I loved the pre Early Access game, then hated it upon first launch.
A year later a lot has changed and a lot hasn't.
It's clearly evident to see the progress made in all areas of the game but most of the same issues I had at E.A. launch still remain

Game speed: My god, this game is slow. Running feels like you're wading through deep water, it's so frustratingly slow. Fire rate still feels slow, I guess it might speed up as you level up but I've still never had a game that  went more than 10 minutes before a team surrender. There is still a need to click a button when you get into a game, why? and there is still a player draught that just makes getting into a game really slow. Why is a draught even needed in quick play/unranked?

Game balance.. urgh. Still this is a huge problem. If you can keep pace score for score with the other team it's fine, but the instant you start to lose you may as well surrender as there is no way to recover from a losing game and one team begins to hugely dominate very quickly.

UI and shop. Still awful, the shop especially is still awfully presented and confusing. Map is still the same as E.A. launch (i.e. not very interesting or fun). Plenty of important game stuff just isn't explained or easy to understand from a new player perspective.

I have never had a game go to the end, it always results in an early surrender by one team and this feels really frustrating whichever side you're on.

Still no battle pass like system, very few original skins and just not a huge amount of incentive yet to keep players playing (and bring in revenue)

On the plus side, lots of new heroes, updated main menu, better team coordination options, controller support, AI battles for training. Graphics still look great and gameplay is mostly really smooth and well animated.

It's a year into early access and still feels very far away from being a completed game. I really hope it can survive that long as there will be a really good game in there eventually. I really want it to succeed.

Paragon: The Overprime has announced they will be sun-setting their take on Paragon in April of 2024. Unfortunately I predict this game will follow suit by the end of the year. Smite 2 (or Smite 1) is not the 3rd person MOBA most players that played Paragon want, so to see this will open old wounds yet again. Everyone cursed Epic's name when they shutdown the original Paragon (myself included). Perhaps they simply had enough foresight to see the writing on the wall for this type of game far in advance. Now the wait to see if my prediction comes true is on, but I would much rather be proven wrong in this case.

December 2023 Review Update
TLDR: It wouldnt be worth it at the price of free. Took a good month+ long break. They had a few sales and released on PS5, so player numbers are up a bit. I expect them to drop quickly. Most if not all the issues previously stated are still issues. It was not worth the re-download and I will likely not return to this game. At this point, I believe something has to be fundamentally wrong with either the dev team or the core concept in general. As the Paragon remake I had the highest hopes for, it really pains me that the ball has been dropped time and time again. I wish the remaining players luck!

October 2023 Review Update
Still some weird lag/latency problems that are a big issue in a game where every second counts in a fight. The fact there is still no reason to sink hours in the game is pitiful. Considering their design philosophy was to get the core gameplay sorted before worrying about other aspects, it doesn't seem like they can get balance or game feel correct either. The hope for this game has been dying, but at this point it is all but lost. As stated before, best of luck, this dev team needs something to keep this game from following in its father's footsteps.
 
September 2023 Review Update (190 Hours Game Time)
Thought I would re-install to check out the new champ and UI changes. The new UI looks ripped from Overprime (the other Paragon clone). Clean but not very inspired but any means. The game feels worse to play, not sure if its a server issue or what but I had 20 ping and 144 fps in most situations and the moment to moment action felt worse than the last stress test. The balance has been leaning toward early deathball style strategy for a while, and this patch fully capitulates. Good luck trying to have a solo lane phase. Also for any newer players hopping in, the recommended builds are still broken. It will typically only show 1 build for any role selected, where it used to be tailored to that roles playstyle (think Jungle Riktor vs Support Riktor). Could be a bug, but it has been so consistent it feels like they stopped bothering with the system. This game is quickly dropping off my radar. I have lost a lot of love for both the game and the dev team over the last 4 months. Best of luck to the team and community, but I can't help the feeling that this game is already on the path to sunsetting. I would be impressed if it makes it further than early next year.

August 2023 Review Update (178 Hours Game Time) - Game Un-installed
For a team of devs that is supposedly made up of a lot of experienced Paragon players, they do not understand the balance and mechanics that left the game unable to progress in the MOBA scene. After the latest patch, Deathballing has gotten considerably stronger and more present in game. To top it off, we are in a high damage meta and it is taking its toll on both the pacing and enjoyment of the game. Had I wanted a more arena style of gameplay, I would re-install Overprime. Each time I start the game up, there is more frustration than fun. If you enjoyed early-mid Paragon where you had a lane phase, got to feel out your enemies and strategize, I would not recommend this game. If you enjoyed the dying throws of Paragon, maybe this game is for you still. Perhaps it is a sign this game will also have the same fate after all.

July 2023 Review Update
I took a month off Predecessor, played some Diablo 4, had a blast. Came back to the game after reading the promising 0.8.2 patch. this game seems like a waste of time at this point. Just gonna give it 6 months to maybe sort itself out but as of now I have officially lost all interest in this poor gaming experience.

June 2023 Review Update
Omeda seems to struggle with overall hero balance and itemization even with the small pool of both. The QOL updates are non-existent, and QOL is sorely needed at this point. 3-5 Minute queues are tough to swallow when most games end in surrender or snowballs. Right now the game still finding its footing and I really do hope it does so soon. It feels like a product with high potential to either stagnate and die or glow up and thrive. Really depends on how much the devs listen to the community.

May 2023 Review Update
Omeda continues to struggle with overall hero balance and itemization. This on top with very slow QOL updates are very much choking this games enjoyment and player retention. Right now the game is at about a 40% enjoyable to 60% Frustration ratio. 

February 2023 Review Update
The balance has improved (barring Countess still being a significant issue), the shinbi character was well done and in line with her characterization, and the matchmaking seems better overall, albeit with slightly longer queue times. There is a bug with matchmaking, but it can be usually solved by a quick game restart. Getting new heroes and working on balance is great, but to retain and/or grow the playerbase we need some movement on player progression rewards and QOL updates. 

January 2023 Review Update
Went from Thumbs up to down. Clearly still in EA, but not a lot of QoL, UI, or Content additions. Balance feels rough to say the least.  Countess is just as fun as she was in OG Paragon, but came with a lot of balance/bug issues. Just not having as good a time as I did a few months back. I wouldnt recommend to the average Non-Paragon person, as it wouldnt be a fun introduction to the game in its current state.

Original Review:
I am absolutely enjoying my time with the game. The combat feels fluid and impactful, the graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay is fun and varied. I can not wait to see what is in this games future, and I do hope the game has a long and successful one at that. I definitely recommend Predecessor in its current state and believe it will be a great investment in the long run.

This being said, game needs a lot of balancing. Carries like Drongo and Murdock start with strong autos that get stronger way too fast. It feels impossible to get back into matches so most end in Surrenders. I get that its in EA, but the gameplay is right where it needs to be and the other features will come with time. My Friends and I really want this game to come out on top but if OP comes out F2P and more FUN (not necessarily more polished/better performing) then that will be the game to play with friends. Please Predecessor, you're my only hope.",1670478124,1708641243,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

1) There are Duo lanes like LoL, unlike the asymmetrical set-up of old Paragon. (This is a major one for me)

2) Everyone has a built in Blink, which I find to be very weird and goes against item building.

3) The item system, while they are taking it into a better direction, needs some more explaining and intuitive functioning.

This is not a critic of the games state, more so just a heads up of some design choices that are NOT Paragon for potential players considering to purchase. As I have read many of the reviews praising Predecessor for being just like Paragon while not stating these differences.

First of all, I am a Paragon veteran, but came to it in a strange way.  When I saw the trailer for this, I knew it was for me, but I can't say exactly why.  Before Paragon, I barely even knew what a Moba was, and even when I started playing it, didn't know that's what I was playing.  It took a few matches of really liking the 'feel' of the game but not really knowing what I was doing, for me to start researching.  This was the game that got me not only INTO a new genre, but to LEARN a new genre.

But man, was that a steep learning curve.  I can understand why people get so turned off to such an unforgiving type of game.  But the highs kept me returning, and the lows sometimes had me staying away for a couple of days.  But I kept coming back, for reasons that I couldn't fully explain.  I put about $300 into Paragon just on cosmetics, and it was worth every cent to me.

So when it got cancelled, I was heartbroken, but made a clean break and went back to Destiny 2 and played some other games.  But nothing felt like Paragon.

I had my doubts when some small studios took up the assets released by Epic, and just gradually tried to make my peace with the fact that I had lost that experience and would never recapture it again.  Still, when Fault was released, I dropped a few bucks on it.  It was ok, but nowhere near the Paragon experience.  When it failed, I decided to give Predecessor a go - and I have no regrets.

The beginning was hard, no doubt.  The game was barely there, only a shadow of Paragon, a pale imitation.  And in the early months, I only dabbled.  I can cope with losing matches, but feeling useless and not knowing what to do, that's what turned me off.  In Paragon, I knew the rhythm of each game, the cadence of activity - I always had a sense of what I should be doing and when.  That took time in Predecessor, but I now feel the game is in that state where that Flow can start to happen, and my playtime in the last few months has ramped up significantly.  It feels more like Paragon than ever before, but still with little stamps of its own personality.  There are Omeda-developed heroes that are new to the game, the old heroes have largely received some reworking and the map mechanics have been tuned to feel familiar but different.

As with all Mobas, the community is the best and worst part of it.  For myself, I can say that the vast majority of my games have been positive, whether winning or losing.  I'd estimate around one game in every ten has had a troll, or someone who disconnects from the game or intentionally throws it.  That feeling when a losing game starts to turn in your favour, that one big play which changes things or even just that gradual realisation that you are catching up, despite the odds - it's quite the sensation, and easily worth the matches where it doesn't go so well.

I'd also be lying if I didn't mention that I have great respect for the Omeda CEO Robbie Singh.  Back in the Paragon days, he was a streamer, just a dude enjoying the game and putting his boundless enthusiasm out there.  His efforts to build a studio and successfully recapture the experience, has to be appreciated.  He still puts out videos now and again, usually around a new hero or big update and his genuine love for the game comes through.  His warmth and enthusiasm is genuine and it makes me root for the success of Predecessor.

If you are curious about the genre, I'd say this is a great starting point, but just know that it will still take time to find your feet.  Choose a role, or hero, and persevere, find what works for you.  Experiment, turn off the chat for a bit and see how you fare.  Be prepared to learn and this game will reward you.

But again I cant stress this enough out of everything I said these long matches will definitely kill the game for me. If there was one thing that needs to be changed about the game its that. If the devs change that about this game it will easily shoot up to the top of being one of my favorite MOBAS. If you like MOBAS you'll like this game. Id recommend if they change how long matches are. If this is the way the game stays then idk Id say wait on it.",1707536234,1707536787,False,1,1,0.455946445465087891,1,True,False,True

With this game, Omeda has yet to figure out even that level of matches, as of right now I get MAYBE 1 decent and potentially winnable game in 15-20 games.  

I understand that the smaller playerbase makes matchmaking more difficult, however I expected something a little more for paid beta access.  It is improving at least the game balance mechanics and such but I will be reinstalling once it hits full release. Until then good luck to those making it work and to Omeda.

Granted, they haven't released all of the characters that were originally on the previous version of the game but they are getting closer with every update. My only complaint is that it take FOREVER to unlock characters in this, to the point of being practically ridiculous. The best way to earn XP to unlock characters is to PVP matches which can last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hours if you get a really even match. You get your XP, rinse and repeat until you get enough XP to unlock someone. a low level unlock can take several hours or days depending on how good or bad the matches are that you get. and the higher level unlocks are literally 5 times as long to unlock. the XP you get towards character unlocks is just too slow to feel like you are making any actual progress. It wouldn't be so bad if you could work towards multiple characters at once, but that isnt an option either. They do let you play with characters that you dont have unlocked (for some reason?) but if you arent working towards unlocking that character it is only earning ""Affinity"" which basically banners, icons, etc. so nothing of real significance. I lovw the game but can't stand the character unlocking system. (Especially coming from the previous version of this game where that wasnt even a system in place.)

1) Absolutely terrible match making.   Match making at a minimum should be matching people of similar play times and win/loss ratio's and if there is a two three playing together, don't match them against 5 randoms!  Even better, ranked play like Paragon's match making...... You cannot enter ranked until you are a certain level.  MMR gets reset each season.

I'm reviewing this from the perspective of a decently skilled player with 1k+ hours of experience between this and Paragon (Predecessor is a remake of Paragon by a different studio), thousands across early access games and much more from other games over the last 15+ years. I'm focusing on points that affect the majority of consumers, not just experienced MOBA players. I have updated this review a few times now and in doing so have managed to hit the character limit, so to cover as much as I can be bothered to I have decided to leave out a lot of detail. I was addicted to the game this remake is based on, that's why I have played so much.

When the game goes free to play I may make this positive, but I doubt it, it may be fun to play at times but at no point can I justify giving money to these developers even if I may have done so myself.

[b]I will update this when and where I think is necessary.[/b]

[h1][u]Full Review[/u][/h1]

- Studio Communication
Occasional blogs, 80% fluff, 15% self praise, 5% teasers.
Patch notes, 80% changes/fixes, 20% fluff.
Transparency/clarity, 50% direct, 50% misleading (or flat out lies).
They mainly acknowledge existing issues when the community is raging or it affects monetisation.
50-75% appears on their site which is linked in steam and discord posts, little to nothing is spoken solely in their discord which is usually flooded with questions.

- Studio Respect
Little to none, the very active players feel mostly ignored, content creators and very experienced players which you would expect to impact the game have been seen for many months complaining about the same stuff which is clearly falling on deaf ears. Most feedback responses go 1 of 2 ways, ""Thanks for the feedback"" followed by no changes, or ""Thanks, but we have no plans to change this"", the first is annoying, the second is outright disrespectful from a studio claiming to value our feedback. They have so little respect for us that they have ignored their original statement of not monetising the early access period by charging us for the only little bit of content the game has, this backfired so heavily that they immediately went into damage control and made a part of it free (future edit, there will now be a completely free option in the future, who knows when that will be).

- Bugs
Where to start... Performance bugs have existed since launch in December 2022. New bugs appear over time, few get patched out, we have now had bugged walls and vision for 3+ months. Some characters can clip under the map, get stuck in geometry, completely lock up, be unable to auto attack, or get stuck in an ability. Some items don't work properly, some passives don't work at all, item stats may be incorrectly listed. Crashing is rare for some, frequent for others, a memory leak or 2 exists, possibly more, disconnection issues plague some people. The comm wheel can get stuck, refuse to work, or lock up your movement. Audio doesn't always play when it should, sometimes it's super quiet, other times it's extremely loud. New features (very rare we get them) are almost always bugged in some way.
The store UI was probably the longest functioning thing, yet for some reason they decided to make some subtle change and it has been broken in a few different ways since such as not buying what it shows or double buying...

- Updates
Lacking, things that need changes barely change, things that don't need changes will change, powerful items/characters somehow get buffs whilst weak ones get nerfs, feels like no testing happens, or that they have no idea what they are doing. It took 12 months to get new items, 1 ""new"" boss and 2 tiny lane edits, no new modes outside of the broken AI mode, 12 ""new"" characters (most of their assets already existed years ago) and a very underwhelming ""affinity system"". It feels like we have the same game as launch just with more bugs... Updates use to be 2 weeks apart, small to medium patch followed by a ""major update"", now they are 3 weeks apart despite earlier claims that they would speed up development...

- Gameplay
Is fun at times, but... The matchmaking will put you with or against the lowest and highest ranked players. People that feed 5+ games a day for 30 days straight seemingly don't get banned at all. Most characters have crowd control abilities and many of them are insanely strong and unfun to play against, many also have strong lock on abilities that are not just unfun to play against but also give unskilled players a free ""I win"" button when they randomly get lucky and hit a few shots. Movespeed feels like it has no penalty, people can stick to you like glue without building to do so. Towers do not do enough damage fast enough leading to people diving towers without caring at all even in the first 5 mins of a game, minions also suffer a similar issue where people will fight in waves because they are so weak.

- AI Chat Moderator
Tons of false positives, Omeda claims otherwise, says we deserve it. They put out a blog post saying we will be able to ""swear like sailors"", but the AI will ban you for swearing a little bit, again, Omeda claims otherwise. They claim it understands context, it very clearly doesn't.
This seems to be resolved some point in the last few months of 2023, but who really knows for sure...

- Monetisation
Disgustingly greedy, recolors of skins cost 3x what would be considered expensive. There doesn't seem to be any consistency with skin prices. The ""affinity"" system is a cheap attempt to milk people of their cash, mostly because they are withholding the free version of the system for an indefinite amount of time, originally it was going to be 6+ months but the community outrage and resulting damage control seems to have expedited this a bit, and as previously mentioned they have also ended up making a part of said system free (future edit, it's still approaching 6+ months so clearly their claims of getting it sorted were just to calm the community outrage, skin prices may end up being cheaper though so I guess that's good).

- Early Access
We are now over a year of early access, and as mentioned earlier, barely anything has changed outside of 12 new characters... This was the period to test things, yet they refused to test stuff, so much that they trolled the community by saying they could test things like no lock on abilities, but then made excuses such as ""that basically wouldn't change anything therefore its not worth it"" in order to not have to test stuff... The new menu UI has removed more functionality than it has added, more noticeable bugs exist now than at launch, performance hasn't improved at all, the quality of matches has only gotten worse. I fail to understand why this launched into early access if it wasn't to just make money, yet they said that wasn't the purpose of early access??? There are very simple things they could do, yet they don't do them, plenty of things they outright refuse to talk about. It's tiring keeping up with this game when they only thing keeping us engaged is the hope that it is eventually good.

[h1][u]Final thoughts[/u][/h1]
You can't have a competitive game that relies on communication if you are rushing people into matches as fast as possible regardless of balance, stopping them from communicating because it might hurt someones feelings and having completely stupid bugs that may benefit 1 side more than another. There are no significant positives to mention, more and more issues could be listed but the character limit is rapidly approaching... I would love to say this game is worth something, but I'm honestly more excited for Smite 2 despite not even liking smite...

The community is toxic and very unforgiving to newer players.

The affinity system is to be honest absolute garbage, and wants you to spend money to unlock skins at a faster rate but honestly serves no purpose.

There is no ranking system so if your an avid moba player your going to be matched with players that dive tower death after death until the enemy team or your team is so fed that the game isn't even a challenge or fun anymore.

The combat swings from slow and methodical to fast paced and execution heavy. There is a high skill ceiling in this game with enough quiet moments to focus on improving your over all strategy and dueling ability over time. I'd say that it get's just on the edge of too fast paced and execution heavy for a moba, but it doesn't cross the line to being too much for most fans of the genre who also like action combat. The item system has many strengths compared to most mobas. That being said the dominance of certain characters of others along with their still in development match making system makes matches feel a little samey at times. 

There is toxicity in every moba and I feel like it's slightly above average than other moba's in that regard. This could be due to the smaller player base size, but over all I think that unlike some mobas people at least generally agree on when a player is being toxic or not in the more vocal cases.

Finally regarding their monetization plan, I feel like they currently under monetize in many areas and over monetize in a few areas. The game is lacking cosmetic based battlepasses that function as an optional subscription. Outfits and character passes feel over priced as well, but it's easy to see why given their over all limited selection. They need to fund development somehow. I hope they fix this as I feel it will negatively impact the game if not properly dealt with.

Overall I'd say it's a solid 7.5 for me (with 5 being average). There is a lot of good things going on here with massive room for improvement.

There is no ranked matchmaking, graphics feel worse than before, performance optimization seem **** and i m fine with all of that. What makes me boil over is the fact that the game crashes on occasions, you try to open the game and rejoin the match -> network error, every single time. You got the options to send the crash report to Omeda. Well after like 10 to 15 minutes the game un****s itself and you can start it again.

I like that they have added new characters as well as added the favorites from Paragon. The item system is good enough to find a few different ways to build most hero's from what i've seen, the most recent items added were all interesting.  Not to mention its still still early access. They addressed adding ranked and a free currency to replace the contracts they have ATM and fill the problem of not really having anything to grind for.

But, I will say the matchmaking as of now is at best slow to move up, never the less that will just leave you in lobbies full of easy prey.  So that just leaves the leaver problem/ not taking the role you are given. I think that problem could be fixed if there were more players, then they could give out more bans and have people pick their roles before queing.

fix the matchmaking please.

This game is incredibly fun.... when you get paired with competent teammates who don't feed until the other team is 5 lvls ahead and then rage quit. That almost never happens though unless you're queuing up with a full team. Which is what I assume all the teams I've played against are doing because every game it never fails that our team is eating glue in the corner while the other team is coordinating the impossible mission from Top Gun Maverick flawlessly. I mean seriously what the hell is this matchmaking? I've seen 5 competent players on my team in the almost 200 hours I've played. Meanwhile almost everyone on the opposing team is always paying attention and extremely coordinated with the rest of their team. This is not to say I'm the best player but if you're a lvl 8 sparrow and you jump into a 1v4 against the other team who is lvl 13 at this point, what the hell am I supposed to do when you rage and say it's my fault for not helping and then rage quit leaving us with a 100% loss chance.",1677043946,1705382138,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you are like me and couldn't understand why Epic would take Paragon off the market when it was such a good game, you're in luck. This game is looking to be an extremely faithful remake of what we lost six years ago. Sure, things may be a little buggy every now and then, we may not have all the characters of Paragon, and the balance will need tweaked when we do get all characters, but that's why the game is early access. Even for early access, you can tell that this team has such a passion for not only this game, but the community surrounding it. Coming from a long-time Nintendo fan: please do not discount how important that is to a game's development and success.



Now onto a bit of apparent controversy. Despite what people seem to believe about the DLC choice of opting in, I believe it's an idea that is not only thoughtful to the community, but benefits the players and studio longterm. Players get to choose how much they'd like to support the studio and get reward tiers for their commitment. It seems a lot of people dislike this choice because it complicates refunding the game, but why would you need to buy an early access DLC to figure out if the game is for you when there is already so much content out about the game? If what you see on YouTube isn't to your liking, remember that the game is in early access and wait for the finish product.



What's most important in buying a game is your enjoyment, so before buying Predecessor's DLC early access, please consider the preceding and following.

[b]If you played and enjoyed Paragon[/b]: I believe this will be a godsend product for you. The pacing is the same, the item shop is fairly expansive yet simple, and we have new characters to look forward to, some familiar and some fresh.

[b]If you never played Paragon, or aren't sure if I've convinced you[/b]: Please take some time on Youtube, Twitch, or another media sharing site to take a look at the game before committing to anything. If you don't think you'll like it, don't buy it.



Hopefully you've found this helpful in your decision on Predecessor. I fully support this game and it's creators, but I understand that other people are looking for another game. Best of luck to you all! GLHF",1672166046,1704790543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Immediately you might be a little perturbed by the fact that a MOBA - a genre notorious for welcoming F2Ps - costs money to even install. I understand.
You might be put off by how there's little to no cosmetics for many characters outside of essentially just recolors and reskins. I understand.
You might dislike the UI being a little jank or too big or not showing enough information or not being configurable, etc. I understand.
You probably won't enjoy the smaller regular playerbase, due to it having a base price and it being early access.

BUT-

The gameplay genuinely feels good. It feels FUN to play this game when you are actually in one. It feels smooth, most abilities and attacks feel impactful enough for that little serotonin hit(the sound design helps this quite a bit for most characters), and most of the game legitimately feels balanced. At no point during all of my time playing so far did I ask ""How is that allowed?"" when getting killed by someone. Every time I immediately understood I'd positioned myself incorrectly, or that I'd missed some crucial ability, etc.

Not only that, but the dev team for this game is pretty good at feedback. Heading over to their website/subreddit, you can actually see they posted a quick teaser for what they plan for early-2024, and it already is quite a bit. Pretty much every single concern the active playerbase has given them they word-for-word repeated and said ""We'll get right on it.""

Because of these reasons, if you are interested, please do give it a shot. Purchase the game, pick a character you want to try, curbstomp some bots in the AI gamemode for 2 or 3 matches and feel for yourself if you want to play this. Then, if you feel you don't wanna, ask for a refund. 

But I know I personally don't want to refund this game, because the effort the devs have put in thus far FEELS like they deserve the money I gave them for it.

As a die-hard fan of the original Paragon, stumbling upon ""Predecessor"" on Steam was like discovering a long-lost treasure. This game is, without a doubt, the best remake of Paragon to date, capturing the essence and magic of the original in a near-perfect manner.

The first thing that struck me was the unmistakable feeling of familiarity - playing Predecessor brought back the same exhilarating emotions I experienced in the original Paragon. The attention to detail in replicating the heroes, the map, and even the smallest gameplay nuances is truly commendable. It's a testament to the developers' commitment to preserving the essence of what made Paragon such a beloved game.

One aspect that sets Predecessor head and shoulders above its competitors, particularly Overprime, is its commitment to the MOBA genre. While Overprime tends to lean more towards a brawler experience, Predecessor stays true to the classic MOBA formula that made Paragon a standout title. The strategic depth, team coordination, and the delicate balance between offense and defense are all present in Predecessor, delivering an authentic MOBA experience that Paragon fans have been yearning for.

The graphics and design of Predecessor are stunning, with modern visuals that enhance the immersive feel of the game. The heroes are meticulously crafted, and the map design is a nostalgic trip down memory lane, beautifully reimagined for a new era of gaming.

In conclusion, Predecessor isn't just a game; it's a love letter to the Paragon community. If you've been searching for a true successor that captures the spirit of the original Paragon, look no further. Predecessor stands as a testament to the dedication of its developers and is, in my opinion, the best remake to date. If you're a MOBA enthusiast or a Paragon fan, this is an absolute must-play.

I also like the fact that they aren't focusing on new skins and such, but leave this for later stages of the game... they are really focusing on making the game better and balanced out -- and they said that if everything works out good enough - that they will then start focusing on releasing awesome skins and such -- this is how it should be! Compared to Overprime, they got really awesome UI and Skins for each character... but this should not be the focus of a game in it's early stages --- the gameplay should be the most important aspect, and that is where Predecessor is shining at the moment.

BUT.... 
People are horribly useless. and i don't even mean that they just ""not so good and lose fights""

Dekker Support main here 

85% of matches with randoms are lost because cant carry as a support. i lost all matches the whole 28 hours except  all the ones played with my mates. I 90% play support cause i love it but i have no chance to carry anything if i save my carry 3 times in a row and he still runs into the enemy with 40 HP

People chose character with no idea what they are for.
People go on the wrong lanes constantly, 
or maybe not going on their lanes at all. 
and if finally people are on their lanes we lose a tower at 5 mins and have 17 deaths in 10 mins feeding the enemy  like hell. 

DO NOT PLAY SOLO.  most people have zero clue what to do. 

TLDR: Nice game but definitely get some friends and better yet get 4 friends because this is a highly teamwork oriented game and if even one fks up it can snowball really quick. 85% of Randoms only get you an aneurysm.

EDIT.: 

Changing my review to negative cause the community is awful. no one knows how to play this game. the matchmaking is horrendous. when you queue SOLO u only get matched wight the most retarded people on the planet. i grinding my ass of to rise MMR but solo it is impossible. tell me what you want. i am definitely no grand master for sure but i know how and when to do what. and my team is constantly throwing. Feeding the living shit out in the first 10 mins and then surrendering. and even worse these damn devs cant even balance their matchmaking. i lose 6 matches the whole day in a row and this fucking game cant give me one good team who at LEAST knows how to NOT DIE 15 times, so im not losing all my MMR with idiots. DO NOT PLAY SOLO if you know how to play a moba.  this game is punishing you to try your best and puts you only with morons. and the best of it. instead of fixing the match making the devs implemented a butt hurt BOT to mute you when you are slightly harsh because the lil babys cant handle some critique. only play with friends. the randoms are so brain dead that they cant be from this world. totally not worth your time if you wanna have fun. play LOL there they ban trash like this lol

EDIT2:

I want it to be the best game it can be, and I'm sure all other flaws will be wrinkled out in time, but for the time being, with the matchmaking the way it is, I cannot recommend the game. I say this to interested players because if you join now you will hate the game and likely never return. If you return later, after what I'm about to detail is (hopefully) fixed, you'll have a much better time and stick around for longer, benefiting the game in the long run.

The issue comes down to one of two things. You're either a new player learning the game and being put against master proficiency players and getting absolutely stomped, or you're a master proficiency player being put on the team of people who don't even know what a ward is, much less how to place one. The experience isn't just insufferable for new players, it's insufferable for experienced players as well. 

I'm not having a go at new players, it's not their fault, how else are you supposed to learn? The fault is on the matchmaking, in what world do you pair players with hundreds of hours against or on the side of people with less than 5 hours of playtime? The game doesn't have a mammoth player count, I get that, but it's also not a dead game. Your game will survive a lot longer if you make queue times a bit longer in order to make the actual process of playing games more enjoyable for everyone. Tight matches are fine, it isn't losing that's frustrating, it's winning your lane and seeing everyone else on your team is going 0/10/0 within 20 minutes with zero wards placed.

I'm not a game dev, I don't know if this is feasible or even logical, but as a player I would happily wait longer for balanced matches. I'm sure the tutorial could be better, but the tutorial doesn't matter as much as experience and you aren't just going to magically be able to perform against experienced players because of a well made tutorial, it takes time and your own experience within the game to grow and learn, understanding when to rotate, where to place wards, etc.

I think this issue has become more obvious in the last few weeks because the game was recently given away for free on Epic and also the recent PlayStation closed beta which has mandatory cross play, but again, the issue isn't the players or the device they use to play, it's the new player onboarding and the matchmaking. I'll change my review if they fix this because it's the only issue I have with the game. Fingers crossed!",1704383253,1704384185,False,88,7,0.686164200305938721,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately, this positive experience is somewhat overshadowed by a handful of disruptive players in the community, a somewhat anticipated but nonetheless disheartening aspect.

The fights flow seamlessly, with a high time-to-kill and the skills although user-friendly prove challenging to cast when at a height disadvantage due to obscured indicators. Predecessor heroes manage to mix and match abilities from other MOBA's champions creatively, resulting in a refreshing take that feels surprisingly satisfying.

While the off-game menu side of things appears to be a work in progress, the core gameplay is a solid 10/10 in my books. It's evident that the game is still in development, but the potential for greatness is there.

The game is visually stunning, the mechanics are like no other MOBA out there. The best comparison would be Smite, however, there's a lot more skill involved here as you're required to look up and down as well when aiming attacks. The game plays like Paragon almost exactly.

Where I struggle to recommend the game though, is where I don't see anything new aside from what Paragon has laid out. The item system didn't excite me at all and there's no motivation behind learning it either as it defaults to auto-buy items. For new players, especially players new to MOBA style games, I see this as a plus, however.

The fact that team chat is off by default is another red flag to me. As, other than teammates angrily pinging things, I didn't really understand what they were trying to tell me. Similar to visiting a foreign country and trying to get directions somewhere.

Along with this, there's absolutely no teamwork unless you're playing with a friend or friends. So, once the first line of towers are destroyed, it's pretty much all down to whichever team has a more skilled ADC as they absolutely wreck the damage game. (As they should)

There's just not much new player help here with the tutorial, or any guide on how to understand a MOBA style game. As someone who is very familiar with MOBA style games, I even struggled to understand how the map worked, how wards worked, buffs, etc.

To wrap up, I see this game as the better of the two, as the other is more of a killfest, this is more MOBA based, but still needs work and overall communication in a multiplayer team-based game really needs to be stepped up. Further, something I really see Smite bettering this with, is the ping system. It really makes you notice the map when a player pings something along with an alarming noise notifying you that a player has pinged a location. Here, if you're not really keeping the map in your vision, it's easy to miss a ping. Again, the team chat thing really needs to be addressed as I hadn't been able to talk to anyone outside of quick chat commands. Maybe the reason behind this is to avoid toxic behavior? I don't see that being a good reason, as no matter where you go, what you play, co-op only games, hell, even single player games depending on the person, you're going to get toxicity.

Game is good, has the potential to recreate the joys I had in Paragon, but lacks communication and core concepts of a team-based competitive MOBA.",1704292631,1704292631,False,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

2. Abilities, Once again feels fluid and responsive.
3. All the heros kits are decent some alot better than others not to say there horrible some just need some extra love.
4. Most OG Paragon hero's are in the game now just missing a total of 7 i believe? then after that I't will be all Omeda original Hero's from there on out!
5. 2024 is ""LOOKING"" to be the best year to date  for Predecessor as far as updates go from actual Ranked mode(will be a preseason solo/duo queue to start to get feedback before they release Ranked mode in full.

6. Also Omeda will be implementing there own Matchmaking system because the Devs have said countless times on streams and in discord that they don't like there current matchmaking system they have in place also I'l touch on this a bit more in cons, Q1 next year (if you're reading this and its not at the time when i posted my review its most likely 2024 already so happy new year) the devs have stated that the game will be going into open beta for both PC and Playstation.
 
7. This Was also another hot topic in the community Skin prices will be reduced after they received countless forum threads complaining about the predatory pricing so we'll see how that goes when they reduce the prices also do take note if you have the game and have bought the skins already and have not been following whats been going on Once again this is from what the devs have said, ""As part of this, we will also ensure that any previously available skins, should they receive a change in their base price, will refund any platinum to players that already spent money on these skins"".

8. They Will be introducing a ""Soft Currency"" What that is, is basically a F2P Currency and with that you can purchase Heros and hero Affinities.

I never tried the original Paragon before but I've read and watched some things about it.

By far as a MOBA in my opinion it's the best one out there right now. The game contains a roster of 32 heroes and for that reason the game is already well balanced, good thing is that they don't only add the previous existing Paragon heroes but also adding their Original Heroes like Kira and Zarus and in next 2 bigger patches we receive another one which I'm excited for. 
The Time to kill is imo how it should be, it takes longer to get a kill how a moba should be, and by later in the game the Carrys (ADCs) deal a lot of damage how a MOBA should be doing as well. Average match length currently is about 30-40 minutes, depending on the cooperation of your team. Teamwork is a MUST otherwise you won't succeed. Based on the lower playerbase rn it can be quite hard to get decent players sometimes too, now that a lot of players join on a Playstation closed beta test. Don't get frustrated because in the end it's just a game and you lose nothing but your mentality if you unleash anger.

Map design wise I like it a lot. Currently only one map is available for a 5v5 match, but it's already been teased about a 3v3 map coming next year. Game works a lot like League, for example in the jungle you got a Fangtooth and Fangtooth Prime which is an equivalent to the Dragon and Elder Drake and the Mini Orb or Orb Prime are equivalents to Herald and Baron. These bigger buffs are really important because of giving huge amps to your damage and can turn a game from loss to win easily. Visibly by its color Red and Blue buffs which do quite the similar thing and there is some smaller buffs in the middle which is better than nothing it gives you a boost either shield, movement speed or attack speed and such while for example in League the Scuttle only gives you gold and vision. Jungle just like in League is the brain of the game it can really change the whole match around so I don't recommend it to new players really. In the end MOBAs are more like an improved Chess game where you have to think and act quick. When you are new it can be confusing which lane you are going based on which side you start on but you will get used to it quick, also for the new players it shows you where you have to go though (with icons and a path).

The bundles other than the no bundle version offer you more heroes so you can spend less time grinding otherwise the rest is cosmetics and if you wish to support the Devs which are working on this hard (since 2017 i believe). They listen to our feedbacks and do everything in their power for which I like them.

One thing about the game view is that it's just like Smite, it's 3D Third Person so your view can be limited and you have to watch out for ganks and such, visions exist in the game too so you gotta place your wards. As a league player it can be harder for you to get the hang of it but believe it or not you can learn it pretty quick.

Items are decently explained, just read about them, just know it's like in other mobas you can have a passive and active effect of that item. Other than that make sure to change your hotkeys to how it suits you better.

Itemization is poor at best, heroes imbalanced, matchmaking easily the worst I've ever seen in a MOBA. I play this game vs bots exclusively at this point. You still earn rewards and if at about the same rate as public games. The games aren't ever challenging but when you need a mind numbing hold left click and watch stuff fall over it works alright for that purpose.

Revision after playing additional 40hr: Game has a ton of potential but the dev's don't really seem to know what to do with it. The number of critical bugs left untouched (and the new ones the patches bring to the table) combined with a lot of their stance on critical issues regarding any game let alone in this genre make me pretty wary of dumping more time into this title. Also because of all the time the devs admittedly spent on the core loop (leaving none for the supporting systems) the devs released a online game with no way to report players on launch and their quick fix solution is mostly just disabling chat by default. I love the attention the devs spent on the core loop, it shows and is fun to play for the most part. It's just so sad they didn't spend any time on the systems needed to support that loop in any way before the public release (even if on Early Access). I may try the game again in a year or so if they still around.

Original Review:
I enjoyed my time with Predecessor quite a bit, but it has a lot of pretty glaring issues and at this time I'm not sure I'd recommend picking it up unless you're well aware of what you're getting into with an Early Access title like this. There are several issues with UI scaling and rendering on any aspect ratio other than 16:9. Mouse buttons often don't register, and using Window mode doesn't correctly clamp the mouse cursor meaning you WILL grab the side of the window and resize it mid game several times. This won't be an issue if you have a 16:9 monitor and run full screen, if you're running any other setup though you will have to make sacrifices to play the game. Either bad UI scaling and FOV (you can alter INI files to help with this) OR a mouse that WILL cause your window to resize and move all over the screen in the middle of most team fights.

Predecessor also has none of the in-game social tools that are desperately needed in a MOBA, as well as no new player experience. If you're not VERY familiar with the MOBA genre before getting this game you're going to get dumped into a game with no explanation what so ever to how the game works, which WILL cause players to become toxic with you very quickly.

Grab it if you played and enjoyed Paragon and need a fix, avoid it for now otherwise.",1670296825,1703305392,False,1,0,0.5,1,True,False,True

While playing the game in locked window mode, my cursor still phantom moves to my 2nd monitor and will start clicking random buttons and tab me out of the gameplay repeatedly.

Add a mute option and use a report system based on game play if someone is consistently causing bad plays send them into a punishment of training modes on there reported bad plays, if 10 people a row report a jungle for not rotating effectively then he probably shouldn't be in the games playing jungle, allow mute options for trash talk or talk in general so the people that cant handle it can just mute or stop playing the game.

That's the main issue, also it feels extremely slow, it, it may be the animations as well but damage and snowball seems pretty lacking more on camps and waves than actual players but i feel the game play could be quite a bit more engaging with a quicker grind for levels and gold. Perhaps more camps to control if you are winning your lane. larger reward opportunities post kill. 

But as of right now, some games you just have to just leave. If you play for enjoyment and you got unfortunate luck with a team and you cant comm with them to give more detail on what they are messing up on or what you need help with your best bet is to just leave the game and face the ban. Unless you want to sit in a fairly long game 30-40 minutes that's heavily team work based and a bad team but that's not my idea of a video game for fun.

People will try to harass you or other things, for daring to critizise an early access game, which i did many times of VERY calmly and easily in the discord and other platforms, yet there are just the people that sort of accept it and the other that will do the formerly mentioned thing.

Guess what other game got critiqued in early acess and got game of the year, not saying this game has that sort of material even if they listened (not me spiting the game, i would just be honestly surprised if a moba got that title) but so far, no balance in the world is gonna make this game fun if you sit in the lobbby for sometimes 15+ minutes, only to get matches in a team of randoms against people on comms that you can find on their discord sweating their cracks out, when all you want to do is enjoy at least a single decent round in this game. 

This wont happen tho, unless you are an INCREDIBLY skilled player that plays against vastly mismatched enemies and your team being half way there mentally, which then you will have to sit through a 30 minute+ long game, where the enemy is ahead by about at least 10 kills at the tenth minute.

I make this review after a long hiatus, to speak with a clear mind and fair assessements and all i can say is that they are greedy really, they bothered more introducing a cash shop instead of fixing the matchmaking, which shows they value the monetary gain more than the longevity of it, with its playerbase almost consistently dwindeling each day and seemingly not recovering mostly and at best getting stallouts. 

Paragon is a cursed franchise at this point, doomed to fail due to poor management and cash being the first concern rather than making the game fun. This is VERY painful, considering that this game is otherwise the probably most competent Paragon clone, seeing how the revisions of old characters are genuinly better than what epic games, a multi million company could not achieve. Sadly most of the time, these OH's and AH's can only carry one so long until seeing themselves found at the impass, noticing that a god pvp balance can not mean anything if 99% of your games are steamroles, be it in or against your favour.

TLDR: Good Character design and balance, horrible game design in terms of balancing teams and horrendous management, valuing cash shop over retaining and gaining player numbers to improve influx of reviews and assisstance to improve the core of the game.",1702689062,1702689062,False,3,0,0.515030086040496826,0,True,False,True

BUT until the window resolution is improve for wide screen monitors I just can't. The Fullscreen, Windowed Fullscreen, and Windowed; Settings are complete Garbage. I have a  3840x1080 Samsung wide screen monitor. When i select fullscreen it'll stretch the display in order to fullscreen. Leaving you with not seeing ur character full body display and thin the view. Window Fullscreen as well. Both of those in my experience are useless. All that is left is ""Windowed"" for me Right... Well would have been fine if they didn't forget to add the most basic resolution to every game ever. Which is 1920 x 1080; My educated guess, they figured that fullscreen, and windowed fullscreen would cover that scale leaving 1920x1080 out. I've used 1680x1050; must say worst experience yet again. If i'd spam buttons sometime the mouse leave the game window. Having widescreen it'll be a few second to drag my mouse just to play again, don't get me started with window 11 taskbar just to mistakenly open a software or something. Truly frustrating. Final and last straw; When I go into window settings and force window display to 1920x1080. Again go into the game settings. Changed it to fullscreen and windowed fullscreen... and I shit you not that it ignored window display scale and used the entire screen once again still stretched.

So if you get a game without trolls or people just straight up bad from lack of ""experience"". The game will actually be fun and competitive. If you ever played a game where you can tell everyone is on edge based from play style and when everyone actually team fights. It's the most fun I've ever had from these type of games in a long time. The matches becomes much more thrilling and exciting because even if your carrying and winning team fights. The game could tip into the other team advantage very quickly. My other experience from some of the matches is i noticed that some players could have easily split push, but once the round start having it first few team fight. More than likely the rest of the game will continue to be team fighting. What i'm trying to say is that some of the players; Would much rather team fight, than attempt ending the game.

In overall it feels like the successor to what was Paragon without that horrible card system in the end of it's life. I can't remember what the old Paragon felt like but I do have faint memories playing that vanilla map with my friends and roaming around in that exciting jungle that Paragon had. I was bad back then but decent at best right now. Predecessor doesn't feel like that old Paragon but it feels like Predecessor. Early access game with wonky matchmaking at the moment and decent player pool with the veterans, the frustrated, the game throwers, the sweat lords, the newbies, and those who just want to play the game.


Looks: Well the actual game is good fun and feels and looks nice. Even on turd graphics. I do get few stutters here and there but I mainly blame on my close to 10 years old pc at this point. I can't imagine what it looks like on maxxed out graphics.

Gameplay: Basic 3rd person moba with the objective to destroy enemy teams core. there is also 2 different objectives on the map that you can kill to get some permanent and temporary buffs for your team. 

Matchmaking: right now the matchmaking is a bit of a hit or miss. Meaning it might mix beginners with pro players which makes the matches enjoyable or not that enjoyable but every once in a while you do get mixed up with players with the same skill level as you and then you are in for a good time. EDIT: there isn't Ranked mode in the game yet so everyone from veterans to newcomers are getting mixed up together. This can be a bit frustrating at times when the new players are not aware of the game dynamics just yet. However the developer managed to do some changes to the matchmaking algorithm. Now the matches are a bit more balanced what they used to be in solo queue. 3-4 player premade teams it feels just the same as before meaning it can be either curb stomp for your team or you get curb stomped. 

Sidenote: The game is using a third party algorithm for the matchmaking but it is not working how they want it to work. I read from reddit or Predecessor's official discord channel that they are going to fix it by making their own algorithm for the matchmaking system but we'll have to wait for next year for it to be released. 

Community: Basic moba community I think. I haven't played mobas that much and this game has the most hours that I've sunk in one so far and I've heard that the other mobas are pretty much the same with the toxicity. I do believe the reason is that poor matchmaking algorithm or people are just that mad all the time.. Reddit and official discord are quite active. I usually check out reddit to see if there has been anything new development about the matchmaking or any other stuff. Discords channels get way too many messages so I can't be bothered to follow them. Sidenote: When you first start the game the teamchat is off and you can keep it that way if you just want to enjoy the game since nobody is propably not going to give you any good advice. 

Other info: Console beta test is coming in next month starting 5th of December. Close to 25k people signed up for it. So this will eventually be a good boost for the player base. 

I'll still give this game thumps up since I want this game to succeed. It's still in EARLY ACCESS so it will have it's good and bad things but I hope the good things will keep this game afloat untill the game is fully out. I am a decent player at best but I do enjoy good competetive game here and there. Get this game on SALE with the cheapest bundle(this unlocks you 20 heroes so you don't have to grind them) or wait until it comes out FREE TO PLAY at some point next year.

Most of the items are direct carbon copies of items from other Moba's so there's not even uniqueness when it comes to the items and builds, so if heroes are boring and items are boring why would you even want to play? And that's before you even get into the real gameplay. 

Its bad. There is a few cool things that they tired to do, like side camps, but it just rewards the and accelerates the snowball completely out of control in practice. The visual clarity is awful, there are some ablilites that cause screen shake, which just should not be in a moba, it increases the chances of missing abilities and it makes it harder to pay attention to things you want to look out for, and it could be your teammate that ""cc's"" you.

This one has let me down the most though, not to say its the worst clone its just not the best of the garbage. The game still has no competitive mode to separate the sweats from the casuals. Beyond that the balancing is a nightmare and instead of focusing on fixing clear issues with characters and itemization they instead have just been pushing new characters etc. Unless you have a million hours into league or dota your not going to enjoy this. It's not paragon it's just a shit reskin of it thats being produce liked every other shit storm moba that exists. heroes tend to be either a nightmare to play or just a nightmare to play against. What makes things even more difficult is if youre not playing this game constantly you will get shit on due to lack of info and quality builds. Pred pro and omeda city exist but pred pro barely even works and omeda city lacks substance in way of builds. IE played a game of kira needed to look at a quick build to see what was up pred pro wouldnt even load anything and omedas most relevent build only had 24 total votes on it so no real reference on whether or not its a viable build. I think with the small community and lack of information related to the game and poor character balance the game overall would hugely benefit from a drastic item decrease while improving focus on character balancing to allow for the continued content pushes their doing. Also improved suggested builds since the 2 main build sites at this point are totally useless. another thing would be to atleast improve mmr usage within match making if there is no comp, no need in having people play others 500+ mmr  higher than them in a quickplay setting just to get shit on by bad matchup and skill diff both itll just lead to new and casual players not wanting to play the game at all. I do have hopes that it'll still get better will check in, in another 2 months to see how its doing. bonus points to the ui improvements and addition of mastery skins. minus points for implementation when they had access to paragons original mastery system with multiple tiers of skins and they just threw all that in the trash and are only utilizing 1 of the skins for each character.",1702145773,1702145773,False,1,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,True

I welcome new players and I realize they're needed to keep the game alive and evolving. However, the lack of communcation makes it just stupid in a game like this. There's rarely any teamplays anymore and you can't even help people to get better as they don't see the chat. 

Matchmaking was already an issue before the PS launch and some matches were lost already in the lobby when you get matched against team that has double the MMR. It was still somewhat playable and enjoyable because you could learn from your better and when it was obvious that match was too one-sided, your team would usually forfeit when it's possible after 10min. Now, after the PS launch, I can see it after 2min that our team is going to lose it (e.g. skill difference between jungle & carry) but our team isn't voting anymore. Actually I'm not even sure if PS players can see the vote because usually I'm the only one voting at all - no one is voting against forfeiting either. So there I am stuck in a match that was obviously impossible to win from the beginning and it can take 30-45min to wrap it up. Don't feel like wasting your time and quit the match? Sure, enjoy your 24hr matchmaking ban.

The draw is the third person camera that makes the game far more accessible than top-down MOBAs, putting you in direct control of your character and their abilities like more familiar action games. Though the hero pool is smaller than other games of the genre, there is still a moderate learning curve to cover the items and hero interactions that will give dedicated players something to study and engage with long-term. That said, the auto-buy builds work reasonably well and are kept mostly updated as the items change with patches. Mechanical skill can certainly be rewarded, but positioning, timing, and teamwork over the course of the game is what wins the match.  

The game is entering a paid open-beta stage on Playstation this month, and will be free to play in 2024. The game is cross-play with console, so you can play with your friends on Playstation and on PC. Though some heroes don't work quite as well on controller, there are many that certainly hold up and there are definitely high rated, scary players that main controller. 

All in all, this is an extremely addicting, approachable yet deep MOBA that appeals to all mechanical skill levels. For new players, there are easier heroes that will let you focus on learning the flow of the game, while veterans from similar games can find harder heroes that reward you for your mechanical skill in addition to strategic engagements.

-----Good:
Default sound level is at 80%, it doesn't blast your ears on first time boot-up. Motion blur can be toggled off, fps cap goes up to 240. Settings menu overall is good and very customizable.

Skill level-up keybinds are good, but the ui could be improved. Minion HP turns red when they're able to be killed by an auto-attack.

A pop-up shows above players when they use items. Useful, considering just how much visual noise is in the game sometimes.

-----Bad:
Mouse sensitivity settings are bad. At 1600dpi my cm360 changes by about 5cm between settings. You also can't select the exact sens you want, using the (very sensitive) slider is required. Settings go from 0.01 - 10.0, and I'm playing on 0.08. So the amount going as high as it can is a bit overkill, I think they should slash that in half and allow you to more accurately choose the sens you want to play on.

Item art isn't great. Some ""full build"" items look like they'd fit right in next to low-power ones. Like, ""Here is my bow, it gives me +10% atk speed"" and ""Here is my axe! It gives me 3 different stat increases, and the ability to auto-execute low hp enemies."" So as a new player, learning what does what is going to feel like a chore, and the ""strength"" of your opponents isn't something you can learn from just a 2 second glance at the scoreboard once they come back to lane.

First and foremost, the player base isn't what it was when it launched, and it's not really recovering past the 950 24 hr Peak point. Hopefully with the game going free on Epic next week, that'll solve some of it. Seeing that it's becoming free on EGS is actually what reminded me that I have it and made me get back on it.

EDIT: The player base has a habit of dodging queues once it comes to character select if they don't get the role that they want. Thus is shoves you back into a 10 minute queue where all you can do is stare at the screen. Beware if you don't like queue-ing simulators.

I don't really pay attention to the community aspect of it, so I can't say if the devs seem like they're planning on abandoning it soon. I hope they aren't, I think the game is a lot of fun when matches are actually found. Which leads me to  my next problem.

The Matchmaking system is pretty awful. Because of the low player count, they're just throwing in all different types of players as ""quickly"" as they can to get a game going. This leads to high skill players teaming with low skill players on both teams, sometimes grouping all high skill players against low skill ones. I *hope* this is something that gets worked out as the game gets worked on more, assuming that is something that happens. This is quite irritating as it can take about 20 min to finally get into a game after waiting around in the main menu to match-make, and then dealing with people not selecting Heroes and forcing a re-queue, which can last another stupid amount of time.

I love Predecessor, just like I loved Paragon and Fault. I want a game like this to be successful, as I suck major ass at League and have played Smite for ten years at this point and just want something fresh.

The only reason I'm recommending this game right now is because I feel that with more players for it's low price of entry, this came could revive itself and become something great.",1701464032,1701594028,True,2,0,0.51336902379989624,0,True,False,True

Ignoring the glaring issues centering around performance, balance, and matchmaking pool sizes, Omeda Studios has repeatedly proven themselves unworthy successors to the original Paragon. Their philosophies on player retention and microtransactions are reminiscent of EA and Bungie. If you hid the developer logo and told me that this game was made by a handful of Bungie B-team interns, I would believe you.

I tried my best. I played and played competitively, I've interacted positively with the community, I've provided coaching, esports commentary, resources for players of all calibers. The developers of this game are short-sighted and greedy - which is a shame, because I know some of them personally from the old days and believed them to be better than this.

I can't comfortably recommend any alternatives in the 3D moba genre. The only competitors are Overprime and Kingshunt. Between the two, Kingshunt is the better game, but at the time of writing this the servers are temporarily shuttered. If Fault were still around, I would recommend that. Revenblade may also be worth looking into - though it is still in closed alpha at this time (the core is solid - of that I can attest).",1669916840,1701586764,False,0,0,0.524025380611419678,0,True,False,True

playerbase is small at the moment, with it being in paid early access, but queue times are decent (at least on NA East). NA West suffers from long queue times, some of the worst players, and just in general constant dodges/interntional feeders (which sucks cause thats where im based, so ping is better). being forced to play east servers is fine, although the lag is definitely noticeable.

as for the players themeselves (which is the main thing in any multiplayer), well they are pretty hit or miss. sometimes youll get really good games, othertimes someone will die once and instantly tilt 5 mins in, as if it even matters. ive never seen so many consistent matches where people have mental breakdowns so quick and instantly either throw or afk and start talking shut. there needs to be a tutorial that explains you can be down a bit and still win. theres plenty of time to come back and even if youre even/winning in map control, these guys still are having mental breakdowns. also, why lock in an obviously hard to play character, do nothing with it (misses every ability/pull/stun etc) and then get mad when people say to pick an easier character. it benefits everyone to play an easier character while you learn the game better. this is the biggest problem with the game, but there really is no solution, outside of a ranked system, but even then bad players can get boosted, carried, or even potentially buy a high rank account, but it would solve the problem pretty drastically (potentially).

as for optimization, it's just alright. im on an rtx3060ti 3200mhz ddr4 ram 16gig, and a ryzen 73700x. it can play alright at 144fps with a mixture of high textures + medium to low everything else + 90% render rez otherwise it heats up fast and runs bad (stutters hard frame drops). game looks pretty good otherwise.

some gameplay things i hate, using the smite thing sometimes doesnt work and just goes away when you click it on a mob. basically all dashes feel bad, outside of gideon portal and sev dash for the most part. feels like kinda laggy and just starts and ends abruptly. still not a fan of the item shop either, i wish you could make builds for characters, instead of having to menu everything everytime, but obviously still allow the entire shop to be accesssible. i want per character paths that i actually use.

So I recently started playing again and despite a lot of negativity in the community I think the game has made a lot of amazing progress from last year.  At least to me since release matches seem more stable, and the game play feels more consistent.  The new Heroes added have worked well, and while at times some characters seem stronger than others that's just how MOBAs go.  They're constantly patching improvements and giving insight on changes coming on their website and socials.  I saw a few complaints on having to change builds about who you play against...., but like that's what a moba is there's going to be counters lol.  So far every character has pros and cons, and while some are easier to pickup most still have a field they're the best in.

Maybe a little too slow for some people but they're still making regular updates trying to get the game to what Paragon was.  Such as adding old and new characters ones about every two months. Which don't get me wrong I want the old charters like Wukong and Grim added, but stuff takes time. Also soon They're making it cross platform like people have been asking for which is amazing!  A lot of people are still comparing it to the end of Paragon, even though this game is just getting started. 
  
That being said the main two things that I think should be reworked are the item system, and the map itself (also why do we have to pay for affinity items when in Paragon they were free).  However I do think these are just place holders for things to come later on.  Items are very primitive for the most part, and unless I just cant find it why isn't there a way to premake builds before matches.  For the map I miss the verticality of Paragons maps.  It gave the jungle and lanes more depth, made chases more interesting, and characters with movement harder to catch.  Also I'm curious if I'm the only one who misses the 2v1 lane setup?  To me made the off lane more interesting, and ganks by mid/jungle more meaningful.  

Also I'd recommend old paragon players keep in mind (double check my research just checked YouTube Channel Video Dates)  but I think paragon only had a live service with Epic for three years.  In that span of time we had a whole map  rework, like three / four different card systems, and many characters added.  However, that was with a triple A studio with plenty of resources.  

The game definitely has as much potential as paragon , but it's going to take time for things to get back to the way they were.",1701408938,1701408938,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Edit:

After a few hundred hours I can no longer recommend this game in the state that it is in. I feel the dev team really needs to reevaluate their mindset towards this game as it no longer feels that they have the care for this project as they used to. It seems like they are more and more interested in just money and not recreating the experience we all once loved. Their discord also does not feel like a safe environment for players who have the slightest ""negative"" insight into a mechanic or otherwise. My friends as well as myself have at one point or another created a threat or mentioned something deemed ""unacceptable"" and the comments were either deleted or sometimes the player was kicked. All we were trying to do was give input but it is clear that is not acceptable unless you want to meat ride their decisions. As a player of the original Paragon for years it is disappointing to not feel the love for this game anymore. 

To be specific with my other problems with the game currently, I would say the chat banning is too strict and unforgiving. Also you have no idea how long you have been banned. As someone who has never been chat banned but has had friends be, believe me it is just as frustrating to have a teammate who cannot communicate with your teammates. 

The monetization is also pretty crazy. Almost everything is behind a paywall when you have to purchase the base game. Furthermore, a lot of these assets are cut and paste from the previous game for them to cost so much money.",1669885802,1701293714,False,0,0,0.496931463479995728,0,True,False,True

I believe after another year or two of cleaning up their systems they'll have a really clean game. However the issue I've had with the game since it released in early access is that the game is just not fun. Every time I come back to the game (once a month), I'll play 2-3 matches and leave with the same ""bored"" impression. So much so that the last time I played with friends we all just signed off mid match and went to play Overprime because we just didn't find the games moment to moment game-play to be more enjoyable. Unfortunately I can't pinpoint the core problem. Some of it has to do with last hitting minions feeling like a chore, while another part of it is the game feels slow.

I used overprime as an example. That game for me feels fun to play. It has a whole list of issues in terms of balance and monetization strategy, but it definitely feels fun. The biggest contributing factor to that is the shorter cooldowns, TTK, and ease of clearing minion waves, you kind of just get back to the action faster. It reminds me more of a game like Smite, which has IMO incredible game feel and match pacing (say what you will about balance). 

A core complaint I do have about these paragon successors in general is the fact that ADC's can run you down with auto attacks for 8-9 shots before getting out of range. In a game that practically has hitscan auto attacks, I think there needs to be a higher movement penalty for auto attacks. There's no way a ranged ADC should be able to back pedal while shooting the whole time. In Smite, there is a 50% movement penalty for back pedaling, and even more so for shooting. You can't shoot and retreat at the same time.

The map is fairly boring overall and not a big change from Paragon, it feels, but there's plenty of opportunity to change it and it's clear the team recognizes that. I highly recommend this game if you're interested in a new type of moba or if you played paragon in the past. This will scratch that itch. It's the best playing game of the paragon child games by far, I promise. The community is cool. You'll find the one of ragers that spam chat but dude its a moba, if you aren't mentally ready for that then overprime or league or smite isn't for you either. Devs are cool overall, CEO literally posts his games with commentary on YT so you know that at least someone here plays the game so that empty insult can't fly here. 
The skins are solid. Monetization is terrible and it needs to be fixed for sure. Gameplay is king and this game definitely takes that crown. If you keep in mind that the game isn't fully released and they're focused on retention and tightening screws over remodelling the house then I think your perspective of this game will be appropriate and you'll be satisfied. If you expect this game that's really only been out for a year to already be a smite and league competitor then you're just gonna hurt yourself. They'll get there. I'm confident in it. But for now, just let them iron things out and really perfect their craft and image for the game while you get to play for fun and just let the paragon glory days bubble back up.

The game's not perfect. I feel like they should really be more experimental with this game. It's really aligning closely with what paragon was (which might be exactly what you're looking for so that's great). But it's a new game with a new studio and new leadership and admittedly it feels like they're playing it pretty safe overall. THAT BEING SAID, it's early access? While I think this is the perfect opportunity to break the game, it's also the perfect opportunity to piss off and deter paying customers. I think they're doing pretty well overall and the game feels close to a complete product imo. I definitely think this is well well worth $10 or less.

Currently this is one of the best MOBAs I have ever played but it suffers greatly from not having any social features and a broken matchmaking not to mention there are some biases towards certain heroes usually having overloaded kits and itemization despite having a closed testing server all of that mixed in with a gameplay loop that is getting stale and unimaginative this game has fallen from grace for me and I have asked for the license to be removed from my account with no refund being needed.

Multiplayer 3/10
At the beginning the game had a health population of 3k people to play with but now it barely has 700 meaning that you are more than likely going to have a mixed team of experienced players that know how to itemize and play the game with new players that don't know what they are doing, this coupled with the fact that MM is currently made to prioritize quantity over quality is killing the game slowly.

Community 1/10
This game has nearly zero social features only the in game chat which is near useless and bring more problems than anything else I have been able to use it before to communicate  but recently it has had an update that allows bans this would not be an issue if it was per game bans but if you say the ""incorrect"" thing you will be banned.",1669887868,1700942690,False,0,0,0.484104275703430176,0,True,False,True

90 hour review:
-Game feels good, there are a couple annoying bugs but I don't find myself running into them too often.
-No body feels to out of balance, the game really does come down to how well your team coordinates around objectives and team fights.
-Speed of games feels nice.

190 hrs:
-Game still fun and exciting
-Exploring meta and theorycrafting can really add some extra depth
-Content release schedule being followed
-Community is *mostly* non-toxic, there are definitely some weirdo's but it's few and far enough between to not really bother too much.

300+ Hr review:
All of the above still stands
Devs pay attention to community and make changes as needed to items if they see blatant abuse etc.
Devs have stuck to roadmap schedule to a T. 
Still optimistic on outlook.

450+ Hr review:
Lots of QOL improvements
PS5 beta coming out in like 2 weeks
Optimization and balancing tweaks every couple weeks
New Original heroes as well as Paragon heroes released since last review
Still optimistic about this game and how it will be on f2p launch
I don't think that p2w will be an issue as the grind to unlock heroes is not as tedious as other titles.

Decent graphics and high quality models.
Smooth movement and camera mechanics (One of the reasons i loved Paragon compared to other MOBAs)
Interesting and powerful shop items, keeping the matches engaging.
UI is simple and concise.

Only one map (Not even any night/day variants)
Cosmetics are locked behind a silly paywall - Easiest way to explain it is a Battle Pass PER! Character.

Not a priority for now: lots of quality of life features missing.

Yes because it's the closest thing to Paragon. I wasn't good at Paragon and MOBAs in general but I liked it for some reason and now I like this.

Absolutely not. at least not right now not in EA.
. The game has a lot of bugs.. sometimes I can't use some abilities and I have to leave mid match and rejoin, sometimes I get kicked out of a match for no reason and can't rejoin, and every time I launch the game it tells me that I need to update my graphics drivers even though my graphics drivers are up to date.
. Also this game has the most toxic player base that I ever encountered.. do one ONE wrong thing in game and they will blame everything wrong with their entire life on you.. on top of that you won't be able to complete matches.. most of them will end in surrender, if your team is losing they will spam surrender until enough of them will press F1 and if they are winning the other team would do the same.
. And finally the game has a very small player base.. the matchmaking time is not that (except  early in the morning and late at night) bad but you are most likely going to play with or against the same people which is not that bad if the player base wasn't that toxic.",1679080105,1700624053,False,5,0,0.557139277458190918,0,True,False,True

However, they released the game's assets for free once they announced they weren't going to support it anymore, and many attempts to revive the game have been made by various groups. There are currently 2 that are currently available and worth checking out: ""Paragon: The Overprime"" and ""Predecessor"".

That first one, Paragon: The Overprime, is being supported by a Korean Mobile Game dev called Netmarble, and they obtained the rights to use ""Paragon"" in their game title. That one is Free-to-play currently. 

This one, Predecessor, is being developed by fans of the original Paragon, who decided they didn't want to let their favorite MOBA die for good. It is currently Buy-to-play, to gain access to the Early Access, but plans to launch as Free-to-play whenever they're done with Early Access. (No date announced for full release as of the posting of this review).

Both games have different maps, different interpretations of Hero's kits, different game flows. They FEEL different. Predecessor feels a lot closer to how Paragon used to play. Overprime feels faster paced, but many dashes feel clunky to use. Predecessor's gameplay itself is a lot smoother, but it's UI leaves a lot to be desired. Overprime's UI feels small and hard to read, but features are more developed, with many more heroes and skins added than Predecessor. Ranged attacks are hitscan in Overprime, but have travel time in Predecessor. Both have their draw, but I personally prefer Predecessor cuz it's the closest to what I loved about the OG Paragon. Highly recommend Predecessor, but both are at least worth trying.",1700467995,1700467995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game is just baaaad. The devs updates are too slow, and when they do come, barely add to the game or make significant changes. After what seems like a year in early access, they still haven't managed to even reach OG dead Paragons state. Compared to Overprime, which feels like it has surpassed Paragons state and polish.
They've have tried to sneakily add some bad monetization which thankfully was reverted. Just a big no.  Needs at least 1-2 years more dev time at this rate. A main menu UI that took months to implement for example.

Original review-

Positives-
Looks good and plays smooth. Seems to be well optimized but I do have a high end system.
Games seem to be 30-40 min. Getting killed end game is punishing.
Autobuy system for items
servers working day 1


Negatives-
Slow movement speed. Hard to get used to after playing Overprime with their sprint option.
[strike]No ultrawide support for 21:9.[/strike]

Chaotic team fights, can't see whats happening- just a spam fest hoping you come out on top.
No voice lines
No ranked yet
Charging for a skin recolor of an old Epic made skin...
[strike]Limited heroes - only 3 adc? cmon..[/strike]

$13 CAD  early access for a game that may or may not survive. Competitor will be free with more heroes available day one, ranked day one.

Do I recommend paying to play this at the moment? If your a die hard Paragon fan maybe. Game is slower and more 'strategic' in its moba approach. I do enjoy its end game, as you can finish games if team coordinates. But the time between fights is not very fun.

Paragon:Overprime is faster and more of a 'action'  focused moba. It feels more fun to play, but the end game last beta was bad. Might be fixed on Early access release. Very hard to end games, and getting killed was not punishing enough. For example death timers too short.

Depending on future updates Predecessor might get a lot better. Overprime edges it out slightly in the fun factor. I will revisit review when Overprime drops its (Free) early access and have a better comparison then.

Pros:

Feels like the Paragon we knew/loved (After the Monolith update, not Legacy.. :(  )
Visually, it's nice. Character models could use a huge update in comparison to the scenery (Countess's pastey-white face, im talking about you... There's more details in her rear cheeks than her face)
Gameplay's fun and fluid. 

Cons:
Balancing is pretty rough, in terms of heroes themselves. There's patches every so often but reworks on some heroes is pretty much necessary. (Narbash, you forgotten soul you)
Matchmaking is horrific. This is mostly due to it's low player count. Until the game's F2P/Console release(5 Dec?) be prepared to play against people that are significantly higher MMR than you, or with people that are significantly lower than you. The latter being more frustrating.

The AI chat-bot is kinda ridiculous. Something as simple as a ""F* i almost got her"" = chat mute.
Repeat offenders, even when not used in slang/aggressive terms towards anyone in particular, will be outright chat banned.

1. Chat system: Their chat banning system is so rudimentary it hurts. Pretty sure its just a library that scans words or phrases leading to mass frustration when the chat ban kicks in incorrectly without remediation. I am currently banned for some unknown length of time (currently been a couple weeks as of this post) when I typed ""I deserved to die for that one"" when I made a bad play, but since it had the word 'die' I was chat banned on the spot while just conversing with my team.

2. The matchmaking prioritizes speed over fairness. A third party site calculates MMR ranking so you can see how you stack up. A good match usually fits between 40-60 / 60-40 odds of winning/losing with your mirrored enemy being within a few hundred MMR. That is not the case for how matches are made. Instead, it will roll on average MMR and give you the most statistically wild spread. For an anecdotal example, I played against two players that were 99.5 percentile while having a teammate in unranked placements clearly incapable of being on par. But, what actually will normally happen is which ever team gets a big difference in MMR for their jungle or carry will win the match barring miracles. 
I would rather wait a few extra minutes for a 30-40 minute full length match instead of starting sooner and getting torn apart by the best players of the game while I play with someone learning the keyboard mapping of their character. You can even see the chances of winning your lane, and it is frequent to find players with 1:9 odds of winning which is crazy. I understand this game does not have tens of thousands of concurrent players to make it super clean, but there are enough to make it have some level of consistent fairness statistically with some effort from developers fixing their matchmaking.

3. The community is rightfully and unsurprisingly awful. Given how severe these two issues above are, players are clearly frustrated and express so through chat, throwing or feeding. You can see the outcomes of most games within the first 15 minutes so by then there does not feel like a reason to play it out if you are on the short end of the stick making it less fun. There is nothing fun about Olympians playing against preschoolers, there is no healthy competition here.

- The hero affinity system and hero unlock systems need work
- Skins are a bit too pricey

Opinion: Personally, I love this game. It isn't perfect, and they have a little while before I feel they are ready for an official release. But all that being said, I just can't put this game down. The game-play is engaging and responsive, the heroes are all fun to play, and the map is beautiful. If you are at all interested and are OK with being patient with an early access game, I cannot recommend this game enough.

1. playerbase to small for proper matchmaking, i eather play against masters or against brons players while i am diamond (3th party site for mmr). This is simply not fun th ematchmaking is garbage.

2. no ranked yet atm but a 3th party site calculates the mmr (omeda.city)

3. Community is complete dogshit like all mobas and i have the feeling that penalties for toxic behavior and afk are not being punished hard enough. i come across players that i know are toxic again and again.

I am new to this GENRE but funny thing that in a League of Legends (i hate that game and i am an FPS player) i have more feeling of success than in this game. They exploit the Bundle system because you cannot just buy the game without DLC. I just wanted to buy in myself as an Early Access to check out the game is it suits me or not can i have a fun with it or not. If you quit the game it will still run in the background as a process so your minutes and hours will grow on steam if you didn't notice it. You cannot get a fully refund at this point if you not played 2hr and you noticed in time that the game still running in the background and you closed it then you will still only have a chance to refund 5€. Why? Because the game in the Bundle 5€ and the Rare DLC is 15€ so they just exploited the system to get income even from refunds because they just give you back the 5€ from your purchase so the left 75% is theirs. This is a disgusting move so they have 75% income from every single purchases which ones requested a refund. I love Early Access games and i like to give them a chance but if i don't like it i request a refund it but if i like it nice worth it maybe i support them in someway. This game should use the DLCs as a support option but they force support even when you just want to try the game. For example, if I could buy the game on its own and like it over time, I could buy one of the DLCs to support the developers but in current state this is impossible so they scam you. So if you don't want to lose any money but you wanna give it a try just wait because the game will be Free to Play in the future just to know.
As many reviews say:
""The $20 bundle is a scam. The game itself costs $5 but its $15 for DLC. And purchasing the game as a standalone is impossible.""


Update: 
They needed almost 1 year to give a chance to buy the game separately without any extra stuff. MM still bad at all. Plus you get wrongly muted by AI permanently so you cannot even communicate with your teammates they gonna not unmute you they don't care. They introduced mastery system for every hero separately, there is a free and premium version of it but you need to pay for each 5€ to get the premiums. There is 31 hero so get all premium stuff is gonna cost you 155€ which is multiple games that are much better. Just a bad game, doesn't deserve any attention, just a waste of time and money I suggest you to move on. They just want your money, nothing more.",1675366512,1699186897,False,2,0,0.501190423965454102,0,True,False,True

The game play has been great the whole time, noticeably buggy, seem to do will with hero balance. Old heros that were released in a broken state back in paragon came out relatively balanced, but some basic heroes (grux, crunch) are still somewhat out of balance to this day.

The gameplay is great, but it ends up repetitive as there isn't a ton of build variety that is viable, and certain heroes force you build a certain way or you will almost certainly lose. The lack of build variety makes the game mechanics that have a lot going for it become stale, you either win by playing a small number of heroes with select builds, or you get lose. Its fun to win, but not when you are just playing the same few ways on repeat.

The player base is really the problem at this point though, I stopped a year ago due to the toxicity and general time sink of it, but coming back it is even smaller now and more toxic. basically impossible to come in as a either a new player or a rusty player and have a good time. Due to the limited number of players you are thrown in with the wolves to play against experiences players immediately, hard to even improve when you can't even take a step out the door. The community is fairly toxic as well, some players will try to be helpful, but typically you are met with rudeness or harassment if you have the audacity to try and play this game. 

Without a way to directly increase the player base to allow for more balanced match making the developers should probably expand on the player vs AI game mode. Currently there is no real way for new players to experience the game without be harrassed, or to some extent, ruin the game for current players. The AI mode being updated scale up the difficulty so that actually simulate something resembling a real match might allow for player to actually learn the game before ""going live"".

However, this review doesn't give the game 5/5 rating, rather 3/5. There are major obstacles this game needs to overcome to be successful.

The current map just isn't it. This game will need to refine their primary 3-lane map as the current one is mediocre at best. 

There needs to be in-game currency that can be earned, and also be meaningful. For now, this company is trying to bleed the wallets of it's current EA players and it's hitting the community wrong and could cause the games untimely demise. 

The matchmaking system is horrendous and as a result the community is very toxic in-game. Be prepared to endure players asking for your own untimely death and not being able to report them or have consequences because the reporting system is trash and outside of a match the reporting system is non-existent. 

Hope this game makes it, but it's walking a tight rope right now.",1698243837,1698243837,True,8,1,0.566307723522186279,0,True,False,True

This game, while fun, has some incredible major flaws, most of which are coming from incredibly poor business decisions and lies to the community.

This game has had [b] NO [/b] new content besides hero releases, of which only 2 are new original heroes (both of which are extremely basic and pretty much copies from other moba's) from Omeda Studios. The rest are all literal copy pastes from an older dead game named [b] Paragon [/b] from Epic Games.

Omeda Studio's likes to say they are going to release content and then delay it in favor of working on something else, which then also gets delayed or partially released in a state that serves no purpose to the community other than being a big middle finger to the players who have supported this game for almost a year or for some even longer.

Now Season 3 has been released, and after [b] ALMOST A WHOLE YEAR [/b] of waiting for new original content, they gave us the *Affinity System*. This system was marketed as a mastery system where you could grind heroes to gain levels on them to then unlock cosmetics to show off that you have [i] Mastered [/i] said hero. This had the whole community hyped, as it would have been Omeda Studio's first real content update and would also give players something to grind for.
Then Omeda decided it would be best to well fuck the entire community and put a paywall in front of the mastery system, making it so that half of the whole mastery isn't obtainable, which at first also included the mastery skin. They have now corrected the thing with the skin being paid for, but HALF THE MASTERY SYSTEM IS STILL BEHIND A PAYWALL! What other game puts a paywall in a mastery system?!?! Even Activision or EA aren't that greedy! Their whole apology also reeks of PR lies, and not to forget, the CEO straight up lied on stream about them not calling it a mastery system, as they even called it a mastery system in their apology while also saying that it isn't a mastery system.

Omeda Studios and their CEO seem to give less of a fuck about their players and seem to give a lot of fucks about trying to fill their own pockets. This is further proving by them asking sometimes for up to 15 euro/dollars for skins they didn't even make themselves but instead just copied over from Epic Games, which released these skins and assets for free for anyone to use. I can understand asking that much for an original skin they made themselves, but instead they don't bother with making skins. They made some skins, but not a lot, and most of them are now in the whole mastery system, which is a complete joke to begin with, and the other ones are just recolors that should be free or made to be earned for free.

If there's one thing you take from this, please be it that you shouldn't buy this game!
The studio behind it is full of complete greedy fucks who lie and guild-trip their community.
The game gets no real updates besides the hero releases, which are fun for 2 days, then you realize it's another empty update with a basic hero that a 12-year-old could brainstorm and develop in a week. (These updates also only occur every 6 weeks, so be prepared to be bored out of your mind.)
Also, this game still has bugs from the early access release a whole year ago that they just refuse to fix.

TLDR
Studio doesn't care about you or anyone besides themselves.
Studio will paywall everything without giving you the opportunity to unlock it through earned currency.
Studio releases almost no original content, and even if they do, they put a paywall on at least half of it.
Don't buy this game if you value your money in even the slightest, because if you thought EA or Activision were greedy, just wait till you meet the greedy fucks behind this game.",1698180792,1698180792,False,8,1,0.509056925773620605,0,True,False,True

Chill for a few months and smoothen it out, the first player experience is kind of a mess atm.

Ever get that feeling you want to play a moba ? I got that so I turned on a stream and to no surprise the streamer was in a 5 stack. I quickly changed my mind and pushed that feeling of wanting to play a moba, I'm going to buy new world expansion(even though amazon are oath breakers and I'm paying for this expansion when amazon promised it was going to be free.. anyways..).

-Predecessor bring in solo/duo queue -make the map larger - slow down the game and you'll see it explode in population -stop listening to the same crowd that kills your game -600 player base isn't something you need to worry about losing - Overprime like predecessor picked up where monolith left off, team death match but with a larger map, seems they did it better but it was to boring for me to watch enough to make a real decision.

What impact my influence on this game the most is 4 years and $20,000,000 dollars later, we get.. kinda a disappointment. The game has okay stability at 90 fps, but the lines look blurry. At 120 fps (lowered settings frame rate felt jumpy, contrary to the fps counter Overprime did feel more stable and smooth. The Pick and Ban takes way too long in contrast to its competitor. UI is fine, but the new item system feels kinda hand holdy.

Now for the juicy stuff, gameplay. Overall, Pred is alot slower pace than OP. Some people may like that. Level and item progression both feels slower than OP's. Combat feel less fluid and our items ares as exciting as the other game. Though TTK's are similar in both games but OP is easier to process; it feel like its easier to understand what buffs are active and what is going on among the chaos. OP's abilities feel good! All your abilities, including your autos, feel impactful character defying. In Pred, at least to me, the abilities feel kind of dry and bland.

To be honest I was team Pred for the longest time. But after playing both games. Pred seems a little uninspired and lacking. OP is overall faster pace and you feel busier through out the match. The changes they made to the towers, travel mode, and jungle, all feel good. 

One of the biggest things going for OP, is that it already has a ranked mode for serious players. In addition to that, the Devs seem to have the ambition of trying to bring OP to the eSports arena. 

Pred feels like ""Incomplete Monolith Launch"", if that makes sense. OP Feels like a like a ""Proper Sequel to Legacy Paragon""

Follow Up, Sep 2023:

This game is beyond disappointing. In fact its worse than launch. The man reason I play Pred over OP, is because there are more NA players in Pred. This latest patch v11, has terrible stability, frequent DC's (they comeback, so it usually from game crashes), terrible hero balance, and no content.

No content
-I get that its in EA, but I feel that's total BS given what was stated above. No ranked mode, no area/one lane, AI was just released in the game, limited champs, item shop feels small. There are alot of assets the could be using, but they're not. Game to me feels empty and I feel I have already explored the game and characters enough.

Balancing
-The hero balancing is whack. Overall the game is more balanced than OG Paragon. But some heros got even more out of balance and are just not even fun to interact with. OG Paragon and Pred have a handful of characters that are fun to play, but are a nightmare to go up against. In a hero based game such as this one, the optimal interaction for a certain matchup, should never be no interaction. There are some characters that you just don't even want to interact with. Generally the easiest characters, are also the most oppressive. Its okay to have easy characters in your game, but those characters should never be the most oppressive and powerful AS WELL.

Stability
-In patch v11, there are people DCing left and right. Most of them are from game crashes. No joke, at least once a game, 1 person in the lobby will DC.

Predecessor is making alot of the same design decisions as OG monolith Paragon, which I feel killed Paragon in the first place. Overtuned characters that just aren't fun to fight against, repetitive item shop, poor map, fast ttk's but slow movement, no ranked mode, and no casual mode.",1669978628,1695894372,False,9,1,0.477046936750411987,0,True,False,True

I hate the warding system in the game. If I buy an extra ward why do I have to wait a cool down to drop the ward? I might as well not buy the ward. Also, I feel like wards dont do a good job with notifying you that something is there. The sound queue is easily mixed up with the communications sound queues which are often spammed.

The queues can be a bit long, usually a lot shorter during the later times when everyone is home from work and school. Overall its been fun.

Clearly their money issues are just beginning and the game is getting worse -- not better with each update. 

This is a remake of a much better game called Paragon, and since Paragon was shut down, people started playing the remakes as a coping mechanism. This worked until the latest patches for Predecessor to where the game went from just passable to outright unplayable garbage. I don't regret supporting this game, but I wholeheartedly believe this game is already at death's door and I can't see it making it out of 2024.

Matchmaking is still horrible, I am assuming that its due to not enough players in this game. The Developers cannot retain new players which makes matching making worse. How is a person who is learning the game supposed to play against someone who has a high elo. This discourages new players from staying. They also will ""slow"" things down on updates when everyone already thinks they were already moving at a slow pace. There is currently just one game mode, so casual players have to play against people who take this game more serious. It would be nice if they focused on adding some content to the game. Maybe implement a 3v3 or 5v5 single lane, but the Developers focus on the wrong things. I still would not recommend you buy this game. Wait for it to go free as you paying for early access is not worth your money. There is still no incentive for current players to play the game rather than ""for fun"", which as mentioned before match making and only 1 game mode makes that difficult. Games go 2 ways, you steam roll the other team to the point where it is sad, or you get steam rolled and you can't even play the game. DON'T BUY.WAIT.

i know this game is in early access but damn, recently the matchmaking is horrible. The gap between players is huge. I really liked this game and it pains me to not recommend this game. The other issue is that there is no reward for players putting in hours of game play. its in early access so I am hoping this game gets better as time passes.

I enter the game to find that two players from the previous game are beefing and are just trolling eachother in game and chatting in text. One AFKs in fountain, the other goes in the lane he isn't suppose to. All within the first 20 minutes of downloading the game and playing. The game is scrapped, the players are insanely toxic, and one might say...""that's a moba for you..."" well no, not exactly.

Of the 30 hours I've played Overprime I HAVE ENCOUNTERED 3 TOXIC players! I've played approximately 50 games in Overprime and have encountered 3 absolute troll team mates. I'm no mathematician but I believe that equals less than 10% of the player base I have encountered in my region. The fact that I downloaded Predecessor to give it a shot, and see if it stood up with Overprime was absolutely LAUGHABLE. My first encounter with the game in PVP online is me being subjected to extremely toxic team mates just texting away in base because one was upset at the other for god knows what!?!?! Instant uninstall. Overprime has figured out how to deal and penalize bad behaviour and its absolutly working wonders. Im tired of devs just not taking initiative about toxic players because in reality MOBAS are EXTREMELY toxic, but no one will ban or penalize the majority because thats their main group of players. Needless to say, Overprime is the way to go if ur looking for a paragon remake. Dont waste your time with predecessor. Its literally leauge of legends community in a third person shooter moba. Sad because I was asked to try and give my feed back to a friend because he swore up and down it was better. But pred's community although I only played one game, knew it was jaded because no one does anything to combat the toxicity. One note I do have to say is the MAP is abosultely STUNNING and 100x's better than overprime.

There are no problems with the servers, i have been disconnected maybe twice out of the thousands of matches I play, rubber banding is not due to the servers its due to your shitty internet because i havent experienced it once and there is no way you are sitting in a Que for  15 minutes, if you have screenshot then send it to me pls.

The game has some rough core gameplay elements that can be worked out over time especially since its EA.

Gave me Ubisoft vibes, so i went to discuss on the official discord and was met with a ""i need to re-evaluate my spending habits if i cant afford it"" and "" Maybe you should un-install and not play the game"" by the moderators for preds discord. So i did and will not be playing again. That same type of energy you get from the mods is what you also get from regular 600-900 people who are currently playing the game. The heroes to boot are 10$ a piece and there is still 10 heroes left for them to release from the original roster.

Do Not let the smooth or polished look trick you. There is still a limited roster, the original Heroes have not all been released let alone the game balanced. There are many bugs and lack of actual game modes, content, skins and Maps. WE are paying testers in hopes that this game can grow and become something new to the Smites and Leagues of the world.

This is a 5V5 competitive arena style game. Just like recognizable MOBA's there are 3 lanes , 5 players per side all set to protect a Core. You choose to play in one of the 5 available roles and protect your lanes. Youll choose heroes based on the role you want to fill. You wanna be a fighter , or a tanky hero thats on the front line, or you wanna be a glass cannon dealing the most damaging numbers youve ever seen from the outsides of the battle? Do you wanna be a magical assassin and sneak up on people? You want to be a mage that shoots missiles, or summons rocks from some far off galaxy?   

While there are other iterations of the game out there, this game stays close to Classic MOBA pacing and mindsets of an early, middle, and late game phases. Roles are classical and meant for certain heroes and cannot be filled by all heroes. There is a small player base currently as the marketing and advertisement of the game is niche and pointed towards the small community of paying testers. Console is quickly approaching connecting the PC community to the Console community for what will hopefully be more opportunity for growth. 

The game is fun and playable, with an unfortunate skill wall , due to the vast experience and talents of the current player base. Your set to sink or swim with no real understanding of how to get better or learn aspects of the game due to the lack of information. There are testing modes as well as AI to kind of get of feel of items and hero kits, you dont get a good feel in a real PVP setting unless you get 9 other people to do a custom game. These modes are there but not really fleshed out since this game is in real early development. The game is so good that players forget how much more development the game needs to actually work like the MOBA they are shooting for. 

The info that the average player new to this genre of game is largely from the small few content creators of the small community if paying testers. You will be part of a small few who have loved this game since EPIC games creation of this title back in 2014 - 2016. Its worth 20 dollars, and is better than a lot of games that cost 70-80 dollars. It takes time to master , and definitely fills that competitive spirit that we all love much in online gaming.

Is this game perfect? No, but for what it is I've enjoyed my time on it. My queues (NA East) are always fairly quick and I've been lucky enough to not run into much toxicity. Balance wise the game ebbs and flows, but in general isn't too bad. If you feel weird about spending money on an early access moba, that's understandable. Just keep an eye on it for when it full releases and goes free to play. If you liked Paragon, or it seems interesting, give it a shot.

Here's a few pros and cons for anyone not sure.

Pros: 

- Devs have updated the game and released heroes consistently since EA began
- Gameplay and game pace feel smooth (my opinion)
- New original characters are solid and enjoyable (I've had a fair bit of fun on Zarus recently)
- Item system is familiar for anyone who has played other mobas
- Objectives are impactful when played around properly
- Macro and micro skill expression exists and can win games
- Is pretty (Overprime looks better but i think Pred still looks great)
- EA gives all character without needing to farm to unlock more

Cons:

- While the devs consistently update the game and release new heroes, the development feels slow on releasing quality of life and user experience type features
- small playerbase
- I've heard queue times can vary depending on what server you are on (refer to my previous point)
- Item system is boring and does nothing to innovate on the existing moba genre
- Many people report a toxic playerbase
- Unique skins are sorely lacking (what i like cool new skins? sue me) and skin pricing is kinda weird.
- Can be hard to break into as a new player (both game knowledge and community wise)

Neutral things:

- the map is more akin to paragons monolith map. Some people prefer that, some people prefer the legacy map
- still in development so things/meta/items can shift a fair bit depending on patch changes
- they are selling skins that were released as free assets by epic (i don't care about this but some people do)

I hope this helped inform your decision. If this interested you, at the very least, give Predecessor another peak when it full releases and goes ftp. Have a good one!

They have responded to other reviews that they don't feel like the game is in a place to focus on marketing, yet the player base has dwindled to the point that we are at this moment, under 500 players.
 
I am utterly confused at the direction they have taken the game. If you don't market, you don't have players, thus you have no cash flow.
The game is $5 yet they ONLY sell it in a $20 bundle. Visit their social media and you may come across banners for ""Free to Play"", which is just plain false.

Matchmaking isn't competitive. Arguably it can't be, as the player count is too small. You will play with the same people over, and over, and over again. The same toxic players that throw games while flaming the chat before they DC. 

I really, really enjoy the core game play but it's being driven straight into the ground, and I unfortunately think we have crossed the event horizon some time ago. For this title to revive is a long shot and would require some miraculous turn of events that we rarely see in the industry.

The game doesn't need a million strong player count or to become some titan in the field, it just needs to acquire and maintain enough players to carry its competitive MOBA platform. As long as the focus is selling a new paint job and calling it a skin, the servers might as well shutdown.

I'm hoping everyone that is disappointed in the game voices their opinion and just maybe, the tide changes and we can keep the game afloat.",1673307766,1693603683,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

1. The game is $20. $15 of that is a DLC that you can't refund. No option to buy base game. That is scummy.
2. The player base is down to 400-600 people most of the time. You will get into a loop for 15+ minutes of getting into a lobby and it disbanding for someone not picking.
3. What players remain are the most toxic human beings I have ever encountered online, and I play other games like OW, R6, Val etc. I've never seen so many ppl cry and throw games in my life. 2 of my 3 games yesterday had ppl leave or go afk sub 15 minutes. 1 of 2 today had 2 people throwing because of a previous match they played together and didn't like one another. Reporting seems to do nothing as I run into the same players every time I open the game.
4. Kind of tying into the last two points, the matchmaking is wild having people who are way higher or way lower elo together, leading to everyone being angry. 9/10 matches are a steamroll in either direction. I can't even recall the last time I felt like we had an even, hard fought win or loss.

The game itself is really fun and it's sad to see the current state of it. The problems it has currently are mostly from a small base of players but the devs have stated in reply to other reviews they don't think the game is in a state to begin a marketing campaign. The window for this to pick up steam is probably long gone and I don't see a positive future for it unfortunately.

The game feels mostly well balanced and skill based, but unfortunately still needs skill based matchmaking as far as I can tell (More on this later). Very hopeful for the future of the game though. 

The major gameplay complaint I have, is that matches are too long. It would be nice if they ran closer to 20-30 minutes. Games seem to be getting dragged out for no reason. Sometimes just because of unskilled/unknowledgeable team mates, but generally matches tend to go on for 35-40 minutes or much longer depending. A major issue I'm seeing is players are scared of the core and won't end games. I've had games that have gone on longer than an hour. With that in mind I do hope that skill based matchmaking is shortly on its way. In the current game there doesn't appear to be any and its very obvious in some games that you are playing with people who have little to no experience with MOBA's or Paragon/Predecessor. I play mainly jungle and it can be frustrating playing with new players who don't pay attention to pings or even you showing up in their lane to gank for them. Its daunting when they just continue mindlessly farming a lane, ignore objectives, or refuse to group when its time to. I understand that the games still in early access and player numbers are limited, but it would help with some of the frustration. 

Aside from that, there are some smaller quality of life changes I would recommend. Your player icon on the mini map is very hard to find quickly. Which isn't a good feeling playing a game like this, where you want to be able to compare your position to an enemy or an ally in an instant just by looking at the map. Its nearly impossible to do with the current icon. Additionally why can I only blink in the direction I'm facing? Its kind of silly.

Whether it's the toxic teammates that riddle the server chat with discontent or the Discord chat where Nitroboost members are openly allowed by admins to harass and threaten the lives of others in their chat. The discord chat issue is basically sanctioned harassment for profit... and in the end the game is utterly toxic from top to bottom. You can't find 5 people to play with, for all of them are in constant judgement of you and your game play, even when they do nothing wrong. If you ask a question to another player about a play they made that got you killed, you will get excuse after excuse, and they NEVER take the blame for anything. AFTER ALL, EVERYONE CLAIMS TO BE ELITE!!! It doesn't matter how good or bad you are, it only matters how good or bad you are in that very game, and the paid members persecute you for any bad plays you make, but never, and I mean never ever apologize for their bad plays. Matter of fact, they blame others for their bad plays as well!

Worse, comes the utter immorality of the players when 2 or even 3 of the players have given up and left due to this so called elite players behavior! Some begin to idle in the base due to the endless harassment, and who can blame them!!! This is because, 3 players who are, yet again, community protected as fan bios, are purposely refusing to forfeit in a direct attempt to troll those players they purposely baited the whole game. Yes, so called elites constant bait other teammates they've deemed losers on a minute by minute basis. This is due to the fact they are only playing for a K/D RATIOS that will get them higher rank, which will match them up with so called better players. Of course, this is early access, so their ratios doesn't matter right? NOPE, cause the devs, in their oddest wisdom decided to make games and who you played with, base on an invisible ranking system, one that they first claimed didn't exist even when it did. This of course makes the fan bois even more toxic, while the admin immorally make claims they are attempting to clean up the game, they introduce rule sets they promote toxic behavior, cause yet again, the truth of every situation doesn't matter. In the end, these people don't care about winning the game, they don't care about helping their teammates or acting as a team at all for that matter. They care about themselves, and their K/D Ratio. Whatever gives them a higher rank, that is all they care about! So they don't have to play with so called bad teammates. This, of course, leaves valuable teammates to suffer, and be teamed with horrible, toxic players they refuse to perma-ban, because money matters more than the experience for those that actually supported the game and want it to succeed! It's all a money grab, and honestly, this is sorta, in the devs end game, and what this game is all about. Some have claimed the head dev is a tyrant and I haven't seen that. What I have seen is a systematic attempt by devs to discount the players whom don't rank well, base on the immoral individuals they blindly support who have attitude and are given free reign to harass who they choose. From the devs down, this game is about selfish behavior, selfish lifestyles and a immoral basis to live life by, all for the almighty dollar for the creator and his team.

Now, move forward to just weeks ago!!! Add in the AI chat banning system so they can save money, where you say a word like 'murder' when the statement was, ""but why are you threatening to murder your grandmother"" and you get banned but the other one who threaten to kill his grandmother, but skirted around the system, gets to, the whole game, threaten to kill your family over and over again while you are banned from chatting and defending yourself. If you complain to the admins about this, they will literally say, just mute them. Convenient when it's your friends making the threats and throwing around racial slurs your system hasn't caught that are personally offensive. I guess when you are most a team of white people, these things aren't a big concern! So anyways, then you go into chat to jump through their pathetic hoops to prove your innocence, after you've been dubbed guilty without proof, and low and behold, people in chat who are paid members (nitro fan bois) begin to harass you and accuse you of deserving the ban because you suck at the game, then it resorts to each little paid member threaten you for thrills, while admins behave as if they are AFK, cause calling them out for their threats would be bad for business. I accidentally contacted a HIGH END admin about this and he literally could of cared less about the in game harassment or Discord harassment, as I believe it was his friend to committed the act in the Discord arena! And don't get it wrong, I pointed out the very individuals who were guilty of those actions in their chat, and I'm sure they had logs of the behavior. They didn't care, they are all about the Almighty Dollar and nothing more.

The worse part is, the devs know, like I know that this community can't survive unless they change the culture! Yet, they will be more than happy to raise prices and gouge you for their profits, even while everything points to this game dying in a little more than a year. If you continually dismiss claims like mine, with the false idea that that victim making the claim is otherwise, either problem or worse expendable, this will get around, and people will know these devs, this creator are all about how much money they can make until it goes bust.

Remember this ABOVE ALL ELSE. This is a game, that was initially made by EPIC. This team has done little more than take those assets which were given to the public at large for free and remade them for profit. EPIC EVEN gave them a welfare check to complete it, after the fact!!! So ask yourself, is this a good game, made by a superior developer? Or is this an idea, made by a much smarter and more talented community in EPIC GAMES and made into a game for profit which you are about to but??? EPIC cancelled this game for a reason, because they saw something much more successful to put their time into, and that was Fortnite. I highly doubt this team has the talent the Fortnite team has. After all, they can't even get rid of obvious bad apples, cause they need every single cent at this point to survive. I'd rather count my losses and give up on this community. I've deleted this Discord channel and uninstalled the game, they got my money and that is all they ever care about. Don't be a sucker like me. Don't fall for their scheme, this is not Paragon and never will be of the same quality, and I would guess it's because the dev team, in their first attempt ever at designing a game, has become full of themselves, and forget their success can very well turn into failure at a moments notice. This tends to happen to the best of us when we are freshman designers and worse, get a little extra money in our pockets. Some people tend to get full of themselves with their success!",1691829164,1691834036,False,14,4,0.535608530044555664,0,True,False,True

Hard to say if reporting is working. I certainly have seen players that 4/5 (and maybe even some from the other team) people reported still pop up in games days later.

The game play is smooth and responsive and very fun. The main issues come from typical MOBA crap- character balance, metas (CC, tank, certain items, etc), and players behavior (trolling, not knowing how to play, not playing lane characters).

IMO, the devs are focusing on some less than important stuff (new original characters before already finished old ones, skins, animations) over features that will increase their player base (ranked, full launch, bans/ swaps) that would make it a serious respectable MOBA that wouldn't immediately turn off and turn away those from other games (smite, LoL, etc) coming to dip their toe in.",1691659708,1691659708,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Edit 8/8/2023

My, how we've come a long way from this review. In a nutshell, this game is going down that dark, dead path Fault made. The devs have Predatory monetization practices, the game doesn't run as smoothly as before, they can't figure out how to balance their game even temporarily, and their events are garbo (events that reward no-lifers). I played this game for a long time and it's stale now. 1 map, the same meta heroes always being played, the same item builds, the toxicity and poor matchmaking and a developer that would rather be toxic and insult players that aren't top tier and communicate with smoke and mirrors when they make mistakes. 

It's a sham. I threw in with the game that I am not sure is going to make it. Paragon: The Overprime remains the better looking game and seems more fun. PTO made it to consoles first... so it's not looking good for Pred. They need to shoot some life in this game or just close up shop and release it when it's fully ready instead of bleeding what little community they have left.

Pros:
- Regular updates
- New characters every month
- Beautiful Graphics ( can be subjective )
- Glitches and bugs are super rare.

Cons:
- The worst thing about this game is the developers not advertising the game.
- Dead game in terms of active players, so you basically end up against super high division players, example would be bronze against GrandMaster which is the highest division.
- You cant always find a game quickly due to low number of players, sometimes you have to wait 5 to 10 mins.
- Players leaving mid game due to toxic players, in my opinion this could be fixed by removing the chat system mid game.

game kinda blows. 

When they release patch notes, its scripted like they hired the god damn impractical jokers and they always give you the updated version of whatever item or character they changed, without EVER comparing it to the previous version with an image or a list, so its ALWAYS confusing to read.

They have not addressed matchmaking correctly and until they do, whenever that may be, then I will happily change my review to a thumbs up. At its core, it's a fun game. 

is it the most balanced? no. late game the carry role (playing kira) will essentially shoot you 3-5 times and you'll be dead even if you built full tank, because, balance.

what do i mean by the matchmaking sucks? i mean that i went from top 1.5% of players on planet earth (top 50 a couple months ago) to now getting stuck with players that bitch at each other from before matches start until they inevitably run down lanes to intentionally feed and end the game. In most cases, both complainers leave and ill see them the following match because they got a 5 minute matchmaking ban.

how did this happen you ask? the simple answer, i went on vacation for 6 days. and my elo shot down to silver 1 (ish, it was like silver 2) 

what happened to the people who left the matches? oh dont wory, I never forget them. because they keep fucking appearing in my games somehow. why? good question, and an even better answer. omeda appears* to give more of a shit about pushing some mobile game looking ""modern UI"" and adding more heroes to play, rather than harshly punishing those who ruin the fucking game. Ill admit it too, soon as one or two people dip or my team is typing in chat, 5 levels behind the opposing team and they wont play and i have successfully solod the first three fangtooths, got 5 kills and two mini primes and im above the enemy jungle by 50 CS in sub 20 minutes, ill just fucking leave too. cause why? THEY WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HA HA.

That being said, there is a huge problem that needs to be addressed or else I fear that the gaming community will decrease. Yesterday morning an update was released that was suppose to fix the matchmaking. Myself and many other grinding individuals agree that nothing has changed in terms of the matchmaking. In fact, it may even be worse. I believe the real issue is that there is not enough of a player base in predecessor and that is making it to where the servers have to pick whoever is queued up at the time to play. The MMR rank is a joke at the moment. I played a game this morning where the average MMR for the opposing team was 1686.4. My team had 1433.7. The opposing teammate had a 3000.6 rating and my highest on my team was 2055.3 rating. I am not sure how this is fair. Instead of trying to fix the matchmaking, which cant be fixed atm with the player count, I advise the developers and team to prioritize making the game free to play to increase the player count. I have 1000 + hours in the game and love it but am so frustrated seeing the game go down the drain at the moment. Please work to fix these issues, and I know the game will benefit from it. I see so much potential in the future of the game but at the current moment, the game is in a rut. GLHV",1690369142,1690369142,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,True

It's been awhile since I last played Predecessor. The last time I played was April 2023, but a lot of the problems that I addressed still stand. For $10 I think it's fair to get in, but $20 is still not worth it, especially considering the current playerbase count. What has changed is they've added an end of game scoreboard, a tutorial/onboarding system, an AI mode, and player reporting system.

- Match history is still missing
- No profile/progression system
- No map pinging
- The Predecessor fanbase is still rabid, but less so now that Overprime has also been struggling with their own playerbase retention.

Good news is that updates are frequent and OmedaStudios are very active on explaining balancing decisions. I'll leave my review like this for now and add some of my old review in this post, but I'm mostly waiting for full release at this point to give my consolidated review.

In my opinion, the game is worth the $10 asking price and I would have given it a positive review if the game was worth $10. In actuality, it is $20 which is the normal price when the sale ends and I cannot recommend the game for that much. Right now the game is very barebones. I know I know, there was an early access trailer that said features like match history and profile progression will be missing. That still doesn't make it okay for it not to be there and I cannot recommend this game to the general public until basic features are included in the game. Buying into the game right now is giving a lot of faith to OmedaStudios to deliver what they promise in a timely manner, when in the past, they have been extremely bad at communicating with the fans and players who are interested in the game.

There are some changes that Predecessor makes to differentiate themselves from other MOBAs (outside of the 3D aspect). Some I agree with, but some I don't. None of these changes are overtly negative for me, as I'm sure early access will iron out most of them. I still feel the need to highlight what Predecessor is doing to try to differentiate themselves.

First, there is only one active item you can have per match. You are given a crest in the beginning of a match that levels up as you do things. A tank crest will level up when you receive damage and heal from the crests passive or a support crest will level up as you hit minions (but don't kill them) for gold. When the crest becomes max level, you are given the choice of one of 3 active item choices and you cannot switch crests once you have chosen one. The reasoning from this comes from Bloodmordius, a senior game designer at OmedaStudios who spoke out on a developer Q&A stream (called Cutting to the Core Episode 3: The Passage to Predecessor on Im_StranGerr's twitch stream). I'll paraphrase, but essentially Bloodmordius claims that in League of Legends statistically the majority of people will build active items, but not use it. So them having only one active item is to make it easier for the casual player and possibly for console players as well. I'm not sure how I feel about this change... perhaps time will tell but this is perhaps one of the biggest changes that I see a lot of reviewers not write about.

Second, wards and one refillable potion (has 2 charges) are given for free right at the start of the game. If you build the support crest, supports will be able to have 3 wards when their crest is fully maxed. Junglers are given smite over a refillable potion and are ONLY given smite if the jungler role is chosen at the beginning of the game.

Third, Flash is given for free for everybody at the start of the match no matter what your role is.",1670802145,1690231558,False,10,0,0.541880428791046143,1,True,False,True

- Community -
Usually MOBA's tend to have a very toxic fanbase, but as other MOBA games have quite a large player base, chances are you won't run into them again. Unfortunately with Predecessor, you'll constantly be playing with or against these players as the community is so small which makes it more of a chore to queue up for a game. Reporting doesn't really do anything and even if they were to be banned, they can just make an account as the barrier to entry to low. Will be even lower when the game goes free to play (whenever that is.)

-Developers-
At the start I really trusted the Developers as they've done previous game tests, talked to the community on their discord and really pushed for open communication. However at this point, it feels like they haven't really been communicating with us. The community has brought up concerns about map design, balance, the store and more but it feels like they're not acting on it. They've also provided tools for us to report and ban players, but when people have reported certain members of the community, nothing gets done about it.

-Price & Monetisation-
For me, this is the real confusing part. For some reason at launch they put everything at half price (including all the bundles) and I thought paying £7 for the Rare Bundle was a pretty good deal. However, the fact they bumped the prices back up is just confusing to me, the developers say that this is just so we can get people to ""test the game"" but lets be real,  if you've opened the game to everyone it's not for testing anymore. It also has a full cash shop which has so many problems with it, with skins of similar level being different prices, the developers using FREE SKINS PROVIDED FROM EPIC AND CHARGING THEM and developers making their own skins and charging ridiculous prices for them (around double/triple of skins at similar level.) You can also buy in-game currency, which clearly states that the early access period isn't for just ""testing.""

-Gameplay-
The best thing about this game is of course, the gameplay. The gameplay is very similar to anyone who played Paragon near the end of it's development cycle and is definitely the best ""paragon-like"" game on all platforms. It feels smooth, rewarding and engaging and it definitely feels good to win a game. However, there is a lack of resources to help new players. It does have a tutorial, but it's very basic and needs to be worked on for the full release.

Overall, I would avoid this game for the time being. This game has so much promise, but wait for it to be free to play. It's definitely not worth buying in now, especially as (we think?) early access is ending soon.",1689167945,1689167945,False,22,1,0.607778191566467285,0,True,False,True

1. Not a whole lot of variety in cards stats. I would like to see a complete custom system. Almost might as well not have a card system at this point or ever. 
2. There are really only 2 jungles in the game if you want to win. If you know how to play khi or rampage and they dont have one of them your team pretty much lost the game. There needs to be a support system for assassins to really jungle. 
3. No reward system. I dont really know why I should get on every day or even week. Progress means nothing right now.
4. The mmr/q system is a joke and im not saying that to be mean. Why have master players agains lower than 1000 mmr or placement heros ect. The mmr system also has change and its even more screwy right now because I find that there are like 1200 mmr players that are better than 1800 mmr players hand down. This needs to be reset and it need to stay how it is done.
5. updates feel slow to come. 
pros
1. seems to be more balanced then some other moba's that have been out for testing when it come to hero vs hero play. 
2. there is a good support for dev's/makers of the game and this can allow them to make the game promising.

It is still in early access, so there are few bugs here and there. I thought there was a moment where I activated a hotkey and fired the ability with the LMB but the ability didn't activate. Maybe it was just on cool down. If it's a bug, that's a huge one that needs fixed asap. Otherwise, nothing game breaking or CTD like at all, it's really stable.

One thing that's glaringly missing is any community tools. No way to vote up that epic Murdock or wiley Dekker. Would really like to have community building tools in game to help it grow.

Maybe some new maps once a year and keep it all balanced... You got a real winner if you just improve the optimization at this point. This is a niche game that if you believed in it enough to build, I hope that you believe in enough to stay faithful to the vision and play the long game.Because this is a solid reinterpretation of one of the greatest games of all time.

Overall with game play, when you do get the fair games, it gets intense all the same as fun for me.

Which is why when I come back from work, I immediately launch Predecessor and queue up.

I was primarily a Predecessor player. However, changes Predecessor had made lately, have driven the game to near extinction. This game feels like a bad League of Legends wannabe with horrible sound effects. Paragon: The Oveprime has Epic's blessing to be the Paragon successor, so they not only have the original voices and sound effects, but they also have all the assets that never made it into the original game.

Predecessor looks, feels, and plays atrocious. The balance in this game is god awful. All balancing decisions are reactive, causing more problems for these amateur devs every few patches. Paragon: The Overprime not only feels more like the original Paragon game, but it has a much larger character cast. The game is better balanced. There are more items to choose from, and those items are better balanced. Plus, in Paragon: The Overprime you can use more than 1 active (Predecessor has only one active called a Crest, thats it, one only!). In this game as well, one team usually snowballs to the point that a comeback is near impossible. Paragon: The Overprime has many comeback mechanics, so that game feels like a constant back forth, and there are even mechanics in place to break stalemates and beat teams teams that are good at turtling.

In Predecessor, crowd control, and stuns are overkill. This is also why you will constantly see the same broken heroes in almost every single match. If you play against a full team, get ready to be perma stunned to death with no way to counter play, other than chain stun them to death as well. I cannot stress how awfully balanced Predecessor's roster is, and they do not even have that many heroes available. It's that sad currently. Predecessor devs call this game ""fast paced"", yet it feels slow and clunky, which is also why anyone can be good at landing stuns and crowd control.

The art team in Paragon: The Overprime is light years ahead of Predecessor's, and Paragon:The Overprime even makes their own characters and the skins for existing characters. This game, just takes Countess' character model, throws a hooded robe over her, recolors her hair and lips, and boom new character model! Predecessor also charges insane amounts of money for some of the worst skins available, not to mention you have to pay for access when this game is at best a clunky 2010 version of Paragon. Paragon: The Overprime is free to play.

In Predecessor, devs balance from the bottom up, instead of top down. This means they balance around players who do not fully understand how to play, instead of balancing around the ones who do know how to play. This causes insane character imbalances in higher elo games. The devs do not listen to community feedback. They have horrendous balancing in the game. I promise, if you play enough, you will constantly see not only the same few broken heroes in every single game, but you will also see the same players because the player base has dwindled that much. If you do not believe me, please go check Steam Charts.

This game has horrible matchmaking. You basically need a full team or near full team to play because if you queue up with friend or two, you will be matched against 5 stacks. This game has such a low player base, that if you are matched against another stack it is not uncommon for there to be a 200+ elo difference. If you do not believe me, go check the Predecessor discord feedback. Paragon: The Overprime has a ranked queue that only allows solo and duo players, then they have a casual queue for teams of up to 5.

Stay clear of this game for now. This game is not worth playing. These developers need to figure out so many things still, that by the time this game remotely begins to feel like Paragon, everyone will have forgotten about this one because Paragon: The Overprime is that much better overall. I hope these devs figure something out sooner than later, because once again, this game is on a steady decline.

TL;DR

In short, stay away from this train wreck. Paragon: The Overprime not only looks, plays, and feels better, but it more accurately represents Paragon. Save your money, go play Paragon: The Overprime for free.",1670042085,1686635078,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Various problems, most prominent being the matchmaking, are causing players to leave by the dozen everyday. With so few players to try and match make the game will shove whomever is available just to meet a 3 minute queue. The result is usually being curb stomped before you even know it's happened. This has caused a negative feedback loop resulting in more players leaving and even worse matchmaking happening as a result. Couple that with no reason to play the game: no mastery skins, no hero progressions, nothing. Just a meaningless XP bar and it's easy to see why it's haemorrhaging players.

Last game I was in was a team of 5 stacked top players including the 18th best ranked player globally versus 5 strangers in SoloQ. Ended 22 kills to 4 in 14 minutes. Why the f*** can a 5 stack of some of the best players in the game be matched up against 5 strangers in SoloQ? If you think the MMR was close to being fair, Omeda City recorded it as 2257 to 1616. Not even the grand canyon is that big. The answer? The game has no players and doesn't respect the new player experience enough to be worth investing your time into. 

If you're still a crazy optimist and want to give it a fair shot, don't think you're liable for a refund. You have to buy a bundle to play the game and you can't refund the full cost of the bundle. It stinks and is very scummy.

All of that aside, the game is pretty fun and very much could be a worthy successor to the Paragon that we remember through rose tinted glasses: just a shame the current situation is making it unplayable.

Oh, and I've not even got started on all the toxic players who tilt, afk, draft dodge, and flame the chat 24/7 whilst feeding the enemy team...

they're focused on transparency, they have a dev blog, and they have honest passion for their project.

welp I was wrong,  they gave me reason to,  I'm never touching this game again,
they ruined item diversity,  and absolutely REFUSE to do anything about
all the afkers and surrender spammers. its not fun, at all.

I truly don't understand what's going on in the devs heads, or that of all the players
that PAID to get into the playtest  just to to afk and throw.

I wanted to play this seriously,  the concept was great, and the narrative was great,
passionate game devs bringing back a beloved game better than ever. cool.

but the bad actors ruined it, and the devs just don't listen to the right people in the community,
or they just don't know what they're doing.

and of course there's the bugs, that just don't get fixed.

Like oh, the camera constantly spinning bug,
or say the locked ability menu bug -_-

Both of which make the game completely unplayable,
the latter of which only goes away once your character is taken out.

It needs more time for the devs to add more features, refine the mechanics and map, expand the small roster, and find ways to keep the game interesting in the long term.

My main issue with the game as it stands is that it's just... not fun to play. The map is genuinely awful and requires an overhaul -- which currently has not been acknowledged by the devs, raising red flags for me -- the roster is way too small at the moment and is being increased at a snail's pace considering the assets and kits for the next good few characters are already made (provided for free by Epic when Paragon was shut down), balance is whack with the game having massive time-to-kill (TTK) issues, boring itemisation, and very minimal adjustments to characters that need way more to make them more balanced/fair, and all-in-all the game just grows super repetitive after a while with nothing in terms of progression to strive for, something that should not be happening in a MOBA.

The other issue that is constantly on my mind when playing is how poor the match quality is. The game currently is keeping around about 1000 consecutive players which, while admirable for a paid early access title, is absolutely not enough to allow for decent-quality matchmaking. What's worse is that the game currently has no tutorial to help newer players learn how to play the game even to a basic degree, which is very apparent when you get matched with such players who will proceed to actively sabotage the match, intentionally or not. And as of writing, the devs are also looking to add a separate ranked mode this season, which I strongly hope they reconsider as all it is going to do is make this worse - the queues will become split between normal and ranked and will do the opposite of what it hopes to achieve.

So yeah, even if you like MOBAs, I strongly recommend waiting for this one to become free-to-play sometime later this year (hopefully) before trying it out. It needs a boost of players, it needs to strive for better quality matches and balance, and the game needs to have the replayability you'd expect from a MOBA. But considering how reserved the devs have been in terms of changes and additions to the game during early access -- the perfect time to test big changes and tackle the main issues with the game -- I don't see this happening for at least a long time, if at all.",1675646879,1684879762,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Predecessor, oh where do I even begin? This MOBA game falls far short of its potential, leaving players like myself frustrated and disappointed. From its lackluster community to its subpar matchmaking system, it's clear that Predecessor has missed the mark in several crucial areas.

Let's start with the community. Toxicity runs rampant in Predecessor, with players constantly hurling insults and derogatory remarks at one another. Instead of fostering a positive and supportive environment, the community seems more focused on tearing each other down. It's disheartening to see the lack of sportsmanship and respect for fellow players.

Moving on to the matchmaking system, it's nothing short of a disaster. The game consistently fails to create balanced teams, resulting in one-sided matches that are no fun for anyone involved. Whether it's due to an ineffective algorithm or simply a lack of player population, the matchmaking in Predecessor leaves a lot to be desired. It's frustrating to invest time and effort into a game only to be pitted against opponents who vastly outmatch or underperform.

Furthermore, the development team behind Predecessor seems disconnected from the player base. Feedback and suggestions from the community often go unheard or unaddressed, leaving players feeling neglected and undervalued. The lack of communication and transparency regarding updates and bug fixes further exacerbates the sense of frustration.

Even from a technical standpoint, Predecessor falls short. The game is plagued with frequent crashes, connection issues, and game-breaking bugs that hinder the overall experience. It's incredibly frustrating to be in the middle of a heated match only to be abruptly disconnected due to server instability or encounter game-breaking glitches that render the gameplay unplayable.

In conclusion, Predecessor fails to deliver on its promises and potential as a compelling MOBA game. The toxic community, flawed matchmaking system, lack of developer engagement, and technical shortcomings make it difficult to recommend this game to anyone seeking an enjoyable and fair gaming experience. It's a missed opportunity that leaves players longing for a more polished and player-focused MOBA alternative.",1670477538,1684469852,False,0,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,True

Though, after having bought the $20 version myself, this game is well worth the price point. This isn't EPIC games making this so Omeda Studios doesn't have a butt**** ton of money to throw at it. Though for what they've been doing, they are staying true to the Paragon universe and it really feels like they have good direction with the game. 

*Reminder* This is a MOBA. People, for whatever reason, are incredibly toxic in MOBAs. Don't let this distract you from playing, or take away from the experience. Just because you aren't playing the ""meta"" doesn't give ANYONE the right to flame you. But be prepared mentally to deal with sh*t people and you'll do fine. I recommend muting EVERYONE if you are new to MOBAs. Some content creators that I would recommend for guides and game play include:

Pinzo - He can be a little salt sometimes but he's insanely good at the game and has incredible MOBA background knowledge which will help you get ahead of the crowd. If you don't mind a somewhat brash commentator/player, he is great to watch to learn the meta and how to play it to a T.

SoulRe4p3r - Former SMITE pro. He's not flashy, nor quite entertaining, but he's incredibly talented and knows his sh*t. He is a Mid player (from what I've gathered) and he knows how to play the wave management game very well. It's clear that he's a pro.

Krashy - Great guy, super knowledgeable and continuously updates us on the state of the game and changes coming. Really comfortable vibe and has a iron mental. Experiments with crazy builds that he somehow makes work. Truly great player.

JoeYoursTruly - My favorite of the bunch. He's super sweet and incredibly friendly, and he has a knack for explaining thoroughly what he's doing, and most importantly *why* he's doing it. All around great personality and he can back it up with his big brain and amazing macro play.

Feel free to add your own recommendations, but these guys are really what are keeping the game fresh and lively.",1683847409,1683847409,True,43,1,0.799849033355712891,0,True,False,True

Edit:Now that I've played 130 hours of this game I have different thoughts. The game itself is great, but the community is so toxic i find it to be unplayable. I'm not a  person to be easily offended but the verbal abuse I've received in this game is unlike any other. Not only are the people on your team hateful, But no one plays as a team completely oblivious to team fights, objectives, ganks. No draft pick so people fight over roles and then throw a fit when they cant have it immediately throwing the game for the team before the game has even started.


The problem isn't the game its the people!",1679175131,1683825486,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True
961200,130193488,76561198053791716,0,7,15168,0,4031,1698175116,"Fun game, reminds me of Paragon but honestly it's pretty toxic, worse than Paragon on that front already. It's early access and only casual games are available and even now, it's full of toxic people constantly complaining and whining. It pretty much boils down to two outcomes;
1. You win and everyone's all ""GG"" even if you won because the enemy team had a d/c (which happens fairly often). Even won matches despite a toxic teammate at which point they shutup or try to act it's all because of them.

2. However, if you lose or start losing, oh boy prepare for people pointing out any mistakes made or whining without adding any constructive criticism or what we can do better as a team, it's like a bunch of baby manchildren getting together and all crying and blaming each other to which point you get a epiphany in life wondering why you're even playing this game and could be doing something else with your time. It seems MOBA's attract the worst of all people and they're incapable of ever looking at themselves. Combine this with the safety of the internet and u get the cesspool of a playerbase that is called a MOBA. 

A good visual example of a MOBA player is a clip of a person driving into a car with their bike and immediately complaining about what the other person did wrong for a full minute with no retort, only to then realise they drove into an unmanned, parked car on the side as they look around to see if anyone saw them make this mistake. 

tl;dr
Pretty fun game that brings back that Paragon feeling with an expanded item selection but expect the usual toxic MOBA players who need help/friends in their lives and considering the fact that nobody can ever have a 100% winrate, there will always be matches to lose and players will probably get toxic and start complaining with your favorite words such as ""trash"" and ""noob"" along with plenty of spelling errors and lots of caps lock! And remember folks, it's never your fault and always someone else's fault! If there's no one to blame, blame it on the lag! 

Edit: Played it again and community is pretty much still the same, you can disable team chat in options though but muting someone does not mute the built in ""team chat commands"" so people can still spam and ping all over the place. 
Also apparently statwise, Kallari is more durable and stronger than a Steel even at level 1 so lol at that? She literally has more Health and Health Regen and about the same protections and it doesn't get better at max level, she beats him in everything besides a measly 4.7 physical armor. Even same Health as a Sevarog without his passive. Whoever thought of the stat/passive balancing, even compared to Paragon (just look at the old wiki), just wow. You really notice it in solo lane. Might return in the future when characters MAY have actual real stats that make them stand out and to reflect a real ""stat distribution"", otherwise this was my last attempt. Just look up the wiki or practice area and you'll see tons of weird stat distributions that make no sense, like Drongo ending up with more base physical armor naturally than a Steel or a Howitzer being superior as a tank in every single way statwise on top of high native attack speed (on par with carries) and then look at the old Paragon wiki where the stats do make sense in line with their role/lane. Also, having abilities scaling between 200-600% is just ridiculously high. The new hero Kira's ult scales almost 600% and can crit/lifesteal and is basically a Reaper's Ult from Overwatch so also AoE and you can dash during it...

Final edit:
As of right now (10/05/2023), there's about 700+ concurrent players according to Steam and the game has devolved into a cesspool of toxicity with matches being short and more of a ""who will throw/surrender/AFK"" first after a couple mistakes. Almost all of my matches have been either ""we stomp the enemy team"" or ""we get stomped"", there's rarely an in between. it's gotten so bad that this game honestly feels more like a toxic relationship at this point where if you come back, you're making a big mistake and during games, any mistake you make or death/gank that happens, oh boy you're going to hear about it. Constantly have to be walking around carefully to avoid triggering some manchild's rage. None of the issues/balancing stuff i mentioned before have been fixed and it seems like it never will, the game is in a perpetually weird state and the tiny changes they make in patches barely affect anything.

If anything, let your future partner play this game for awhile so you can see what he/she is really like, that's the only positive thing you'll get out of this! Other than that, i see no reason to continue this game as it provides no entertainment or pleasure and considering the concurrent player numbers, it's not like you can ban people and you'll constantly see a lot of the same people. You'll only feel worse after some matches, there's enough negativity in the world already so steer clear from this and go do something that makes you feel happy. Hopefully they refund people like when Paragon went down.",1672929717,1683745371,False,6,0,0.551925539970397949,0,True,False,True

I've never really been a big fan of MOBA's and have only really played League of Legends.

However this game had me hooked from the first match I played, the 3rd person aspect is what made me fall in love with this game and despite being a MOBA I am absolutely addicted. The gameplay is fun and action packed and feels like a mix between a MOBA and a Hero-Shooter. The game also looks fantastic thanks to being in Unreal Engine 5.

Devs are also regularly updating/balancing and adding things to the game and are very engaged with the player base.

The game will be free to play in the future, but I absolutely recommend picking this game up and joining Early Access as there is still an abundant amount of fun to be had here.

The abilty changes and general balance are fine, but every game there is a skinny chick with nice tits and ass who will run around in circles (spam jumping) avoiding all auto attacks unless you are a melee attacker with a horizontal sweep. I say this because they shrunk the map to ant man levels and made movement speed ""flash"" speed, then added some of the later champs to the game of whom are (I feel) money grabs (shinbi, countess, new chikca who i dont know the name of). The game doesnt feel fun if im sweating my dick off JUST to land a single auto, let alone consecutive autos, let alone among-est an army of frame jittering abilities. 

Every team fight is a slide show at some point (even if its a brief slide show its still a slide show), and no Im not on my grandmas fucking pc. There are other things like the item system which is just slot for slot league of legends, yet missing some of the core mechanics of league that make league feel WHOLE. Paragon used to have amber banks you could gain income from and would be vital to contesting space. That is an example of what i call a NTDMM or Non-Team Death Match Mechanic. You could stealth as kallari and steal it all game if you had no value, or stomp your enemy by conquering them on grux or rampage. 

Also i have to coordinate my team like seal team 6 in order to get to the core, even though we have been stomping all game. That one i still dont really understand why, but its fucking HARD to finish out a game, nine times out of ten im just hoping they will ff because its ny impossible to get my team in the core. ESPECIALLY WHEN TEAM CHAT IS DEFAULT OFF. ITS ALMOST LIKE THE GAME PUSHES YOU TO TOXICITY WITH REALLY REALLY AGGRAVATING MECHANICS. I love the soul this game has, but i dont love that the devs aren't listening to that soul and following it. I dont know why everyone thinks this tiny map structure is what paragon is fit to be, but it aint this chief. 


TLDR: If map size and movement speed (and potentially item structure) don't get fundamental changes before the console drop, this will be dead in the water. I refuse to play this with my controller lol.

(Yes this is all out of order and clearly an anger-driven review. I love paragon, and I love this game and its devs. But I in no way shape or form agree with the direction it is taking, as I had high hopes it was staying like this for easy development clarity and would change to some other system in time. But I think I'm on cope-ium)

Its just annoying, 4 out of 5 games there is at least one person who just doesn't do what he is supposed to do (play his role he got in draft) or just griefs the game (toxic behaviour, feeding or refusing to group up)

Pros:
- Fun game(play)
- Fast paced action
- Overall balanced hero lineup and items

Cons:
- Matchmaking is not perfect (solo or small parties can be matched against full parties, which already have 70% or more winrate)
- Community is more toxic than nice (people griefing games, going afk when losing, trying to surrender as soon as possible)
- There is no real/good ""comeback"" mechanic, so if you are losing hard the first 10min - it is really hard to win the game in the end

Wishes:
- Improve matchmaking, i would rather wait longer and have a decent match (the close games i had, are really fun, even if i'm losing)
- More active/activatable items you can build from the shop, just like crests - passives are not fun
- Talents/Modifications for abilities - A choice to alter abilities to help you in certain scenarios (e.g. grux charge: Do i need longer range or longer stun duration?)

Overall it is a nice game, with many frustrating moments (mainly due to the community), but overall i can recommend it, especially if you are able to play the game with friends instead of ""randoms""",1677194386,1683154568,False,0,0,0.524691402912139893,0,True,False,True

For people who actually care about the game's contents: It is a MOBA and you should go into this game expecting the package you'd get from a MOBA title. Personally I don't play MOBAs and this is the first that really made me want to invest time to learn more about the strategies. After the initial learning curve I enjoy the roles a little more each time and so far the balancing measures on part of the developers have been really decent. For veteran MOBA players I think it's also worth pointing out the verticality of the combat in this will add another dimension to combat variety that isn't really seen in most other similar titles.

I have played LoL since 2011 making Plat in 2014 and then being a silver Andy pretty much every season since. I went hard into Overwatch 1 in 2016/17 making it to high gold before coming back to LoL and have dabbled with other MOBAs over the years, but nothing serious. I am an average player with occasional flashes of skill if i apply myself. I never played Paragon. 

First Impressions:
1. I feel like it has taken A LOT of inspiration from LoL (or maybe LoL took alot from paragon idk), which isnt a bad thing, but movement and last hitting did not feel great right off the bat. It took a few games to really adjust. 
2. Ability and basic attack VFX/SFX are lackluster, at no point did a single ability really feel impactful, it was just a case of ""oh the button that does more damage is up, ima press it"" and then you would do more damage.
3. The map is booorrrrring
4. I cant find a game. 1000 players peak on steam, they seem to be from NA through talking in discord. Up to 45mins in que before I quit. Maybe come back when there is a new champ released or something

Conclusion:
It has the potential to be a really good game with a large audience, especially if it brings some version of the traditional MOBA to console. Try it out, the game is still early access, none of the things I said are impossibly hard to overcome, it just needs more polish.

I feel this game is a good remake of Paragon, and a great use of their assets. The graphics are stellar and I am super happy to be able to play the game with my friends. I am hoping that one day this could maybe be a free title, and could even have a larger playerbase to hopefully have more game modes, ranked, and even an Esports league. Below are listed Issues that I see with the game, and pros about the game when compared to other titles. 

Issues ---
1. The loading screen announcer for champ select hurts my ears because of how loud he is, even though i have announcer volume at 3%. I think a settings menu for audio specifically for champion select screen is needed.

2. Lane locator system is a neat little feature, however I believe that it is hard to see when first starting out to the game given all the colors around the map. Perhaps an indicator in the sky would be nice. 

3. Currently I believe that there are to many ""Hunter"" or ""ADC"" style champs within the current version of the game. It does make end game really difficult as the damage has a hard time being blocked in the late game. 

4. Tanks are really really tanky in the early game, and I feel that cant be poked out of lane by ADCs before 16 minutes. I also feel that tanks currently do not have the ability to really survive well against champions who scale hard into the late game such as revenant.

5. Huds are way to large for my personal liking. I think a setting to allow the user to change the size of the ""shop"" or ""store"" when purchasing items should exist, along with options for the user to move the map to the left side of the screen, and map size. 

6. Monsters/Elite Jungle Camps (Baron/Dragons equivalent) should be more tanky. A solo ADC should not be able to solo them. 

7. Screen Tearing has been a thing while in public lobbies, along with packet loss. However server connection is really good when just looking at ping. 

8. Mid lane has 12 areas to gank from, given that players can see champions through walls around the entire map, I think it removes a part of ""get good"" aspects such as, not having good vision, map awareness, and even wave control.

9. Wave management is hard in this game, as the waves will prio you if you do even a pin prick of damage to the enemy laner/or laners. That wave will follow you for half a lane, and they still do a decent bit of damage. It is the same issue if I run into fog of war. Though this means players can pull the waves towards their towers and hold a ""freeze"" and eventually make a ""slow push"" with said freeze by stacking 2 or even 3 waves of minions. 

10. Minion HP is insane! Either make towers do more damage to minions as 3 turret shots on minions to put them into execute range and 4 shots per minion with 6-7 minions per wave is a lot of time where waves are being frozen under that tower. So every wave that crashes and isnt touches by players, is 2 full waves of minions that the enemy can farm for free. I feel that making the minons take more damage so they get executed by the tower on the third hit would help improve laning phases. 

11. Tower damage to players is not high enough as players will walk up and poke under towers because of their short tower radius. They will trade turret agro for a few quick shots on players just to have the upper advantage for the early laning phase. So punish the player for taking tower shots! They hurt late game, why dont they hurt earlly game?

12. Healing is an issue for early game. I so far have not found anything in the jungles to help you heal, get mana, or even provide cover from enemies such as a ""bush"" or ""smoke screen"". These features are in other titles and it changes how the game is played in the ""alcoves"" and the ""jungles"" as it gives more room for error and counter play as players can now escape fights.

Pros ---
1. I think the graphics engine makes this ""Paragon"" rework, look really polished. I think the colors and attention to detail translates well to new players.

2. Though the ""Fog of War"" is very different from other MOBAs, I think the ""ray shield"" look is unique and interesting. 

3. I think the use of wards are going to be very helpful in this game because of the way the map is built with rotation holes, elevations, and fog of war.

4. I like some of the unique itemization, and that the store does have a recommended items feature. 

Summary ---

I think at this given state the game is fun, given the playerbase that they have currently I am not shocked by haveing 8-15 minute long queue times for games at night. But with the game being in early access with assets from another title, I feel that the game is in at least an okay state. The graphics look great, the audio is clean, though it can use some tuning in some places. Bugs do exist but what title doesnt have bugs? I am excited to see this fully release to steam as its own supported game. And maybe even one day see this title and this game grow to be something larger with options such as crossplay, or even having the ability to play on another server such as EUW, KR, OCE, etc. The game brings many interesting aspects to a title that was already fun known as ""Paragon"", But they have made the title more... unique with the itemization, menus, and potentially more characters coming soon.

I liked it so far. Everything seems to be bug-free and working flawlessly. The same great experience of the original Paragon I remember. Good job.

A bit of context (as it seems that a lot of Overprime fans are leaving negative reviews).

I've been playing the original Paragon from the very beginning, when they still had placeholders for everything :-) I stopped playing Paragon shortly after Shinbi hero was announced - I strongly felt, that Paragon steered into Asian market, which contradicted the initial vision and my personal tastes. So I stopped playing. Then it got closed.

Eventually, when Predecessor and Overprime were announced - I started to follow both projects. Unfortunately, it became clear that Overprime is moving the same exact direction as the original Paragon during its' end times - orienting strongly towards Asian market (which is no surprise, given that it's being made by Korean developers). Tbc, I don't think that is bad - it's just not exactly for my taste, I prefer more ""realistic"" approach towards character design, with warriors being warriors, not k-pop stars =)
Anyway, Predecessor atm seems like a perfect match for me, in it's concept it's exactly as Paragon should've been originally - with consistent character roster and visuals. I've spent in the game about 20-30 minutes so far, and I liked everything I saw, I'm not even sure what's new and what came from the original Paragon. I'll spend some more time in the game, meanwhile I feel like supporting this game and devs. I may correct my review as I go =)

P.S. Devs if youre reading this - please dont add that weird characters, which were added to the original Paragon +- after Serath - Aurora, Shinbi, Countess, Yin, Phase, Zinx, Terra and so on, they are weird, rushed in (due to a ""hero every 3 weeks"" policy) and they seemed absolutely out of place in the original Paragon",1669933348,1681509879,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its pretty bare-bones right now, so its difficult to quickly understand what everything means exactly.

I could use the recommended/auto-bought items to help understand what kind of items my hero should typically build.
There is indeed long queue times, largely due to people not accepting the matches when they are ready. Combine that with  PvP matches taking a long time (they usually took 40ish minutes), and good luck trying to see if you like this game enough within 2 hours.
Also, bots can show up in PvP matches, had a game where my team had 2 bots while the enemy had none :D We lost hard
PvE matches don't take that long (and they have a queue time of about 3 seconds since its just you and bots), I was able to do 3 PvE matches in about an hour. I did 2 PvP matches before I noticed I was well over the max refund time of 2 hours, so I continued playing until I got fed up with being confused the entire game about what's happening (what's a Fangtooth?).

I'll probably keep trying to give this game a chance in the future since I'm stuck with it now and will update this accordingly, but for now, it's best to get if you already know how Paragon played, or can easily spare the $20",1681419857,1681419857,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Paragon arrives and finally fulfilled the promise of FULL 3d movement inside if a moba, verticality to the max even.... we enjoyed this for years, then.. all if a sudden one day, it shut its doors and all the hard work and dedication we put into the game was gone, forever. 

Many companies have tried to recapture the spirit of that game. I've played Overprime, I played Fault (before they too disappeared.) and enjoyed myself but... it wasn't paragon, it didn't FEEL like Paragon (even if OP has the rights to the name, I'll never call it Paragon.

It was fun.. but it never truly worked) carries feel like carries with the massive damage from auto attacks they can dish out, casters feel powerful with their abilities and offlaners and tanks feel sturdy with the correct amount of health and CC. I encourage you, if you're on the fence because of what happened to Paragon, give this dev team a chance. They have proven they can dish out the content on a consistent basis, they've proved they know how to listen to the community when theirs a problem and are quick to fix it. The game plays good, it looks good, it's fun to party up with others (of course) and also even fun to play alone (there's not TOO many toxic people) so would I recommend this game?

Average match times are a little shorter than Paragon and LoL matches, and at least half the time of DOTA2 matches.

The developers come out with regular updates bi-weekly with new Heroes releases once a month. There is a Season every 3 months where level progression and rewards is reset.

I think its definitely sad to see a game with a tonne of free assets be sold off in a strange tactic that is a bundle of $5 game price and $15 DLC so that if people want to try the game they can only get 1/4 of the money back... again, really strange because I used to play Paragon and a LOT of the assets are the *free* Epic Games assets that the developers could get for *free* and that players previously would get for *free* in game via loot boxes so now selling that back to players is really odd to me.

Its a fun game, its a dated map everyone knows this. It's been a full season and we've not seen any changes to the map bar a fangtooth upgrade... which was needed... but the map itself is the same and its actually lost a lot of the verticality the old Paragon map had which is a shame. 

I bought Pred day one, as I prefer the true to vision style of this vs something like overprime but I feel like the absence of ranked or more focused match making is hurting the game a bit. There's little punishment for people who AFK / throw and I feel like at least 20-30% of my games are just people in bad moods or people who are new so i have to sit there for 30-40 minutes watching a loss happen no matter how well I play.

On top of that, I think the biggest thing no one seems to talk about is the odd patching of characters in batches that will just pendulum swing a meta towards the way the devs want. We had a mage patch a while back that just pulled all the tank items off of them and boosted magic power so then mages ran like crazy. Now we have a carry patch where all the carries crit items have gone obscene so you play a game with a carry character in 3-4 roles and thats just the ""meta"" until the devs will do their next focus on something like tanks or support. Its frustrating because it feels shortsighted just focusing on one role type every big patch with then another mini patch where they slightly nerf the characters with comments like ""X hero been doing too well recently"" or ""X character has seen a little too much play recently"" well ... yes if you boost their stats and items in one patch and leave them alone for two weeks that would happen.

I think balancing a game must be hard and I don't envy the developers but I can't help but feel that just boosting one group of characters overall strength (with a slight nerf two weeks later) so that that group (carry, tank, mage, support etc) feel busted is just going to be a never ending mouse chase of ""what role should I play this week, not because I'm good at the role but because I know its the viable option right now"". 

Also on technicals... obviously an Early Access game so fine to have bugs but at the end of the day the developers are charging for the game... I've had two games in the past two weeks where 30 mins in the games have just sent me back to the loading screen, no way to get back into the game I was in and no way to check if I won or lost?????

I switched to league when it was in beta and super dope, and left around season 5.5 when it started  growing more and more corporate, increasing shady practices many with bad gameplay in balancing decisions. I came to paragon and eventually predecessor. It has good gameplay from the the best of paragon days but has a few issues.

One if the player  base. There's simply not enough players right now to make this game succeed the way it needs to  for a moba. It's in early access but you have to ask yourself a few things. Do you have faith this game will grow in popularity? Will it get necessary balance patches and updates/new champions/etc to succeed?

Sadly as much as I enjoy playing this game I don't think it's going to draw in enough new players unless the company gets a big budget, a large amount of updates, and a success for grand launch to draw in enough new players they won't be soon bottlenecked into the old hardcore paragon community that exists in this game, but has an extreme with a low volume, high que times, competitve mentality, with only a qm  available. They seem small but are quite essential for moba.

New players are competing with a lot of old vets. Alot of rank seekers are extremely toxic, which draws away new players and people trying new things, but also a range in skill level individual and group based  leading to big snowballs. Which in domino effect makes hard to have accurate stats to balance games etc.

The progression is pretty dismal to new players as well, cosmetics in a game most people have never heard about or play, in a sea of big launches this year, in highly saturated genre, with few progression options, high cosmetic costs, and even a base price for a game alot of new players feel should be free. Maybe it's a genius idea to draw in as much money for some marketing and budget that will help this game grow but I fear it's more likely not going to be used efficiency while starting a distrust with their audience, many of whom already are resistant to pay  for the base game (which I don't personally think is too big of a deal, and I paid 120 for the founders pack in paragon in order to support the developers, but felt they were much open about packs and giving donations for game production. I also feel their shop was a bit more generous and well thought out)


The other thing is que timews are 6min  plus alot of the time and still matchmaking is not super great. Hopefully the publishers make some good decisions to draw in more players but right now it seems unlikely the game will grow enough to start having consistant matches. A part of me wonders if it will reach out of early access.

Stick with the competitor: Paragon: Overprime, as it is simply a far more polished product. 

There is no elo matchmaking, so you are paired with complete random people. You'll be on a team with a person who has 0 matches played and someone else who has 1,000, so there is seldom any teamwork as at least one teammate is always trying to figure out which button even attacks.

There is no punishment for AFK, disconnecting, trolling, feeding, etc. 
You can disconnect immediately and have zero penalty. You cannot surrender until 10 minutes into the game, however. In 4 of my last 5 matches we had a teammate disconnect within the first 5 minutes. 

You also cannot report anyone after the game. This means you can only report someone mid-game, by stopping play, and entering another screen to write the report. Bizarre.

 (TO READ OLD REVIEW GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS ONE) 


The game is still going  strong. New characters play just like how they used to play back in the og paragon. 
Especially Shinbi. I was blown away by how smooth her gameplay is, it feels the exact same if not better than og Paragon.
 I´m saying this because all of the other paragon remakes would make every character somewhat smooth but never with Shinbi.

Balance Patches are really frequent happening twice per month on average, aside from New character patch. 
Hotfixes happen almost inmediately after a new patch is released (normally being the new character one).
On the Shinbi release update (Ver 0.4) they finally introduced two of the most requested things:
SOLO VS AI 
AND THE STORE with 12 skins (1 of them being original from omeda studios)

The balance is getting a bit more fair each patch, both on characters and items. It´s somehow now well-known that every new character has a really strong debut. (Happened with every single one, deff happening to Shinbi).

Devs are not the best Communicating, but they always let us know whats coming in the future.

Patch notes never dissapoint. They´re always packed with a lot of changes aside from balance and new characters. You always get filled for the entire month until next patch.

Controller support has been getting better. They´re slowly assigning each action to a button just like in og paragon. Way better than having to move the cursor all over the screen. They Really need to add an option to disable aim assist on controller. It messes up with lock-in skills and proyectile-based ones, it makes the camera flinch, completely messing up your shot and making you look in a complete different direction. (This is the most visible on Countess´ E and Shinbi´s Q).

Post match screen added. They still need to show items. But they show every single other possible stat of the game (dmg dealt, gold earned, kda, just to name a few).

I hope i can update this in the future in a few months aswell. For now everything is going great. 




------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW------------------------------------------------------



DISCLAIMER: This review is written by an og paragon player, after being done playing 5 pvp games and trying out controller support, i think i can do this, (this is my first review so expect some potencial biased stuff).

Also im not comparing to Overprime, grow up already.

Let's start by the graphics. Beautiful. And surprisingly well optimized, im playing on a gtx 1650ti, intel core i5, playing on high settings and never noticed stutters or fps drops. UE5 really makes this product shine. Im playing on 60 fps because i have a 60hz monitor and screen tearing is quite the deal here, so i had to cap my fps.
The problem with this is that i recommend setting effect details to medium or low, because it can get quite flashy in teamfights.

Gameplay- Surprisingly smooth, it really captures the original essence of Paragon post-Agora, There are still some aspects that need to be polished, like hitbox on minions and problems with hit reg when you´re attacking multiple minions (especially as a melee character). 

Ranged characters have their basic attack proyectiles too thin, this means that it´ll go between waves of minions to hit where you´re exactly aiming at. Call it skill issue, but i lost some potencial gold from last hit on minions until i had to figure it out.   
Melee characters basic attacks need to deal more damage to the objectives they´re not directly hitting, but close enough to be within range. It's kind of a pain in the ass trying to clear a wave of minions because your damage doesnt really affect to a significant level the horde around you. 

Controller support
As a former ps4 player, you know i had to try the controller support on this game, for the most part it works fine, but because they have new systems like the ping one, it can get quite overwhelming, so i hope they add custom binds.
Also, i tried to figure this one out, but it seems that when you´re playing on controller (ps4), it only shows the xbox display, despite that i went to configuration and changed the display to show the ps4 one. But this doesn´t affect gameplay at all.

(Also, idk if i´m stupid, but i couldn´t figure out how to open and make the quick notification system work, i had to use my keyboard and mouse for that).

Balance- At the time i´m writing this review, the balance seems fair for the most part, the most powerful characters right now are the tanks. Meaning they can get away with multiple kills while being really low on hp. 

Going over the minions. They are really tanky but somehow they become extremely squishy when inside a turret. Meaning that you cant really let their hp be drained for you to take the last hit to get gold. Even the ´´tank´´ minion gets half its hp drained with a single turret shot. So you have no option but to damage the minions yourself praying that the turret doesn´t steal them from you.
For the turrets themselves, they are really low hp. The damage towards the characters its fine for the most part. But it only takes you 5 minions and 10 seconds to drain a full hp turret to 50% hp, this happends when you enter mid-game. So you can imagine how easy it is to drain a full hp turret on the late-game. Needs some adjustments there. 
You can win a pretty good amount of xp by just doing jungle and clearing waves, so you don´t feel pressured to rush and aid your team to get kills (I´M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT HELP THOUGH). 

Current general problems. (Monetization related stuff is confirmed to be addressed after EA is over)

Character Roster is really small. For the most part, it lacks assassins and supports (i´m being biased here don´t take my full word for it), of course they will add more characters in the future, but according to their workflow it would take a whole year till the roster would grow up to be more flexible with gameplay options. (Shinbi when) 

No store.

No skins aside from the bundle ones. Devs already adressed this on their yt channel, but it feels pointless to just have 600 coins sitting there, not being able to use them till this game is out of early access, and that will be until this game is out of EA, which will be in 6 to 12 months, so we´re for a long ride.

No co-op vs AI This one is a MUST HAVE, there has been a several amount of players, both allies and enemies that don´t even know how to use their characters because there was no tutorial beforehand. And training mode is optional. So of couse they will skip it who cares.

No report system, only thing that you can do is mute players.

Current training mode is really bland, it lacks as you can´t do anything else than just leveling up and upgrade gold, there´s jungle enemies but what´s the point if you dont have anything to try their buffs on aside from minions, there´s an enemy npc but you cant even configure it to attack you, it just stands there and it has automatic health and mana regen, so you cant really make an idea of how much damage you´re making there it would be good to introduce a dps meter of sorts. 
Also, you can´t Change characters inside training mode, you must go out to the lobby and enter again.

Conclusion: 8/10
Game is really focusing the most in gameplay, again, this is an EA so there will be QoL changes and balance updates. If you want to spend money here, it´ll be only throught the bundles. I´ll be sticking around with this game for a while and try it out further. It´s a really good remake of the og paragon.

As a MOBA the gameplay is smooth, things seem balanced, and I have yet to have a game where I felt like all was lost early on - and am often presented with situations to bring a game back.

Performance-wise the game runs great, I don't have a super-powered rig (RTX 2070, i7-9700K, 64gb ram), and it runs like a dream on max settings through Proton (Manjaro, Kernel 5.15.93-1, KDE Plasma, X11). I don't believe I have had any stutters or noticeable framerate drops while playing, even in 5v5 teamfights.

I contributed to a social poll they did just the other month, where they let the community vote on the next returning character after those they already have planned, and I have to say that it really showed how much they care about what we have to say.

Update - 2/20

Bonus addition to this update, Dev does put out consistent updates and balancing to the game. Sometimes they do miss on over tuning characters but are adjust after. So far they haven't nerfed any champs into oblivion. New Champs once a month so far.

Once you close the game, there will be a sneaky process still running on windows which will make steam say the game is still running- even when you've closed the game.  Plan on steam support acting like you've been playing the game all day and night while the process was still running. Steam support will give you a canned response that you have played too many hours to refund. 

Whole thing is a scam.  No one liked Paragon, no one likes predecessor.  The positive reviews are all fake.  Read the negative reviews on the DLC packges.  It's all just a shady scam.

UPDATE:
Best option is to dispute it as a scam with your credit card company. 

Steam support tells me that it is not an ""appropriate"" way to get a refund, but the DLC scam is obviously not an appropriate way to keep a payment from being refundable from $hitty developers either.

When they announced they were making the assets available to use that gave me hope I'd be able to play again one day. Well, Predecessor has fulfilled that hope. It truly does look and feel like the original. If not better.

They've recreated my favorite Heroes almost perfectly. Everything feels familiar from the movement, to the abilities, and the combat.

Positives:

- Nice graphics
- 3rd person moba
- Only a few bugs I've seen so far.

Negatives:

- Terrible ping system
- No ranked play which turns into people who have never played a moba vs people who have played 10k hours of a moba.
- No store active
- 2k player population on steam
- Overly simplistic
- No voice comms, next to impossible to create plays in the game.  
- It is a moba that you have to pay 20$ for. The best MOBA's are League,DOTA, and Smite .... which are all free. This game offers NOTHING that is worth 20$ over those games unfortunately. Stick with the classics.
- They game will stay on even though you exit through menus/alt +f4 the process continues running. This is especially annoying as their ""anti-cheat"" is also running which stops any other games using anti-cheat from running.",1673919742,1675645783,False,1,1,0.480198711156845093,0,True,False,True

Skill casting and aiming with controller or mkb is as smooth as butter, however casting aoe ranged skill in tight spaces can be a bit messy and should/could be improved I think.

Surprisingly the champs are mostly balanced and they all bring something different to their teams, although ranged casters and the adcs are all two similar both in gameplay loop and builds they can run, with exception of Revenant and Fey which have more unique kits.

Population is pretty low and the level of the players is all over the place: you'll find paragon veterans and total newbies that have never even played a MOBA before. This can be an issue as games can be a complete steamroll a lot of times.
This will be eventually fixed when more people come in when the game is F2P and new players will have had time to learn the heroes and the gameplay loop.

Map objectives need some work as they are either a bit pointless (Raptor, never felt any difference in power between a team who took all of them and one who didn't) or too hard/risky to contest early on (blue and red buff are waaay deep in the enemy jungle and very close the t3 towers).

After a few hours and being a MOBA noob I can say this is lots of fun!

It is very different from other MOBA's that I have played, especially SMITE. 

The Good:
The gameplay core itself is very fun and satisfying. Hits have good feedback and things feel visceral
The items seem influential and learning them feels rewarding.
SBMM seems fair and not too hardcore.

The Cons So Far:
Too much audio feedback. The map tells you verbally everything that is going on and it gets kind of annoying.
UI could use some work. 
Queuing should include your preferred role before loading into the lobby

For what Predecessor offers. This game is nostalgic to the original Paragon but with it's own modified map and the Heros are slightly altered for balancing issues. While the game is still a work in progress, I am humbled to be part of the EA group of players that gets to experience this master piece. 

Others may say, ""Hey why not go play Overprime and it's free"" Well my reasoning for that is that I play on NA West servers and it is near impossible to find a match on NA West server of Overprime. You will get 30+ minute queue times, nobody on West is playing Overprime right now. Which is a concern considering that it is free right now. However, when playing on Predecessor between 12pm-5am NA West, the queue times are usually about 1-2 minute queue times. That is really decent for the playerbase count that we currently have now.

Non Peak times is about 5-10 minute queue times if anyone is queuing at those times. Someone the other day said ""Mobas are just dying"" I don't personally think that is the case. There is 8 billion people in the world and only growing, so the potential of video gamers we have as time goes on just goes up and up with the amount of population and technology advances. Predecessor doesn't take much to run.

- Built in slot for wards and blink
- No P2W

- Some Paragon heroes reworked or adjusted where it was necessary

Picked it up after a recommendation from a friend, and have been having a hard time putting it down. Fans of MOBAs should feel right at home. Being an early access game, I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality! The game runs perfectly smooth, for me, and I have had no real issues with playability. Playing on NAW servers,(where I'm located,) the highest ping I have experienced was ~20, while NAE is still very playable at ~70-80. Another really great thing that makes me hopeful for a healthy future of Predecessor is the Dev team. They seem to be very on top of things, and have been very communicative with the community, which is always great to see. There are only a few issues, in my opinion, but they are all fairly minor. The roster is currently at ~20 heroes, so you do run into mirror matchups pretty frequently, right now. Now, with the EA came an EA roadmap from the team that shows a new hero coming every month,(at least through March.) So, over time this will be less and less of an issue. Another issue that I have is the lack of progression, currently. I'm certain the Predecessor team has 7 billion other things that they are hard at work on, but there is currently no real in game progression, aside from player level. Other games have mastery skins,(which the team has said they are working on,) or achievement-like systems to keep you working towards something + keep you playing..

I played Paragon quite a bit back in the day so I was excited to see that it's been remade so I picked this up straight away.

I really tried to like this game but unfortunately, I just didn't have fun, every single match was a complete stomp one way or the other, this is due to levels mattering a lot in this game, I reckon even more than dota 2, died twice in mid lane? You're gona get one shot non stop, died once to enemy jungler? You're screwed.

There were barely any team fights, in fact, I can't remember any at all, most fights are segregated between 3-4 players and then all one team surrenders 20 minutes into the game, I can't remember a single game lasting more than 30 minutes, it's either 20-3 or 15-1, then the losing team surrenders.

I found the community to be pretty toxic and elitist, this goes for most MOBA's but there was something particular about this one to me, like a real ""Die hard"" culture, it might also be the fact that I kept playing with the same players since I am in Australia and there isn't too many of us. I feel like tagging roles with things like ""EXPERT"" adds to the toxicity because when someone does poorly in an ""ADVANCED"" or ""EXPERT"" role, everyone flames them and tells them to stick to the noob roles, bad idea, not a very psychologically aware design.

Barely ever get the role I want with the current system.

Now all of this, isn't really a show stopper for me.

What really killed it for me is the very ""dead"" or ""soulless"" feeling I got while playing this game, I think it has to do with the current audio design and particle effects / animations, hopefully this is just an early access thing but it seems to just plague the game, I feel like I'm controlling a weightless, soulless, clunky, slow, immobile, quiet, default asset from unreal, it's like these models were just stuck onto a capsule collider or something.

It doesn't help that there is no invigorating music or anything, there is just no tone to anything, every kill feels lackluster and every death feels random, like I didn't really get hit by anything big, I just randomly died.

Now I respect that this tries to stay true to Paragon but here's the kicker, I played Paragon Overprime afterwards and it just seems to have innovated a lot more.

Overprime overall seems to be much more polished, graphics, audio, innovative map, interesting items.

First game of Overprime, I had multiple team fights, the game was even and went for 40minutes, no one surrendered, I played Wukong which is basically like Phantom Lancer from dota 2, he spoke or made a sound every time I moved, attacked, used a skill or got hit.

I want both games to succeed, but I found it difficult to have fun in this game in it's current state, Overprime is more fleshed out in pretty much every aspect... audio, graphics, hero design, item design, UI. - Not to mention it has competitive mode and is much more balanced, I also don't understand how this is $30 and Overprime is free, Overprime 100% has more work put into it at the time of me writing this, it's clear. 

Honestly, I think both games are going to be worth more than $30, but the whole early access thing is getting old.

TLDR : Overprime has much more work put into it right now and it's free.

Out of 5 stars, you get to rank the enjoyment of the match, the fairness, and the time to find the game. Every single game without fail without even thinking about it twice, I have hit 1-3 stars for enjoyment, and 1 star for fairness. Usually I give 4-5 for search time. I feel it necessary to explain why, so I might save people who are interested in the game who can just wait till it's free some money. Having played over 4k hours in Dota 2, and 3k hours in League of legends, I feel I also have a good idea about what contributes towards a matches quality in a MOBA, which I feel is definitely a major metric in measuring the playability and long term entertainment of a game like Predesessor. 

This game is not going to be fun if you want a consistent Moba experience. This is because of the stage of development the game is in. Generally, I would love to see more people pick this game up, however, for now, if you are not interested in the game as a project (if you played paragon for example) then do not bother picking it up. Stick to your Dota 2 and league for now until the game comes out fully and for free. You will have more consistent fun, and a generally higher quality match (Which is what I want at least if I am going to be spending 20-40 mins in a game). 

I personally love the gameplay and mechanics. The characters are cool, I love the map and the items are fun. However, Every match has a hardcore moba player who has his/her main character mastered, and then their is also the exact opposite. Every single game has at least one person going 0/15, and someone going 25/1. You can see a match come to this state in as little as 15 minutes sometimes, but then the game will carry on till 40-50  minutes total... This dynamic is incredibly boring and is purely because the game doesn't have much in the way of smoothing out the learning curve for new players or a ranked mode for players wanting to have more challenging games with worthy rivals. This will be, and has already been started getting developed on, and when it is finished I expect this issue should be entirely solved.

After my a few hundred hours of this game, which I don't regret as I have been hyped for years to play it, I might put it down until a few more patches are out.  or maybe until it is fully released and the player base is larger allowing an incentive for the developer to release ranked search. Until then, I think I will stick to Mobas that have ranked systems that for the most part work allowing for a consistent and fun tactical experience, not a blood bath where the win condition is ""who has the newest player"".

This is a very good start for predecessor. The devs are focus on the right thing like the gameplay. The gameplay is very good and feels good.

Edit after 100 hours:

Predecessor is still a good game. We get every two weeks new content like a new hero oder Qol changes + hero/item balancing. The devs are transparent and the discord is very good for informations and to learn the game. there a still a lack of content like no ranked, tutorial, coop vs AI or a shop.

I have played 200 hours of this game: these are my remarks.

- fun gameplay, game runs smoothly and the characters are well rounded
- 3the person gameplay, makes the gameplay more immersive. you are one with your champion
- Strategic part of the moba is on point. Not just brawling.
- the pace of the game isn't super fast. you have an early game that last around 7 min until you get your ultimate ability.
- Omeda studio's love the game. this is an ideal team to build this game out to a big moba
- the game isn't out yet. if you are doubtful you can still wait until launch, then it will be free.
- console will  be supported (cross platform)

Epic games were generous enough to put their game assets for free so other game developers can hopefully recreate what Epic couldn't continue with. 
There are two main competitors at the moment of writing this. Predecessor and Paragon:the Overprime. I can't comment on Overprime since I haven't played it. However, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on Predecessor. 
This game is pretty hard to play at first with learning all the characters and then having to manage Mana and HP. Then there's lanes to learn on top of all the buffs and items to learn what they do. It can be very overwhelming, especially if you've never played a MOBA before (Like me) Once you've gotten past the learning curve the game and be incredibly fun and addictive. At the moment of this review, there's not a lot to grind towards but they are planning on adding a skins, character profiles etc. So it is a little bare bones at the moment, but you'll probably have a lot to learn anyway. 
The graphics look great and the game does run smoothly even in team fights. However, you can drop some frames when there's a lot of particle effects on high graphics but it usually doesn't impact your gameplay. I've encountered minimal bugs which is always a good thing, but nothing game breaking. From what I've played, there are a few hero's that are stronger than others but I can see them buffing and nerfing heroes when they need to. The game has been out a little over a month and they have updated the game a few times and they plan on updating it every 2 weeks which is great to see. 
This game is great and can totally see this game being one of my mains ones to play and grind through. If you like MOBA's or want to try getting into one, this is a great first choice.

While I think it sucks that this game is getting negative reviews not based off gameplay or performance but on refunding, It definitely deserves that bashing. They should AT LEAST make it clear, and AT BEST return the full $20.
If the refund thing doesn't bother you, there aren't really many other complaints from me.

I'm really sorry to all those Paragon fans but this game is not good, not as a MOBA not as a game in general. I have tons of hours in League of Legends and reached high ranks there, studied the game etc.. so i know what a good MOBA needs.
Runs really bad with constant fps drops and small freezes even on a good pc and sometimes (unless im crazy) doesnt even register damages, melees in particular.
As a MOBA in general is really unbalanced and some things, like creeps changing aggro on a minion wave far away even if you're in front of them, are not fixed yet.
I would be here writing for a long time but i just wanted to bring in the review session some reality cause i only saw good reviews or bad reviews just because the games are surrendered too fast (which is not true btw) or because it costs too much.

It feels just like a MOBA and has plenty of in game mechanics that allow you to feel as if you aren't just wasting your time by playing it out.

The gameplay is amazing and fluid. That being said there are some things that I say could be a bit better in the game.

PROS
-Very smooth gameplay
-good graphic
-hero ability/passive are pretty good (rework and original)
-planning on releasing a hero every month
-Roadmap of the game is very promising
-matchmaking is fast for my region (NA EAST)

CONS
-need more hero (obviously more is better)
-you have to pay to get in early access, but its gonna be free to play on full release(see roadmap for full release)
-Toxicity (its a moba, people are toxic what i can say... Like they say ""always blame others for your mistake""
-Could be optimise better

There are obviously more PROS and CONS but that is what I was able to put up together in a minute.

I would advise anyone that wants to try out the game to take their attention else where. I've purchased this game in order to test it out as it seemed interesting. Unfortunately, I was having game play issues among many other things within the game. Therefore, I attempted to refund the game, which I was able to achieve. This where my issue comes in, the bulk of the purchase is this so called ""DLC"" that doesn't actually include any extra content for the user to consume. But due to this ""DLC"" label, it comes along with this ""token"" tag, which makes the bundle non-refundable. My issue here, is the false pretense under this purchase. I would have expected at the very least CONSUMABLE content within the game to warrant the ""DLC bundle"" a ""token"" classifier. Yet there is nothing of the sort, all the DLC does is give you access to the main game.

Tried many others, but few clicked as well as Paragon, mostly due to the superb 3rd person action gameplay. Shame the old Paragon got left behind, but it's amazing that the devs released all of the assets for the game FOR FREE for anyone to just make their own Paragon.

For many years I sought refuge in dota, getting almost 4 thousand hours in it. It was the closest thing I had to Paragon in terms of gameplay. But years later, we've got two powerful rivals, Predecessor and Overprime. Both wanting to be the Paragon there never was. Though out of the two, I see Predecessor as the true successor. Focusing on gameplay over monetary value. Everything they've produced so far has been above pristine, and I foresee them making an absolute wonder of game design. Not to say Overprime hasn't a chance, they too have amazing gameplay, only real problems being questionable game design (many Item and hero kits), and frequent bugs. However, I haven't played much of it so I can't say for sure.

Only problems Predecessor has currently, are a lacking hero pool, Fangtooth buff being too strong, some hero kits being overtuned (Crunch dealing massive damage with spammable abilities casting very little mana as an example), and difficulty introducing new players to the game.

HOWEVER, many of these complaints are planned to be address later down the line, and the game's fairly fine as is.

Some of us were good, some bad, and one of us was a god, but we all had fun. The day they closed it down was a sad day indeed. I have tried all the knock-offs and none of them have scratched that itch again since Predecessor. We have stayed up until 2 am for the last few nights playing together again, me and two of my boys on the East Coast, the other in Alaska, and are loving it.

On to the game itself. Very smooth. I've only seen one glitch where we loaded into the character select screen and it didn't load properly. Othe than that, the game runs smooth as silk. I mainly play Support but I have played many of the other roles. They seem pretty well balanced across the board. If my oldest son is playing, well, he makes any character seem unbalanced.........

I bought the legendary pack because I have disposable income and I wanted to support a studio that I think can do this game justice. Personally, I think this game is worth dropping some money on and being patient as they provide us with a quality experience rather than a cash shop, TDM game in a Paragon skin.

You can play for 1000 hours and still get matched with a brand new player that doesn't communicate. We call them ""bots"" because it's exactly what they act like. They spawn, run to lane, shoot, and die. If you know anything about MOBAs, feeding an enemy player gives them a huge advantage. This isn't COD and it ruins the experience. It's a waste of time. So not only are you paying money to test their game, but you are also paying to be a teacher and waste your time with new players that aren't willing to learn. There's zero content outside of the core game.  1 map, 1 game mode, and a handful of heroes. No match history and the after battle report is thin to say the least. No hero progression or battle pass. Just a play button and an archaic and counter-intuitive friend system.

Cons
-All the characters' abilites have at least a paragraph associated with them.
-Jungle buffs are all exactly the same as LoL, structure of jungle is even VERY similar
-Feels like Smite with a different engine and vibe
-Verticality in a game like this is a big no for me. Theres already cooldowns, aiming autos, knowing what all the abilities do, paying attention to the minimap and multiple enemies. The last thing I want is to have to flick my mouse up as well to add the already disorientating amount of particle effects. 
-Doesnt require new players to play a tutorial
-Confusing UI bar, tooltips are not the easiest to access.
-Plays like a cheap korean space knock off of smite.

Omeda Studios has a clear goal to bring back the beloved game from the past that had attempted to redefine the MOBA genre. Sure, the price tag is questionable, considering this is a competitive game that seeks to find its spot next to the other Esports titles, like League of Legends, but I'll tell you what: when you purchase even just the $20 bundle, you get some microtransaction currency and a skin, so the devs are giving you more than just the base game for the lowest cost. Sure, they could have simply sold the game at an even lower cost or made it free to play, but they need the capital to push the game through Early Access, so right now they seem to be primarily focused on raising money rather than making the game more available for more people. I hope the game is successful enough in these early stages so they can move toward a stronger marketing campaign and free to play.

Now for the gameplay. Predecessor's biggest strength is the polish of its mechanics. You will not see the same level of quality of action combat in Paragon: The Overprime as you will in this game. I am not kidding when I say that the gameplay is even better than Smite's, which to be fair, is a small bar to beat anyway. However, considering that Smite has established itself already, it is worth mentioning the immense difference in the effort put into this game compared to Smite. This game makes Smite look even more like a kid's game than it already does. The abilities and basic attacks are so satisfying to hit, and the physics and movement is so buttery smooth that you forget this game is made by an indie team. This is critical for an action combat-focused MOBA where the feel of the gameplay is the most important piece, and this game does not disappoint in that regard. The sound design complements this well with bass-ey and chunky audio effects. On a different note, the map design and item system offer plentiful opportunities for creative strategy, with the map having thoughtful pacing and placement of jungle camps and versatile pathways, and the item system having unique effects that can give you the advantage in a variety of situations.

With how early this game is in development, I do not have much to critique that cannot be easily changed in the future. The game has an incredibly strong foundation, minus some extra features, such as fun and interesting voice lines, a good soundtrack, or a more presentable UI. Like I said though, these are just the fleshy bits that can be added to the bones of the game at a later date. Keep in mind that while other early access titles are shoving skins down your throat, hoping to suck every dollar out of your wallet, this game doesn't even have a shop yet, and they still give you some microtransaction currency to be spent later when skins start making their way into the game. This is a good sign, since it means that the developers are prioritizing the quality of the game over tempting you with flashy and shallow cash-grabbing efforts. This is supported with frequent balance changes and a commitment to release a new character every month. Even further, they are rewarding players with skins and microtransaction currency at the end of the season for just playing the game and earning player levels. Based on the quality of the product, I can tell Omeda Studios takes their game seriously, and I only hope that they leave their mark on the MOBA genre and reach heights that Paragon never could.",1673593687,1673593687,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

See because the game is extremely bare bones and just concept looking in almost every way they can get away with it. 
The only way to issue a report on someone is to stop playing mid game and report them by clicking the report icon on the score tab next to their name. You can not issue a report on the post game screen because it súcks. The way people are taking advantage of this is they are only sort of toxic during the game before getting really vile just before the end of the game because they know that you don't have time to report them. 
See if I was over there at Omeda Studios I'd suggest a proper post game screen sooner rather than later so that players can issue proper reports because it certainly won't help the game's appeal that a majority of the playerbase are toxic shíts. 

As for the gameplay itself it's okay. Balance is as expected a bit fúcked and there really isn't much to play at the moment.

""Fault"" died, ""Overprime"" is struggling and Predecessor would need to do much better than those to make it and at the moment it's all just kind of meh. The game will not survive on the small number of extremely passionate Paragon fans who desperately want it back and for someone completely new the product as it stands is extremely unappealing.
If I had to put money on it i'd say we will see Paragon die for good this time. 

I will keep playing and half áss my way to level 40 just in case it by some miracle doesn't die (so that I get the early access rewards), that's why I will end up having more hours than at review time.
Why half áss you say? Because the majority of the time you are playing with toxic shíts and getting stomped by premades anyway.

Also, both Overprime and Predecessor have a ton of deluded fans who defend every piece of critique of the game. Warranted or not they don't care, they will come at you for it. So just keep that in mind. The only thing they like is if you bash one game to the other.

Plenty of games have you pay for a Kickstarter to get special early access that other people won't receive. At least it's an option here for anyone.

Well they released all of the assets to let people do whatever with them and people instantly got to work bringing the game back from the dead. Several years later and after the sad death of Fault we've got Predecessor and Overprime. Both do something different but I play Pred primarily because they have controller support. I suck with K&M with competitive games so it was the only realistic choice I could make. It feels like it's closer to Monolith Paragon if you remember what that felt like, so a bit of a smaller map but still great to move around in. There's only a handful of the old heroes in at this point but every MOBA role has at least 5 that you should be able to pick so you should be able to find a role and heroes for your preferred tastes. The game is obviously in early development still and has A LOT of stuff they need to add but I racked up around 35 hours in a few weeks just off the sheer fun I am having with the game right now. I wish they had left the bundles at the prices they were at because atm I am having a difficult time getting people to give the game a chance.

2. graphics look amazing even while running it on the lowest setting 10/10.
3. balance does need some tweaking but to be fair way more balanced then paragon ever was 7/10.
4. item system is good but very basic and not enough variations or active items also you cannot build and save decks which is annoying but not game braking and to be fair the recommended is typically pretty good 6/10.
5. heros not as many as paragon originally had but they are all free and dont have to pay to unlock them even countess that just came out is free and they will be releasing them monthly witch im guessing is for balance and polish which makes sence but as for hero balance only one issue MAKE CRUNCH LESS OP ERLY GAME HE LITERALLY ONE SHOTS YOU OFF THE GET GO but thats my only complaint there 8/10.
6. menus are bland and literally exist to search for a game or look at skins, like i said before no deck builder which is a must have in any moba no shop even though they sell skins through steam dlc but still early days so understandable to some extent though it should be higher on the priority list in my opinion 5/10.
7. matchmaking is amazingly fast considering the amount of people playing compared to other bigger multiplayer titles but once they add a competitive game this may change but this still surprises me every time i queue up then alt tab to watch a video but finds a game in 10 second 10/10.

Complaints? Not too many. 
The hitbox on Riktor's chain pull is wayyy way wayyyy too big. I see it actively pull my char back into it.
Seems to be only a couple builds for each character, really would enjoy a more diverse item shop for highly custom builds, but i expect items to be added over time. 
Without early kills the jungle seems to struggle to keep up, maybe buff jungle camps' xp early on in game like paragon. 
Inhibitors probably respawn a little too fast and evenly matched games can get very drawn out sometimes.  Team comms need to stick around for a few seconds longer by the time you hear the alert it's gone.
The entire role choosing system needs reworked. Why force people to choose a role then allow them to choose any character they want? Get rid of the roles or have players choose roles BEFORE being in a game.

The game is extremely unfinished, even for an Early Access game. The features it has available now aren't very different from their first alpha nearly 2 years ago. Let's break it down. 

The game has an awful UI system, something that could easily be remedied with the 22 million dollars the devs have acquired through fundraising. This could be done in maybe a week or two with a good artist, but they haven't changed any of it in 2 years and the roadmap makes no mention of the UI or any kind of post game stats or lobby. 

The game is so full of toxicity with a small player base that the devs felt the need to make chat unavailable by default, so you have to enable the ability to talk to your teammates in a team game. They are basically conceding that the players are toxic, and then create an environment where only the toxic players are going to enable the chat, thus furthering the toxicity. 

The limited hero pool makes each game pretty much the same, rarely is there any variation in hero picks. This leads to a very shallow gameplay experience. They are SLOWLY releasing heroes that already exist from the original game, paragon, with seemingly little to no balance updates. Not sure why they are dragging their feet on this. You have 3 choices of carry/core hero to play. That's it. 

The game in itself is completely boring to play, there is very little room for player skill to shine, and decision making requires working with your team to take objectives like fangtooth but there is no voice comms in game and the team chat has issues as previously stated. 

The devs really seem to be BIG fans of League of Legends, so if you are a league of legends player you will likely appreciate the game more than if you are a DOTA player. They copied skills like ""flash"" even though it promotes bad gameplay and tactical decision-making among the players. Some things seem to exist in predecessor simply because they existed in league of legends. Recall, flash, can only buy items when in base etc. 

All in all, if you aren't someone who previously played Paragon, you aren't very likely to enjoy this game, and the devs are doing nothing to promote it.

Item system is fairly simple and gives good recommendations for beginners. You can set graphics to minimum and yes, you will not get the map details but the game works anyway. Like any other MOBA it will take some time to learn the heroes, and which one if your favourite (you can probably guess which one is mine), but it won't require a grind to be honest. If you can, bring some friends, unless you are ok playing with randoms and meeting new people. Matches can last anywhere between 20-40 minutes depending how good your/other team is. There are no in-game micro-transactions to unlock heroes (calling Overprime) and it is worth paying the basic pack. Have in mind that this is Early Access and it will be free on release.

And yes, people can be toxic like any other MOBA in the market, but you can just ignore them or understand that some people like blaming others for their loses.

If you HATE either of those types of games this will probably not be for you, especially if you do not have any will to learn from mistakes, mistakes which will stick with you for possibly a 40 minute match. IF you like either of those types of games this is worth a shot (when it's free) if you are experienced in mobas you are better off than someone coming from overwatch. If you're more into shooter play carry, however you need a lot of game knowledge to carry games, as carry I haven;t lost a game in 17 levels, every game is winnable as long as you are good enough, without the moba knowledge and game sense it will be hard, but who knows sometimes you can out strafe the enemy carry and kill them, happens more than you'd think lol.

Good sign when all the negative reviews are about refunding and nothing about the game
Game feels incredibly smooth, lacking entirety of any jank. Plays like a mix of league and dota, need to respect some characters for their abilities (like hooks and assassins) ADC's/carrys get really strong later but can;t take any punishment. Everything feels really well balanced in the ""everything is broken"" sort of way, and the times are very interesting and allow for different optimizations. The game is very skill based. Progression system is just okay, but getting premium currency will mean more in the future.
Only negatives is matchmaking, but it's like 1/5 games are bad, the other 1-2 are fine and 1-2 are amazing.

EDIT: Item system is the best I've seen with almost too many options, I've only really looked at AD items so far.
EDIT 2: I'm now level 16, it's hard to find negatives about the game. Basically every character is playable and 1-2 are S tier, who it is varies based on who you ask. I didn't feel stronger on anyone then Feng Mao, and he's considered the worst character; I've ended games with 20 kills as mid and carry (and below 5 deaths) and didn't feels stronger than I was on Feng Mao, diving a turret and winning a 1v4 is absolutely insane to me.
any negatives of the game are things people wouldn't notice or that would come from being very experienced in mobas and balance.

Queue times are on average 30 seconds, and in 70 games I've seen 3 people that can possibly be considered toxic, and I'd say 5 bad games, you have to exceptionally suck, or try really hard to hate this game.

Honestly, I think it's > Overprime.  I liked OP, and either is better than fault.  OP matches are too long, and have too many active items.  This is all passives, which suits my playstyle.  Matches are 20-40 minutes (20 for forfeit due to stomp, 40 at the outside for a competitive match).

I'll play whichever game wins the battle, but this one feels tighter.  Better ping, and I also don't miss the stealth ""stay out of the tall grass!!! (thanks Ajay)"" grass that is in OP.  Good jungle, I do want a bigger map but I'll take what I can get.

Hero balancing is good. OP has better item art, no doubt, and their shop feels cleaner, but I got used to this pretty quick.  I like that I get 2 pots and 2 detectors per base visit and I don't have to buy them or my base item.  I would like a reorganization of the items just a teense to make carry's be able to do something other than just crit, although at the same time, i did a speed build on Sparrow that i was pretty happy with.

Can't wait for more heros and cosmetics.  I think this one will win the race over OP due to financial backing and a tighter, more responsive game.  Feels more skill based and less Heroes of the Storm brawler type.

Dekker or Kallari) doesn't avoid melee attacks, but mechanically it's sound. However there are some issues which I feel make the game not for me, and thus I do not recommend it if you're excited to play a MOBA:

- The items don't feel very impactful or it's difficult to understand their nuances. They generally just feel simplistic (add power, add defense etc).
- The map is way too small and it affects every part of the game. You can easily gank a lane and be home in time before your tower takes much damage. Your jungler can easily swing around the map and disrupt any chase exciting parts of the game. The distance between towers is quite small. The fog of war makes it feel even worse... gone are the days of exciting engagements where you see far out and get excited for. This is just a fog of war poke arena.
- Most games are over in the first 15 minutes. There is no mid game to this game... it's beginning and end game. Win the beginning? Most likely going to win the whole match. IF it gets that late...
- Most matches are surrendered as soon as one team feels they are losing. They lose interest in the match and want another.
- Lack of heroes is stunting the game. However due to the map size, I'm not sure it really matters. Even with a long list of heroes most of them won't get a chance to shine as the game becomes a centralized brawler. You can't really chase down enemies here, too easy to swing from lane to lane.
- My BIGGEST gripe about this game is the lack of movement speed loss on attack. If you're blink is down and you don't have an escape ability, IT DOES NOT MATTER how good you are... you CAN NOT get away from a gank because they can just attack you forever without loss of movement speed.

I think most of these problems would be solved by bringing back the Agora map and creating more space and exciting fights... also removing the many fog walls around the map and letting people enjoy the excitement of the game.

As a previous Paragon player, I splurged for the $39.99 pack. As it stands, there's no reason to purchase a pack that contains premium currency as the game lacks a store for cosmetics. Additionally, there is a lack of a ranked system, and the current roster is quite small. The developers do have a road map and plan to increase the roster size monthly until they have to create new content. However, this is probably where the drawbacks end.

The game feels relatively polished for Early Access. While the game uses a lot of free IP's at the moment, they still look nice, and will be replaced in the near future. Matchmaking (NA-E) has been no more than a minute to two tops and ping is around 20ms. Cannot complain at all.

Each game feels fresh. It uses the monolith map, not the legacy map, but removes travel mode and focuses heavily on the MOBA aspects. This game is not a brawler.

Overall, pretty surprised at how well this game plays. Feels relatively polished, the champ's abilities feel quite strong (most of the time), and it wasn't exactly too difficult to grasp, compared to other MOBAs such as League of Legends and Dota 2. 

It does still feel quite, beta like, with a severe lack of any content aside from the main gamemode/map. There is a small amount of characters compared to all the other MOBAs, however these are being added in, as we have seen with the new character added in less than a week ago: Countess.

I cannot speak for all roles, as I have not played all of them, however the 3 I have played (Off lane, Jungle, Support) have been rather pleasant experiences, my favourite being Off lane with some of the bruiser and tank champions present.

Overall, happy with the game so far, looking forward to future updates. Would not recommend for someone who is not big into the MOBA genre, however give it a try if you feel.

Paragon revived. Mostly... In the current state of the game, it IS playable but with some VERY SERIOUS balancing issues. Some characters are the CLEAR choice over others.

Currently, Predecessor is very fun. It scratches the itch I've had for Paragon, and while things are a bit ""bare,"" so to speak, I can very well see the developers adding more and more to flesh the various systems out/adding new systems altogether.

Balance-wise, I'd say the game is in a very good spot too. You can do very well on every hero, and none feel too oppressive either.

Hopefully some sort of skilled match making makes it's way in so those who really know the game don't either get dragged down by new player or just steam roll them if they are on the enemy team.  I hoping that the adc role get fleshed out a bit more sooner rather then later. 

There is no Cash shop right out the gate which I see as a net positive, their priorities are in the right place and that seems to be directed at the performance of the game which runs super well. I can count the number of times I have had such issues on one hand and they were very brief. Like many other have said, the heroes are very responsive, the core mechanics and gameloop are all there, we are only missing variety in Heroes and in items. 

My biggest gripe about the game though has to be the shop UI. It is somewhat serviceable but definitely has a lot of room for improvement. A smaller gripe is that it would be nice to see your stats (Phys damage, magic damage, armor, health ect at a glance somewhere other then the very cluttered shop UI, which isn't very apparent it exists in the first place. 

Overall it is a very solid, competent game that just has to spread it's wings a bit and flesh out the heroes, items, improve UI and information about your character's stats in game.

Comparing this to overprime, i had a lot harder time figuring out the items and this game doesnt have a sprint function so I constantly found myself unable to ever get on top of anyone as i would just get stunned or they would jump away every time. To be fair my only game in this was in the jungle and i found the jungle to be quite boring. 

The only positive to this game compared to overprime would be the the minions spawn time. In overprime, minions spawn so much more frequently and it made me really frustrated when trying to get stuff done on the map. Every kill or push lasted for seconds before the next wave came in and it made the games take forever.

The combat in this game is less laggy than overprime, but its not good either way. This game really made me feel the dark side of the moba genre and wish for its death.

considering this is early access, im flabbergasted.
Cheers Omeda! keep it up!

quick easy suggestions that can help the game alot:
(- ESC should close and return to main menu, or close the shop ingame.)
(- Add an option to rebind the shop from G button)
(- normalize turret sound levels, game intro, or just add a seperate volume bar then SFX)
(- option to add friends from scoreboard will greatly help the community to grow, i already missed so many players i had great chemistry with and would love to play with, but couldnt.. ALL GOOD THO ^_^)

This is an indie dev team and they are self publishing their game. Doing something like that is not only really brave but also expensive. I would prefer the buy in price for Early Access to be less than $20, but I am happy to pay that price to support this game's development. That being said, you don't have to want to pay that price. If you don't either wait for another sale should one ever arise, or wait until 1.0 happening next year (most likely) when the game goes free to play. Comparing this to Overprime in terms of price and amount of content in the game is not fair to the Predecessor developers. Overprime is backed by Netmarble. They were able to put a lot more focus and funds into Overprime than the Predecessor devs were in the same(-ish) time. That being said, I like Predecessor MUCH better. I will point out that I played Paragon quite a bit back in the day before my next points. Certain changes and design choices in Overprime turned me off near instantly. The voice acting (characters and especially the announcer were really annoying to listen to, I turned the characters off immediately and I turned the announcer off after not being able to listen to his nonsense anymore) and some design changes for certain characters were just bad. Just as an example, the character Shinbi, who is an idol in Paragon (and will be in Predecessor), has been massively altered and her backstory has been made a lot more generic. At the same time they didn't change any of her animations. She still has her VERY idol themed Recall animation which no longer fits with her character at all. They also humanized The Fey (she looks a lot less ""Fey"" and a lot more human), they made Howitzer adorable (apparently gritty, visually rough characters don't work in Overprime's market), and some of the characters with darker skin tones look notably lighter. If you're OK with these things, and that's fine, then give Overprime a look. I didn't play it that much cause it wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for Paragon, and this is Paragon. If you want to play Paragon, play this (I know Overprime is actually called ""Paragon"" but that's the world we live in!). Cut the developers some slack and if you want to know if they're legit then track the game before you decide to buy in or not.

The graphics are the same amazing quality epic gave us, and the gameplay is a great improvement to the things the old paragon community were always wanting it to be. Currently the only negative is champion pool, there's not a lot of options so far, but its understandable. Balancing a moba is no easy task, rolling new champs out slowly keeps the game from breaking.

My only complaint at the moment is the lack of purchasable skins, and the inability to play the game without buying one of the dlc bundles. The game will eventually be free, with an in game shop for skins, but being forced to buy in while overprime is free feels strange. The buy in gives you in game currency for skins, but the shop doesn't exist yet. Epic made a ton of skins for all their characters, and Omeda Studios said they'd be selling those in the game, but they haven't yet. It's such an easy win to add them in and let players buy them, I'm confused by the lack of it. The business model right now is strange, but fair.

Paragon is a bit more aggressive, a lot more team fights as death isnt as punishing and neither is losing a bit of ground in your lanes.

My gripes with it so far:
- No way to save an item build.
- No player profiles with Stats.
- Personally, I feel the game is too slow paced in the laning stage.
- The matches last too long. like 45-60 minutes. 
- The power spikes of the characters feels strange to me. It feels either low or high power spikes. I always feel extremely weak and easily combo'd down all the time.
- Not enough support characters to choose from.
- The Blink ahead skill has too long of a cooldown.
- Items have absurd 60+ second cooldowns.
Positives with it so far:
- Character movement is great. Wish all characters had a sprint with short cooldown though.
- Last hitting mechanic and its been made simpler with a red portion of the HP bar meaning you can easily last hit it.
-Orb buffs are interesting, they give good reason to leave the lane for a moment and gain say, a gold gain buff.
- Having 2 strong enemies in the jungle that give party wide buffs to end the game quicker or pick a fight with advantage.
- Hit range indicator for ranged characters. Though everyone has a medium range, that can be quite frustrating if you're trying to skirt the edge of your range against another player, missing due to projectile speed/attack speed timing. 1 meter longer range would be sick.
- Character design is pretty interesting. Some really cool looking guys like Kaimera and Sevarog and Feng Mao.",1671424348,1671424348,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are 4 servers in this game:1)NA East-Northern Virginia , 2)NA West , 3)Europe , 4)South-east asia-Singapore . 
Pros:1)Gameplay is fun
        2)Game runs smooth,no lag or stutter.
        3)Has hidden MMR so that you will be matched with players of your same skill level
        4)3rd person which gives more immersion
        5)Graphics is beautiful
        6)Heroes like crunch,howitzer have nice attention to details.  
        7)Has a practise mode
        8)You are not bound to any servers like LOL. You can change the server to any regions for free,for example-From Europe to SEA from settings.
        9)Has Gamepad support
       10)You won't buy a item twice accidently in in-game shop because when you have bought a item, a checkmark is given to that item just like when you buy items in LOL
        11)Wards have a different item slot compared to the main items slots. They are not the same like in Overprime, where you have to choose between having vision of the map or having an extra item
        12) 5v5 custom game mode

 As the game is in early access and is not in complete state, so it will have some cons
 Cons:1)No hero mastery progression
          2)No tutorial
          3)No in game currency reward for winning match
          4)No main store in the main menu
          5)No ranked mode or custom game mode, only 1 normal PVP mode
          6)No solo vs ai or coop vs ai mode
          7)There is not an option to practise in the main map to have knowledge of say like jungle pathing ,as the practise map is different from the main map
         *8)This may or may not be a con to you, personally it's not a con to me. But i like to mention that out of 20 heroes only 6 heroes has skins.The rest don't have any skins
         *9)Most people may not like the UI design and the item shop
         *10)Some people may or may not  like the reticle when playing with ranged heroes. As the reticle is a little bit spread out
          11) Only 5v5 custom game mode, no 1v1,4v4 etc. or no custom game with bots or playing solo 
Conclusion: Even though the game is not in a complete state(And that's what early access means), I am enjoying it more than LOL and dota 2.

I think and hope that the ""dumb"" (i.e. random) matchmaking might get alleviated somewhat in later stages of development as ""leagues"" form and there's a more fun learning curve for beginners. 

So as a newbie, it's frustrating and outright embarassing to have little to nothing to contribute other than getting killed, pranked and laughed at by the enemy team. As it stands you're thrown in with sharks and while freedom zealots and cons probably think that's the only form the game should exist in (as long as the situation benefits them, of course), it doesn't exactly motivate me to keep coming back for more beatings when I could just read news or exist in real life and have the same thing happen to me there. Why waste my time? There are a myriad games of the exact same type with lesser graphics that already exist, so what incentive do I have to play this one specifically (other than the cool themery and the fact that it's ""new"")? If the community was more helpful, accepting and friendly, cool, that'd be one thing. But it seems like you get trash talked just for being in the match. Every decision you make from character choice, to positioning to (lack of) fighting skill seems to put your team at a huge disadvantage, and the community just loves to point it out - it's not that fun.

In the years that followed I found myself playing Smite simply because I wanted to play a MOBA with the third person perspective, I enjoyed it well enough but it always had many things I disliked that never let me feel like it was the MOBA for me. Predecessor has without a doubt hit its mark with me and brought back the feeling Paragon gave while feeling new. Gameplay is smooth, responsive and very engaging, the new item shop can take some time to adjust to given the ammount of items and all their different passive effects, but once you learn it well enough and find fun items for your character you will see the strength of its build diversity. Heroes have been slightly changed from their days in Paragon, now every hero has a passive ability in their kit which adds to their identity as a hero and their role. It is one of my favorite additions to the game and it shows creativity from the dev team that I am eager to see continue. Matches on average can last 30 minutes but I have found myself in matches lasting 40+ minutes when both teams are equally matched in skill and coordination, which makes for some memorable high intensity matches. Now not everything is perfectly tuned, some heroes feel stronger than they should be and the main objective (the core) feels weak, which often times leads to small windows to defend it if already being attacked. But this could be a matter of preference, perhaps to others the core feels fine, but it is worth noting nonetheless.

The game has put a blink as an option for every player, which gives you more offensive, as defensive options to play your games. You may use them only to escape from a gank, but you can also use them to make sure your opponent does not get away. To all junglers complaining about not getting kills, based on this addition: Have you tried not ignoring a burnt blink for 5 minutes? Therefore it might even help you decide where ganks might be an option.

Obviously the game currently has a rather small roster, with only 20 characters to choose from. The devs take their time and release only 1 hero per month into the game, so it will take some time to get all those lost characters from back in the OG Paragon.
There is also no visible rank currently and no real progression, outside of your account level in place, which might lead to some players not being too motivated to grind the game a lot, and as of right now I dont know when better progression will be implemented, so for now you may only play the game because the matches are fun to you.

The Map might not be perfect, I could not tell you if I tried, however it feels like it has been created with the ward mechanic in mind at least. As a support player, warding in this game somehow feels like a skillbased mechanic and I really like it.
There are small points of entries around every objective, which are perfect for placing wards with purpose, and using positioning to counteract the fact, that a player might not have enough wards to cover all paths.

Predecessor put great effort in making hero kits in a way, so every character feels powerful and impactful, if played correctly. Some kits are overtuned, looking at you dekker, but overall, it seems like no character is overpowered by default, and the balancing is at least pretty good, even if, as of the time of this review, rampage and howitzer are exceptionally strong.

Current map objectives feel good. 
Miniprimes, which spawn before minute 20, feel good. It is only on one person, so if you kill them, the buff is gone.
Raptors feel oppressive, if the enemy obtains 3 or more, with you having none. However they are mapobjectives, so you should mostly do them after you won a teamfight, or you may get punished for doing them, so it is fine.
Orb Prime feels as it should be, it is hard to obtain, because the minion granting it is hard to take down, but if you manage to get the buff, you can do a lot of work on your enemys base and maybe even close the game out.

Having (only) 1 active item in any given game makes it easy to keep track of ""your fifth ability"". Other games might make you run 3 or more active items at any time, which gets quite overwhelming at times, so I am happy with the system in place here. These items all feel powerful, even tho supports are suffering from having not the flashiest of options. 
You have 5 Itemslots for items with passives. Those have strong effects, that might even work with each other, leading to strong item combinations, if you can solve the item system.
There are a lot of items to choose from and most characters have a variety of items they may build to good effect. Also most items are balanced well.

Overall I am quite happy with the game as it is and knowing that this is not the final result, but an evolving product makes it even better. If the game is not fun for the moment, one might return after a while to check back in to what has changed. I was searching for a good third person moba, ever since the OG Paragon shut down, and in Predecessor, I feel like I found what I was looking for.",1670584910,1671305586,True,6,0,0.547596633434295654,0,True,False,True

Good remake, feels good to play and good to look at, can't really compare it directly to how paragon felt because it has been literal years but is very promising and has me hopeful.

CONS: it's exactly the paragon you remember, i've forgotten how absolutely vitrolic players were, and i just played one match and unistalled the game, one death and they spam DMs with death threats, sadly, the toxicity is also here, so, everything is just the same

and, no, there's no refounds since they force the ""consumable"" dlc that once you install adnd play once, there´s no refounds.

Edit: TOS and the recipt explicitly say ""This purchase contains consumable content that cannot be refunded"". since reading the TOS and the recipt is deemed as ""braindead"", my bad, because ironically a screenshot at the ""warm and welcoming"" comments i got at the discussion section made the support guy say they can make an exception and i got a refound.

now, since comments say i am a fat mouthed liar and they reported me because i'm spreading misinformation, here's a nice piece of free easily researchable info, you can, well, test if im a liar or not.

see how warm and welcoming the guys you'll be playing with, are. read the discussion topics and the way they treat people that doesn't belong to their friend list.

if reading that makes you feel like home, by all means, buy the game, it's , like my review says, paragon. if you are new, it's a good moba. 

just, well, beware that if you say something they don't like, you can easily lose your account.

in that scale i guess is the same as real life where saying something someone don't like can get you killed in real life.

but IMO games should be fun and threats like this, again IMO aren't as fun as they sound IMO nobody should tell you how to have fun or how to like a game.so. yeah.

if you buy it, threats and reports are included, i just tried to warn you and i got reported in the process.

Not to mention my internet speed : 800 Mbps !!!

Problems I encountered in the game:
1. Ping: 200++
2. Input delay 
3. Hit register (Delay)
4. Weird Hit box ( In Overprime, u hit where you aim, so you can target the minions with residual health way. But in Predecessor, You'll only hit the creeps at the front row. There's a invisible wall. And you no need to aim right to the target, but then the target got hit ( Hit-box + Aim assist ?? ). Man we no need this Kid-Friendly setting. Let's us aim by ourself.)
5. I got ""No Feedback"" when my attack hit someone. I'm firing without knowing if I've hit my opponent or not. Guess what, I got a PENTAKILL...??????
 Reason :
--- Bad/No sound effect (At least I can't hear it)
--- Bad/No visual detail (At least I can't see it)
--- The reduction animation of the enemy's health bar is abnormally too slow, and the color selection is not contrasting. 
6. Fps Drop even in low graphic setting ( Desktop : i5 11gen +  GTX 1660 Ti )
7. Very Cheap looking UI ( I suggest you 【Omeda Studios】 to Fire / Hire UI designer. )
8. Snowballing issue even worse than Overprime
9. Turret Damage / Durability 
It's make me feel like I'm playing a Mobile Moba Game, then what's the point I play the game on PC?

As of writing this review, the game is in early access ""shocker"", right now we have 20 Heroes, a mixture of OG and when Paragon dropped new heroes. If you want the BEST experience of OG Paragon in its prime, this is version of the game you maybe interested in. Even it its early stages the game feels solid with very small minor visual bugs that don't affect gameplay, the game assets and level design looks polished, the vfx for some heroes have been altered for the better of their abilities along with maneuverability. The Devs got rid of Paragon's Card system in favor for an item based system that feels a lot better and familiar if you play League of Legends or Dota 2. The heroes feel Balanced enough that truly a matter of skill can be what makes or breaks matches. The Devs also released a road-map of returning heroes and modes for the future. 

My only gripe as of right now is that there is influx of new players that never had the chance to play OG Paragon, and some people don't try to learn the game before playing pvp, however thats a user error not the game error. There is already a patch set to do balance changes and QoL changs to make the experince better and in gear towards season1. 

OG Paragon had an entry fee for the founders pack for $20 before it went F2P, the cost for PRED being $10 for the rare pack also feels like a nice welcome. As of right now I can't touch on the store, as its not out yet, and I hope its just cosmetics and not Heroes that need to be paid for (unless they have a system with a reasonable way of getting ingame currency every few matches for casual play and even more for ranked matches).

----------------------------------------------------------
I want to mention the other version of Paragon that's out called Paragon: The Over Prime, just so people that don't know aren't confused. Again Predecessor IMO is the most OG version out and the dev's where endorsed with funding by EPIC themselves for the development of the game.  

OP is a korean based game ,made by a Korean Mobile studio, that mainly has the korean/russian playerbase carrying the playercount. The game map is the 1st paragon map (IMO wasn't good and why EPIC made a 2nd map), there are only 3 Tier 1 towers are each teams side, instead of a traditional MOBA with Tier 1 & Tier 2 towers then Inhibitors then the core, the old ""SPRINT"" traversal system (EPIC got rid of cause it was bad) along with teleporters to get you around the map. All this makes the game matches feel like a constant all out Brawl, less hero balancing, less traditional hero roles and with an even less TTK to boot. This style of Paragon is obviously not how EPIC intended Paragon to be and OP dev studio are trying to go for something different, rather that's good or bad is subjective. Either way the game build up each match is more COD kill everyone as much as you can vs strategically winning and taking objectives with killing the enemy team along the way.  

OP Paragon has Policy and law agreements and scans your pc that you should be aware about before just blindly installing. Their version of the game looks phone game-ish, with the korean game style aesthetic and over the top UI/UX and constant VFX that it takes up the screen, Hero models that are lower res and not properly scaled like OG Paragon. They also are already have heroes locked by $10 or over 5 days of total play time to unlock 1 hero, and selling $30 legendary skins.  

The only thing that OP has over Predecessor is that you can play every hero from when Paragon was online. However everything else about the game is typical mobile Gacha.",1670892504,1671088660,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Also a lot of the items look very samey with names that sound like they were made by a random name generator, so it's very annoying wasting time in spawn trying to find that one items that works with your character. The items themselves don't feel like they have much of an impact until they do, and you're suddenly destroying the enemy team. The game needs more player feedback, so you know why you're dealing damage or why you're getting blown up by the enemy instantly/

Looking at the roadmap I see that they are working on adding a lot of characters and features (Including the paid store), which worries me cause it feels like they need to fix the base game to make it actually feel like an early access game and not just a demo you would play months before the full game comes out.

I saw they that received 20 million dollars in funding so I hope they can fix the base game and netcode to make the game feel like something worth playing, and not just something they put together as a assetflip cashgrab.",1670470083,1671088318,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

This does everything those do but better (imo) for the broader gaming audience. Sure, they are great games BUT they are not for everyone. Whereas that is a strength of Predecessor - Intense, strategic gameplay that not only requires planning but the the reflexes and decision making to back it. Consider that, great graphics, interesting heros and the ability to play with friends, there is a lot to love for most.

A huge bonus of this game is the direction Omeda is taking it. Paragon was ripped from many who loved it due to circumstantial reasons surrounding Fortnite. Robby Singh and his team are incredibly passionate about bringing this game to new heights and they KNOW where they need to go to make that happen. The founder was the top content creator for the game and many brilliant developers are working within their ranks. Constantly would I find myself watching his videos years ago thinking, ""Yeah, that's a good idea. They should take Paragon in that direction"". Well now, I don't have to wonder or hope - they have direct control over that direction.

Epic Games (the original creators of Paragon) have backed this studio with even grants because they believe in Omeda as much as many of us do. Barely 2 weeks in and already have they been extremely communicative about the future of the game and what we can expect as well as tiding up balancing where necessary and cleaning up bugs.

If you couldn't get into LOL or DOTA because of the top down view, or couldn't get into SMITE because of it's graphics, then Predecessor is a game you might want to try out.

However, while the game is currently lacking in a lot of features, what is there though is really good for a new studio and early access title.

I would recommend waiting for the free to play release to truly enjoy what this game has to offer, but if your itch of a 3D moba wants to be scratched, then come on in and join this passionate community.

I highly recommend joining the official discord to play with people all around the world, and if you're new its a perfect grounds to learn the game together with other people. It also avoids 90% of toxicity, because getting mad in front of strangers that can hear you is more difficult than just typing it out.

TLDR: They are different games. If you want MOBA -> PR. If you want action brawler -> OP.

[b][GAMEPLAY][/b]
-OP has action-oriented pacing, it keeps you rushing at 240 bpm all the time for entire match. Sprint, escape and portal mechanics add very nicely to the dynamics of the game. Expect this to play like Call of Duty in Smite.
-PR is much slower but much more tactical oriented towards classical MOBA. Not having extra movement abilities forces you to pay more attention to your position and enemy location, plan ahead and not take extra risks. Expect this to play like traditional MOBA - DOTA/LOL

-OP is less punishing for deaths in terms of gold and time, dying 7 times in a early game does not mean you lost the late game. You will have matches with 43 team kills vs 27 and its still going to be a tug of war. You don't feel growing in power significantly with every item. You are less likely to solo carry. Having 1-2 fewer items is not critical.
-PR is much more punishing for deaths and has a significantly steeper power curve. Someone scoring 7 kills early game will faceroll mid game and probably late game, he can carry your entire team. Killing someone contributes to your power growth much more significantly, items give a bigger edge, having 1-2 fewer items is a significant disadvantage. Your games will end around 22 team kills vs 12.

-OP has more newly designed heroes which are fun and made more changes to existing ones to fit the dynamism of the game. 
-PR stays true to Paragon and implements heroes almost identical as they were, appealing to veterans like me. Its unclear if they are capable of designing new fun heroes yet.

-OP has a significantly better sound design. You can hear the footsteps of enemies and fights behind walls and bushes sounds. This adds a new layer of attention you need to pay—my new favorite feature in MOBA's.
-PR has significantly better itemization in the shop. Its deeper with much more variety allowing more builds, and more counters. This adds incredibly more depth to the game and variety of how you build your hero.

-Both games are visually appealing but run differently due to different engines, expect to tweak settings to smoothen out fps during team fights in both games.
-Both games' matches can last the same amount of time ranging between quick 15min surrender, to full 60minute matches. OP will have more brawls tho, albeit the majority of which will be meaningless for the overall game result.
-Both games will be F2P so expect the audience to stick around for at least 6 months. Don't refer to the current number of players in either game. It's too early to judge.

[b][MAPS][/b]
-PR has a bigger and much more complex map, including verticality, allowing you to use LOS much more efficiently
-OP map is smaller, with sprint and portals which makes it feel even smaller. Rotating between lanes is a matter of seconds.
-PR wards are available to everyone, but their range is smaller. With a bigger map, it means you have less info on the enemy, meaning you play more cautiously but have more vision overall.
-OP has bushes, which make noise and visually move when someone is inside. ±I prefer these visually rather than bulky purple mist walls from the original Paragon present in PR because of the to camera jiggling when you are close to the purple walls.


-OP pushing lanes and destroying inhibitors is much more important for victory than scoring kills, due to short death timers, faster travel, smaller map, and shallower snowball effects, which goes against the constant temptation to brawl.
-PR objectives (gold dragon / main buff boss) matter much more as extra gold and buffs contribute much more to your power scaling
-OP Backdooring is easier, you can win a game by backdooring 2 inhibitors and spawning powerful minions even if you are behind by 20 team kills. They will destroy the core very quickly.
-PR counter-jungling is more effective, due to longer camp respawn times, albeit more risky. You can hurt their jungler much more without direct encounters.

-PR you will spend more time watching minimap, due to lack of decent escapes
-PR most of games will end before either team reaches enemy core

[b][MISC][/b]
-OP UI is significantly better and much more intuitive. Icons fit the game fantasy much better.
-OP skins are much better, albeit are unreasonably expensive.
-OP minimap signaling system is simpler and much more intuitive

-OP is developed by Korean company which attempts to appeal to both PC and Mobile players of ASIA, expect weird game changes in favor of mobile, as well as nyanya K-pop signers as heroes which don't fit the game fantasy
-OP development cycle is much shorter due to above, meaning more updates in shorter time
-OP is much more polished, but falls short on core gameplay loop. It is shallower and more primitive, yet action-packed.

-PR xp sharing in a lane is better balanced, preventing you from stacking 5 on one lane for too long. Also, level difference means much more.
-PR Expect to play at higher mouse sensitivity due to added verticality. Kallari can jump out of your vision with just one skill.
-PR winning team fights brings same feeling of joy, as in OP, yet rewards you much better in gold and XP, making you truly feel that each fight matters.
-PR requires more team coordination as each fight matters and is deeper in strategy, tactics, teamplay as well as variation due to better itemization.


[b][SUBJECTIVE][/b]
I prefer the sound, visuals, UI and polishing of OP, but I enjoy core gameplay loop and depth of PR much more.
I wish to have sounds over walls, bushes, UI and better skins in PR. - this may happen
I wish to have better power scaling and deeper itemization in OP. - this may not happen, due to the audience being partly mobile and the game being Asia oriented.

Predecessor can honestly feel quite boring and hollow to play a lot of the time due to the very slow pace, lack of progression, and them wanting the game to be played closer to top-down MOBAs. If I wanted a full sweat MOBA, I'd rather play League or Dota 2 instead.

Predecessor is like the final Paragon experience in Monolith after they removed a lot of what made Paragon unique and made the game more standardized to other MOBAs. Its much slower paced, with no travel mode and barely any early rotating. However, time-to-kill is lower despite the slower pace, meaning you die a lot faster with not much chance to recover if you're caught off-guard. Also, Predecessor is missing some core gameplay features such as a Ranked mode, player progression, a statistics screen & lobby after a game ends, a shop etc. I know it can be added after the fact, but I'll just wait for this game to be released as free-to-play with all those features added in a year or so.

Ultimately, if you like the old school MOBA gameplay, but in 3rd-person you may like Predecessor.

My biggest gripe is it seems like you aren't rewarded enough for getting a lead especially if you are playing jungle. If you are 5/0 as a jg, and your solo laner is 0/2, you might literally be a level behind them. It doesn't feel like going for kills is worth it, and putting your head down and just farming doesn't feel like you get a lead either in jungle. Also it takes way too long to get items online. You literally dont get your first item online until around 9 minutes into the game. A game might be 40 minutes long and u still dont get full build despite the fact that your starter item upgrade is literally free. Items are fine though and the map is visually appealing and looks great. Also the game runs pretty smooth I have barely had any issues with how well it runs. The orb prime is way too hard to kill though. Fang Tooth on the other hand is too easy to kill as you can solo it as a jungler once you have your first item online. But overall the pace of the game is just a little slow. Towers also hit for too much damage. Late game you can be full tank, but you will die if hit by the inhib like 5 times. This game is often compared to Overprime which makes sense, but the two games feel very different. If you prefer a more brawly fast paced moba, play Overprime and if you prefer a very slow paced Moba, then play Pred. Neither are perfect games and still have a lot of work, but personally I prefer Overprime because it feels like I am rewarded for farming and ganking efficiently, while Pred I am not. Overprime also has faster paced games which I prefer. But as of now, Overprime doesn't run as smoothly and the map feels too small mainly because of the sprint feature. But the objectives seem more balanced and the gameplay just feels more fun. One thing I will give to Pred though is that minions actually punish you for playing too aggressive early, while in Pred the minions actually have a threat in all times of the game. Also last hitting in Pred is more skillful because in Overprime, last hitting executes minions at around 20% hp no matter how much dmg u do with your autos. Overall I would say Pred is a 5/10 and OverPrime a 6/10",1670980115,1670980115,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

As a former league tard I'd hope this game to have more sprite, more interesting take on the MOBA genre but so far it feels almost exactly like league, players included. 
The first thing to know is that unlike the other Paragon clone (topc), this one does not have a tutorial, so players are expected to figure out things for themselves. Which is fine by me, but then the beginner friendly option is turned on by default, AKA auto buying items, so you gotta turn that off yourself. The items interact like league items do, beside every players except jungle having 2 charges of HP potions and 2 charges of wards by default. What is also the default is role selector, and depending on the role you choose will pick the starting items for you. 
The hero roster is similar to topc, since they both take them from the original Paragon. Topc had like 2 Asian looking ones though. The heroes' abilities are similar enough. The range indicator is not very legible when playing, and some abilities don't have one so you have to rely on the cursor. Some have deceptively long range. 
The heroes themselves are a bit poorly balanced, since some have the above mentioned long range while other don't. Most of them feels like reskinned league characters. 
Unlike topc you can't have a quick way to return to lane, couples with really excruciatingly long death timer( expect waiting a full minute in 30 min mark) means that the game time is just as long as league. Do you really want to play a third person league game? it's exhausting. 
Queue up time is not an issue since this game is 2 weeks old. There's no internet related issues with my mediocre 10 mb/s ethernet either, so that's a positive.
Another positive is the visual, which looks great. Topc in an effort to have more people playing downgraded the visual so that even when you crank everything up to max (with anti aliasing) you still get shimmering and no aliased image at all time. Motion blur is baffling for a moba but you can turn it off. 
Then there's the price. The developer published the game themselves (unlike topc with a big Korean company backing up) and they sell the game for $10 with discount and 2 season passes. And topc is free with micro transactions, so pick your poison.

All in all, don't get this game now. I hope the dev can improve the game to be more action focused and more fun, unlike league that's shackled under e-sport and decades of bad decisions and toxic community. Reducing death time and adding way to quickly get back to lane would be a good start. The heroes while somewhat poorly balanced can still be tweaked. Just don't do it like every other moba out there and try to make the game e-sport ready, that thing comes naturally and you cannot force it.",1670967952,1670967952,False,1,0,0.504690408706665039,0,True,False,True

Both Overprime and Predecessor pick and choose certain characters from the old Paragon- hopefully this is rezolved with further DLC. Overprime wins on overall graphics but it's invasive T&C's make Predecessor the clear victor.

I played Paragon for a long time, like most of the people that are playing Predecessor as well as Paragon: Overprime. For me, I feel Predecessor is very very close to what Paragon was.

Instead of Pros and Cons, I'll just write some points to consider:
-It is Early Access. Meaning not all content is currently available. Of course that was the same with Paragon when it first became popular. Only way this game gets better is for people to play and provide feedback!
-They have a decent roster of characters to choose from with more on the way
-Sometimes matches can be a steamroll, just as they were in Paragon. But for the most part there feels like good balance.
-Some players are quick to surrender... but I've seen amazing comeback games and those have honestly been some of my favorite games. It is very much possible to come back when all hope seems lost. 

Overall, there's enough content here for an early access release, which they did. And they've already announce more content in the near future. All in all I see a ton of potential in this game and can't wait for more characters!",1670954764,1670954764,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

I am a recently converted player that tried out predecessor to play with some friends, and it did feel a little awkward at first. Compared to the top-down MOBA like LoL, predecessor's third-person view changes how the whole game feels. There are many similarities in the abilities of certain characters, but what changes is how you execute them. This games plays like an FPS with the traditional MOBA characteristics(i.e., abilities, minion waves, objectives).  So while in LoL it is just linear, in predecessor, it is multi-dimensional. Your auto attacks are aimed instead of just right-clicking, while moving is WASD instead of right-clicking, stuff like that. The transition is fun because it is like being a part of a whole new game and watching it grow. The gameplay of this game is very unique compared to anything I have played, and I think it provides a new spin on a game type I enjoy.

I like the subtle changes to the heroes. The addition of passives for all characters gives different characters in similar roles a more unique feel and I like that everyone gets a blink with a long cooldown. 

Some people hate the UI, I'm pretty indifferent. It's there, it works, it says what it needs to. Item shop could use some reorganizing but the default auto-buy builds and core items are plenty good enough for 90% of players so I'm not too hung up on it. Being able to create custom build presets for different roles would be amazing. 

No stat trackers or anything for people to wave around their e-peens but who cares? Play the game for the whole reason gaming exists: the gameplay. I do wish there was more than 1 active item slot, but I like the concept of the crests.

Reasons to play:
The game plays as a traditional moba, early game is just the right speed overall. While also being able to speed up depending on how you play the game. The game play and mechanics of the game are smooth with little to no lag or interference. Items offer a plethora of building and playing styles. I personally would pick this game over Overprime personally due to the pace of the game and the attention to detail that the developers put into the game. Overprime is basically Overwatch pace with a moba map and items. i would still encourage to give both a shot since the amount of time that was out into both games. However just in reviews alone Predecessor rises above Overprime in Pos reviews alone with no contest. Also i think that people complaining about every character having a blink is ridiculous, every moba has a blink. This one isn`t even that bad compared to Dota 2 blink dagger. 

Cons, personal opinion:
Champion Roster is not that big.
I think some champions are unbalanced but that just plays into needing to play smart and having teamwork.
Items are great but they almost feed into a one-shot meta. 
I wish i could add people that I have played with.
Map gets boring at moments, only because it the map that paragon left off with, so its nothing new.
Fangtooth is a joke of a camp, almost anyone can 1v1 it with little to no issue, even though it provides a massive buff to all stats throughout the game.
I want to be able to change where the map is on the screen, but not a big negative, just personal preference.  

Overall opinion:
Its a great game and Omeda Studios deserves major credit for taking their time with the game and doing it right.
Definitely give the game a shot and draw your own opinion from your experience. In the end of it all this version looks the most promising and less of a quick money grab in comparison to all the other versions of paragon.",1670906290,1670906735,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,True

961200,128447834,76561198238884234,0,7,95,0,95,1670812858,"Reasons I refunded:

I played OP for 38hrs before trying this game and I grew to really love the faster pace throughout every stage of the game. Laning phase in Pred was slow and boring. I only played a few games, so maybe I was missing something. Paragon: The Overprime didn't feel slow my first game, and I became addicted to the pacing and fun of it. 

Predecessor graphics have a shading and style to it that I don't like, specifically the art on the Howitzer. Howitzer looked like he had some Fallout cell shading on him that I didn't like after looking at OverPrime's Howitzer's design.

Ability rework of Howitzer was weak, and I didn't like the changes. The missile impact on other players didn't feel impactful using the sound design and visuals like OP's did. Same is true for his ult and probably many other abilities.

The in-game skills and items don't show the percentage scaling like they do in the starting menu, OverPrime does. I like the UI and info in it better overall in OverPrime. Predecessor's UI is really big and takes up the whole screen when looking at items to buy and other things.

The map is small and claustrophobic. The towers are really big taking up huge sections of the lanes, making the map feel even smaller in comparison. 

Mid lane seems really boring compared to Dota, which has side river rune objectives and bonuses of getting runes when rotating top or bot to gank. OverPrime was more fun in mid because of the mini-objective of the mana boost positioning to the side and the mobility for moving left and right through the jungle.

I've heard complaints about OverPrime's mobility, but with wards I don't find it a problem. There is no fog-of-war or vision blocking elements other than hiding in grass like LoL, so wards buy time just the same as they do if a team jumped out of fog-of-war to gank you.

There are a few things I liked better than OverPrime, but they were very minor things. Overprime can fix the things I don't like, whereas Predecessor would have to redesign the whole game.

The main worry I have for OverPrime right now is that they make all future heroes look Korean in style and art (based off the 2 newest heroes added). Both games still have me guessing how they will monetize in the future. Maybe there is info I haven't seen somewhere, but I'm guessing both will have options between the $10–$30 range.

Other than that, both have free heroes you can play. I think Pred has 20 and OverPrime has 14 on a weekly rotation to switch it up. OverPrime has more heroes in total. OverPrime has the ability to grind dailies/weeklies and get small rewards for each match, which can then perma-unlock heroes (you get 5 heroes for free just for logging in and need 12 to unlock ranked). OverPrime has ranked, and Pred doesn't. Predecessor had no grind at all right now actually.

Overall, I just find OverPrime has faster development. It's more polished and finished. OverPrime seems to have better longevity as a game with up to 10x the player pop compared to Pred. It's free2play, giving access to more players that want to try it without any obligation.",1670879845,1670900227,False,3,1,0.495777249336242676,0,True,False,True

Actually, the biggest problem with MOBA games generaly speaking is toxicity, and this game has nothing to counter it. And it is a fest concerning toxicity. I mean, you HAVE TO know that this is gonna be a big problem as a game creator team, and you have to create something to fight against it.
Players are AFK, and you cannot kick them (why do they even play?).
You cannot report players insulting players or throwing games... (ppl saying you can on the official website are idiots, you need so much informations and screenshots that it is a clown show).
One thing I regret is role queue (personal opinion, at least for solo queue), so that you play the role you like, and not fill if you don't want to loose because someone is one trick pick. I've been filling 80% of the time.

This is a good (maybe the best) successor of Paragon, but I absolutely DO NOT recommend to buy the early acces right now. Really. Don't do it. It's a mistake.

I am not comparing the game to any other moba that is worse or better, I'm just telling what is obvious in 2022 about moba games and what has not been taken into consideration FOR NOW. So I recommend to wait. Certainly a lot.

This review is also made by someone who has absolutely no experience with MOBAs, so take it with a grain of salt or sand or whatever, just something bumpy.

So far, this game looks quite promising. Quite honestly I was drawn in by the showy graphics, promise of skill based FPS gameplay, and all the machinery (i have an obsession with cyborgs, implants, robots, whatever it is if it's tech.) It's delivered so far. However, it still feels barren, but that's what EA should be, the core of a game looking for feedback. It's got got a solid core already, and that's still supposed to be getting improvements too. Its got a moderate amount of annoying bugs, but there's a menu tab just to report those, which is pretty neat. Besides, it's early access, it'll have bugs. The item icons are a little goofy though. I personally feel that they don't fit the game's pristine and polished graphics, but that's a matter of opinion. They may be placeholders after all. Finally, this game NEEDS a tutorial. I can guarantee that one will be coming, but I might as well add it. I've been playing for about 4 hours. It took about an hour for me to understand the abilities system with mana and upgrading, along with range and such, at that point I went online and played a match, it only took about one for me to get the game's combat system. However, I'm 4 hours in and a still have some gaps in my knowledge of the item and store mechanics. I get crafting, but the rest just flies over my head. In short, for total beginners like myself, A tutorial is very beneficial.

It's looking like it'll be a great game so far, but it's always hard to tell until the big 1.0 happens. Here's to hoping that this review stays a thumbs up! I sure think it will.",1670859416,1670859416,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Also hate that they lock items behind the role you choose so if there was a situation where you want to switch roles with someone in the character selection screen you're out of luck.

I think a way to create an item loadout for your heroes before a match, so when you open the shop it shows what item you chose next instead of the ""recommended"" for your role, would allow players to experiment with unique builds they come up with on their own.

Unlike Smite, the gameplay is fully 3D and there's a huge amount of verticality to the map. On top of this Predecessor is lightyears ahead of Smite in terms of graphical fidelity. With the recent move to Unreal 5, it looks about as good as any triple A release out there. My advice would be to wishlist this game and give it a good try once Early Access has finished and it's at full release with all the new player experience sorted out (full release will be free to play btw). Hopefully you will be as hooked as all the OG fans were from 2016 =)

For the old fans of Paragon: 
This fan lead rebirth project has come closer than I think any of us imagined possible to recreating the game we loved. The devs have managed to secure major funding and some amount of collaboration with Epic Games, so the future does seem promising. The biggest thing is of course that there's no idiot executives or meddling Tencent overlords to ruin things (I'm 90% sure Tencent were responsible for both messing with the development of Paragon and eventually killing it). I'd say there's still a little work to be done with animations, sounds, and some ability effects to fully recapture the feel of the original, but really it's nitpicking and the game already feels great and is a lot of fun in its current form. Note that Predecessor is focused on recreating the Monolith version of Paragon, so if you're more interested in the Legacy/Agora version you might want to look into Overprime.",1670762574,1670762992,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Back in the days it was one of the best MOBAs around. And now with the revival in form of Predecessor it is just as good as it was back then, before the devs made some questionable decisions.

Before buying it read about what developers say about this phase of the game, the Early Access, so you dont expect something different.

Right now what you have is the main game, nothing more and that's how they want it to be, 'cause they're polishing the core gameplay, and tbh is really good with minor bugs atm.

No progression right now, so no unlockables, ranked mode or skins, but if you're looking to play for fun is quite worth the low price.

I'm pretty new to mobas and having a third person view where skill and aim matter is so much more engaging than the top down view.  It's fun and rewarding when you finally start to learn the map and strategies, and when you hit those clutch skill shots.

As expected in a moba I've had a few toxic players, but nothing compared to when I tried League or Smite.  As I said I'm new and still learning so I'm terrible, but most people don't say anything.  I feel the silent judgement sometimes, but that's on me.

Getting in early with Predecessor and really learning how to play before the game is released appeals a lot to me.  Learning heroes as they come out is also much less overwhelming than if there were already 100+ in the game

The developers seem to be very responsive and present in discord and reddit.  On release there were some ping issues with OCE so the very next day they had a server up and running in Singapore to help.   They've also released an EA roadmap which makes grinding player levels worth it already.

It's possible I may have been slightly better off in my first games if I waited until there was a tutorial and PVE, which are both in the roadmap.  My teammates would most likely agree, but there are a lot of youtube videos and twitch streams that help with the basics, and now I feel like I've earned what little skill I've built so far, making the wins all the more satisfying.

I wrote a review originally, and I want to rewrite it after playing Paragon: The Overprime some more with it in EA, too. As I said in my OP review, I think it's impossible to escape comparisons between the two games. Predecessor is my game of choice currently, but I don't think either game is bad. I think they serve different playstyles and expectations and will likely find their own communities within the greater Paragon community.

[h2] The Good [/h2]

Predecessor is pretty, and almost every character looks almost exactly as I remember them. Muriel's face changed and is arguably worse, but everyone else looks like they just ported the character models straight over. I recall hearing that Muriel's face had to change due to some country's laws they plan to release the game in, so I can overlook that one.

Gameplay feels smooth in this. Everything works and acts roughly how I expect it to, and a majority of the character's kits are as I remember them from Paragon. Gameplay is probably the most polished feeling portion of this game currently in early access.

Game length is good. Games sit between 20-40 minutes on average. Most games I play are done right around the middle of that at 30 minutes. It's a good length to make you not feel like you wasted a ton of time when you lose but to let the game have a good amount of room for strategy.

It's a weird thing to call out since most games just do it well, but, after playing Overprime, wards are better in this. I like that they go invisible, and you have to use sweepers or vision wards to find them. It creates more places you can drop wards and keeps them safer to avoid having to constantly babysit them. I play a lot of support, and good warding systems matter a lot to me since it's a good portion of my gameplay.

Monetization is better so far. We'll have to wait to see how that changes after EA, but, in it's current state, $10 for the 20 currently available heroes plus the 5+ more before the end of EA is a great deal. If you have even a passing interest in this game and think you might want to try it after EA ends, just toss in $10 and get all those characters unlocked.

The ability to create tempo advantages, setup lane freezes, and actually manipulate waves overall to create an advantage makes Predecessor really feel like a MOBA to me. MOBAs are made or broken on these elements in my opinion, and Predecessor really shines with these. I can actually kill my lane opponent, back, and return to lane and still have an overall advantage in tempo since it's not as easy for them to just push the lane back out or get back before me.

The verticality and how characters interact with it is great. I'd like to see this explored more. It adds a ton of outplay potential.

Everyone getting a Flash button for free is great as well. It gives everyone an emergency escape which allows for riskier and more aggressive gameplay especially on heroes like Sparrow with no mobility in her kit. It's on a long enough cooldown that it doesn't feel like everyone has a get out of jail free card constantly.

[h2] The Bad [/h2]

Balance isn't great. It actually shares the same Ranger problem that Overprime has. The Ranger builds in Predecessor are ridiculous and offer the Ranger a ton of stats with not a lot of decision making involved. Every item they'd normally build gives the Ranger every stat they could want. There's no decision making between do I want this item that only has crit or this item that only has attack speed. They all have a little bit of everything. Tanks feel reasonably tanky around midgame, and then the Ranger gets about 3+ items, upgrades their emblem, and starts melting everyone. Pure supports like Muriel still don't feel as useful as taking someone with a good amount of CC or damage to really secure kills. Fighters and Mages both still feel okay but largely get overshadowed by your Ranger late game. Balance does feel in a better place in some aspects than Overprime, but neither game is really blowing it away on balance so far.

Items don't feel impactful until they do. I know that sounds confusing, but you'll immediately understand when you play the game. A lot of the items feel more like stat sticks, and their passives aren't super noticeable as the majority seem to be tuned to be on the weaker side. The Ranger Statikk Shiv equivalent, Storm Breaker, that does AOE damage on every 4th hit seems to not do a sizable amount of AOE. It was so little that I questioned if it was working when I first got it until I started watching the combat numbers onscreen and saw the little 7 magic damage pop up on the minions. You start to get some other items though, and those passives really start scaling until you're just wiping people out.

There's no tutorial. This makes it hard for new players to get into the game. If you didn't play Paragon, I'd actually recommend that you go through the Overprime tutorial and then come play this. It mostly all applies here still, and, at least, you'll understand how this stuff works. No tutorial exacerbates the already tense relationship between new players and veterans.

There's no MMR from what I can tell. You're just tossed in with a random set of people each game. This leads to one team stomping sometimes while the other team seems to not even know what's going on, which is likely true since it might be a whole team of brand new players.

There's no progression. Yeah, they released a roadmap with rewards for leveling up, but, in-game currently, there's nothing  that rewards you for showing up and playing each day/night/whenever you play. For some, this will cause them to get bored and not have a drive to play. For me, my progression currently is just getting better at the game, but who know if that will drive me to the end of the season.

There's no skins outside of the current EA bundles and no shop at the moment. If you want to make your heroes look pretty, you're limited to the current skins from the bundles. It's not a huge deal to me currently, but I know some people like to look nice while playing their MOBAs.

Heroes for each role could be dispersed better, and I think Twinblast should've been in this initial roster/on the roadmap along with Revenant. Off lane, mid lane, and jungle seem well represented while Rangers and Support feel less so. I'd like to have had about 5 or so heroes in each role instead of 3 rangers and 3 supports with Bellica and Steel flexing to support.

Sound design in this is weaker than Overprime. A lot of the sound effects in Overprime sound punchier and more impactful. Predecessor is still lacking voicelines for a good portion of the heroes, and some of the sound effects just really lack that same level of impact and satisfaction.

UI and UX overall needs work. A lot of the UI from the shop to the main menu all feel unpolished, at times ugly, and just not very intuitive. There's a lot of opportunity for quality of life changes throughout the UI currently.

[h2] The Conclusion [/h2]

I prefer Predecessor to Overprime. As said before, it's impossible to escape the comparison. They are both successors to Paragon and both are trying to occupy a similar space.

I would recommend Predecessor to those wanting a game that feels more like a traditional MOBA. Lanes feel slower paced. There's more strategy surrounding lane management, rotations, and the like because they are harder to do and result in more punishment if you do them wrong. Much of what I learned from other MOBAs applies to Predecessor.

That does not mean that Overprime is garbage. It might appeal to you if you want something faster paced that is overall more polished and feels further along in development. For me, the gameplay just doesn't appeal to me as much, but nothing is forcing me to choose only one. I will likely bounce between the two as they develop.",1670043306,1670722398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Movement and impact of attacks is top notch. Fault and Overprime (the other paragon remakes) have a degree of choppiness to their movement and or a lack of proper impact when attacking so this is a major plus for pred. 

It has launched with a lot of items to give you a good opportunity to make a vareiy of fun and interesting builds plus more are sure to be added over time. The starting roster of 20 strikes a great balance giving multiple choices for each role without overwhelming new players. Adding more characters is a double edged sword because one one hand more heroes is great but it also means players need to have a better understanding of more characters in order to properly strategies and adapt their playstyle. That said The plans seem to be to release a new hero each 1 to 1 and 1/2 months for the next 6 or so heros so the roster should expand at a good rate for awhile. 

Furthermore, the second character planed to be released is supposed to be a fully original creation from the pred team which is great news as it proves they have the skills and talent to expand beyond the original paragon roster. 

It appears they've taken there time refining and streamlining development so that this EA will be very content filled and exciting to participate in with lots planned in a short window. 

As for bugs, crashes, and performance. I've literally experienced none. It runs perfect, not a single disconnect either.

Best Paragon successor out of them all. It stays the most faithful to the original Paragon while doing some things differently. BIG plus for native controller support as the original had it so no excuse for these wannabe Paragons not to have it themselves. Gameplay is MUCH smoother than all the rest of em and I've yet to encounter a bug or have the game crash on me. Devs said they had their fully attention on making sure the gameplay was polished and ran great first and foremost, and that it does. 

THEY HAVE THE GENIUS MIND THAT BROUGHT US THE ORIGINAL PARAGON STEVE ""THE MAN"" SUPERVILLE ON THEIR TEAM. That alone gives them the most credibility to the throne vs the other Paragon descendants. 

Due to that lazer like focus on nailing the gameplay right first it means some things like the UI could be better, wish it told me my exact stats (one of the very few things Overprime did better).

Some controls need to be moved around, when you go to upgrade a ability on controller it triggers the ""Free Cam"" too so you start uncontrollably moving around which is very annoying. 

My BIGGEST point of annoyance with this game is and has always been its VERY CONTROVERSIAL addition of a free ""Blink"" (teleport, think gideon teleport portal) that EVERYONE gets as soon as you spawn in. It ruins the balance or certain heroes who were NOT designed with having mobility in mind such as Sparrow and Murdock. And it gives heroes who ALREADY had stupid good mobility such as Gideon EVEN MORE insane mobility and gives him TWO get out of jail free cards. 

It WILL cost you MANY well deserved kills and acts as a way for bad players to play like morons without having to deal with the consequences of their actions and misplays. The ones who are for it (especially in their discord) are typically players who never played the original and if they did they likely came when it was dying around the V.42 update when they changed everything with the 3 card system and you could do insanely stupid shit like be invisible as countess and walk up to someone and delete them from existence with little to no counterplay. 

If you 1v1 badly, if you are out of position, if you are just a worse player than the one you are fighting, if you build wrong, if you dont understand your hero well and have very little mastery over them, if your mechanical skill is low, all these factor should lead to you dying. Yet the blink is a ""hey i know i am and did all of the above but none of that matters because im just gonna blink away and not die""

And to those who say ""use yours"" you can't follow them if they go under tower with it and if you DO burn yours you better hope you kill them because now you don't have yours and someone else can just blink away with nothing you can do about it.

It REALLY is the worst part of Pred and i cannot stress that enough. 

One other negative is the towers HURT. A LOT. They can VERY much deal damage in the thousands EASILY in 2 or more shots. Enemies WILL use them as babysitters (even though it is YOU who should be protecting the tower not the other way around)  so be prepared for that. Also be advised this will lead to HEAVY turtle strats where the enemy team will group on their tower or inhibitor to keep you from taking it abusing the fact the towers MELT anyone caught by them. The only reliable way i have found to FORCE the assault on them and keep the pace of the game flowing is to get the orb prime and have your damage dealers be willing to die to force the tower/inhibitor down.



OVERALL i DO recommend this game to both newcomers AND (especially) OG Paragon vets. And IF they remove the blink from this game and tone towers down a bit (but mainly just remove the stupid blink) then this game will truly be the successor to Paragon and have the chance to grow and be what Paragon was on its way to becoming before its untimely demise. This game if treated right and the right decisions are made and it KEEPS faithful to the original Paragon before it, can surpass all the other MOBAs out there easily.  It CAN absolutely pass Dota and LoL. They are outdated and Predecessor is exactly the innovation that is needed.

Unbalanced gameplay and extremely toxic playerbase.

Has the same issues as most MOBA games when it comes to balancing and backwards design.
Like the OBSESSIVE focus on kills, last hitting, and ""carrying"".
I will never understand the point of making a 5v5 game where there exists champions who are so extremely powerful that they alone can instantly delete a player from the enemy team.
What is the fucking point of a team vs team battle then?
What is the point of support champs..?

Games like overwatch work because the entire game design is focused on team work and keeping as many players in the same fight as possible.
There are champions in overwatch who can one shot you, but you will never be forced to play 1v1 against them in a ""lane"" for 15 minutes where you BY DESIGN don't have any chance to beat them, or even survive against them.
Because OW is a team fight objective focused game.

Make a choice.
Do you want to create unique champions with very different damage outputs and survivability, or do you want to create ""laning gameplay""?

Bad UI.
Every menu, even the score board, is fullscreen for some reason.
Sensory overload even though there isn't actually that much information there, so there is absolutely no reason to fill the entire screen.

The game even early in early access feels pretty polished gameplay-wise. Being a competitor between this and the other free-to-play MOBA's, I would say that this one so far is lacking things that seem very minimal in the grand scheme when the game feels so smooth and fun to play. I would say that it is worth supporting this game as the developers seem to be taking the long game approach to deliver a quality product that is more than accessible in its early stages. I have personally failed to notice any game-breaking or annoying bugs or issues while playing this game. Developers also seem to be very open to questions and transparent with progress through discord and other advertising platforms. It may not be free-to-play as of yet, but it sure is fun.

Edit: After putting some more time in Predecessor, and playing Paragon: The Overprime, I will say that comparing the two games side by side, Paragon: The Overprime may have more features available and be free to play, but the game generally feels clunky and does not in any way look as polished as Predecessor. Movement, scenery, and personally the item shop feel and look better in my opinion.

As far as Predecessor goes, while being what I feel to be the better MOBA, It should be noted that a roadmap for the games progress has been released, and the overall release of heroes and general improvements to the game are going to be made over a 3-month period of time. For someone who is looking for all the bells and whistles immediately, Paragon: The Overprime has what you are looking for this moment. If you are interested in a game that is polished, and ready to play, but also willing to wait for content, I feel that Predecessor will end up taking the top spot in the long game.",1670369408,1670654553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Secondly, as a player who never played Paragon I can't compare but I have played other MOBAs, including League of Legends for a very long time. I've grown tired of League but never found any other MOBA that hooked me until I played Predecessor.

I'm in love with the gameplay. The combat feels so rewarding and most importantly it's a blast to play. The one-on-one fights are intense battles of skill while team fights are exhilarating. It's rewarding to learn and improve with a character you dedicate your time with.

I like the map layout and the several objectives you can fight over. Instead of just playing super passive and not doing anything, these objectives force teams to take action and for frequent fights to occur, which in my opinion is a good thing.

All-in-all I've been really impressed with the game! Evan as an avid MOBA player, Predecessor comes with quite learning curve but it's so worth diving into and dedicating your time to it. The more I play and learn about the game, the more I appreciate it. 

It's a breath of fresh air in a genre that has stagnated

In Smite, minions do more damage then champions early game but its still possible to poke and play aggressive. Its impossible to have any level of lane pressure in this game because minions do far and beyond more damage then champions.

EDIT: The Season 1 Early Access roadmap has been released and issues with the roster are being dealt with. 

Right now it feels like Smite on Ice in the worst possible ways, but it could easily be fixed. The game runs well and handles decently for the most part, just needs some adjustments to make it actually feel good during combat for anyone that isn't a melee bruiser.

8/10

Experience: Played the OG Paragon daily

Played 4 Matches today (Reminded me of day 1 of Paragon)

The map, the Heroes, the Steam Roll LOL

If you loved Paragon this is an easy pick up.

If you never had the chance to play Paragon, or a MOBA prepare the climb the steep hill.

Better with a team, if you're going to play with randoms just leave the ego at the door and have fun.

It does bring that nostalgic feeling of the good old Paragon.

These are some of the bullets I got so far from playing for up to 50+ hours (according to Steam):

Good Things
- Good server connection (I play on NA East at ~50ms). I am from Costa Rica.
- Game music is great. Specially the main menu music.
- Narrator's voice, its the original from Paragon. Just perfect!
- Controller support but I play with K&M.
- Navigation through the items list/menu during a match its kinda easy. Just type some key words and items will show up but it still needs improvements.
- Game's performance its generally good.
- Matchmaking still needs improvement but so far isn't that bad.
- Alerts are good, the sound alert maybe a bit higher but visually its fine.

Since the game its in EA stage, some features will be implemented in the upcoming days, but so far this is what I can tell:

Bad Things
- Cannot modify some keybindings for example the item's store access key. Its perma-linked to G key.
- Game has a recommended item feature (it works kinda well) buy you cannot make item pre-builds yet, so you have to look for them manually during a match.
- You cannot review a match, there is no match history yet.
- No heroes' lore in game yet.
- No FX sounds in the champ select screen.

According to the Discord channel new changes are coming in the new patch. Go and take a look.

1: The tutorial is seemingly nonexistant. There is nothing I could find for people unfamiliar with mobas to get a grasp outside of a practice mode that doesn't give a proper understanding of how these types of games work. Larger communities can solve this problem, but until it reaches that point a basic overview couldn't hurt.
2: the game in addition to not telling you how to play, automatically starts with you autobuying items. I've yet to see if once you turn it off it stays that way, but it was annoying to seemingly be forced into certain items because there is no outright warning of this feature (which I don't think is a bad feature, just an important one to mention)
(take with a grain of salt as I only played a few games) 3: Matchmaking seems to not be too good right now. Granted I only played a few games, but in each one my team got stomped. Granted it could be I was the problem there, or I simply picked a bad hero leading to a worse experience (I picked the green necromancer looking guy, because that's my favorite aesthetic), but either way I felt I was going against and playing with others who had more experience in the game than I had.

Overall, I find the problems with this game are those many games that have been out far longer and by larger companies still deal with. Making it forgivable since this is still early access. any other issues I have would either be nitpicking or most likely misinformed from the painfully small amount of time I played. This is mostly just here for the developers to know what they may or may not want to look into from a newbie grabbing standpoint.
(and if the devs are reading this, thank you for reading and please consider some kind of response system for things outside of bugs in the game. Such as an occasional poll on balance issues and the feelings of if champions are well rounded or not. probably with a minimum playtime requirement. That way people who do actually know what they are talking about can help point out any lingering issues that might exist that aren't purely 'code did an oopsie')",1670614264,1670614264,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I told myself that I would not get this game early access. Just to avoid another Fault: Elder Orb fiasco, where they just dipped on the development. Nah Predecessor is exceeding my expectations. I thought Overprime was going to be the next big thing. But Overprime is just bland and needs too much re works on characters. Not to mention all of the heroes in Overprime to unlock are around $10 each. Just horrible. It might look pretty but the mechanics are clunky and some heroes just do not feel right or game break. 

(Fault: Elder Orb)
Just a pushed project that felt like a cash grab by strange matter studios. But who am I to judge? The project failed and they do not plan on any refunds for pre early access through steam. They promised so much but they only dug deeper and deeper. The community and mods of the server itself were just unwelcoming. Fault Elder Orb is the reason why I am afraid of paid early access. 

(Paragon The Overprime)
Do not get me wrong. The game itself looks PRETTY ASF. Some visual bugs that could be squashed. But like I said in the  beginning, Just the mechanics are not there. It would take the team to rework the map, sets, abilities, and hero rework just to make is right. The issue with this being F2P so early, Is the cash grab hero purchases being super expensive. Takes around a week or two just to save up with weeklies to get a hero unlocked, and more weekly grind to get skins. Just all around bad practice to do.

(Predecessor)
There are minor bugs and a few things missing. The game play just feels right. people communicate more especially the new players to this game. The mechanics are SOLID. They give me the feel of paragon itself and what direction it should have gone. Visually, the game looks stunning. The characters do have a few minor details like expression missing but that's fine, it looks like a few have that already. For example, Narbash is filled with emotion just like in paragon and looks like they added a few things too. Gameplay, man oh man. the ping system. its OG OG. How it should be. Amazing to use and to navigate. pings are super subtle on map, but the noise queue makes up for it to make you look at it. I am glad they took monolith and gave it a face lift it needed. Camps make better sense than the other games by a long shot. Buffs are great to fight with but the lane buffs for solo and duo lane could be better in my opinion. The fights and info screens can be a bit much at the same time where the HUD will take alot out but still playable. Maybe add an option to remove certain HUD out? Other than that the game is SOLID. I was afraid to purchase the early access. I really was. But I caved with all the promise and hype they implemented. All the clips they have shown should not be taken for granted. A little bit of polishing of heroes and this game is set up for success.

Buyers beware! The devs have fully noted the paid early access, and have forewarned everyone via social media. This product is non-refundable through steam. You purchase for the hero unlocks and the access itself. They may have a plan how to unlock heroes that hopefully will be if not better than what Overprime has at the moment. They will share that information later on hopefully on time needed on hero unlocks and skins. I know they will not disappoint.

Predecessor has a less of a height difference than paragon and prime but still plenty of places to get up to that only certain movement abilities will allow you to go to The game is slower feeling but still the same speed as paragon but slower than paragon prime. Graphics are clean, Servers are good, I average 20 ping and no spikes. All of the heroes seem relatively balanced.  All of the items are very well tuned but I wouldn't always follow the recommended builds as they are not optimal and dont provide flexibility.

Especially cause it seems like they learned from all the other developers that got heat from their respective communities.

5 heroes will be released during the 6-12 month beta

Predecessor is a superior MOBA because they nailed the fundamentals across the board with an obvious focus on gameplay. You can play any hero for their role and learn to do well, because they are balanced!

The game runs on Unreal Engine 5 which makes the game run like a brick on my computer whenever I get into team fights; however, I also have an old and outdated CPU. Aside from that, the card system is unique, the heroes all have unique abilities (most abilities are the same from Paragon with some differences in certain heroes kits), the map is okay (from my perspective), and the matches usually aren't too long (ranges between 25 minutes to 45 minutes with the occasional 1 hour match if it's super sweaty). Overall, it's not bad for an early access game.

Here's the catch, it's still an EARLY ACCESS GAME. The devs focused on inserting more heroes into the initial launch of the game along with updating the game's engine from Unreal Engine 4 to 5. This caused them to have less time to work on performance, bugs, and balancing the game. The melee in the game feels FANTASTIC while the ranged heroes feel kinda awkward. If you prefer to play ranged heroes, go play Overprime. If you like melee, then stick with Predecessor. Just know that there are some heroes who are very strong as of right now and some heroes who are practically useless so if you're an ex Paragon fan and you're wondering why your main character kinda sucks, it's because the heroes aren't perfectly balanced.

Here's my advice: give it a try. If you don't like it, wait for the devs to push out updates to the game now that they have more player feedback. If you don't want to risk it, that's fine. In about a year from now the devs plan on releasing Predecessor as a free-to-play game once early access is over.",1670607426,1670607426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can't believe I'm saying this but the Korean knock off Overprime is the one that doesn't feel like an asset flip.
This version of Paragon feels like it has no direction, and feels like it has no soul and that hurts so bad knowing the people behind it. It's an early alpha playtest quality at best, with the free assets from Paragon given by Epic, and yet it plays so lifelessly.

Side note: I've read elsewhere that you can't refund this game, as it is DLC and not a game. I'll be holding on to it either way to see what the devs do with it.

[h1]Ui design is awful.[/h1]
Selecting a character doesn't give you much info on select screen to tell if they fit your role even.
Once in game they give such poor direction that 3 separate people I had try the game could not tell where they were supposed to go, left lane or right lane.
The scoreboard stretches across the entire screen, with only a little info that could be halfscreen size like any other game.
The map is unsaturated with no icons only colors, giving such useless info that I could not tell what was an objective and what was a jungle camp for 3+ games.

[h1]The gameplay feels soulless.[/h1]
The camera controller feels like a free asset, and jitters when moving up and down elevation.
The movement is so stiff, it feels like Smite. That's not a compliment.
Attacks are so difficult to understand distance on because a transparent blue arrow shows your farthest range and it's on the ground, where you can't see it when aiming at enemies. ??? Who thought that was okay?

[h1]Scaling is non-existent.[/h1]
Power differences mean next to nothing across the game.
By 30 minutes my team had multiple people who died twice as much as they killed, and yet we were able to get to their core before they could get to ours. 
How was a guy with 18 kills and 5 deaths not able to stomp my team with a 3 item advantage?

[h1]Sound design[/h1] 
Feels unbelievably lacking, the music or lack there of is so terrible it's just literally the sound of wind.
No music, just wind.

[h1]Bad at conveying information[/h1]
Most importantly, even though I've played many MOBAs for thousands of hours, and played Paragon, and Overprime, I could not for the life of me feel the game state as anything meaningful. Are my towers being attacked? Probably or maybe an enemy walked past them. Are we losing terribly? No we're actually stomping the enemy. 

It's just so bland that the visual language of the game doesn't convey anything to you clearly or efficiently.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Devs took the Paragon assets and made a game that feels lifeless, and can't be refunded as you're buying DLC to play it and not the game. Gameplay feels unenjoyable and weightless, movement is stiff, UI is terrible, there is no music, and it feels lifeless as a whole.

I would recommend watching a video on it if you are new to this genre. If you aren't new then i would recommend looking through the heroes before you go into matchmaker. Figure out what they can do before loading up a game.

Canned advice:
-Lock in your hero selection
-Don't dive towers unless you know what you are doing
-Don't jump into fights where you are outnumbered 2+ to 1
-Minions and towers will shoot you if you hit a hero so don't if they are close
-Check the enemy heroes level. If they are 2+ levels higher don't try to 1 vs 1 them
-Get into the mid to late game team fights and roam the map at that point.
-For all Carries: LAST HITS! Your support gets gold and XP from them too so if you don't get them they suffer too.
-For Supports: DON'T TAKE THE CARRIES LAST HITS. They need them to scale damage into late game.
-Play your role. If you pick Carry role take a Carry Hero. Mid Lane pick a Mid Lane Hero. There is a filter in the matchmaker.

It's a fantastic game, well polished, with promises that the rest of Paragon will make it into the cast as well.

The lack of a report or punishment system for bad behavior has emboldened people to just let their absolute worst out as if ruining their teammates' fun is the most optimal way to get to the next match.

The game also has a surrender button, which I view as a huge flaw. Fragile people will give up or start arguing after the slightest mistake because they are no longer having a ""good"" game, and then they will sit in fountain and call surrender votes until you give up on trying to 4v5/3v5 or whatever. One way to ameliorate this (in addition to removing the surrender button...) is to do what DotA did and give players bonus gold/xp when they kill or assist in killing a player that is more farmed than them.

I have a few things to say about this game. (currently in EA)

Pay in to early access should come with extra steam keys, 1st bundle - 1 extra, 2nd bundle 2-3 extra and 3rd bundle should have 4.
it will grant more incentive for players to opt into the Early Access, i believe once the cosmetics start coming out you will make money back from that.


Predecessor fells fluent, smooth and well really good to play, most launches over the past few years of any game has been a buggy mess, to Omeda, thank you for putting so much time and passion into your game, there is only a few bugs. (Early access by the way)

The only bug i have encountered is a disconnect to game server for no reason, happened at the start of the game and i could not get back in. it has only happened once.

MY OPINION WITH THE CURRENT ROSTER.

Crunch is overtuned, he is exactly like he was in paragon and i feel like that isn't a good thing, his burst and cc makes him near impossible to out play, but he feels so good to play, combo's flow perfectly, but the damage output is a little too high.

Riktor is and has always been a great support, the only issue i have with him is that his hook feels clunky, loosing the ability to look around feels really bad IMO, i don't know how anyone else feels about that.

Dekker is in a really good spot, her changes are well thought out and she feels much more impactful in predecessor.

Feng Mao feels a little too weak, maybe i play him wrong, but going up against him or playing him doesn't feel the greatest.

THE ITEM SYSTEM.

Crests are great, a passive to active card for the price of 0 is a interesting choice, but it works well.

some items feel lazy, a direct rip from other games like League of Legends, but it isn't entirely bad, it allows players to come from other moba's and pick up the game fairly easily.

Building to T3 items is more efficient than building multiple T2, though building multiple T2 will grant you a bigger powerboost midgame, i think that needs to be reworked? who knows, maybe i am crazy???

TUTORIALS

IT IS A MUST! New players do not know how to play the game, force a player into a custom practice instance, where they pick their role and learn to play said role, it is a poor experience for the newer players and older players when they are loaded in and dekker is duo jungle because she is lost.

TLDR:

Great game, feels good, only a few bugs. a few characters need tuning and item progression does to, maybe? Please help newer players out with a tutorial custom to each role.",1670467446,1670556643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Sounds on the Champion selection screen. A little notification sound to let you know its your turn to chose would be helpful. Stuff like that.

2. Make the map look better. idk if its just my graphics but pics of the characters are to blurry and small. i can hardly tell who they are, some times they are confusing. I get Grux and that tank guy mixed up all the time on the map.

3. Update the UI both in and out of game. Its just sad and i find it lacking. 

4. Give us more info on the end screen. Like how much damage  each of my items did. how much magic and physical damage i did or took total. Also labeling everything at the top. I still cant tell if the gold number at the end is my damage or how much gold i made. Even if you dont want to label them let me hover over it and see what each one is.

5. Put in a rank system and please fix your item search. when i was only typing half the word it wouldnt pull up what i wanted even if i hit enter. Maybe have it auto populate. Also allow us to create our own builds out of game and save them. Or somehow import them into the game with the auto buy system.

The game is boringly simple with a UI that got 0 attention and items that were copy pasted from league of legends.And the excuse the developers and their fanboys use is ""they have vision"". Sadly, vision alone creates dead games in the MOBA market, and all the proof you need is in the player numbers.

I was very excited for this game because Paragon was always presented as this ethereal masterpiece integral to the MOBA fan experience, but that was taken from us by the greedy Epic Games that wanted to fund their Looney Tunes shooter. Something that was apparently liked by everyone but somehow nobody played it. So I grabbed the 10$ package and went in a game. Mind you, all the Paragon players said this is exactly what Paragon used to be before it got its plug pulled.

The first thing I'm greeted with when entering the game is the main menu of a ps2 game. Not that that's wrong, but not something I'd expect from a game asking me for 10$ in 2022. Started a game and found one instantly. I get to play carry so I pick a dude that looks like he's out of Mad Max. I proceed to lose the lane and game. I expected that, since carry is my least played role in all MOBAs I played before. So I get in another game, play jungle and pick a character that looked very appealing. I had a... not terrible time. I hard stomped the enemy, but the whole game felt like 40 minutes of just hitting camps with a stick, hitting 1 enemy with a stick, get an objective (or not, depending on my team's willingness to play the game), rinse and repeat for both teams until we all got to the endgame and the team with the slighter advantage would win. Not a bad core loop, if you are DOTA. If you have very complex heroes with crazy abilities and builds with 6 active items that change your game plan entirely once aquired then by all means stretch the game to be 40-60 minutes of farming and small skirmishes so we can enjoy every part of the game. But Predecessor has the most basic design choices for every hero in the roster. The characters can be compared to oldschool League of Legends (season 0 and 1 where all characters had stat stick abilities or a skillshot, maybe some CC if we felt spicy that day). So you have games that can easily last 1 hour (worst case scenario) where all you do is look in the general direction of an enemy and press buttons on cooldown. The happy scenario is when the carry gets fed. Do that and there is no such thing as a comeback mechanic. A fed carry melts through anyone and with minimal peel can wipe an entire team. That's the 15-20 minute happy ending. But if you are not the one stomping then you have 20 minutes of practicing your cheerleading skills.

The graphics are made on Unity 5 but somehow look very mediocre. Either it's the assets that are being used or something on their end, but the world feels like someone spalshed water on a painting so all the colors are watery, blury and all around unpleasant.

The UI was the result of unpaid child labor outsorced to some tribe in Africa. There is no way anyone would willingly put out a game with the UI that looks like the ""Elden Ring UI if it was made by Ubisoft"" meme. So much clutter everywhere, full of unnecessary information, icons that don't need to be huge covering the screen, a scoreboard with opacity at 100% that blocks the entire screen and map and more.

The items are the bonus they got from the unpaid child labor as a commissioning ""thank you"" from them. You have different flavors of sword, bow, crossbow, book, amulet and armor with different colors on them. All drawn in the sand near the house where the UI design happened. And 95% of the effects are straight up copied from League of Legends.

But it can't be all doom and gloom right? The reviews are all positive! Well, sure. The game is polished. Not that it has a lot to polish. Everything is so simple in this game there are no bugs to iron out. Every interaction between characters can be described on a piece of paper. The animations don't look janky. Because they barely have any frames at any bonus attack speed so they don't have a lot to fuck up there. The map is exactly what Paragon had before it closed, no stone moved. So that was done by the other team, no need to fix what isn't broken. What's there to fuck up then? Yeah, there were no parts of my pc melting due to shit optimization so that's good. Expected that from a 10$ paid EA though. 

In my eyes, the reviews are positive due to one single reason: nostalgia. The people that play this game and defend it to their last breath are the true Paragon fans. The fans that loved that game. Predecessor is like a letter from a dead relative you find after they passed away in their drawer. It's addressed to the family. But it is written in gibberish by a dementia riddled old person, with scribbles and random lines take the place of words after half a phrase. It's sad, it only opens an old would and it brings 0 closure to anyone. It just makes you ask ""what could have been?"" for the 4th time in a row. But you still try to find meaning in that letter, because you cannot accept the sad truth. 

Paragon was never that great, and making a crappier copy of it 4 years later is just a waste of time and money. 

Now for the people like me that just want the Paragon assets again cause ""Space mage guy named after Gravity Falls kid"" looks cool and I wanna drop meteors in third person without having to deal with Smite's graphics, there's Overprime. It has nothing to do with the old Paragon gameplay. It plays more like a battle arena with both team being able to swing the game around. I hate the short games because stomping an enemy isn't fun. The 40 minutes game where you clash in 3 teamfights before someone can end the game is amazing. Coordination in a teamfights is arguably harder than macro play, and much more rewarding. The game feels complete and the devs are very receptive to community feedback. Overprime initially got developed by a guy that loved Paragon, made a small team then the team got hired by a korean company. The same love, if not more, is put in Overprime. I hope to see Predecessor make a comeback, but for now it brings nothing of value to the table.

I predict that this will not persist vs Paragon: The Overprime and end up like fault rather soon, which i do not wish for, but you can't beat free to play, more heroes and more optimization. The only selling point is the main map which the game take place on, but i dont prefer one or the other, i find them both good.",1670536454,1670536454,False,0,0,0.491803258657455444,0,True,False,True

What were they doing for 3 years and 20 million dollars? Overprime is light years better than this. Predecessor is frustrating, boring, slow, broken characters, no counters to stuns or ganks, just a mess.

Every single aspect of gameplay is frustrating and punishes you for playing. For instance, in Predecessor you have zero visibility and virtually zero escape options out in the field leading to almost instant death and frustration when playing the obj. Push a little too far? Enjoy a  kalari being completely invisible living the good life and one shot you. Miss the one milisecond window your ward disappears? Enjoy no other information on a coming gank and your instant death. No footstep sounds or audio, nothing. Oh well you can dodge 2 inches in front of you every 5 fuggin minutes is your only response.

Hitting enemies - minions and Heroes feels completely limp and unimpactful. You can never tell what you're hitting and trying to last hit minions bunched up like sardines is nigh impossible. In team fights you're basically GUESSING where your bullets go because like I said NOTHINg feels good.

The heroes are even worse, they literally took every single generic, uninspired hero Paragon had and pasted them here, but removed their most exciting abilities. I mean Drongo? lol. No skins, no rewards, no masteries to boot. 

Combine that charging you 20 bucks for who knows what on a supposedly ""free to play title"". They did this because they know the majority of people will move to overprime, because it is light years better so they needed a quick cash infusion before they go bankrupt. I was supposed to get skins and gold but see nothing. 20 bucks absolutely wasted and it sickens me I spent it.

Steam forums are a mess, mods ban you for the lightest, smallest reason - no one is actually talking about the game and it's ""fun"" mechanics, they are talking about how much better Overprime is.

Overprime is the superior paragon clone and I hope this thing crashes and burns like the money grab it is. See ya!

First off: No silly, overwhelming amount of cosmetics. The focus here is making the framework of the game work before there are lots of traditional MOBA cash shop items.

Second: Optimization is amazing, right out of the gate. They have put a lot of effort into making the backbone mechanics, game play, and heroes work really well. Have had no crashes, stutters, or other issues while playing this game.

Third: Core game play and the game already is extremely fun. Want to see more progression systems/hero leveling systems put in later once the game is further down the line but over all amazing job with the core game play and how fun this game is at EA launch.

Regarding Overprime, it is a very fun game, with unique mechanics, good and clean UI and superb graphics. The gameplay is intuitive and the scenery is the most beautiful I've ever played.

anyway, back to Predecessor. While the game currently does not have ranked and only has 20 heroes, they are committed to releasing at least 5 more heroes throughout the course of early access that will last up to a year along with ranked mode and eventually the rest of the heroes from the original game. 10$ for 25 heroes is a STEAL considering how polished the game is at the moment.

Graphics: It is unreal engine 5 and it has one of the best graphics that I played, third person is immersive and it has that feeling of RPG games.

This is still Early access, so things are subject to change. Whenever those changes may come, I will adjust my review accordingly.

I am playing this game with max settings on a 1920x1080 144 refresh rate monitor with some cheap Ryzen 7 2700 cpu and a 1080 gpu. My specs are pretty trash. Results may vary.

The good:
• Map visuals are actually outstanding
• Gameplay feels smooth, sharp, and pristine
• Game details are pretty to look at without causing framerate issues
• Game is more like a traditional MOBA
• Being a 3P MOBA, there's verticality to it that makes teamfighting fun
• Uses Paragon (old MOBA) assets really well
• Time to kill is pretty acceptable
• No sketchy permissions

The bad:
• Game is Pay to play. Not everyone has $10+ to shell out (which I did)
• Items are pretty lame. Pretty much all Carry items give crit, which is insane
• UI and sound fx are lackluster
• Main menu is pretty lame
• Wards have no range
• Can't refund an EA game because you HAVE to buy a bundle to be able to play

The personal:
• As a support main, I felt like I couldn't tank any damage. This isn't my first MOBA btw
• Doesn't have sprint mode
• I couldn't utilize the ping function for some reason. I even reset all my controls
• Not a big fan of the whole active item system this game has going for it
• I don't like the new Dekker
• Muriel's face. Please revert it to her OG look cause the current one is EWWWWW

The ugly:
• Both Predecessor and Paragon: The Overprime (now being shortened to OP) have polarizing communities. I'm apart of both. Because both games dropped relative in time to one another, both communities have been review-bombing the other game.

Final verdict for yes:
• Enjoy a traditional, slower paced MOBA with Paragon assets (with a new character coming soon)
• Doesn't mind spending money for the full roster

Final Verdict for no:
• Gameplay and combat feels too slow
• Doesn't want to spend money

I've postponed my review until the release of competing Paragon: Overpriced title which turned out to be korean cash grab all complete with evil monetization, insane privacy-breaking EULA, and kernel level rootkit spyware, so it's clear that

[b]Predecessor is the better Paragon game with brighter future.[/b]

While Predecessor is missing quite a few QoL features especially on UX side,
the [b]core is very solid[/b]:

[list]
[*] enough players 🥳 - Even in paid EA, I was able to find match at any time within roughly 1 minute in queue (EU)
[*] great performance - it runs extremely smooth on Ultra details, fast loading times
[*] decent netcode - I've noticed no issues related to network (!)
[*] fine controls - feels good to play with Quick Cast enabled in settings
[*] decent map with some verticality - positioning is important, map awareness is critical, play is tactical
[*] nice heroes and kits - heroes feel unique, abilities feel impactful
[*] sufficient balance - no hero felt horribly broken/OP
[*] role selection - no need to argue about who plays what, no instalock mid etc. (idiots still happen ofc)
[*] 30 min games - I'd prefer average game to take 20 mins, but 30 min is still bearable
[*] access to all heroes - I don't enjoy grind (this might change after EA, dunno)
[/list]

What I don't like:
[list]
[*] item shop - I never cared about items. These are uninspired and shop UX is horrible - I simply play with auto-buy on and pretend there is no such thing 🙈
[*] team communication / pings - some people seem to be able to actually ping what they mean, but I still didn't discover howto do that efficiently in the heat of battle
[*] lack of deeper post-game stats
[*] not enough time to write GG (or alternatives) to your team after game end :)
[*] no punishment for players who are outright acting as d*cks and ruining entire games
[*] lack of features that is expected of EA - these can be added later on top of the solid foundation
[/list]

I already got my 10 € worth out of this game and I really wish Omeda Studios use all the monies to realize full potential of this game.

The dev team is composed of former players and fans of the game who knows what Monolith era was (before New Dawn, the last revamp from Epic that made the game die in a few months). They did a great job at balancing and reworking the characters as well as reproducing the feeling and overall ambiance of the game/map. They went with an item system instead of the OG deck of cards to make it more classic MOBA players friendly (potion, ward and flash are there by default) and added some interesting new mechanics (a crest item from the start evolving throughout the game). Also, every character from the original game will make it for release and there are already 20 of them available (+1 each month until release).

Yes there is no ranked, daily missions, shop, skins and such for now, but this will come in time and what they have to offer already is quite reassuring for the future (be it the graphics, performance or gameplay). Also the fact that they have been able to gather considerable fundings will prevent the project from dying like Fault did.

Yes Early Access has a cost (10 bucks for 2 weeks, 20 after that time window), but you get all the characters unlocked, even the ones that are still waiting to be added. It will be F2P when released, so it all depends on your will to play right away and support the time and effort from the devs to bring Paragon back to life. 

In comparison, the other Paragon project (Overprime from Netmarble, a greedy korean mobile game studio) is F2P, but unlocking a characters is either 10$ each or weeks/months of grind. Of course, overpriced skins for characters are already available to buy. 

People need to be aware that Netmarble just used the name and assets from the original game to reskin one of their projects (that they had trouble developing and marketing), to get some visibility. They are just playing the card of opportunism.

TL;DR: Predecessor has been made by fans and Early access is very cost/time effective with all chars unlocked. Overprime has been made by the korean mobile game studio Netmarble, is F2P but unlocking 1 char is 10 bucks or weeks of grinding and there are 15 chars out of 27 playable during a rotation (plus they just reskinned one of their projects to gather players interested in a Paragon remake).",1670499224,1670500644,True,2,0,0.523576796054840088,0,True,False,True

Those who've played the original Paragon will remember the orb prime mechanics where you'd be playing a game of rugby to get the orb into one of two pools. The 'home' pool was the only way to recover your inhibitors, an essential reset when all seemed lost. 

Then the harvesters, a unique jungle mechanic where a jungler can actively give his team an edge without even ganking. 

Though I don't exactly miss the old card system, the items in Predecessor are uninspired and can be found similar to items in other MOBAs namely Smite and League of Legends. And as much as I like to build crit on adc, not every 'hunter' item in the game should give 20%.

Sure it's the only real 3D MOBA on the market but due to the map design it hardly feels like it. The only real vertical movement is in aiming at a howitzer in his ult or kallari jumping over. 

Given it's earliest of access I won't comment further on the horrible balancing besides to say that 'the game needs work'. 

Finally the fact that no new (non Paragon) character has been developed yet is a red flag regarding the developer's capabilities.

I played Paragon from the first day it was available until the last day it was alive. I played it a whole bunch, I had about 30 days of total in game time in the span of the near 2 years it was around. Compared to others, it may seem minuscule but I was young and in school with a job for the entire duration. I was extremely competitive in the game and actually enjoyed many things about the alpha updates, such as the slow movement speed, the risky but rewarding sprint mechanics, and the long methodical games. I never became a large member of the community but to this day my skills and understanding of this specific MOBA are top notch.

Now for the review. Numbers below it.

Predecessor is not Paragon. But it does feel like it. That is a good thing. Paragon was one of my favorite games, it was a terrible game. The developers rarely listened to feedback, the characters were always unbalanced and unfun to play against, no ranked modes, loot boxes, bad monetization design, paid card system, confusing and constantly changing UI and systems. If you didn't play Paragon everyday you would fall behind and get confused. The development switched focus and design philosophy after gathering a type of player that preferred the other design. To summarize, Paragon failed for many reasons, but one of the hard pills to swallow is that no one wanted to play it. It was drawn out, complicated, and down right boring at times.

Predecessor is not perfect, but it does not share the same flaws that its predecessor did. The average Paragon game lasted about 40-45 minutes even at the fastest game play levels. In Pred, it is down to 20-25 minutes, and shockingly, this does not come at the cost of the games pacing. I still feel like I am playing a full game of Paragon with the same characters and abilities that brought it to life for me the first time around. However, I'd like to view this as someone who hasn't played Paragon, as I think the majority of people will be in that boat.

I've played League, Smite, and Dota. I enjoyed Smite the most of the three as I enjoyed it's camera view the most. However, the systems of the other two should not be forgotten. Predecessor to me feels like a mix between League and Smite, and I think this is a great thing. The main problem with League today is how far it has fallen, people around you dislike you for playing it, the skins and shop system is so predatory it hurts, and the player base is toxic and mean. This has nothing to do with getting good. Many of the skills you have earned and honed in Smite or League will translate to Predecessor with just a little bit of practice and learning. It is absolutely able to compete with other MOBAs for my time playing the genre, this game is worth pouring some time into, it has deep moment to moment game play other than being in the right place at the right time like other games. You need to learn the map's terrain and how to move, and attack around it. This is much different than simply hiding in grass and waiting for an easy pick. How do you reach someone waiting from a cliff-side? Can I steal this buff through the wall? These are questions you may find yourself answering each match. There is no shop yet but I do believe it will feel more rewarding than the current models seen in games like Smite. You may spend nearly $40-$100 on a single bundle in that game. I would assume the higher prices in this game will reach $30-$50 which I personally prefer. And lastly for a short comparison, the player base is willing to help people learn, you will not be ridiculed for trying this game and playing it for the long term, and most of all the graphics and art direction completely destroys the competition.

No game is without flaws, especially not games with a small team of developers left to pick up the scraps of a game that destroyed itself. Predecessor's main flaw is its lack of characters available to play at the time of this review. The game is in early access with 20 characters where as Paragon at the end had 35+. And of course League has hundreds of characters to choose from and master. This is going to make a lot of people not enjoy this game, the variety isn't there yet, you are going to see the same characters over and over. This can feel frustrating especially if you aren't used to seeing this characters like I and many others are. However, I think patience is a virtue, and actually see this flaw as a small upside. You have the opportunity to experience a MOBA before it has 50+ characters and a large player base. Can you name the original characters that were in League on launch? Didn't think so. There really isn't a more exciting time to learn and play. As the UI systems are changed and added the game will become amazing in time, the more people who play it, the more likely this future is to exist.

Overall, Predecessor suffers from a lack of content and players as most games do. However, they have a large vault of old stuff to pull from and a hopeful team filled with new ideas to share. I think their continued communication will be helpful as the game progresses and grows. It is worth playing, do not pass up on this game, grab some friends, and give it a try. It is the easiest MOBA to pick up if you have never played a MOBA before.

I've missed Paragon since that moment and have been waiting, hoping to fill the void ever since. I've been following all of the remakes (shoutout to BritikHD) as they've developed, and Predecessor finally sounded like the version that I/the entire Paragon community had been waiting for. A new, better version of Paragon, fully supported by its developers. One that listens to its community, and focuses its initial efforts on perfecting fun and engaging core gameplay, rather than monetization/cosmetics, progression, or hero/map variety.
[b]Omeda Studios has accomplished this with Predecessor.[/b] While the game is of course not finished, they have been making steady progress since they began. I've been playing Predecessor since player-hosted lobbies being shared on Discord was a thing, and honestly the game was pretty rock solid, even back then. With early access, they continue to refine everything that needed to be refined, to the point where it feels like I am finally playing Paragon. [b]I'm not scratching an itch anymore, this is the real deal.[/b] I also think the fact they're asking for $10 for early access a perfectly good approach - it keeps the early access phase clear of people who might not understand the state of the game, and potentially dismiss it (and tell their friends and the internet), because it's missing features/playerbase/polish that they expected. 
Thank you so much Omeda for picking up where Epic left off.

There is no card system, it is item buying just like smite and LoL. Minions move at the same speed no matter what, you move incredibly fast and being near minions does not affect anything (unlike the old Paragon that that did effect things). Honestly player speed is WAY too fast. The graphcis do look good and controller and m&k both do feel smoothe. Also this is 1v1 top, 1v1 mid, and 2v2 bot (Support and ADC) lane oh and jungle. I hate that, HOWEVER!!!!! I have played a game where both teams played the old setup of ADC & Support versus Offlane. It was THE BEST not only most evenly matched but ALSO the most BALANCED game I have played. If the devs stop encouraging the LoL/Smite ways and just encourage yeah 2v1 for side lanes, this game would be SO much better, I would give a solid 7/10

I do not like and am severely dissappointed in the amount of changes to the mechanics in this. The only thing I can say is I'm gald it looks nice, and they kept the characters mostly the same. 
3/10 overall, because it has potential if devs just tweak two things it would be a good (not great) game. 

The following needs changed at the very least, 
- Lane changes (Change it back to how Epic had things balanced, with 1v2, 1v1, 2v1, and jungle vs jungle. The devs and some of the player base refuse to believe this works becuase ""It didn't in other MOBAs"" but IT DOES WORK Paragon made it wokr, AND Predecessor ALRREADY WORKS THAT WAY. They just need to encourage it as the main way to play.
- Get Vs AI implemented. 
-  Let us enlarge the map, its ridiculously small, a blind person like myself it is 100% impossible to see while playing.

Again, if AT LEAST the Lane change and map part is implemented, I would recommend this game.

Lastly, A WARNING to anyone THINKING of purchasing. You cannot refund the game becuase the game is purchased by means of a DLC.

I had bumped my score up to a 4/10 after playing more, however it is now back to 3/10 becuase the community is EXTREMELY! Toxic already. This is Ranked League of Legends kind of toxic.

This is probably the worst MOBA I ever played. I remember playing it on the PS4 when it was Paragon and everything feels pretty much the same. I forgot why I didn't play it that much then. I remember now.

THIS GAME IS BORING AND SLOW AS HELL

It all came back to me in my very first match. Most of the game was spent farming until every 5 minutes when every decides it's 5v5 teamfight time. It was well over half and hour but it felt longer. I don't think I've ever SUFFERED a win before.

I used to be a League player when I was younger ( I recovered) , and only get a MOBA itch every now and then. Take out all of the interesting designs, cool abilities, and style and you get Predecessor. I KNOW it's not because this type of gameplay restricts these elements because of games like SMITE, Paladins, Overwatch, and even Battleborn.

CS since 1.3, all CoD, WoW since vanilla...lots of arena. I can honestly say I think this is gonna strike BIG. Predecessor is much more of a moba than Paragon, this is not a brawler which is more aimed for a casual audience. Last night I was in a game and we laughed about how fun the game was etc, and I, with some distance to self said that I'm 31 and still playing this. Whereafter everyone replied with their age. Had to screenshot it, what a moment. Every guy in my team was older than I and we all loved the game.

 It's the perfect mix between aim, strategy, reaction time and all that (take WoW-arena, DOTA and add a little skill shooter into it). I just love it, I love it when skill matters and now we might get a DOTA skill-cap with prediction aiming, the variables are endless. 

High skill cap is what makes a game last, you have up to like.. 7 abilities, lots of items that reduce CD and just crazy extra stats for MAJOR BUILD DIVERSITY.  The map is beautiful, graphic engine runs so smooth, I'm at 170 fps locked with 6 second frame time on 3070 Ti. 
 It's so new, not that many items and still it beats LoL, Smite and dota in my opinion.

 The best thing is the movement and fighting, everything is on point.The hitboxes and attack-mechanics are FLAWLESS. Just an impeccable engine. Paragon has that too, but... it is just too casual. 

I'm so happy this game has come. Was playing Paragon on Epic before this released, also 6 years ago when it was newly developed. I liked it...but was a little ""shallow"", this game adds the MOBA-depth that I was missing. New WoW expansion? Warzone? Nah, done with those now. This is what matters for me. Really excited to see this thing develop into a big competetive title, also to see the TPS-MOBA genre brought into the light. Smite has nothing on this. 

Easily worth the money. I would have paid 50 euros for this.

""Paragon: Overprime"" are the sneaky weasels trying to milk your hard earned $$ from microtransactions for a simpler/arcade version of this game. These two games are extremely similar to each other, the map, characters, etc as they stem from the original Paragon game. They are obviously competing with each other, but this game (Predecessor) is run by dedicated/fans of the game and have put in the effort to raise money and build a team to succeed. Whereas the other game (Paragon:overprime) I truly believe will do the same as they did before, get as much money as possible from microtransactions before closing the game down permanently again (look up Paragon and the shady way the handle things some years ago). I believe in Predecessor and the team behind it and hope they will eventually gain the player base and finances to take over the full game. 

I bought this game not realizing what exactly happened as there are two same games ran by two different teams. I hope this will save players time and money on choosing the right game for them. However, at this point I can honestly advise that you play Paragon: Overprime as a casual arcade game and take advantage of the free access but not invest in any of the microtransactions. I also advise that players who truly are fans of the old Paragon game invest in the bundle to help fund the devs. New players to Paragon in-general I advise to only pay the minimum $10 to get access to this game which I highly recommend if you are a MOBA fan as it is an excellent game. 

KEY ADVICE: You are most likely lighting money on fire if you are investing in microtransactions for Paragon: Overprime as they have already cancelled the game after taking players money. Players who invest in this game/team are also at risk as they are competing against a giant, and have a chance to lose out to them. So it comes down to whether or not you want to invest in the good guys (predecessor) in hopes that they overcome and takeover the actual game, or invest in the bad guys and play for less than a year before they close the game down. Either way you are risking time/money wasted, but if I was a betting man I would invest in the team that truly wants the game to succeed rather than the team that has the shady history of stealing money/time.

hope this helps, good luck to you all",1670287558,1670438983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Queue times can be insanely long and in all my games there have been high latency issues. Steam (Valve) refuses to honor any refund after 2 hours of playtime which means you can theoretically go over that limit after a single match and will most likely exceed 2 hours after just 2 matches.

The game has potential but is borderline unplayable for me; and these issues will only get worse if player count decreases. I would hold off purchasing until the game is out of EA - at which point I will re-evaluate the game and update my review.

I have played them from their alpha /beta phases to how they are today. I understand that this game is in early access, but as it is right now this game is pure dog sht, and not worth buying or playing in the slightest. No customizable HUD, barley to none at all character voice acting resulting in the characters feeling boring, lifeless, lacking in personality, and generic, there is no diminishing returns on CC in this game. You can and will get CC chained to death in this game with no way to cleanse it aside from 1 or 2 characters, the ping system barley works at times, It is very hard to tell what is going on with the ping system because is way off to the side of your screen, with no way to change it, buying in the shop feels bugged at times, like when I try to buy an item for the character i'm playing. You have to triple click the item to buy it, and there is no way to change it resulting in you sometimes launching off the platform thinking you bought it just to have to walk back to go get it again, the announcer in the game does not tell you what is going on in the game ever except to say someone has died, mini map is way to small, critical hit items are very over powered, Most of the physical damage characters are absolutely broken and do way too much damage looking at Feng Mao, Grux, Khaimera, and Crunch. This coupled with the fact that towers do little to no damage means they can and will run you down under tower and kill you, and have enough hp to just walk out after doing so. I was once forced into JG because I didn't get the role I wanted, and ended up having to play jg. Picked Crunch and it was my first time playing the character and the role. Let me tell you this character is insanely broken. My whole team was feeding their brains out and on the fly I learned the the character's really simple abilities and proceeded to annihilate everyone I saw with ease. None of the ultimate abilities make you cc immune while casting them. Making the game feel really sht at times when you press your ult button and it just doesn't go off or just gets instantly canceled. There have been a few times where I'm playing someone like Howitzer or Gideon and I ult just for the character to go up then right back down because my ult got insta canceled by someone.

To sum it up this game definitely needs a proper balance team, full HUD customizability, better character voice acting, the announcer needs to be more involved in the game, Like letting the players know what and when they are pinging but obviously not spam the calls.

-the flow of combat is good

-creep farm doesn't feel too bad, though I will say it's not as satisfying as something like league. 

-Contesting creep is something i'm going to need more time to observe; without things like lane bushes and creep blocking abilities not being as impactful in predecessor... I don't know how this will pan out.

-the 3rd person view removes a bit of the strategy and mind gaming from the game; that being said, it makes for a really solid casual MOBA, something i've wanted for a long time.

-I have yet to feel like the any game of predecessor i've played has snowballed as hard as every 2nd game of league or DOTA does. Even if someone refuses to surrender, i've never felt ""trapped"" to the degree that makes me not even log into the afformentioned games anymore.

-any fight larger than 3v3 feels pretty unmanageable as a mele character. The tiny field of view at point blank range leaves much to be desired

-the game does not currently have enough characters, i'm already feeling a lack of content; without having 40 characters on full launch, I suspect this game will struggle to find a large enough player base for long-term success.

-the ping/comm system is absolute ass... DEVS, GET RID OF HALF OF THOSE USELESS PINGS AND SIMPLIFY PLEASE, I don't want a 7 stage menu to say ""i'm on my way."" Also, nobody wants to look at the chat box to find out basic comm info, unique pings and a distinct map icon/color is vital here.

I could just keep slapping up bullet points, but here's the gist; the game is a casual MOBA in 3rd person. While creep farm and 5v5 arams are not nearly as fun in this format, 1v1's and 2v2's are an absolute blast; and the reduction of economic snowballing allows  you to have some fun on the back foot. Don't expect this to be your main game; for most people, Predecessor will likely be like R6S is... a game you play 2 months on 6 months off.

b)the RoCo-style cash/shop also need replaced for pickups in field; should be constant 'airdropish' droppings to fight over growing more powerful as match continues along with a SIMPLE/QUICK means to upgrade gear quality at base ..should capitalize on the Squad-based aspect and thus 'some forced teamwork' and 'fun' should be the extent of deveopers intended 'strategy' here.. do better than throw us a shop",1670276316,1670388022,False,2,6,0.450148820877075195,0,True,False,True

I haven't felt the same amount of joy playing a multiplayer game since I downloaded paragon in 2016. 4 years ago was when Epic Games shut down their servers but they gave us the ultimate parting gift by releasing all $16 million worth of Paragon's assets for free in the Unreal Engine.

In my humble and honest opinion, I encourage people to buy into this game. Omeda studios is a diamond in the rough in the gaming industry and the fact that this game started off with just 4 guys who wanted to recapture the magic that was Paragon to become what it is now is a testament to their drive for making a great game.

Wards are a joke, there is no cleaver spots to hide them as the AOE range is very small...so basically you are putting it in the enemy's main path lol good luck not over extending. Some characters feel nice to play but then other feels very underwhelming. 

Also, dont be sad if you dont get your kills BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS BLINK FROM THE START(WHYYYYYYYY), so it makes characters(mostly melee) feel broken as they have 2-3 dashes making your life expectancy 0% lol youll love it as a jungler.
They you have cards/items like fenix that basically can turn every player into a Greystone(Mathew McConaughey).  Should not have to kill Kalari, Grux, crunch, etc. multiple times.  But all in all in feel like im playing a beta/alphav.3.

As of right now, no I couldn't. It feels like absolutely nothing has changed since the last alpha in terms of features/hero pool/bug fixes and while the basic structure is there and can be loads of fun its missing way too much for me to want to stick around. 

Pros - 
In game graphics pretty good
The bare bones structure is there for a moba. Hopefully with updates the game will improve
Feels good to play (has that paragon feel)
Lots of items in store (galaxy greaves is my fav lol)

Cons-
Many bugs
Alot of QOL/Features missing - ranked/store/game modes/skins/unlockables/No ultrawide support/UI - cluttered, no UI scaling/ etc. 
Development time - doesn't appear alot has happened since last playtest. Hoping updates don't take too long.
Questionable dev decisions (my ultrawide feedback experience)
Kinda making the game casual (?) (free potions and wards throughout whole game)

Ultrawide feedback experience:

10/23/2020 when predecessor had a test weekend I told smokie about the FOV problems with ultrawide resolutions and was told basically they didn't allow FOV changes. So basically too bad we aren't going to fix it. 

7/30/21 pretty much same thing, told him there were issues with Ultrawide but this time he said submit as feedback - ok cool.

12/1/2022 - Issue still persist. Now (hopefully at least) it seems they actually recognize it as a problem and are going to work on a solution for it after players kept posting it in the feedback section on their discord.. but why didn't they work on it when I told them over two years ago? Whats the point of play testing and reporting issues if you won't fix them or listen to the playerbase?

Comm system - basically full copy of paragons. Its old/bad/outdated. Idk why they went for a carbon copy of the comm system instead of fixing/improving upon it. 


Overall predecessor does alot of things right. Overall it feels great to play, and hopefully with more updates it will continue to be improved upon and Omeda will listen to player feedback. $10 for early access is pretty cheap but keep your expectations realistic as it really is an early access title lacking alot.",1670338332,1670363111,False,2,0,0.526523113250732422,1,True,False,True

Pros:
- Feels very much like parent game Paragon in gameplay and visuals
- good graphics, hardly any hiccups, smooth lighting
- character balance using item mechanics
- user friendly UI
- moderate learning curve if you have moba experience
- Good value for the purchase while on sale
- Good server quality

Cons:
- The most obvious, you cannot refund the purchase of a bundle. While I think it is worthwhile, If you just wanted to try it you have to be willing to give up $10 for the cheapest bundle, and if you don't like it I'm very sorry.
- EA, so limited content and repetitive nature
- Steep learning curve for inexperienced players
- MOBA, so it's not for everyone (to briefly summarize any gameplay issues people have)
- Frames are questionable, I have yet to see high performance in that aspect
- Potential region support issues

All in all, I love it SO FAR as I loved Paragon, but take my view with a grain of salt, it may be biased. Try to find people who may not have played Paragon enough to be swayed.

It looks and feels promising, I love it already, I took days off work to play it, and got 30+hours within three days of the early access release. In my opinion, the gameplay is significantly better than the Overprime version. Compared to Overprime, the art style is also more rugged, which I personally prefer. Controls are responsive, and input is snappy. The characters are unique and with interesting abilities, allowing for an expansive field to explore gameplay wise.

Truly the type of game I always hoped the original Paragon game would become.

I come from mainly a FPS background, and this game format was the only thing that converted me. Communication here is key, and playing with a friend will increase the level of enjoyment you may get out from this game. Learning the ropes yourself, and then teaching someone is also very enjoyable.

And if you dislike the idea of paying a measly 10 bucks for early access on this beautiful game, just wait for the official release which will make the game free to play, with absolutely no pay to win mechanism.

The predecessor community are a bunch of toxic moba purists who think Paragon being backed by a Mobile game company is an insult.

No game stats, no ranked mode, no store, no original item art, no original characters, no original innovations of their own. I'm an OG paragon fan who liked Legacy better and others think Og paragon is monolith when it died. But Predecessor is not even superior to Fault:Elder Orb and that game is now shut down. The average players have already dropped from 5k to 4k. It peaked on steam at 7200 players and usually has 1k to 4k players on it. That won't sustain anything.

As a fan of [b]OG Paragon[/b] from back in the day, I've been following the development of Predecessor for quite some time now. My time with Predecessor thus far has been nothing but a blast. The devs listen to the community and seem passionate about the project, and I would highly urge you to pick up a supporter bundle now to get right into the action, or alternatively you can wait until it's free to play in most likely a few months. The game runs really well on my average rig on high settings with no complaints.
   I haven't experienced any major lag issues, despite being from South Africa playing in a EU server. Also, it's just plain fun. I love experimenting with different builds on different heroes and I'm looking forward to seeing things improve in future updates. It's important to note that it's still in EA and that things still have to be added to the game, however as it stands, the game holds up on it's own.

Plus i can't tell if this is on purpose or not but all the ranged heroes' basic attacks are delayed for some reason, like why!? and please Oh please remove the blinks it is a absolutely brain-dead mechanic, there must be consequences to engaging enemy.[/i]

First of all, it's still an EA experience and needs some polish, particularly if you're playing with a controller and/or on a TV. That also means that certain features that are important to people may not be in-place, such as ranked mode and bot mode. 

Let's get to the important stuff though, if you're an old Paragon player wondering if this is the right spiritual successor for you: If you like legacy Paragon, this certainly feels an awful lot like it for the most part. The pacing of combat and cooldowns is far closer to legacy than the burstfest that was Monolith. That Paragon verticality is present in the map. There is an orb prime (but no dunking). There is no travel mode (not gonna lie, I miss it). There is no card system - instead, you have a more standard MOBA item shop. Do with all that what you will. 

In terms of controller support (which, to me, is like the main reason for this game to exist), generally speaking, it's adequate. You can definitely get through a game without needing to touch anything else (unless you want to type to your teammates, of course). But it's not 100% yet. Hovering over items in the item store during a match won't show you descriptions like it's meant to, and like it does if you're using a regular mouse to control the cursor. Menus in the game also aren't fully optimized for controllers. You can use the right stick and X/A button to navigate the menus, and work it like a mapped mouse, but for the most part, pretty common sense controller navigation (left stick to scroll in windows, canceling back out from windows, etc) is yet to be implemented. It's not game-breaking by any stretch of the imagination, but it's worth mentioning. 

It's also worth mentioning that this dev has plans for a console version, so I expect that the controller support is going to improve over time. 

Generally, as a Paragon refugee who detested what Monolith did to the game (before Epic put a bullet in it for good), I'm feeling optimistic about this. I'm having a good time playing and the devs are somewhat responsive on the forums, and they clearly have long-terms plans. And they've demonstrated that they've got what it takes to piece this project together. They've gotten a good-deal of funding over the years, got one of the original Paragon creators on-board, got a Paragon comp player on-board, and took their time to make sure that there is a functional game ready before making access public, unlike some others did with Paragon's assets.

EA gets a bad rep in general because games are released as EA in an abominable state with a focus in ingame transacions, but unlike those games, Predecessor is very polished albeit limited. Sure, there’s a practice mode and a PvP mode, but there’s no store, tutorial, ranked mode and player progression yet. To me this isn’t an issue as Omeda is focusing on gameplay first and foremost, which I hope results in higher player retention when the game goes out of EA and enters F2P with all missing features implemented for a wider audience.

Unlike Overprime, which takes a more brawler like approach while keeping MOBA elements, this game focusses more on being an actual MOBA. There are no shortcuts from one side of the map to the other and the focus is on building your kit, hero placement, timing, and map awareness. 

Do I recommend this game? Absolutely, but take EA into consideratio. It’s a unique game that offers the MOBA experience while controlling your character like a 3rd person action game. For me this makes the game more engaging and easier to get in to as opposed to MOBAs like League. Sure, you have SMITE but that feels archaic compared to Predecessor where you have more vertical mobility. 

If you don’t have experience with MOBAs, know that people can get competitive and sometimes toxic like they do in any other competitive game. That the game doesn’t have a ranked mode or account progression won’t stop them from letting you know how they feel. This shouldn’t be a deterrent but know that people will expect you to know how MOBAs work and how you should play. Luckily there’s a discord where you’ll find players who’ll help you learn the ropes and there’s a couple of players making beginners guides on YT. It’s an amazing game once you get the hang of it but be prepared to invest a little bit of time into it before you hit play now, you won’t regret it. If you’re unwilling to spend €10 for a game that you’re not 100% sure about, I suggest you wait until the game enters F2P when the game hopefully has an onboarding tutorial.",1670326681,1670326884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Currently there are mostly 2D MOBAs like Dota 2, League of Legends or SMITE (I know it [i]looks[/i] 3D, but gameplay is still 2D).
MOBA as a genre haven't been improving in any way for many years now: mechanics and features were heavily restricted by 2D gameplay and new characters or items of the existing titles didn't add much to the genre. Paragon was the only attempt to reimagine MOBA and the idea was really great, however the game failed.
As Predecessor came out, the reimagination of the MOBA genre continues. Since Predecessor incorporates 3D gameplay as well as best of the 2D MOBAs features - it makes Predecessor a very perspective MOBA that will drastically improve the genre.
Thus Predecessor is going to put all the other MOBAs out of competition once it is released.

To start with, heros in this game feel overall wonky, unbalanced, and just slow. Auto attacking and abilities feel very slow, unnatural and unimpactful to even use. 
The jungle layout is terrible. It is a corridor, extremely tight, claustrophobic and choky. The jungle offers no verticality.
Brawler tactics are heavily encouraged in this game, in part by the design and layout of the map and also in part by the amount of XP and gold that you get from killing enemies. I could roam the map as a support, endlessly ganking people, and the amount of gold and XP that I get is better than what I'd get from farming in lane, why would I sit in lane and even try farming when I could roam the map and out scale everyone by acting like a chimp. 
Everything in this game is way too god damn quiet, hearing anything that is going on around you is difficuly. 
This game is running UE5, yet its art and visuals look terrible. Compared to the art, visuals and graphics that other remakes have had, Pred is 100% bottom barrel compared to them. 

This game has been in development for 5 years, FIVE FUCKING YEARS, and it has little to no content readily available on its release.

I loved Paragon in its high time like everyone else, and after its shutdown this was the remake I was most excited for. I am unimpressed by this current state.

What it does good:
- Hero balancing feels pretty well rounded, for the most part
- Full ability lists with some characters having new abilities feels a little new while still feeling like the characters loved before
- Has a steady flow each game that does not feel too fast or too slow
- Game runs beautifully and have not experienced a bug or crash yet (or at least have not experienced a bug I have noticed)

What it does NOT do good:
- Menu UI feels bland and uninspired
- Shop UI is too barebones with no easy direction to items and feels too cluttered shopping through all items
- For as long as game was in development, feels like number of characters is lacking with strange picks for the returning cast (Drongo?)
- No shop so no characters have any extra skins you can buy or earn, minus the few from the purchasable packs
- No match history so I cannot see my past games if I want to copy a build or see what others are using to get a better understanding of items
- No report feature so when people AFK but do not leave, they get away for free
- 5 person surrender requirement with a 60 min cooldown timer...why?
- Every character gets a teleport away that minimizes a lot of the risk and strategic positioning so key in a MOBA
- Cannot choose consumable items yourself, ex: Carry gets potions, Jungle gets a damage burst on minions

I understand the game is early access. With Overprime coming out the same time just about, it just feels lacking when putting the two side by side. I was more excited for Predecessor waiting for release, but now I feel like I should have waited another year for the game to not have 3 - 4 characters per role (with not all of them even viable *cough cough* DRONGO???), no skins to personalize the bare minimum characters I even CAN play, and a barren UI that slows down the gameplay experience.

Balance of the game is absolutely terrible and have not put any effort into that aspect of it. Game is too slow and clunky and feels really bad to play. If you have more than 10 ping in EU or Asia there is too much lag and playing ADC is a nightmare. Last hitting is for some reason absolutely terrible, you have to aim one by one even as a melee hero.

Kalari, Crunch, Kaimera, Gideon and just not balanced at all so unless you pick them you just lose. You get ganked lvl 1 and get stunned and die and then then jungler just keeps camping the whole game and the vision in the map is horrible beyond any other game. Junglers can just jump on you from any direction and your escape ability has a 5 minute cooldown.

This resurrection plays like a MOBA, with meaningful build opportunities and objectives that can let you come back if you find yourself behind. Meaningful item counters mean that its possible to adapt to difficult comps and the item builds of your opponents. Exceptionally polished game-play makes this experience second to none.

As an OCE player, I was initially disappointed by the server locations at launch, however within 24 hours of going live, Omeda Studios listened to the community and put a server in Singapore, making it possible for us to play the game. That kind of rapid dev response is very encouraging and has built a lot of trust with me personally. 

The heroes feel weighty and impactful. Making epic plays using their kits or the thoughtful active items each hero gets feels fantastic, and each hero feels unique thanks to their kits and passives. 

For early access, Omeda Studios has achieved the most important thing, which is a game that feels great to play and a relatively well balanced experience in each match.

As an example of this, I was playing a match with a pre-made team, and we were losing quite a bit in the early-mid game. we were behind 20 kills, and our opponents had taken an inhibitor. Thanks to co-ordinated teamwork, taking certain objectives on the map and two well-played team fights, we were able to win the game. That kind of come-back feels amazing, and its great to know that despite the enemy having an advantage, good plays and good macro awareness is what matters more when deciding who wins a game. That to me is the quintessential MOBA experience. 

As it stand, this game does not have any ranked mode, or account progression, or even shop to buy skins in. This will turn off some players, and that is fair. I encourage those people to keep an eye on Predecessor regardless, as the core gameplay is so compelling, that once these features do make it into the game, I see this becoming a worthy game to invest time in for any MOBA fan.",1670299762,1670299762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is pretty close to OG paragon especially in its card system and build setup. You have a variety of builds to choose from and/or counter the enemies builds to compete in the match. Matches on average take 30-45 min. You can also get a comeback if your team starts off bad which i like. This is more of a moba than its counterparts. 

Cons: 

*pay to play early access right now. This will lead ppl not to try this game out. 
*character pool is low. 23 characters is not enough even in early access. Should've been closer to 30 characters
*some characters need a nerf or revamp on their scaling or abilities. They can become too frustrating to deal with especially if you can't react to the enemy hero for 2 seconds before they kill you. and you have full health mind you.
*the ping or communications need to be reworked. I'm tired of not hearing or not noticing notifications, especially when a teammate is urgently calling out something. These notifications need to be well seen and heard throughout the game.
*Graphics could be better
*need details on how to play a specific role, alot of new players are trying this out and have no idea how to play their roles.
*needs more places to hide. This will make encounters/disengagements/ambushes more interesting
*need to lock roles in the drafting phase. Too many ppl try and do 2-3 adcs in a match which is dumb and trollish. In order to eliminate that the role needs to be locked off once a player selects a character appropriate for that role.

Hopefully the devs will take action on the things that need to be addressed as top priority before releasing any other heroes. Balance the characters that we have first before introducing new heroes or it will become a shit show.",1670291346,1670291346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Don't let yourself be taken aback by people just posting things like ""Money for a MOBA?!"" or ""This is just a bad game"". This game (and yes it is a full game at this very point) costs 10 bucks. Don't believe people who just say something is bad without giving valid reasons. So far, for me, there are truly no valid reasons to say this game is bad or not worth the 10 bucks you spend on it.

Also if the card system was implemented into the game then that would be amazing but I don't know if they are actually allowed to use that for legal reasons, or they just don't want that in their game.

If you haven't played, gameplay is very similar to League of Legends (even some of the same buffs / objectives / items / etc.). What you lose in info and stuff in terms of the RTS-style that most mobas tend to go for is some pretty engaging combat.

20 heroes at launch, so some positions (carry) feel a bit samey or restricted. But so far seems off to a great start, and replaces some of the more controversial features of the older game (cards, for instance, or their P2W nature) with more 'standard' alternatives (a traditional item shop to replace the cards in that example).

Loving it so far and devs have promised a hero release schedule of 1 per month during Early Access, and given Paragon's full roster, there will be some fun additions at a steady rate to add more diversity to it's gameplay.

Does feel pretty 'EA' right now (only casual matches and practice are in the game at the moment), but the game visually is polished and doesn't have any stability or performance issues on my end. More importantly the gameplay holds up on its own as it is to where it doesn't feel like I have to wait and come back once there's more here for me.

Prior to the end of Paragon the developers hamstrung the game by unnecessarily overhauling the entire item system and basically breaking the game. These developers seem to know what their doing with a very fun item system that is more less a carbon copy of the league of legends item system with a few tweaks. Some of the items are literally just re skinned league items so if your familiar with that moba you'll feel right at home here. This honestly just feels like Paragon, but better. 

""But I already play another moba, why should I try this one?"" you may ask. Well some of things that make this game (and Paragon that came before it) so enjoyable to me as opposed to other moba's are...
- The kill times, in games like league if your playing a squishy mage or adc, there are some characters that can delete you in under a second late game. As far as I'm aware unless you're very, very behind you'll pretty much always have a chance to react to your oppenent in this game. The fights feel fair
- You actually get to aim your auto attacks, and even fire while moving. This makes fights between ADC's a lot more skill expressive, both for the person aiming, and dodging. Line of sight becomes something that matters, and movement skills can be used to dodge attacks even if your still in the enemies attack range.
- The characters, this game has some tremendously fun and enjoyable characters. Some are relatively simple and similar to other moba characters, but others can be very unique, 
- The verticality. It adds a whole new dimension! You can use leap and dash abilities to reach ledges out of reach, or take advantage of high ground to fire upon enemies below. 

One downside for the immediate moment however is that not all of the original Paragon characters have been implemented in this game, so for all the paragon veterans out there don't necessarily expect your old main to be available (I can't wait to play as Grim again)",1670284641,1670284641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It still needs plenty of work. No progression atm, limited roster, balancing is currently a bit of a mess (though its offset by the learning playerbase not knowing much), UI issues, and a lack of character identity.

 However, the Devs listen. They are active on discord and give comments to the community. They hotfixed gamebreaking bugs (none of which I personally encountered) day 2, and added some anti-toxicity features the DAY they were requested. They also plan to bring back every original character from Paragon, which is a plus for me.

I love the slower pace of the game, and I'm very excited to seeing this game grow. I have enough confidence to get the highest package, though the 10$ one is more than plenty to support the devs.

If you want to influence development, buy it, join the discord, and talk the community. If not, throw it on your wishlist for when it comes out f2p, it'd help tremendously!

If you do not know the back story of this game, it was originally developed by epic games and it failed. They shut it down and focused on Fortnite.

For people who already know this game and had played paragon, this game is exactly what Monolith paragon should have been. it does not have the weird card system anymore. It has a traditional moba style item store.

The game plays really really well and feels smooth. It feels very polished. I have not came across any breaking bugs at all! The only bugs I've come across are just objective notifications not displaying properly.

The matches last 25 - 40 mins in length. At least in my experiences they have all lasted in between that amount of time. All the heroes feel very fleshed out and impactful. When I hit an enemy with an ability I can feel the weight of my abilities and or basic attacks hitting them, it simply feels really nice.

The Ui needs a bit of work. The only reason I say this is because there is just to much on my screen during the match and the item store menu is WAY to big.

The roster currently has 20 heroes, and they plan to add one each month of early access. Starting with countess, then huntress. There is only one game mode and that is the classic 5v5. There is a practice mode as well. They have a road map saying they will be adding progression, ranked, and much more.

This game has a competitor. That competitor is Paragon: The overprime. This game takes place on the legacy map with the sprint mode and portals on the map to get around faster. This is because the Legacy map is much much bigger. Overprime will have ranked, unranked and a progression system at launch on December 7th and more heroes. This game is backed my a big company out of Asia. The marketing for the game definitely leans into the Asian and eastern marketing style which personally I do not like. The newer heroes are very anime styled and so is the jungle camps. Both games are fun I have heard. Although I have heard many say overprime plays to fast and is way to kill heavy compared to Predecessors classic moba feel, but I have also heard it does not. 

In conclusion if you were a big fan of monolith paragon then you will love this game and you should get the Legendary bundle to support the devs. It is well worth it. If you are someone who has never seen nor touched paragon. I recommend the rare bundle. Definitely try out both games as well instead going off of others.

The reviews you see here that are complaining about paying money for EA must not have been paying attention to the Devs' messaging about what to expect from EA.

I sunk many hours into Epic's Paragon, and have played the other versions of this game which have also come out, and I wasn't as impressed by them as I have been by Predecessor.

Beware if you're purchasing the bundle for the coins as it is misleading and you don't get everything you paid for. You are also unable to get a refund as you cannot buy the base game separate from any of the dlc's.

This is in my  opinion a very deceptive sales tactic which shouldn't be allowed to be implemented. 

For the amount you're paying, you get one map with very limited features. Only upside is that you get a fair amount of character choices and I haven't noticed any significant bugs so far. But still not worth paying more than the rare dlc.

Which ended up dying due to it not being an enjoyable experience compared to other MOBA's at the time. Now, if you liked how the Old Paragon played and looked and felt. This is the game your looking for. 


  That being said that game died for a reason and Predecessor is just like it's predecessor. It's not anything special.  I'd personally recommend Smite, LoL(even with it's toxicity), DOTA2, Battlerite(even though it's practically on it's last legs as well), or even trying out Overprime when it enters early access on the 7th. Since each game has something special to them that quite frankly this game doesn't. 

  Edited on reflection. A couple of issues I have with the game that I didn't mention originally. If you didn't know all the character in the game at this moment are all available to use for free as assets in unreal engine4. As well as most if not all assets for the map and various NPCs. In addition they didn't implement a movement speed system at all. So, nothing slows you. So unless you have a gap close ability or use your blink you can't chase someone running from you. Even if they're backpedaling, Autoing, or throwing out abilities. 

  I personally, didn't enjoy this game in it's current state. If in 6 months to a year's time it gets better, i'll try it again, but until then i won't be recommending this game solely due it not being better than ""Meh it's alright"".

Gameplay is very optimized and almost never gets frame drops despite the great visuals for a MOBA.

For the south american community it is indeed a bit of a letdown not having SA servers, but if you played Paragon you`ll remember that they never had it as well. Playing on NA with 150 ms ping can be kinda rough but definetively not unbearable.
For me they got the priorities on the right place: the game is fun to play and runs very smoothly. There are some glaring balacing issues (who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to give Gadget a root?) but the game isn't out for a week yet, so lets hope.

The ""items"" system is a complete enigma. 

You have to pick a role before PvP matches, which gives you about 20 seconds to read the descriptions of the roles. The roles of Jungle and Support are marked as ""Beginner"", but it's unclear how you should play them.

Cons - Bugs are to be expected. There just happens to be A LOT of them. Item balancing doesn't seem to be very present. Audio design feels almost entirely absent from the game. Some characters feel bland or boring in their gameplay design (examples: murdock and rampage). No level progression. Selling bundles of the game at high prices for already made skins from the OG game, coins that can't be used, No AI mode for new players to learn and practice with, No ranked mode.

Pros - The Map design looks really nice and the layout is pretty damn solid (minus the jungle which is a little claustrophobic). Riktor is by far the most fun character to play as in here. Holy shit was he a blast to play again. In depth ping/call out system.

It's just clear that they pushed the EA release date because of the Overprime announcement to open its gates on the 8th of december.

Comparison with Overprime
Pros:
- Characters have some extra uniqueness, passives and kits that at times result to be original.
- Crest system rather interesting yet is locked to what role you get in the draft lobby. Preventing you to swap roles after the game starts eventually.
- Minions do draw some more attention due to their rewards and laning phase it's strongly skill-based.

Cons:
- Laning phase it's horrible, the damage output is so high from any pick that supports gain more efficiency by going full damage rather than protective items. One grab or stun and you're likely dead/achieving a kill.
- Snowballing it's unevitable and chances of a comeback are extremely low because of an accelerated economy that gives access to items that simply give you everything at once.
- Item system has got to be the worst aspect in here, Let's talk about ADCs: I'm not a fun of crit meta in mobas because usually you get to build 60% and end up gambling, so they did it right giving you access to 100% crit chances in a matter of 20min. But when every single item gives you: atk speed, power, crit-chance AND lifesteal too it does become a joke. Meta build right now is: 100% crit, 30% lifesteal, rather high atk-speed and power automatically high because every single items gives you that. You may think it's a matter of balance about ADCs but no this is a pattern repeats for every pick and the thing is that the way this game is balanced it's by making everything extremely tuned up giving birth to a literal arcade brawler arena with some towers.
- Roster is limited, compared to Overprime's there's about half a roster and nothing unique. But I won't stop here, let's talk about how the game is balanced on this regard: Every category of hero has its own pick and the rest becomes automatically useless or almost. See Crunch in jungle, I don't think I've ever seen anything more unbalanced than this hero in any moba I ever played. Howitzer? Literally the same. ADCs will just 1v5 whenever they get past half build with their 80% crit and 15% lifesteal. And don't you even dare take offpick in any lane, zero design.
- Game progression, it's rather slow but I don't complain about it, every game should be free to have a pace of its own, however, when the game is one-sided you still get trapped in this game for 30 min because there's simply no way to end the game unless people are almost full build or more (or unless the enemy team has no clue of what it's doing). Respawn timers are so fast that it doesn't matter if you just won your 5th team fight within <20 min, the moment you show yourself up in front of their inhibitor all you see is a few ranged skills deleting the wave (due to how over-tuned heroes are) denying you any poke the inhibitors. So not only becomes impossible for the enemy team to make a comeback (due to how economy works) but both teams are just there locked in till the progression gap is huge. 
- The map itself it's also weird, see you notice so many similarities to Paragon 2016 and this game when it comes to design, itemization, map... That I don't get how could someone think that Paragon was still the way nowadays, the map is small, full of narrow corridors that make teamfights a sh1tshow, consequently all you see it's an overload of graphical effects in such a little room of space that you wonder if you're still playing a moba or if you loaded up some Schwarzenegger Terminator movie where the only thing you see it's the entire world exploding. 
- pay2play? what exactly am I paying for? this is hardcore incompetence

New Review - I stand by the original statement but will breakdown my more critical thoughts
-People in their nature want shinier toys and this is where my major concern comes for Predecessor. Your main competitor (Overprime) has significantly better UIs, home screens, Shops and skins with a much larger hero pool 

My suggestion? 
--Double the 5 heroes re-released over EA to 10. Perhaps focus some of those slots on heroes that are not out yet on Overprime. 
--Redo your icons for the shop and its UI
--After those add your shop

You cannot pretend like Overprime isnt out there. They are, and currently they are the better ""looking"" product which is very important when marketing to gamers at the very front end.

Paragon has finally returned and this is by far the greatest remake of the classic game so far.

[h1]Game Play[/h1]
The game play in predecessor feels correct, the games are fun and dynamic and allow you to make a difference in the game that actually means something. As you build your items through the game you need to make decisions and changes based on what the enemy and your team is doing, not just the exact same build over and over again. Combos are satisfying and rewarding and really draw you in to the fights.

[h1]Technical[/h1]
The game runs beautifully and i personally have run into almost no bugs since playing. I have actually made a joke of all the super small bugs that i run into because of the lack of issues (Murdocks shell casings spawn on his gun and where he hits btw). All of the settings work as they should and if you told me this was a full release i would believe you.

[h1]Community[/h1]
By and large the community in most MOBA's is about as bad as you can get. Predecessor is no different. Without a proper method to report the problem players this will probably remain an issue for the time being. I trust the game developers are coming up with a solution in the mean time it is a minor annoyance.

All in all Predecessor has delivered and is the Paragon remake that we have all been waiting for. I can see this game going very far and will be playing it in the future!",1670190038,1670190038,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,1,True,False,True

Before I get into anything else, I just want to say how close this is to the original and how happy I am Omeda studios brought this back to us. It fills the Paragon-shaped hole that I'm sure many of us were carrying for the last 4 years. I know that Omeda  said they are prioritizing gameplay first and foremost. Still, I want to take off the rose-tinted glasses for a moment to address some very obvious issues:

1) Character selection requires you to lock in, which I don't believe is obvious for some. Other games will just pick who you have highlighted.
2) The Map (the one on your HUD) is a little tiny. Personally I would like to make it larger and somewhat transparent. 
3) The item store is a little chaotic, but it's clear that is just a result of it being Early Access.
4) UI is a little messy, also something attributed to the Early Access phase of the game.

NOW for the pros:

1) Fluidity - The heroes and their abilities play out very smooth.
2) Objectives / Structures-  They are not only implemented, they actually have value and strength
3) Continuity - Omeda didn't veer horridly away from the core of Paragon. Plenty of action with plenty of MOBA
4) Role Assignment - the queues are short and you always have a chance to play a different role.

Finally, my wishlist:

1) Hero Mastery - I loved the skins that showed how much time you sank into your characters
2) Nighttime - I doubt this will happen but a night-map would be cool
3) Character selection - Let the community vote on which Heroes to bring back
4) Better pacing - The matches are pretty fast paced, so playing someone like Sevarog to fully stack the passive feels weird to me as it seems more methodical. I think bumping the size of Monolith by about 30% will help things even out without messing with economy balance.

- Great Graphics for a MOBA
- Fun Action Combat
- Something other than LEAGUE!
- Great Character design
- Vertical Gameplay Mechanics (Such as Cliffs or Stairs that can be jumped off or over)
- Runs Great
- Ultrawide support
- Has Practice area to try characters and items
- Back door tower protection

CONS
- Missing Characters (Such as Greystone and Revenant)
- Prob a few balance issues with items and characters (Its Early access so scaling is still a thing)
- Needs a Tutorial for new players
- Games can sometimes take awhile even if you are rolling the other team (Unless they FF)

[hr][/hr]

With that out of the way however, it's missing a lot of QoL features. No after-match lobby, no simple way to re-match with teammates you enjoyed playing with, a poor location for your character's current stats (in the screen-filling shop window and not easily visible at a glance). These can all be chalked up to the game being fresh into Early Access, but by far the biggest impact to QoL is the messy ping/communication system.

The pings are extremely clunky and unpleasant to utilize, especially if you're coming from a game like Apex Legends or League of Legends. You cannot directly ping the map (at least with the methods I've tried), and the only way to specify a certain type of ping is to go through a chain of ping wheel options. In total, this radial system has [b][u]fifty-six[/u][/b] different buttons in the radial menu -- divided into four-option radials you have to click through -- and they're all for different things. On my way (lane), enemy missing mid, enemy stealthed, ultimate ready, attack (lane), etc.

This game can become very fast-paced, and having such a clunky communication system hurts the experience unless you're running with a team. The only rapid pings you have are with your middle mouse button, which lets you directly ping things structures to attack/defend, objectives, allies, etc. This works fine if something is nearby and in your line-of-sight, but it becomes unreliable if you're trying to ping someone or something at a distance that is behind an object.

At the very least, adding a click-and-drag radial for essential pings (on my way, danger, enemies missing here, etc) to the middle mouse button would be immensely useful. An interactive map on top of that which lets you do the same thing would be even better.

All in all though, it's still a brand-new EA title and I still recommend giving it a spin despite the lack of QoL. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",1670163804,1670163804,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
-Allow camera shoulder switch
-Fog of war on the mini map. 
-Bushes and improving off lane and duo lanes. They feel so narrow and cramped against jungle. Maybe remove the magic walls and place some bushes around those sections so it doesn't feel so cramped. Bushes will add a lot more strategy and tension to the game as well. Every MOBA has them for a reason.
-Minion AI. They would get aggroed and run really far away from fights.
-More heroes(early so they will come)
-Role Queue when there is a bigger player base",1670066677,1670151011,True,1,0,0.512820541858673096,0,True,False,True

-No bugs encountered so far in EA

Cons:
-Roles picked in prematch screen, not before queueing
-No time to chat after game, just a short view of the scoreboard
-No match history

Characters are mostly the same with a few tweaks to some (Howitzer RIP). In all I've enjoyed the games that I've played and am willing to be patient as players learn and adapt to the game and see what metas evolve.

The biggest offenders to me in terms of what needs to be changed are as follows:

-Sparrow is in desperate need of animations. The idle ""I'm always shooting"" bow stance looks ridiculous, and skill animations are bare-bones or non-existent.
-The Fey could also benefit from idle animations as they look like a statue with moving wings.
-There are other characters which could idle animation love, but the above two are the most noticeable to me. 
-Items are incredibly disappointing. Having played and enjoyed the old Paragon card system both myself and many of my returning friends have found ourselves wanting innovative ideas, not old rehashes from other game. While the items themselves are strong, they really do just feel like copy-paste items and icons (looking at you, League of Legends) and don't really feel as though they fit Predecessor's themes. Not sure what to do, but maybe something like ability augment cards and stat augment cards could be interesting. 

Balance hopes/desires for characters are as follows:

-The Fey balance wise feels alright. The E ability's ramping damage feels out of place. Most of the kit feels oriented towards burst damage, and I find myself rarely using it. Needing to spam E on an enemy seems a bit needless and its range seems shorter than both RMB, Q, and R thus placing them in danger. I like the bits of utility that the The Fey has, and maybe reworking E to be more utility oriented could be cool. Alternatively, E could have an RNG type of effect with three stacks that it rotates through. Casting E would place a plant that begins to bloom, and depending on the color rotation of the plant the effect of the bloom changes. Green causes add a timed debuff that slows enemies while in the jungle. Red is a fire plant that ignites enemy players that walk into it taking damage over time (in line with the RMB damage over time effect, perhaps just a shorter duration with higher burn amount). Blue is an ice plant that freezes enemies in an aoe when triggered. 
-Howitzer feels a bit short ranged. Would love to see a range extension on the missile launcher and other abilities. PLEASE REVERT TO HOWITZER'S OLD ULTIMATE. While is current ultimate feels fine, I much prefer the old massive AOE DOT that it would unleash.

1)The game is really stable for an early access. 
2)The developers have mentioned that all the funding will go to the game's development and not monetization,
speaking of which they only have plans for right now and dont intend to spend their budget on it yet.
3)This game fixes the issue of league of legends that is you get one shotted by the 200 year collective game design character,
4)it has a steep learning curve but once overcome you are basically good to go.
5) lovely character designs
                        -CONS-
1)Part of the steep learning curve is learning the map which doesnt work in a 2D layer, like smite or League. there are ledges and walls that make the map significantly harder to traverse even with characters who have blinks or jumps. 
2)Gideon can snowball like a madman and he is favored among Paragon like players. 
3)There is currently a bug but you need to actively attempt to do it. If you open your store while the ""SELECT CREST"" page is open buy an item. close store, start moving forward without selecting a crest and dont go back to spawnarea to pick a crest you are stuck without a crest untill you die and respawn and the crest page wont reopen.

Predecessor is in all ways the traditional moba, Just like League of Legends or Dota 2. Your have proper lanes with 2 towers, inhibitors, and the core. with a jungle area in between. It plays like those games too where you farm, poke, have an occasional fight, someone roams or ganks, you have wards for vision, you can either focus on split pushing or grouping with team, or try to get picks on alone enemies etc.
Overprime however, takes the moba genre lightly as it only has one tower per lane, then an inhibitor and core. The lanes are very weirdly made on their map, with mid lane being too small (you can see the enemy base clearly from yours in mid), and the side lanes being way too far to the right and left. It also has sprinting and portals for teleporting directly from one side to another, making it a more teamfight oriented game. You also gain less gold and items slower. So the entire mid and late game is simply running to the teamfight and keep fighting.

In short, if you want a proper moba experience with strategy and/or you are a fan of original Paragon, you will like Predecessor more. But if you want an action game that has lots of teamfights but also with limited moba elements, you might find Overprime more appealing.

Side note: Predecessor Early Access doesn't have a ranked system (it does have mmr for balance) and has less heroes currently, but it is very refined gameplay wise and has great performance even on weaker systems. Plus it is being refined in terms of UI and WILL have all heroes with ranked, rewards etc. The Devs are also super friendly and constantly interact with the community. Overprime does have a ranked system in their EA and more heroes with better UI, but has poor performance and issues on the gameplay side. Plus it's owned by netmarble who doesn't really have a reputation for long term support, and tends to make their games very money hungry and cash grabs.
So you also have the choice of playing Overprime until Predecessor fully releases which is somewhere in 2023 Q2-3.",1670072008,1670072008,True,35,0,0.753279149532318115,0,True,False,True

Most of the good reviews on Youtube say the game runs very smoothly and has no hickups with using abilities. For me, that's completely untrue and the game feels VERY unpolished. 

In-game fps counter is 100+ at all times and ping 20ms, but especially start of game and team fights are stuttering hell. When stutters happen, fps and ping meters don't go down.

Abilities are sometimes NOT going off when pressed with quick cast or instant cast. In every match I've played, if I'm typing and end up not sending the text, my character starts backpedaling even without pressing the key. This is unacceptable in a competitive game.

The ui is intrusive (way too big) and thus blocks important visual information. It is also unintuitive, like it was made for mobile games instead of pc gaming.

There is hardly any ambient sounds in-game and the sound feedback is non-existant. Basically for sounds, there's a bit of music and hero abilities, but hardly any voices for the heroes. 

Lack of features is also huge. There's zero progression (!), ranked gameplay, match history (!!) or even match-end stats (you can't even see how much damage you did in the match!!!). I knew all this before buying (yes, none of these features and you still have to pay for early access), and thought the game play will make up for it.


It doesn't. Most of the abilities and especially ranged attacks lack OOMPH. Again, action feedback is quite limited and with the unpolished game play (abilities not going off, stuttering) and lack of features, it feels like the game was given early access status way too early. With basically no progression and hardly any other features, the developers seem to think the game play will make up for it with unprecedented smoothness and polish. That's just not the case.",1670058387,1670059121,False,3,0,0.481871038675308228,0,True,False,True

Will update as early access unfolds but as of now it's in a great spot. Feels very fluid. Some hits could be chunkier, the sounds needs work in some places, and tweaks to general UI throughout and once all the features that are slated to be in the game are there it'll be a certified AAA title. 

Any core issue I have now would be just not knowing all the items/abilities and how they work yet, how to build and when to build the items which comes in time anyway. Any other concerns I know will be addressed throughout early access as Omeda has confirmed.

-Intense, competitive matches
-Build and playstyle diversity
-Most heroes are well-balanced and fun to play

--CONS--

If you were a fan of Paragon or you are a fan of MOBAs, or you just want to see a fresh take on team-based competitive action games, I highly encourage you to give Predecessor a try.

It's old 25 min phase II deathball monolith paragon back when it was busted and then taken a few big steps back. It feels like they rushed this release with only a quarter of the already small roster as viable. There isn't competition against the developed characters. Dekker, Crunch, and Drongo are much more powerful than anyone else. Murdock basically doesn't even have a kit while Drongo's silence hits like a Phase's blind. Why does Dekker have a powerful long-range wave attack, a lengthy stun, a mobility jump, and a cage with super low cool-down? Meanwhile Murdok sets tiny tiny traps that root for half a second and a touch range push that doesn't work. It's like some devs wanted old unbalanced paragon and some wanted their favorite characters to be superhero broken.

Otherwise, it's impressively smooth. It handles incredibly well. It's all the old game props restored so they're gorgeous. Not seeing any innovation, but it's pretty. I don't understand the item system so I left it as autobuy. The items look like free unreal clip art so starting to think the only original art they have in this is the omeda little checkmark logo.

I don't see this surviving. I'm not going to refund it because I want to support, but putting it out this unbalanced is a real janky sign. If others can enjoy it, I'll watch your streams. I'm not trying to be a 200 minion 10/0 fed ADC and get bodied by a dekker burst kit. I don't want to say 'yes' or 'no' right now. I need a 'throws up hands and walks away until later' button. Given there are so many positive reviews here saying nothing, I'll say no for now. I'll check back in a few months because I would like this work but... I mean... four years to cookie cutter the map and make super Dekker? really bad hype.

Definitely do not pay more than the $10 without playing it a bunch first. Three skins are not worth $50.

SO i am pretty sure everyone knows this game is a third party revival of the OG Paragon a game that was epic , fun , and overall a great take on 3rd person moba inspired by smite with its own story and awesome groundwork. here is just a small review about predecessor. 

First Impressions:overall 
Pros
decent game for a slow paced version of paragon.
Item builds were interesting and fun. (most liked items were to evolving kind in game. it was a nice feel of League of legends when it came to that. )
announcer felt more on point and was great at times. 
map was decently made even though it was minor changes.
server stability is great and hold up on high strain. 

Cons:overall 
Felt like a IOU when playing early EA
Felt like nothing has  been done when it came to heroes some felt great while others did not meet their assigned roles or felt lack luster. 
no introduction in playing this game or helping to make new players feel more ready and learned. 
no Item Build system to make sets for heroes. 
Lack of characters , and lack of uniqueness. 
honestly felt like i was being ripped off playing this game. 
community in pred is very toxic, not very supportive in helping people to learn the game.
the discord community is horrible and the devs hardly listen to player feedback. 
Store is disabled and have no real content both cosmetically and features.  

Overall outcome: I wouldn't recommend playing this game until full release with actual content being made. the dev team reuses all previous assets and features with no real creativity. i would hardpass this and get a refund but i have devs pointing a gun at the back of my head.",1670049191,1670049337,False,8,2,0.481454551219940186,0,True,False,True

unfortunately, Paragon was so boring that only a small set of people could really enjoy it. Predecessor is just the same game, same map, nothing new. The experience of playing this game was very, very underwhelming. For games that lasted 30+ minutes, it felt so boring and a waste of time. Character mechanics feel okay, but that's mostly because some characters are just strictly unfair. The balancing is very weird and precarious. A small army of creeps can singlehandedly, without the help of a hero, take down your inhibitor and backdoor your Core within 30 seconds.

The UI/UX feels like whoever was responsible for making it easy to understand visually, died before they ever made a sketch. There's not much visual story-telling in terms of events in the game, so you'll totally not notice your core being taken.

The character design feels inspired by Santey Alley rip-offs of the Avengers. Apart from a few, most of them look unappealing to look at, boring, or just nasty.

961200,127812960,76561198094309273,0,3,1882,0,285,1671265095,"Price: The game in its essence is a great deal for what you get. You are playing a game that in other arenas is, yes, free. However, to charge 10$ for this game is fantastic, and reasonably is incredibly generous in my mind. For example, even though Smite and League are free MOBAs right now. They make a great deal through cosmetics and other streams. However, for a game that offers a great immersive, smooth, and fun experience, you as a customer are getting a great deal. Long story short you are paying in early access to help develop a game further, for a product is in my opinion that is in such a great state. 

Gameplay: Incredibly smooth! The game for being in early access is incredibly smooth (for my computer) my settings are on EPIC. I have an 8GB Graphics card, 16MB Memory, and an equivalent of an I5 processor. Besides stats, game feels balanced once you learn the ropes and how to build your decks throughout the game. There is a learning curve considering the depth that the game provides through its environment and the interactions that the characters have. In all, as with all MOBA's you are learning the build system (which is similar to leagues) and the layout of your character and their role. 

PROS: 
- Provides a beautiful depth of environment for you as a player.
- No bugs (so far)
- Left off where EPIC left (as in the finish of the game) and possibly I would say in a better state. 
- Abilities are smooth, and fluid, oddly satisfying.
- The games are not too long and feel right.
- It feels balanced.
- Wait times are little.
- No toxicity in the game (we shall see:p soon).

Cons:
- Store is not available yet.
- No ranked mode yet.

Note to developers:

- A ranked mode sooner than later would be great, considering I would play the game by myself more if I were to have such an incentive. Furthermore, I think this would incentivize others to keep playing for a strong and consistent user base. 

- Also, please add a battle pass system. It would be great to have, especially as a way to earn revenue for when the game is free to play eventually:)

Note: I am someone who loved Paragon. I am aware of this bias though while I wrote this review. I tried to be as objective as possible. Thank you:)

The fact that a small studio like Omeda pulled a game that is so similar to the original Paragon from a major studio like Epic is in itself pretty amazing, dont you guys think? It shows how much potential there is for future improvements to the game.

Sure, they had the assets for free. But not the code. And unless you work in the video game / coding industry yourself, i doubt you can fathom how much work that is. And probably on top of these guys regular jobs because let's be real, they were not making money while the game was being created. They still probably don't.

""But they received 20 millions in funding, why should i pay for EA?"" Well, you dont have to. You can wait until the game is fully released and play it for free. Why should you pay to go see a movie when you can wait until it plays on TV right? Making games is EXPENSIVE y'all!

I just played 2 games and I get a ping of around 90. Obviously it's not as good as an actual OCE server, but it's definitely playable and it's great to see the Developer listening to its community. I'm confident we will get an OCE server in the future as our player base grows, and in the meantime 90 ms isn't the end of the world.

Changing this review to a thumbs up to reflect this. If you're from Aus, give it a go. If you can't deal with the 90 ms ping, refund the game. You have nothing to lose :)

-----

EDIT: The game is actually refundable. Make sure you request a refund on the base game and ignore the fact that Steam tells you it's only worth $3.75. It will refund you the entire bundle cost, not just the $3.75.

-----

AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS BEWARE: There are no Oceanic servers and the ping to the closest server (Asia) is 190 ms. I found it to be unplayable so I tried to refund the game on Steam but was presented with an error message saying DLC's are non refundable. Since you must buy this game with at least 1 DLC, that essentially makes this game totally non refundable.

I am an aussie as stated in the title on on release this had asian servers but they were set in Seoul rather than any country closer to Australia, after hearing countless Aussie cries on the discord for a better server so we can actively play this game, within 24 hours, They changed the asian servers to SEA and the location to Singapore so now we can experience sub 100 ping and actually play and enjoy the games.

My first experience with OCE Paragon Refugees is the most fun i've had in a MOBA in a long time and reinvigorated my passion for the genre itself. We won a game when we were 20 kills down and it came down to who had the better calls, positioning and overall better play despite being down so heavy. I love that, I love that its balanced so that you can comeback if you play properly and capitalise on enemy mistakes. 

I absolutely adore this title already despite it being in EA for only a few days and while I was fishy about the price of entry, I would find out that it was well worth the entry. I can't wait to see what the devs do and keep adding the nostalgia while also adding there own spice and flavours to the game.

As an aussie, I approve.

This version is a close as possible to the original, with the same Monolith map & Heroes with similar, if not identical, abilities and skills. The old Card-based upgrade System has been replaced with a more traditional Item Store for upgrading during the matches.
 
In this EA version, 20 characters are available, with another Hero to be release each month for the next 5 months.

Graphics: As sharp as the original, with fantastic visual effects for Hero abilities and a beautifully re-created map.

Matchmaking: Smooth and intuitive, quite an accomplishment for a newly released MOBA. Now offers a Practice Mode so you can test abilities, read item descriptions, practice upgrade paths etc. out side of an active match.

Controller Support: Default button settings are intuitive. For now you have to use Steam to rebind buttons.

Played roughly 6-8 games without any server or connection issues. Some characters need slight adjustments (Khaimera is still a little over powered compared to other jungles). Avg game time is 20 - 35 min. 

Recommended Fixes: 

* ""Surrender"" option if not successful on first vote is blocked for 60 min which is frustrating when stuck playing with a enemy team that is just trolling for kills.

* Players are forced to ""Lock - in"" characters after you select one. If timer runs out and you have not locked in your specific character then you receive a 3 min ban. Similar games like Smite have an auto-lock feature that activates once timer is depleted as long as you have selected a character.

*Shop UI could be a little more clear as far as item progression and starting items. Current setup may deter new players from navigating from Auto-buy.

For starters, the pacing of the game is slow. I'm not referring to the overall length of the matches, I'm talking about the speed of the fighting and skirmishes. This is, until you get about 30 minutes in the game and you literally get one shot in team fights. 

There are a select group of characters that are blatantly overpowered. Then, there are a just some that are next to useless as their scaling/base stats are just horrific.

The lanes (especially mid) are WAY too small, making ganking next to impossible. Probably not much they can do about the size as they've completely removed the sprint function from the game.

You can get fangtooth in less than 10 seconds leading to little time for the enemy team to react to what's going on.

This game feels amazing, it is very early and sorely lacking any kind of real content at this time, however it just feels like Paragon. This is a game that me and a friend have severely missed for the time that it was gone and we didn't really expect anything to come of it but this is great to see. One of the first things that players of the original paragon might notice is that the UI is extremely responsive compared to the original paragon. The originals UI felt bloated and slow to respond. Everything is simple and snappy.

The card system has been abolished for a much easier to understand item system. I don't think I've begun to scratch the surface of the depth to it but many items remind me of old things from Smite or League so I hope to pick it up quickly.
I experienced little to no frame drops or latency in even the most intense team fights. For the first day of an early access this was a very smooth play experience.

- Game runs and feels great. Smooth game-play, great ping and lots of characters.
- Combat seems much better than Paragon. Faster pace, pushing lanes and clearing minion waves has bigger impact.
- IMHO, the UI doesn't look that bad. Maybe it could use some improvements but is not terrible at all.
- Auto-buy option needs definitely some work but you can always deactivate it (who would play with that on anyways?).

In a lot of OP games there would be like 60-80 kills in a game only at 30-40 minutes long and the game still wouldn't be over. OP games were certainly longer and a lot harder to end the game despite only one tower in each lane vs two. I played six games of Pred tonight most of the games were 20-35 with one game lasting 40 minutes. OP currently has more features but looks and runs worse than Pred. OP would sometimes stutter on ability cast and sometimes not even cast the abilities(I found zero of that in Pred). If there were too many minions in lane OP would stutter. I played Pred less hours but I have not ran into any issues no stutters very smooth game play and looks crisp. So, if you want to play a more traditional moba game I'd say Pred is that. If you want to play a team brawler that you kinda just team fight for 40-50 minutes OP is it.

It lacks the sprint system from OG Paragon & Overprime, which gives the game flow a significantly clunkier feel.  Navigating and using the in-game item store is near impossible.  The recommended item builder is shoved down your throat with little recourse to explore on your own.  The UI for the game is fairly poor.  This game needs months if not years of polish before putting a price tag on it.

All negatives aside, the one upside Predecessor has over Overprime is how wards/potions work.  Wards and potions share the same slot as your main items in Overprime, forcing you to choose if you want to be able to ward late game or be fully built for a huge combat advantage.  Predecessor keeps its main item slots separate from consumables like wards and potions.

If you didn't play Paragon, this game is an incredibly smooth and enjoyable 3rd person MOBA. Fights feel engaging. Movement feels good. The way they do jungle line of sight is a nice change from the big 2 MOBAs. 5 inventory slots felt a little weird but you have an artifact type item which is basically item 6. The items do seem to mimic LoL a fair amount. This can be looked at as a positive or a negative based on who you ask. I personally like it as I know LoL very well so the items made sense to me right away. And the game just runs smooth! Granted, I have more than enough PC for this (i7-11700KF, 16gb RAM, Nvidia RTX 3070), but damn does it feel smooth. We are off to a great start with this game!

Couple issues I noticed. Auto buy turned itself back on when I turned it off. I know the items; I don't want auto buy on. The ping system needs a little work. Pressing ""F"" does a quick contextual ping which is nice, but we are missing some key pings for informing teammates. I didn't see anything like an ""On My Way"" ping which I believe is critical. I would also just like an option to be able to have a free mouse and be able to click on the mini map for a ping. Maybe even steal from LoL here and allow me to have a press and hold on the mini map to get a 4 way ping wheel for different ping options. The more ability to inform my teammates of my intentions, the better we will be.

There are some other small things like the store forcing itself on screen when I respawn. I was mid typing, respawned, and the store took priority over what I was doing. Not a huge deal, but I had already purchased and didn't need the store to pop up again.

Looking forward to how this continues. I always preferred a 3rd person MOBA and Smite just isn't doing it for me anymore. I think this is well worth your time if you enjoy the MOBA experience.",1669961595,1669961786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's missing a heap of features though, like post game lobbies, a progression system, ranked, and alternate game modes/maps but hopefully these all get added at a satisfactory pace throughout the early access.  Many favorite heroes are missing, such as Twinblast, Wraith, Iggy and Scorch, to name a few, but I'm interested in seeing how they get tweaked when they make it to this game. 

Other than that the base game is solid and I'm looking forward to how it improves during early access and beyond.

Avid Paragon player and parazombie player as well. Been apart of Fault internal testing and been on OP way back to when it was a sketchy Google Drive link to give you context on my experience. 

This game has potential, but the way these Dev's are handling it so far is concerning so let me explain, the build that we have as of now has no noticeable difference than what we had in previous playtest and I mean GAME PLAY wise, I know Crunch and Dekker is new so don't start typing. Auto on ADC's feel very off and not as noticeable when you land said autos. Certain abilities get clipped or have issues which should be smoothed out considering they were there last time.

Other content we are missing is actual skins, custom games, and a actual Comp mode. The fact that OP has these SORTA figured out, ain't perfect but it's a start, makes me wonder why they didn't bother also they just have way more skins that is easily purchasable with in game currency. Custom games especially is a huge thing considering how some people wanna run Tourney's and just play with friends in a 5v5 arena. Sound design and graphics are meh at best as well. The game it self is very quite and it feels like you're just there and not actually apart of the game.

Now am I going to bash on Pred 24/7? No, I just think that this launch was underwhelming and not as hyped as people are saying it is.

Pros:
+ Game runs well (decent rig, not great)
+ Short Queue Times
+ Non-toxic teammates (mostly - your experience may differ)
+ No pay to win card shop like Paragon had (who makes a card shop for a moba??)
+ No activating items - just basic abilities, potions and wards.

Cons
- Small bug - it spit me back into a queue (player failed to join)
- No in game store (yet... I may have to unlock it by leveling?)
- Worldbuilding/sotry is non-existant
- Jungle Clarity would be welcome. I'm not sure what the buffs do.
- More characters would be nice. I suspect they're in the pipeline.
- A tutorial would be welcome.
- There should be an invisible elo for match making, but I'm just happy the core features run well for the moment.

+ A fun Paragon like (which many have been waiting for last 4 years) moba game 
+ Smooth responsive gameplay
+ Pleasant visuals
+ so far quick matchmaking 
+ great heroes with interesting abilities


However the game in its current state has a lot of really unbalanced things:

- Tower diving is stupidly easy. They simply need more damage. You can easily kill half a team under it and continue pushing.
- Deathballing is real 
- Prime and Tooth are too easy to kill, it's laughable. Either need more health or damage. 
- The crest is a rather questionable addition.

I'm not mentioning stuff like: lack of the store, customization or progression, bad item shop etc. These are kinda expected and will probably be resolved soon.  But the core imbalances mentioned above are serious issues.

Paragon has better sound design, hits thud or sound good while this version seems to be missing out on some good meaty bass tones. Also, there is no speed boost while out of combat in this. That alone is going to make me play Paragon instead.

I can safely say every iteration I've played has been leaps and bounds better than the last. This current iteration feels amazing. Buttery smooth servers (20 ping to NA west, 70 ping to na east. consistent, too. never any dips. about as damn good as you can get), responsive abilities, next to 0 optimization problems (0 for me personally, I have heard some people having some issues)etc.

Things I really like:

The devs behind Predecessor are genuinely a delight. They are very active within their own community, always actively searching for and listening and responding to feedback, etc. They are all also seasoned veterans of the industry, coming from Epic, Riot, Blizzard, and other giants of the industry. These people know what they are doing, and it shows in the quality of their work.

I'm putting this here higher up because if you're like me, and have followed the games industry for quite some time, you've probably been waiting to see a solidly developed game make use of Unreal Engine 5. Well, here's your chance. That alone is worth demoing the game out, IMO. I do think they utilize some of the next gen features very well. 

The game is stunningly beautiful, while maintaining a solid level of visual clarity in terms of the environment not getting in the way of what matters. I have a 5 year old, heavily heavily used 1080 and can sustain easily 70-90 fps on max settings (I usually run a medium settings for 100+ fps, but it can be done). 

There is internal skill-based matchmaking, though with it being so early on in the game's lifespan, it is taking some time to adjust. Games will be one-sided for the first week or so (First week of December 2022, in case this review gets dated). Despite games being a little unbalanced so far, match length has been in the perfect sweet spot the entire time. I've averaged close to 25 minutes dead on for most games, with my only outlier being a 36 minute game today where we just messed around and threw a couple chances to end 5-8 minutes earlier.

The Predecessor community thus far has been generally very positive. Like with any moba, you will have your trolls and toxic players, but a good majority of the community has/is making an active attempt to combat this and bring about a community welcoming of new players of all skill levels.

There are plenty of things that can be improved upon. None of these really detract from the overall fun of the core game, and I'm simply writing this here because if you are interested in these things, you might want to steer clear until it launches in f2p. These things have all been directly addressed by the devs as something they are actively working on and improving.
- I think visual clarity is something that can always be improved in a game full of particle effects and abilities and whatnot. As it is right now, to the untrained eye it is easy to get ""lost in the sauce"", miss enemies firing off abilities, etc. It does get better as you learn sound cues and what all the characters do and whatnot.
- There is a lack of overall content right now, with only 20 of the original Paragon heroes being available to play. They have made a goal of releasing 1 per month while in EA, and with my knowledge of Omeda I believe they can accomplish this while maintaining the amazing quality they have thus far. 
- There is no real account progression, hero progression, cosmetics shop, etc. This is intentional. Omeda has made it very public that they wanted to release only the core game in its current state so that they can further refine and iterate on that, while adding in these other features. The goal is to have a more dedicated group of people that are aware of this to bring the game up to the standard they have set for when they launch in f2p (6-12 months is their current timeline)
- The UI is a little overbearing/jarring in some aspects, specifically the tab screen. This has been addressed by Omeda and we'll likely see iterations on the UI in the next few weeks/months.
- Easy Anti Cheat is giving some users problems with verifying the game correctly and whatnot, though Omeda has already addressed this and offered solutions to temporarily fix this while they work on it. (Wouldn't be surprised if it is generally fixed by the time I've posted this)

I'd like to sum up this review by saying that Predecessor is striving to be the epitome of ""quality over quantity"" right now. They may not have the biggest roster, or all of the content in the world yet, but what they do have is incredibly polished and is indicative of the direction they want to take the game. They've spent a lot of their time and money thus far investing in building these really strong systems that will allow them to rapidly iterate and prototype and overall produce content for us going forward, so what we're seeing now is just the tip of the iceberg to come. The core game that they have presented to us is beyond incredible, all they have to do is add onto it at this point and it will rival and quite easily surpass its own predecessor (Paragon) very quickly.

If none of the above deterred you, I believe you'll likely enjoy Predecessor a lot. Come join us and help be a part of this amazing game being built before us.",1669881969,1669936987,True,4,5,0.399445205926895142,0,True,False,True

****IF YOU ENJOY LEAGUE OF LEGENDS YOU WILL ENJOY THIS****

Okay, so to start with, this is a MOBA. There are ppl in this review section tht DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS.  and GOD KNOWS there are ppl PLAYING THIS tht do not understand that.  This game has 3 lanes, top, mid, bottom, a jungle, red/blue buffs, etc. 

there are ppl complaining about getting ganked tht DO NOT understand why they are getting ganked.   there is a lot of strategy tht goes into these kinds of game.  IF YOU TAKE A SQUISHY CHARACTER, THT BELONGS IN THE BOTTOM LANE GROUPED WITH A HEALER, AND U DECIDE TO TAKE THIS CHARACTER TOPLANE (OFFLANE) THEN YES U ARE GOING TO GET TILTED AND MAD.  it is very easy to get BODIED when taking the wrong character to the wrong lane when u are not competent, nor aware in these games.  
it is very easy to get bodied as a jungle when your two teammates at bottom do not tell you that one of their opponets has been missing the whoole game (raoming the jungle with their jungler).   

This is League of Legends but in very cool 3rd person with amazing grahpics and sounds and this is genuinely fun.  but i NEED to emphasize that this is still a game based largely off USING UR BRAIN.  

Theres a commented review tht says hes mad about no VS AI mode.....its literally there....but notice this game in the corner of ur screen...while ur playing.....LITERALLY STILL SAYS IN DEVELOPMENT???????   the mode is there but locked currently.   it will come out.
This game is in early access, more characters will come out, more modes will come out etc.  dont listen to those who are just all negative with ""ohit lacks this and lacks that""-....duh, its early access????  i dont think they know what early access-still in dev, means lmao

one reviewer said this game does not have sprint and was mad about it, some characters have super sprints some do not.  (even overwatch is the same way and its not MOBA...kinda get it now?)  so its kind of like tht. trust me you dont need it, this isnt CoD.

most (IF NOT ALL) of the complaints i have seen are ALWAYS people who:
1: Do not understand the role of the character they picked
2: Went to the wrong position not suited for their character
3: Do not understand the true aspect of a MOBA (LoL)
4: Continue to keep diving into 3v1 fights thinking this is Call of Duty
5: Decide that it is perfectly okay to keep trying to fight an opponet who has out leveled you (2 or more levels ahead of you with more items built)
6: Are consistently pushed up to the enemies tower and dont understand that, tht is a horrible strategy because then the jungler WILL come to gank you. this is strategy.  (and common sense in this genre)
7: People who dont understnad that you cant directly 1v1 someone who has been fed (yes they will be a lot more powerful than you, that is how the game genre works) 

these people are the ones speaking the loudest,  and be wary that these people are also the ones who dont understand that its (im not trying to sound rude but...) their fault that they are losing.  

League players:  If i take LeBlanc or Ashe toplane, im going to get bodied right?  if i take Yuumi into the jungle, im going to get bodied right?  Yuumi will always get ganked.   Tower pushers will get punished when they dont pay attention to junglers location.

This game is just fine.  however many people who simply do not understand this TYPE of game are being incredibly vocal about things that are entirely within their power lol....",1669936249,1669936630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

TLDR:
-All heroes have a passive now; deal breaker for me due to balance issues
-Low res textures of heroes / abilities in game 
-Slow paced; my preference

________

As of right now, it's looking like OverPrime will be for me... but we'll see.

I have to give it more time. It's not nearly as polished as OverPrime but the performance is way more stable, so props on that.

The pace is very slow, like old school Paragon. I loved it, but casuals did not like the pace. And lack of newbie friendliness is what killed Paragon. 

They have a pretty decent Item system and a good auto-buy to get folks started. 

This is kinda what is the main killing factor for me as it discourages good building and skill --- Every hero having a passive ability will take some getting used to. It's really nonsensical in my opinion. For example, as a passive, Gideon get a magic DOT to his basic for 4 seconds after casting an ability. Like... wtf? This negates the role of caster. The whole point is once you blow your kit, you're dead in the water. Huge burst AOE damage, cooldown. Gid is basically a carry lol. Clearly defined roles. This type of stuff is what leads people to play whatever in any lane. 

The character renders in game are low res and blurry in 4k. 3840 x 2160, Max settings locked to 60 FPS. So that's kinda an eye sore after playing OP for almost 3 weeks. The resolution and textures of the maps, minions, and monsters are pretty solid. Still not as hi-fi as OP. 

It's trying to convince the other people who like OP to give this a chance, because at the end of the day, I like to play with my friends.",1669935260,1669936138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's no progression as of yet, and only one mode so far, excluding practice mode. I haven't experienced any gamebreaking bugs, but I have had a couple CTDs (thankfully not while in-game).

There's no role queue. You select your role along with your teammates in the lobby, and if you two or more of you want the same position, it randomly selects a different one for those who didn't get it. This game NEEDS role queue if there's going to even be a role system in place anyway--having to pick it with your team already gathered is just frustrating, and sometimes make a lobby dodge worthy to be honest. Nobody likes fighting over the same role.

Gameplay and fights are bangers. So much fun.

The combat alone is worth a buy. Items and systems feel good with variety.

There are some issues: surrenders occasionally don't work. Your character sometimes gets stuck in autowalk if you open a menu, until you input a step again. 

It also needs another day or two to adjust mmr for players, but it is pretty balanced with usually one or two people on each team that know what they are doing. A few heroes need some nerfs to some abilities (riktor is strong af imo, it's like a better blitzcrank) But this will go away with time, that's expected of a new moba. So this isn't really a fault. They need a play cycle to address balancing. That's what EA is for.

But I didn't care about any of that because the game runs smooth as butter on my ultrawide 2.5k with a 2070S. The heroes all feel unique. Combat is fast paced but easy to read. Because the hero pool is small, you can actually learn every ability and not feel overwhelmed, unlike jumping into league or Dota now as a new player.

Absolutely worth the $. I was hooked from first spawn.

Overprime felt too loose in comparison. It felt like a hero brawler instead of a moba.

Devs are also very transparent and seem to want to make this succeed. This isn't just a repackaged asset cashgrab like fault. It's not a clown Fiesta simulator like overprime.

I dont know what 99% of people are smoking but this game is miles behind, so far so that i would say they only released it now because overprime is coming out, everything is worse than overprime.

the visuals, everyone says they are better, they are not at all, effects of moves have 0 flare to them, hell you cant even see if they hit if there wasnt damage numbers.

Map design id say this game probably is better than overprime, the jungle feels more jungley so to speak, like you can roam in it.

you get a kill and its anti climactic, doesnt feel rewarding, all you get is ""an enemy has been slain"", but you dont even know if its you who got the kill!

Theres less characters, the UI is trash, the shop has massive icons, theres less characters, 0 store, 0 progression.

Wtf were these devs thinking, this is pure desperation on their part seeing a better game coming out, quick lets launch ours before lose traction.

Anyone who says otherwise clearly hasnt played overprime in its recent play test or they are blinded by some other reason, it felt miles better, people are saying this is like smite, smite is way better, this game feels like ive thrown it together over the summer.

People are saying it feels more of a traditional moba, yea your right but a shite clunky one at that.

Overprime was arcadey but at least felt fun to play .

Ive never refunded a game quicker!

I've been a Paragon-Crack in the day.
Diamond all the way, several accounts top 1%.

So i was hyped. Like... HYPED.
Tho, this is NOT the Paragon you were hoping for. Not yet, at least.
Some items are overpowered beyond belief, some 'Champions' like Fey or Riktor, for some reason Riktor...  Are so strong, they go 1v3 without being fed .. Without breaking a sweat..
Also, a lot of the skills were changed, Howitzer almost completely. Not for the better in some cases, unfortunately.

Gameplay feels overall very sluggish and slow. Better than it felt in Fault, WAY better but still not as sharp and crisp as in Paragon back in the day.
Biggest issue? You get into a lobby and people vote one after another for what they want to play on what lane. If someone doesn't get what he wanted, he dc's. Lobby's down. And this happens.. A lot!

While there is good and crisp sound for some effects and moves, other stuff lacks sound completely. like certain attacks or environment.

The visuals are not as good as they were back then, which is not good, given how much time has passed... But they do their job. Unfortunately, some effects were heavily altered and don't look like they used to. Still the game get's an overall 'yes' on the visuals.

Performance has issues. Lots.
Yadda yadda early access, i know but still, i got into framedrops in certain situations with big card and rig overall.

Overall 5/10.
I'd say wait a couple .. 6-8 Months till they got over all the current obstacles.
The dev-Team sure has skill and determination, as shown, but.. Honestly? After all that time i figured they were further down the road' already.

And seriously, balance certain 'Champions'.
It's not fun oneshotting people as a support with a single skill...
And i'm sure it's not fun gettin' oneshotted either.",1669918347,1669920039,False,3,0,0.501510560512542725,0,True,False,True

Not mention, the pace picks up quite a bit as the matches go on. I'm really excited to see what else is released during EA, and I'm especially excited about the full release.

Gameplay is really fun and almost fluid except for some jumping animations but nothing major. Graphics are quite amazing. Despite saying it doesnt support ultrawide, I've had no issues thus far. Not much bugs except you might sometimes blink into a wall and get yourself stuck (especially muriel). Community has been friendly except for a few I've matched with.

 If you're from asia and you wish to play in the asian region? you'll need atleast 5-15mins matchmaking time unless you can sacrifice some huge pings to join the NA servers, my thoughts are probably there arent much players here. Partying has not much issues so far, paired with a buddy and we didnt DC in any games. Has huge room for improvements i mean hey theyre still in EA like no sh*T. It's still a yolk, not a full ass T-Rex so calm your expectations.

Items seems somewhat similar cant remember well since paragon was almost a decade ago and it seems u cant make your deck yet? maybe soon. The roster so far is alright and hope more main characters gets added and maybe new ones from their own ideas. 

No COOP vs A.I yet, its still locked for me so yeah.

Havent tried practice too. PVP is still fun and frustrating, you might come up with newbies but please be nice.

Only bug so far I've faced is that they misdirect my lane after i chose a role but this happens like once in 14 games so far.(sending me as a support to offlane)(maybe a map flip issue?? IDK)

Give it a try it doesnt tear too much of a hole in your wallet. 

And please for the love of god stop comparing this to overprime. 

Lastly, most of the negative reviews here are what seems to be bots from hardcore overprime base or sumin idk cos they keep recurring with the same condescending and misleading reviews.

It's not GREAT but is sure is fun like last time, help to get off the old paragon itch quite well. Pray it gets better.
