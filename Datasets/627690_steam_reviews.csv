The artwork that goes into making the characters is beautiful. You can even watch the guy draw on twitch, and I recommend you do, give him some views! 

It also has lore, and fun banter between the characters to read between levels. 
My favourite is Jarlaxle. 

But the games monetization is very egregious. Over 200 quids ""worth"" of DLC and an in game store with loot boxes. 
You can get these in game, which is at least a plus, but it feels like an advertisement, the way they are drip fed to you.
And when I say worth, there's a pack in the game, that comes with an autoclicking raccoon (Trash Panda) and some potions, it says it's 35 quids worth at the cost of 15 quid.
That is not 35 quids worth. Some potions and an admittedly very cute, Raccoon are not worth 35 quid... If you think that, then you're just incorrect. Factually false.

If you're content to leave the game on in the background, that's not a problem. You'll eventually get things that will be left in the background. There's also codes you can enter for free chests, which is nice. A point in the games favour.

But I cannot recommend this game, on the basis that it is so greedy. So many micro-transactions. You can potentially spend hundreds of pounds on a game that you leave on in the background. 

If you are not the kind to fall prey to microtransactions, then yes, by all means, get this game, leave it on in the background, and enjoy. But if you are... then avoid it at all costs!

i would also like the bugs to be fixed.there is a bug right now where i can level up a champ by x1 or i can level up by next upgrade. the x10,x25,x100 only increase the champion level by x1. i also like that you gain gold and stuff while offline this helps a lot when you need to farm gold or snowflakes",1546142300,1546142300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
