But I also kind of do. Let's get into why:

I had a lot of fun at first, taking out armies on horseback with a bow. Horse archer is ridiculously overpowered and it's genuinely a blast. If you want to dynasty warriors your way through an army, use a bow.
So why does the game suck?
Because the game encourages you to join an army. Armies are terrible.

I joined the Vaegirs (Still not sure how it's pronounced, Vaguer?) King Yaroglek is a worthless old fool who deserves to crumble to dust under his armour. I played a female character and he said that because I was a woman, I wouldn't get any fiefs.. Thanks game, blatant sexism is wonderful. I know the game strives for a supposed realism, but it fails in so many regards. Not to mention that it's not on earth... they developers chose to make their games historical setting be filled with all the bads of our worlds. 

Fun things in a historical setting: Swords, Shields, Horses, Bows, taking lords prisoner and making their kingdoms pay a fortune to get them back, then catching them again. Muahaha!

Bad things: Sexism, slavery, racism*, not being able to just say ""no, this castle is mine now, I put in all the effort to take it.""
*I don't know if coincidence or racism, but my character was dark skinned kind of a Greek tone, and an NPC referred to her as ugly and sunburnt... Could be a coincidence, but it does come off really badly.

I hate sexism, if I could turn that off, that'd be great. But despite this, I played the game anyway, he did give me a castle, so it was just a sexist comment that didn't mean anything... it just didn't need to be there at all.

Anyway: I wound up taking out almost all of the Swadian kingdoms. Their counts knew me straight away as someone to be feared. It was awful to do because through so much of it, my army fell short. The troops I commanded were fine, for the most part. Often they wouldn't join me in full force during sieges, you have to turn the troop count up in the settings.

Every time I took a castle, going through a lot of effort to do so. Yaroglek, the doddering old prelude to dust, would give it to someone else. I got one castle, out of the dozen I conquered. I got a bad one too. Not one of the cities, just some obscure keep in the middle of nowhere. Seriously devs, why are you giving the reward to NPCs? Give it to the player, the player actually exists, the NPCs do not.

I got to the last Swadian keep, I had to build a siege tower, which involved waiting for ages. It was finally built, we were out of money, food, morale was low. But I charged anyway. We took out all but 20 of their troops, but we were out of troops and I was out of arrows. So I retreated, I thought, let's go in again straight after, like you can do with every other battle in the game when you run out of arrows...
I had to build the siege tower again... 
I would've had to wait 60 (In game still a while) hours.
Their counts came and attacked me while I did that. They surrounded me at the edge of the map (That it doesn't indicate) and killed me. 

That was the end for me, I gave up.
I'd gone through so much effort. I'd taken their entire kingdom. You cannot kill counts, so I tried to imprison them, but they always get free again.
Where's that realism now? Why can't I execute them? Why am I releasing them, so they can go make another army to attack me? You'll allow sexism but not executions? Let me cut Montewar's head off and trebuchet it into his castle! (Game also lacks trebuchets, would not recommend based on that alone).

My army was never there for me, they never helped me, they ignored me when I was in trouble.
They took all the credit and got all the rewards.

If you play the game anyway:
Play female anyway, the game doesn't like it, but if you're not joining a kingdom, then you can show them who's boss.
Do not join a kingdom, become empress of all of Calradia, the kingdoms are all lead by weak simpering fools.
Savour the time before you get an army, armies make things stressful. Enjoy kicking butt before you do.

When the game hits that loop of ""Oh no, this again""... stop playing. Do not go for the achievements. Trying to wipe out every kingdom is exhausting. I got exhausted wiping out ONE kingdom. Just one. If I had to take them all out I'd probably have started drinking heavily. This game gets really stressful. You're looking at 20-30 hours to take out one kingdom, if you're as slow as I was. If you're fast, maybe do it in 10-15. This is a huge time investment. For what might well wind up being nothing. Know when to stop. Take breaks. Don't blitz through the whole thing in one sitting. You will burn out very quickly and hate every minute of it.

Tech issues:
The game has an edge of the map, it doesn't tell you where the edge is, it's not indicated. So if you're running on horse away from someone else on horse, shooting back at them... Eventually you will hit the edge (Or a tree, but that's my fault) There's no way to tell where the edge of the map is.
It's very easy to get turned around in combat and get lost, a compass would've been nice. Less realistic? Make it look like a sundial or something. (I did wind up using the sun to tell direction, but often it's not there to help you.)

Sometimes enemies spawn mid air. They attack you, from mid air, they shoot arrows, mid air. It's a good thing I played an archer. But if I was using a polearm or a sword or something, this would've sucked big time.

Building siege equipment is boring. It takes ages, it takes ages of real life time.

While pillaging a village (I tend not to do this, I dislike killing civilians in any game) you cannot stop until the village is done... however the NPC's can stop pillaging to run after you. This is blatantly unfair and badly designed.

When sneaking into a town, you cannot have armour under your disguise, you cannot sneak in a decent weapon. You go in with no armour and a stick for a weapon, if you get caught, you have to fight a really unfair fight. And you're going to get caught. Extreme lack of fairness. (Best counter I can think of, get your weapon master up a bit and spec into polearms, if you're not already using them.)

You cannot choose your weapon for tournaments. You could be using a bow while they have a sword and are right up in your face making you ""hiccup"", completely unable to draw an arrow because they are in your face hitting you. Or you could be stuck with a lance, which is god awful to use. Give me some agency here, tournaments can be a lot of fun if you win... but losing them just feels like such a wasted effort.

There are other things I could complain about, but this is going on long enough.

TL:DR: I dunno, I had a bad time and gave the game a negative review based on that? Isn't that all negative reviews? 
Ultimately whether you want to play it is entirely up to you. I personally recommend against it because it takes ages. But if you want to play it, then I hope you have fun. I hope you enjoy it more than I did.
I tried my best to enjoy this game, but In the end, I'd give it a 4/10. It's not completely terrible, but it's still in the do not recommend, numbers. It stressed me out to no end and I wound up, ultimately, not enjoying myself.
I hope you do, regardless of your choice.",1708556698,1708556698,False,1,2,0.487641960382461548,0,True,False,False

However, after years of continued play, I would say it's ""too much fun.""  You control every aspect of your journey in the game: who/where you fight, if you engage in commerce or become a ruffian who fights everyone.  When you do something like storm or defend a city, you hold onto those moments, and feel like you actually changed something in the game world.  You start to recognize lords after a while in the field, and feel like you're following the politics of a kingdom by watching who defects or gets fiefs.  Creating your own kingdom is HARD, but that's by design, and you feel absolutely triumphant when you pull it off.

All in all, it's a game that wears its age on its sleeve, but it's just so well done that I have never regretted any of the hours I've put into it, and I know for sure I will put plenty more.",1707533955,1707533955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can scale battles from very small (with large armies) to full on cavalry charges with archer support and infantry. You can assign call outs to each group. Awesome sandbox strategy game. Become a lord. Build up your honor and right to rule while under a King's protection... then break away and wage war on everyone. 
Cons - This game had dated graphics when it came out. The graphics have not held up very well. If you can stomach T.E.S. Oblivion style graphics with extremely fun game-play then look no further from your next time sink.
In summary: Graphics bad... everything else AWESOME. If you can get it on sale it is one of the best values in the gaming industry. I've sunk hundreds of hours into RPG's like Skyrim and Cyberpunk - but over the years and consoles and PC's I've sunk thousands of hours here.

There's a ""tutorial"", but it basically doesn't teach you anything, and just asks you to hit stuff and then tells you ""good job!"". I started a new game, confident that I would be able to figure out everything else on my own. Immediately there is a bandit attacking me and for SOME REASON I can't use my sword. Started with a crossbow as well, so I tried shooting him. Jokes on me, you have to stand still to reload it. So I decided to just start punching him. Killed me. Okay, I respawned in the next area. No big deal. Oh, NOW I can use my sword. Cool, must have been a glitch. No worries. Ok, now it tells me after getting my first quest to exit. I exit. Find some ""looters"". Cool, let's test out my sword skills. Load into a big open area with battle music, no enemies in sight. Ride around for like 10 minutes, still no enemies. Oh, what's this coming over the hill? There they are, finally! I will just charge them and hit them with my - OH GREAT, can't use my sword again. Neat, let's try a bunch of buttons to see what does what, maybe it's a mechanic of the game. WHAT- did I just drop my shield? Well, wasn't able to use my crossbow either, but now I can since I dropped my shield. Wow, these horse controls are AWFUL. Oh nice, can't reload my crossbow. I'm done. Hit ESC to try and quit the game. WHAT- NO QUIT OPTION? No way to quit the game, awesome. What a great game. CTRL+SHIFT+ESC. Cool, already played more than two hours. Not getting that money back. SHITE GAME DO NOT BUY

Update: So I also tried ""With Fire and Sword"", which is basically the exact same game, except it tells you how to play for once. Have to say, that still did not make me enjoy this game. The game basically punishes you HARD for any single mistake. You have to play PERFECTLY if you don't want to have to start all over again.  Forget to feed your army? Sucks to be you, more than half of them leave your service. Don't even try to fight them to assert your dominance - you WILL be outnumbered. Took a wrong step and blinked once? Get attacked by a vastly more powerful army than yours, and get obliterated. Not nearly enough ways to make money, and your army demands a huge chunk of your savings, so get ready to be in poverty and stuck in the ""early game"" loop for 12 hours straight, wondering just what you are even doing with your life.  If you're an autistic masochist, then I highly recommend this game. You'll love it. But if you're like me and want to have FUCKING FUN playing a game that doesn't feel like a full time, dead end job with no promotions - steer clear of this garbage.

It wasn't until my greatest battle that I was truly hooked on the game, and my breaks were greatly reduced, which I will share as a key reason why I enjoy this game more than Bannerlord.

Using a simple trick in the config file, you can set the max units in battle to 1000, so 1000 soldiers will be on the field at most; that is where I found myself, all 36 of my Swadian Knights, a mix of 38 archers (being trained to sharpshooters) and about 7 infantry (footmen) and 2 companions, a mere 81 men VS the Sultanate horde of 726 (300 fresh recruits and a mix of more capable fighters with about 120 higher tier units). 

Had they continued to update the game like they planned a few years back (I saw a thread to a 64-bit beta version you could test for a time), then I could have had better performance than the 7-12 frames I had, but still the battle was great as my actions were restricted during my charge, requiring me to plan troop movements beforehand. About 230 died before the enemies Calvary came around and started attacking my archers (about 4 died and 2 were knocked out before the frame rate dropped to 4-7 from my turning the view), and I had to retreat... lost about 12 more due to the RNG from withdrawing. The second battle was far better, at about 17-21 fps, so I managed to continue fighting for several minutes before my force was exhausted; by then, having lost 21 more men, I had to fall back for the second time. By the third and final battle, there were little more than 300 vs my ~40 soldiers (about 16 of which were cavalry). The battle was the longest, as their remaining soldiers were mostly higher tier soldiers, and about 70 fresh recruits, and my frame rate was within a playable 30-45 average. The close calls and focus that went into that battle, even having to regroup my knights into a new charging line at the right time and distance to begin a new charge. It is hard to recall, and I wish I was able to record it and not just take a screenshot, but it was my greatest victory (The second battle in my one person war on the Sultanate which resulted in their proposed peace treaty). The battle took about 40 minutes (probably misremembering), which is likely due to the retreating from fps (would be better if the 32-bit game could use more than the 4gb of ram), as it took about 20 minutes for the final battle. Lost over half my soldiers by the end, but was able to replenish most from the prisoner reserves the enemy had.

That battle is usually the first battle I tell new players, as I usually can make it sound cooler and help a someone get into the game; for now, I am just trying to leave a positive review I thought I already left, so figured I would share my battle here. Likely I will start recording my battles if I play it as much as I once did, but I figure I will only do that if they picked up the 64-bit development from where they left off and brought it to steam (It was fully functional, as Mac required both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the game to be published on their store, so it had a lot of work done while they were working on Mac and Windows version already, and I am sure its still backed up somewhere).",1706416849,1706416849,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a story line after completing which can still continue playing the game (to conquer the kingdoms). The story is simple but would force you to level up and build armies to succeed. 

Ever since playing Kingdom Come Deliverance, I was looking for games where you have to a) level up skills, and b) learn to fight with a sword. This game ticked both boxes (although getting better at fighting is much easier in this game).

The game is not perfect. It did crash a number of times for me. But I save frequently anyway, so it didn't impact me much.

It lacks proper guidance on how to build armies / level up. I was expecting some forced quests in the beginning. Could be because it is a DLC and assumes I already know. 
However, in a way, I enjoyed this. I learned at my own pace through experiencing things. May be took me longer this way, but I liked it. In a way, it offered true freedom to go your own way.

If you get lost on how to progress and feel like quitting, you could always watch a video guide. I only watched one once I already finished the main story line (~200 hours) to get better idea on starting my own kingdom (youtube video guide by ""Hit Point Inn Gaming"").

Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.

Caution: be careful how you use your attribute & skill points. It gets harder and harder to level up.",1700580678,1705572199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've also only scratched the surface as this being a sandbox game has modded variations that take place in Star Wars, medieval times, and the ancient world. I have yet to play these but the base game itself was extremely fun and is so unique. The lore of the game although fairly surface level was extremely interesting and I particularly loved that any person could have any reason to join whatever faction they wanted. It isn't like other games where there's a 'one for all' faction that has the best troops, best cavalry, best archers, etc. They all had their own strengths and weaknesses.

Whether it's killing bandits, raiding villages, sieging castles or helping a local lord out in a 3v1 fight, there's plenty of large scale combat to get involved in.

Other interesting and satisfying things to do in the game:
[list]
[*]Recruit a peasant woman in rags with a pitchfork and train her into a sword sister in full plate on horseback with a longsword.
[*]Get headshots from 400+ yards with a bow while mounted by firing into a horde of 40+ clustered infantry.
[*]Use blunt weapons on your troops to knockout enemies and then sell them for fat stacks of coin at nearby cities.
[*]Enter tournaments and win first prize to collect top quality gear and mounts.
[*]Use momentum based damage with a mounted lance to one shot enemies and/or horses.
[*]Get outnumbered, defeated and then captured and have most of your stuff taken.  Then come back with a vengeance and grow even stronger.
[/list]

Hell you can even play as a trader by taking a bit of cash, cramming horses in your party for enhanced carry weight and speed and travel the continent getting rich (buy low, sell high).

In short, game has mounts you can ride and blades you can swing.  Another great game who's title tells the truth:  11/10

Only 11 hours played and I can already say, this is the best LotR game I´ve ever played.

It´s slow in the beginning, but when the War of the Ring starts, you will wish you had more time to prepare. It does a great job of conveying the feel of urge as soon as the drums of war are heard across Middle Earth. Gandalf said it the best: ""Three hundred lives of men I have walked this earth and now I have no time.""

The immersiveness, intensity and large scale of the late game of the Mount & Blade gameplay, coupled with a faithful recreation of Rhovanion, Rohan, Gondor and Mordor with it´s cities and fortresses, all while the LotR soundtrack in the background gives you goosebumps, is an experience I have honestly never experienced before.

Put on the LotR soundtrack in the background (because it´s not part of the mod, I guess copyright and stuff) and you will feel like you are taking part in the biggest war of our age, where the fate of the world will be decided on the battlefield of Middle Earth. You play a critical role in preserving the good in the world and rallying as many men around you as you can. However, should you and the strenght of the men of the west fail, then the world will be plunged into a second Dark Age. And it will, because the forces of evil are many.

Visit all the famous places from the Books and Movies, meet all of your favourite characters, join Theoden, Thranduil, Faramir, and many others to defend their lands from the forces of the Dark Lord and purge Moria, Isengard, Gundabad and other key strongholds from those dreadful and hideous Orcs, so that the free kingdoms may unite under your command and carry the war deep into the Black Land, to Barad-Dur, where you are destined to defeat the armies of Sauron on the hillside of Mount Doom.

Or fail and watch powerless, robbed of your destiny, as the shadow of Mordor spreads and devours the regions of the Westland, plunging the last days of the Third Age into relentless and eternal darkness.

If you, however, succumb to the will of the One Ring, you can be the very reason why the destiny of the Last High King fails and Barad-Dur continues to stand strong, bringing death and darkness over Middle Earth.

May the power of the Valar guide you on your way and protect you from the might of the Dark Lord, for the forces of good shall reign supreme, one last time.",1703975630,1703977600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's also ridiculously satisfying.

I think the game creators would have to understand that and add a bit more of a rewarding gameplay.

As good as Bannerlord looks and gets, I don't think ti will be able to scratch the surface of how much of a lightning in a bottle this game is. At its core, it's pretty simple: go from village to village recruiting people, fight bandits to get money, raid villages and castles if that's your style - if not, enroll as a vassal of one of the nations and climb the ranks to becoming king of your own nation. The combat is actually hilarious; it feels like the AI was purposely designed to have the memory of a goldfish and their reactions to being hit/shot and dying drives me insane - even their voicelines are pretty funny!

This game is, at its very core, [i]tedious[/i]. You spend more time running around from village to village than you do actually playing the game. You've got to ensure you've got enough food and gold at all times to keep up moral, and the combat is the very definition of repetitive. Win or lose, you just feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. 

The free-form sandbox style of the game doesn't help. With absolutely no direction, it's difficult to figure out where the main quests are. Even when you do find them, it's hard to know where to go next, and more importantly, whether or not you're even capable of getting there safely. The sense of progression is lacking, which is very disappointing. 

The music is also kind of ass. It just loops the same 3 different themed songs between combat, exploring and tavern/city. With some very out-dated sound effects (which makes sense since this is an older game, so I'm not holding that against it). Seriously, just play . . any other tactical sandbox.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Some of these guys will be very menacing chads who somehow manage to heave an axe into your forehead from 20 metres away one-shotting you as you eagerly try to kickstart the flesh moshpits which are both a bane and boon of this game, but trust me you'll probably be pretty impressed with this if it does happen.
Now I know different mods have different parameters and ways of dealing with damage and armor points. I usually play the ACOK mod because I'm a fan of the asoiaf universe, and most of the stuff above is more relevant to that. In native I believe the highest-tier armor is actually comparatively less protective than in ACOK, so you will still be able to damage knights even in the beginning. 
There are several combat playstyles you can develop your player character around. I guess the most straightforward one would be to aspire towards becoming a knight-like creature on a warhorse, both of you encased in steel plate, shield in one hand and sword in the other in a perfect balance of offense and defense. Personally I've had fun with a more lightly armored agility and athletics focused character armed with just a long(ish) spear, you can really outrun and outmaneouvre and outreach most heavy goons this way, and have fun poking away at them while remaining flighty at a just-out-of-reach distance. Of course this does leave you vulnerable to arrows and getting mogged by horse guys. 
Also you can just be a horse archer, this is like the warband equivalent of skyrim's stealth archer, once you get to a good level you can one shot or two shot most guys while riding around to get them from an exposed angle, and shooting down the horses of any one chasing you.
The combat is really fun once you get the hang of the basic skills. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of nuances and intricacies hiding beneath something that looks simple at first glance. Feinting, chambering, kicking all exist and can be employed even against bots. One thing that seems to be more dynamic and flexible is weapon matchups actually, since each weapon has its own range and swing speed, when you combine this with the weapon proficiency rating of the character, direction of attack, rotational delay/acceleration done by moving the camera against/together with the direction of the swing, and the actual bodily mobility of each of the two combatants, you can create some interesting situations especially in multiplayer (admittedly I haven't played much of this though). You could, say, end up with a situation where one guy can relentlessly close in and rabidly swing without much concern for blocking at all because the other guy's weapon is so slow that he wont even be able to manage a counterattack even if he successfully blocks each swing because by the time that happens the next swing is already coming again. Alternatively taking off all your clothes and equipping a greatsword longer than your opponents weapon means you can really deploy the juke and flail and kite tactic to its fuller potential.

Multiplayer is pretty crazy and I wish it were more active than it is.",1702533913,1702533913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In just a couple hours I can already see I made a good choice.  I played Bannerlord for well over a thousand hours.  Mount and Blade warband is similar but has its own flavors and details. One of the reasons I got the Bundle was because I enjoyed the content from the other game , and read how much This one inspired that one.  I had to play it.   I just started, And I can see that the forums were correct, this game is cool too.

   And the Viking Conquest dlc is so cool.  I have been playing this dlc for hundreds of hours.  I am really impressed with this Viking Conquest expansion.  I can see why the game and dlcs got so much praise in the Bannerlord forums.  Viking Conquest is a whole game on its own basically it has so much content.  I would argue it is comparable to Bannerlord because you can sail.  Don't get me wrong Bannerlord is worth it, but so is this if you really like war games that are well made.

The Viking Conquest DLC is basically a whole game.  I do not know why it does not get more advertisement, because it is really , really good.

It's pretty straight forward and easy to pick up in concept, but the amount of options and paths you can take leaves a lot of room for replayability. I treat it like a real time strategy board game of sorts where I create a character to play out an RPG lifestyle, recruit an army of followers, and eventually conquer kingdoms, or help other NPCs do the same. Battles play out somewhat like a total war game, except you play as that single general fighting alongside your unit while issuing commands to your troops.

It is a sequel to the original Mount & Blade game, released in 2008, and features significant improvements in graphics, AI, and gameplay mechanics.

Gameplay

The game's core gameplay revolves around battles between armies, which can be either scripted or sandbox-style free-roam. Players can choose to play as a lord, vassal, or mercenary, each with their own unique advantages and disadvantages. As a lord, players have the ability to recruit troops, build castles, and manage their own fiefdoms. As a vassal, players can pledge their allegiance to a lord and gain access to resources and protection. As a mercenary, players can take on contracts for various factions and earn money for their services.

Combat in the game is fast-paced and intense, with realistic swordplay mechanics that require skill and strategy to master. Players can choose from a variety of weapons and armor, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The game's AI system is also highly advanced, allowing for realistic troop movements and tactics.

Graphics

Warband's graphics are significantly improved from the original Mount & Blade game, with more detailed environments, characters, and weapons. The game's engine supports high-resolution textures and dynamic lighting, creating a more immersive experience for players.

Modding

One of the most popular aspects of Mount & Blade: Warband is its modding community. The game's open-source engine allows for extensive customization of the game's content, including new factions, weapons, maps, and campaigns. This has led to the creation of a vast library of mods that can be downloaded and installed by players.

Conclusion

Overall, Mount & Blade: Warband is an exceptional medieval warfare simulation game that offers hours of immersive gameplay with its realistic combat mechanics, advanced AI system, and extensive modding community. Its improved graphics and sandbox-style free-roam gameplay make it an excellent choice for fans of medieval history and strategy games alike.",1702214450,1702214450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were also melodically crying negro's on the radio, making it even harder to concentrate on driving the truck. 

I'm not against vulgarity, I'm against constant vulgarity because it weakens its impact and hampers communication.  

It's very annoying to listen to all these filler words, especially when they're words that are inherently annoying to me, like Jesus Christ, God, Ass, Penis, etc.

I am far more invested in my Viking Jarl Barry the Bearzerker. His holdings are vast. A trade network that extends to Daneland and Norway.

I sincerely and _highly_ recommend the 'Phantasy 2018' mod (it's not in the workshop that I could find but is on moddb or nexus or whatever). Search YouTube (if you want more details for 'phantasy 2018 than this meager article).


For a brief example here's my initial personal noob experience playing as a Drow focused army: 

Squads of Drow wizards hurling magic missiles, fireballs, globes of darkness, fear effect, acid arrows and more into the enemy ranks while the squad of clerics spams heals and blessings keeping casualties at zero plus adding buffs and debuff negations. The enemy melees close to my front line and I release a horde of orcish warrior fodder mixed with Drow melee elites upon the aggressors as the ranged units continue pelting the enemy with all kinds of means like crossbows, bows, and _magic_ (charm, ice storms, lightning etc.). 

And I've only played this for a few hours so far, I wonder what elese there is find in this top-notch mod...

Phantasy 2018 is a rebuild of the original 'Phantasy Calradia' (2014) and let me tell you there's some action to be had here for a different flavor than vanilla to keep things fresh. While the graphics are a little dated (personally I think they're great, (been gaiming since the early 80s)) the game-play is absolutely timeless. When swords, pikes, and arrows start getting a little stale, here's a way to add some very interesting elements to everything because hell, an army of casters, healers, fighters, and more working in unison makes for a very interesting e-sport experience worthy of an epic Klingon ballad.

So a special thanks to all the modders involved over the years and of course to the original devs that made this epic game in the first place. This is a special game that stands out from others quite clearly and to be honest, I like it better than Bannerlord because of all the mods that are available. There are so many overhauls turning 1 game into hundreds making replayability a major feature of this title even beyond the enthralling game-play.

There's some serious 'bang for the buck' to be had here. This is how games are supposed to be made. 9/10",1580617267,1701718298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First thing you should know is this was probably the first series of games to reintroduce directional combat in modern pc gaming. Nowadays you got stuff like Chivalry or For Honour that do the same thing but back then it was a novelty. This might not be for everyone and takes some getting used to.

The campaing is only playble in singleplayer and is a blast, but does take some learning. You can start your character as a commoner or impoverished noble and venture forth in Calradia in hopes of being granted fiefdoms, or if you really have a lot of free time, uniting the disjointed potentates of the fallen empire.
It boasts probably the best market simulation in any video game including Runescape. Goods are produced in villages and towns, They are delivered by caravans and the supply in the markets is impacted by factors like how many villages have been pillaged and caravans assaulted. Tip, specially proffitable is the iron trade, Additionaly you can start businesses in towns to produce goods which will be in turn sold at the market price which might not allways turn in a proffit. It is interesting you don't even need to interact much with this part of the game, you will make enough money from looting and seeling the pillage anyways, or later from taxes from your demesne.
You notice some of the features in the game were afterthoughts but it is still nice to have them, specially given the time it came out. You can chose your own banner for example and then all your troops and settlements(Except villages) will have that flag hoisted. You can marry and make an alliance, you can solve repetitive quests for random nobles for fame and gold as well as increasing your standing in a given realm.",1408831636,1701683792,True,0,0,0.478375941514968872,0,True,False,False

An absolute classic, featuring a combat system which is both intuitive and also has a surprising amount of depth, a lovely big skill page to invest points into, and a massive sandbox world for you to explore, exploit and conquer.

Although its age does show in some places - a few bugs and spelling mistakes, quests which are unclear how to complete, and some balance issues. These flaws in no way overshadow what is excellent core gameplay. And, due to the games age, there are many great mods which not only fix these issues but also add new troops, weapons and armour amongst other things.

There is also the mod category of 'total conversion', these mods completely overhaul the game, such as A World Of Ice And Fire, a GOT themed mod which adds the entire continents of westeros and esteros, all major factions, new troops weapons and armours and so much more.

Yes the graphics show their age at times, but for me this doesn't ruin the immersion. 
Yes there is a bit of story going around in the background but in the end it is what you want it to be. 
And even if you feel you've explored and experienced all the elements you wish to in the game, then you can always expand or completely change your experience with many brilliant mods.

-The non-combat music is just so tranquil and evokes a strange melancholic feeling.
-The AI is janky and flawed, but it is pretty funny seeing enemy lords march back and forth while you siege their castle as if they are indecisive about whether to engage you or not.
-The wide variety of companions, with their likes and dislikes. Every player will have their preferred combination of companions, since you cannot viably use all of them at once.
-The graphics are outdated, sure. But again, this ties back to charm. There is visual clarity and you have room left for the imagination.
-The wide variety of builds with the RPG mechanics. You even have control over the stats of your companions.
-You could use strategy, or well, I mean, read any other review and you’ll see “F1+F3” (Charge!!!), You should at least put your archers on a hill behind infantry and then use cavalry to attack behind the enemy or something, but hey, you do you. But this game lets you get away with some really cheesy stuff, and that's part of the fun. 
-And most importantly, the ability to create your own story. Who needs an objective when you can make your own? The feeling of working your way up from a nobody is unmatched. And there is a certain sense of indirect urgency in knowing that the AI will continue to fight each other with or without your interference. Don’t want that faction to get too overpowered cause they are going to be your enemy? Well, you better fight them while you still have a good chance! Want to trade goods between towns and focus on just profit? You can do that too.

  I have played you for over 2,500 hours. In that time, we have experienced so much together. We have fought together, traded together, built kingdoms together, and fallen together. I had so much fun with you, so much anger, so much disappointment, but I have never given up on you. 

When I first played you, I was excited to explore that magical world. I would carve my own path in the dark and unforgiving world of the Middle Ages. I was defeated in my first battle, my first trade venture failed, but I didn't give up. I tried again and again, and eventually I succeeded.

We fought together. We fought against enemy armies, besieged castles, and toppled kingdoms. We traded together. We bought and sold goods, and made a profit. We built kingdoms together. We created our own kingdom, expanded our territory, and spread our fame. We fell together. We fought our enemies, were defeated, and were taken prisoner.

But we always came back to each other. I always wanted to play you, I always wanted to be with you. You were more than a game to me. You were a friend, a confidant, a lover.

Thanks to you, I have met people from different cultures and countries. We fought together, laughed together, and learned together. These friendships will last a lifetime. 

Every moment I have spent with you is a memory to me. I will never forget you.

Sincerely,

I've tried it all joining all the kingdoms and being a vassal, becoming the king myself, helping a claimant which is an interesting route but I've still never completed this game on another profile I have almost 200 hours and I had to buy this game again while it was on sale. In my opinion this is so much better then M&B II Bannerlord mostly because of the combat system + this game is a lot darker and less saturated I don't really get the hype for M&B 2 this is a lot better choice the playerbase is lower but you will always find someone to play this game with too and there's still plenty of mods available here on steam workshop but also on nexus mods and moddb exetera, give this game a try if you love medieval RPG games. The biggest con is probably it has no story, while it has quests they all get boring with time except a few ones but this game is all about conquering calradia which you will have to do one way or another, either you get beat or you do it and it's really fun regardless!",1660944569,1700726702,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

Today, I, your trusty fries game critic, am here to share my crunchy thoughts on the timeless classic, ""Mount & Blade: Warband."" Just like a perfectly golden fry, this game has stood the test of time and continues to be a hearty treat for strategy lovers.

Let's start with the visual seasoning – Warband may not be the flashiest fry in the basket, but it has a rustic charm that's as comforting as a batch of homemade tater tots. The graphics may not be truffle-infused, but they serve their purpose well, immersing you in a medieval world where the clash of steel is as familiar as the sound of sizzling spuds.

Now, onto the gameplay – the heart and soul of any game, much like salt is to our beloved fries. Warband serves up a feast of epic battles and strategic conquests that are as satisfying as perfectly seasoned curly fries. The combat system is straightforward but requires a delicate touch, much like achieving the perfect crispiness in your fries. Whether you're leading a cavalry charge or commanding your troops in a siege, the game offers a spud-tacular blend of action and strategy.

The freedom to carve your path through the potato fields of Calradia is where Warband truly shines. Much like choosing your favorite dipping sauce for fries, the game lets you decide your destiny – be it a noble lord, a roving mercenary, or a potato farmer turned warrior. The sandbox nature of the game gives you the freedom to shape your adventure, just like choosing between curly, shoestring, or wedges.

The soundtrack, like the seasoning on a seasoned fry, enhances the overall experience. The medieval tunes set the mood for epic battles and diplomatic spud-negotiations, adding a layer of flavor to the immersive world of Calradia.

While the visuals and mechanics might feel a bit dated, much like a classic shoestring fry, Warband's charm lies in its simplicity and depth. The game has a timeless quality that, much like a well-seasoned fry, keeps you coming back for more.

In conclusion, Mount & Blade: Warband may not have the glitz and glamour of a gourmet fry, but its strategic depth, immersive world, and freedom of choice make it a classic that's as satisfying as a plate of your favorite fries. So, grab your spud-shaped sword, lead your army into battle, and relish in the enduring delight that is Mount & Blade: Warband. Fry-tastic! 🍟✨",1693265631,1700705879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Захватывать территории не сложно. В метабилде проще, но можно и просто гриндом. Но чтобы их удержать - на территории надо ставить вассалов.
Если вассал не дурачок, то он копит войска, тренирует их, не кошмарит работяг и патрулирует свои территории, ломая лица рванине, которая атакует караваны. Если вассал дурачок, то вассал кошмарит своих работяг, набирает в войска рванину, сам атакует караваны и огрызается на соседей. Дурачок вассал или нет - зависит от [i]характера[/i] NPC.

Список [i]благородных[/i] NPC от игры к игре не меняется, но в каждой новой игре игра случайно раздаёт характеры неписям. Поэтому для эффективного достижения конечной цели, военного объединения всей карты в одно государство, нужно не столько качать персонажа, сколько по максимуму взаимодействовать с неписями. Зачем? Чтобы выяснить их характер и навести дружбу с теми, кто будет вассалом-недурачком.

Поэтому с самого начала игры [b]все[/b] именные NPC должны быть у вас на карандаше. Каждый лорд должен быть постоянно на карандаше. Особенно если вы задумаете женить/замужить ГГ. Нужно понимать, с кем роднитесь и с кем они ""в разладе"". Потому что породниться с толпой отбитых, которые огрызаются на всех без разбора - это катастрофически хуже, чем прокачать навыки ГГ как попало. Ставить вассалов на земли тоже желательно аккуратно, потому что если соседи будут враждовать - задолбаетесь их мирить. Это не сложно, это нужно их найти и уболтать, а это долго. Поэтому бОльшая часть игры - это разговоры с ноблями, с целью выяснить их характеры, их взаимные отношения и всё писать в книжечку. В книжечку, на карандаш. И делать им одолжения, чтобы крепко сдружиться с недурачками и их семьями.

В игре нет никакого внутреннего журнала взаимодействий ГГ с ноблями, равно как и внутриигровой записной книжки, поэтому детали игрок пишет где-нибудь ещё. Сам.

Как настоящий майор.

Майор, который станет императором. Если будет аккуратно вести личные дела вассалов, конечно.",1699466614,1699466614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are new to the series and can afford it, then it's probably better to get Bannerlord instead as that game has weapon smithing, siege weapons, and so much more.
However, Warband is home to many awesome mods. In fact, this game beats Bannerlord in that regards... for now anyway. I still recommend this game, though.

Fun: 10/10 - wars, sieges, raids, battles, what more can be said?

Gameplay: 9/10 - good blend of strategic map conquest and first-person battles

Graphics: 6/10 - pretty old and outdated now, but impressive for the time

Extras: 10/10 - extensive modpacks (specifically Floris) make this game worth playing years after its release

Playtime: 9/10 - long playtime, but you might want to try this game’s sequel, Bannerlord, eventually

Basically it's amazing, the core game is made of solid fundations (though the graphics are admittedly dated even by 2010 standards) with a fun core gameplay loop that was then built upon by countless mods. From small balance tweaks to full-blown recreations of historical conflicts to complete fantasy overhauls (including universes such as LotR, Warhammer Fantasy and even some original fantasy settings), there's something for everyone.

I still enjoy going back to this once in a while to replay a campaign or two, as Bannerlord's mods are not anywhere near as complete as Warband ones at the moment, even if the core game is obviously better in almost every aspect, especially siege battles.

AWAY WITH YOU, VILE BEGGAR!

Now that we're all vaguely forgetting that Bannerlord existed, in the same way I vaguely forget what day it is, we're all coming back to Papa Warband. A game that looks like a potato, plays like utter trash but achieves the right approach to the ""open world"" gameplay that so many have tried to do without succeeding. It's one thing to be an ""open world"" game that strings you along a singular story and let you choose what you want to do. Then there's Warband that tells you nothing except the basics of fighting before kicking you out into the world with 3.50 in denars, five random Swadian villagers who just vaguely follow your orders and lets you figure the rest out.

You are some random goon who gets thrown into the medieval world of Calradia, a once unified continent now in the midst of classic old world squabbling. You must decide which of the factions you want to ""work"" with, which mainly devolves into either following along with your other lords and justifying spending another war having YET ANOTHER FEAST while the Khan takes your towns, burning down 55% of the Kingdom of Rhodoks and selling their generals to Ransom Brokers or enforcing 100% tariffs on random trade caravans until the Sultan call a fatwa on you for stealing all of his paprika. All the while slowly erecting the basic framework of your own military industrial complex based entirely on breweries and weavers built in random towns. To fund your mercenary machine.

Does this game have flaws? Of course. The menu system is a great and terrible reminder that this game is now old enough to have graduated high school and be making mistakes in college, and in lieu of a tutorial this game maintains one of the most in-depth note sections I've ever seen. That being said, the basic frame work of Warband is terribly effective. And even more so in the modding scene. You can add mods that turn this from Sengoku Jidai Japan to Star Wars to WWI and this game chugs along like nothing happens. My personal favorite is still the cowboy mod, solely because you break the game the very second you acquire a Henry rifle.

Warband is scuffed, old, creaking and cantankerous, but it is still one of the most engrossing games I've ever played. I can lose hours to this thing solely because I enjoy running around the world pummeling the snot out of random looters and selling them into servitude. And making fat stacks with stolen goods.

There is little or no hand-holding or even a main quest to follow.  You start out with nothing and build up a band of warriors to take into battle, expand your realm and take on some of the bigger challenges in the game.

The primal screams of battle and victory your npcs make elevate this already great game to the status of perfection. 

This is one of the greatest rpgs I've ever played in the same league of excellence as og Pokemon and Skyrim with such a uniquely fun system that makes me wonder at the possibilities for other games. Building up your character and squads, commanding units from the front line in a great combat engine and maneuvering the politics and war strategies to build money and power has an endlessly addicting and rewarding gameplay once you start to learn the intricacies and possibilities. 

[b] The Combat[/b] The directional blocking, chambering and momentum based damage bonuses among other subtle mechanics make the combat really deep and fun but also intuitive. It can be a tough learning curve at first but there are great difficulty and mechanic settings to tweak your experience(If struggling I recommend turning down damage to yourself slightly early on but leaving it normal for your allies and messing with the npc battle set ups in main menu to get the feel for the battles). The feeling of successfully leading a cavalry charge, while placing your infantry/archers properly to defeat a tough army you used to run from, saving your only peasant village in the process, is a satisfaction like no other. 

Sometimes rough around the edges but amazingly crafted at the core, you can tell they really focused on developing the things that mattered and the game accomplishes a very specific and unique kind of gaming experience. I've had a blast and haven't even finished a playthrough or messed with the many awesome looking mods yet. 


-There's a lot of ways to play and progress the brutal sandbox world with little guidance which is part of the fun but I do think its worth checking out a few guides on combat and what not or just reading some basics on the wiki if you want to save a bit of time but isn't necessary.

I have been an avid gamer for many years, and few games have captivated my attention and imagination like Mount & Blade: Warband. This medieval action RPG is an absolute masterpiece that seamlessly blends strategy, combat, and role-playing elements into a captivating gaming experience. Here's why I believe it deserves a solid 5-star review:

1. Immersive Medieval World: From the moment you step into the fictional continent of Calradia, you're transported to a meticulously crafted medieval world. The landscapes, cities, and castles are beautifully designed, making you feel like a true medieval lord or lady.

2. Open-Ended Gameplay: One of the most remarkable aspects of Mount & Blade: Warband is its open-ended nature. You're free to choose your own path, whether it's becoming a noble, forming your own army, or embarking on a life of banditry. The choices are endless, and every playthrough feels unique.

3. Engaging Combat: The real-time combat system is the heart of this game. Leading your troops into battle is incredibly satisfying, and the controls are easy to learn but difficult to master. Whether you're swinging a sword on horseback or commanding archers from a distance, the combat never gets old.

4. Deep Strategy: Managing your kingdom, forming alliances, and making critical decisions as a ruler adds a layer of strategic depth to the game. Your choices have consequences, and you'll need to think tactically to succeed in the complex political landscape of Calradia.

5. Modding Community: The Mount & Blade community is renowned for its dedication to modding, and the game supports an extensive library of user-created content. Whether you want to explore new worlds or enhance the existing one, the possibilities are endless.

6. Longevity: I've spent countless hours in Calradia, and I still find myself coming back for more. The replay value is astounding, and it's easy to sink hundreds of hours into this game without feeling bored.

7. Multiplayer: The multiplayer mode allows you to test your skills against other players in various game modes, adding even more depth and excitement to an already incredible game.

While Mount & Blade: Warband may not have the most cutting-edge graphics, its gameplay, depth, and replayability more than make up for it. This is a game that rewards patience and strategy, making it an absolute must-play for fans of medieval history, role-playing, and epic battles. Whether you're charging into battle with your knights or plotting your rise to power, Mount & Blade: Warband offers an unforgettable gaming experience that stands the test of time.

My review is more for viking conquest honestly as that is what my hours were poured into. I will say that this game, although old and a bit jank, is absolutely a blast. Working your way up from a pathetic dweeb with nothing to your name to a King of your own domain is riveting. 

The modding community is also peak, the ASOIAF mod in particular is outstanding.

This game is a magnificent sandbox, if you are looking for deep story and quests, look elsewhere. But if you are looking to make your own adventure, be it trading, bandit hunting, raiding caravans, mercenary work etc; then you should love this. Most of the time you will start out doing a mix of these before joining/creating a kingdom and going on to conquer the land. 

The basic game flow is something like this. You start with little money, very basic equipment and after a little recruiting, a small force of peasants. Then gradually find/buy/loot better equipment, level up, promote your soldiers that survive, recruit companions with skills to fill the gaps in your skill set, give them better equipment and level them up. Interact and work for the different factions, get renown and reputation by winning battles etc.

The base game is definitely worth the price and will keep you interested for at least a couple of full games, the DLC adds to the base game nicely but the real gem here is the modding scene. There are many total conversion mods which have been developed over many years and provide complete experiences of their own. Be it Game of Thrones, Middle Earth, the Witcher or more historical eras such as the Crusades or ancient China there are plenty of mods with hundreds more hours worth of play time. This is the main reason why Warband still has an edge over Bannerlord, the mods for the new title are still in their early stages and it will be years before they can compare to whats on offer here.

[h2]Rating: ★★★★★[/h2]

Mount & Blade: Warband is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time, delivering a medieval sandbox experience like no other. From the moment you step into the chaotic world of Calradia, you're thrust into a dynamic and immersive journey that offers endless possibilities.

The heart of Warband lies in its open-ended gameplay. You're free to choose your path, be it as a valiant knight serving a king, a cunning merchant amassing wealth, or a ruthless warlord conquering kingdoms. The freedom to shape your character's destiny is nothing short of remarkable.

The combat system in Warband is where the game truly shines. Mounted or on foot, battles are epic and visceral, requiring strategy, skill, and mastery of various weapons. The feeling of leading a cavalry charge or expertly landing a headshot with a bow is incredibly satisfying.

As you build your army, you'll engage in large-scale medieval warfare, from siege battles to skirmishes. The thrill of commanding troops in the heat of battle and seeing your banner rise above captured castles is unforgettable.

The modding community for Warband is one of the most active and creative I've encountered. With a plethora of mods available, you can completely overhaul the game, adding new factions, maps, and gameplay mechanics. This extends the game's replayability to nearly endless proportions.

Admittedly, Warband's graphics may not be on par with modern AAA titles, but its gameplay depth more than compensates for any visual shortcomings. And let's not forget the incredible sense of immersion the game creates through its medieval soundtrack and atmospheric world.

In conclusion, Mount & Blade: Warband is a masterpiece of sandbox gaming. It may have been released years ago, but it continues to captivate players with its freedom, combat, and modding possibilities. Whether you're a fan of medieval history, strategy, or just open-world adventures, Warband is an experience that should not be missed. It's a journey that you'll happily embark on again and again.",1375481078,1694787500,True,2,0,0.540229856967926025,0,True,False,False

My first character went to Swadia and was doing decently until he made the mistake of riding towards Reyvadin and got demolished by Sea Raiders. It takes a little while to learn the game but once you do you will see just how easily you will climb your way to the top. Most lords have a few God-tier troops and the rest of their army is slop so if you have even a small army of hardened troops you will stomp anybody in your path. I've defeated groups of three lords with well over 130+ troops simply because 98 of those troops were Spearmen that were easily crushed beneath the hoofs of my Knight's horses. I love the diplomacy in this game and having to gain favor with your fellow lords and even your enemy, hearing what they have to say and developing the world around you. This is yet another game where you feel like you're part of the world instead of the entire world. I have watched Rhodoks take over Sultan territory, I have watched Swadia get dragged into a three-prong war and decimated, I have watched Vaegirs drive deep into Khanate land vice versa. My second character is man of legend and any who oppose him will meet his Sword of War and perish. 

Long live Gorg Turgen, he is the true ruler of Calradia. 

May his son who is riding to wherever Bannerlord takes place prosper as he has.

Also Napoleonic Wars is great but I really wish it had a campaign and damn do the bot battles just kinda suck. The AI just kinda gets stuck on a wall on certain maps so it's just you getting vanished by volley fire as you try to solo the other also equally stuck in their spawn army.

This Game looks so old. It looks so simple. Like Gothic from 2001, for example. But like Gothic, M&B is an awsome game! It is complicated to beginn with, because you dont know what to do, but internet helps.

My tipps for starting:

1. Save Game take part on tournaments and place bets on yourself. If you lose just quit and load again.

2. Swadian Knights are killer. Rodhok have great Archers and Pikeniers. Nords have killer Infantrie. But behold, if you have Troops from enemy kingdoms your moral gets down.

3. for the first weeks, work for a lord as a hired sword. Trading can get you income, but its hard.

4. Start to raid towns from enemy kingdoms. First I thought ""Oh no, the poor Townspeople!"" but its the only save (though you will get attacked by enemy armys by chance. so QICKSAVE) and easy way to get money at first.

5. when you have enough money buy enterprises in towns. they generate money automaticly. but you can just have one per town. And pay attention to the profit the guildmaster will tell you. Some generate negative income.

6. Become a Vasall and besiege enemy towns. If the King likes you, you get one. If not, good luck.

Yeah and you need to be respected from all other partys so do tasks for the king and the other lords. If you win against an enemy speak to the King, he will pat on your back and his respect towards you rises.

Always go in a battle yourself. with some tactical commands and just the fact you do your stuff  on the battlefield, you can win against armys that are three times yours.

Thats what I learned about the game till now. Hope it will help someone.


Sorry for spelling. Just 5 hours of sleep.

Progression in terms of power accumulation is very slow. Some of the quests such as delivering cattle are painfully awkward and protracted, having to try to guide said cattle to the location but they are destined to go in any direction they like. It would've been so much better to just have them added to the party. The tournament is a joke - ""I want to be in the MELEE fight please"" ""Okay, I'll just randomly give you a weapon, which could be a bow and arrows"", combat is rather stiff and stilted, stalling at random times and requiring you to be just the right distance (naturally you'd need to be close with melee weapons, but too close and it starts to bug out); and letting your soldiers fight without you is inadvisable, I've lost more battles than I care to count due to this.

It's set in the fictional land of Calradia with factions that resemble real world nations. The game is non-linear with no set objectives, but a common goal is to conquer the entirety of Calradia. 

The game's strong points are its combat mechanics (featuring directional attacking and blocking), character skill system, and large modding community. The weak points are its low quality graphics and animations, poor quest design, lack of a proper overarching story, as well as general bugs, quirks, and some questionable design decisions. 

I wouldn't recommend spending much time with the vanilla / base game. The mods are where it's at. Here are some of my favorite mods, as well as the most popular ones:

[list]
[*]Diplomacy (adds QoL features without changing much else,  used in other mods)
[*]DiploVexed (vanilla but way less grindy + Diplomacy)
[*]Custom Character Creation (vanilla but with more freedom during character creation)
[*]Floris Evolved (""Mount & Blade: Warband: Enhanced Edition"")
[*]Gekokujo (Sengoku era Japan - my personal favorite)

[*]The last Days of the Third Age (Lord of the Rings)
[*]A World of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire)
[*]Prophecy of Pendor (fantasy)
[*]Star Wars Conquest (Star Wars)
[*]Brytenwalda (dark age British Isles - btw these devs were hired to make the Viking Conquest DLC)

It has an active modding community, and mods that have been upgraded and improved over decades of work by dedicated teams. Many of them could have made money as a game in their own right, but instead the creators brought them to us free with this game. It still boggles my mind that I continue to get sweet upgrades to ""The Last Days"" mod even in 2023!

Native Warband is also pretty sweet in it's own right. High action, loads of awesome gear, large variety of available troops, the list goes on... If you've never tried it, you should definitely give it a go. The official mods are also pretty good, especially Viking Conquest, which adds a load of realism as well as sea travel and combat.

Pros:
- Great combat system; very enjoyable and intense. Feels realistic and works great during both 1vs1 or 100vs100 encounters.
- Very good trading system. Also feels realistic. You buy wine in one city and sell it in another across the sea for much more. Hundreds of different resources from strategic to luxurious and hundreds of possibilities to find your favourite trading routes.
- Epic battles - being able to give commands to your troops during battle.
- Ability to hire all sorts of troops as well as real companions who you can give horses, equipment.
- A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES. You can expand your warband, conquer villages, cities or kingdoms. You can get your reputation high or low. You can be feared of or hated or loved. You can ride monasteries. Get Fame, Kill Jarls. Buy horses, ships and mansions. There is a lot to do.
- Relations between companions and npcs
- Politics between kingdoms; battles you can join as 3rd party, border incidents, kidnappings, raiding caravans, Wars. Different ways to make two kingdoms hate each other. Everything is there. 

Cons:
- Campaign and plot is almost non existent. Story is poorly written and not interesting. And it is very hard to follow it
- NPCs do stuff randomly out of order and sometimes their actions do not make any sense.
- Difficulty is all over the place. Nothing is balanced. You get encounters with bandits that are super easy and then you get encounter where only you and 2 of your mates raid slavers and there is like 50 of them with the bandit king being able to one shot you on realistic difficulty. I had to lower everything down for this encounter and cheese the game to try to lure them in smaller numbers to win it and it was very painful. I have army of 100 people great warriors. Why my character decides to take only 2 people with him to raid small army of slavers? It does not make any sense. It is like that all the time. The game does not let you chose who you take with you it is always random. The same with tournaments you can get sword, spear or stick. If you get stick you have no chance.
- Too much grind to actually get something expensive. You spend like 10 hours of trading away and travelling between cities to get like 20-30k cash and then one ship costs up to 50k, everything is super expensive and weekly cost to upkeep your troops is very high so this game is a constant grind for money which is tiring after a while when the trading gets really boring
- There is a huge world yes but all the cities, villages, towns and monasteries look exactly the same. New countries look the same. When you visited one you visited them all so sailing away to a new land isnt exciting at all. And it definitely should be. Except for a few special encounters on maps like raiding slavers, fighting huge man or an old hero there isnt much to do in terms of exploring. Exploring is simply boring and slow
- Quests are repeating. Yes random quests given by jarls, village leaders or fort reeves are repeating all the time. So yes how many fort reeves may have got their lute stolen by a guard who now is hiding in some random village? The answer is a lot. How many villages will ask you to train them to fight off bandits? Again quite a few. And so on and so on. It gets repetitive. 
- Huge map - it is very hard to keep track of quests. For example Quest says you have to go to this village Retards Ham and it does not say in which kingdom it is or there is no pointer to click on. You have to manually go to the map and scan through hundred of villages and cities to look for the name. It literally can take like 15 minutes if you are unlucky. The same with people who give you quests. When you finish quest it says go back to Jarl Harlasson or whatever but it does not remind you in what fort he resides or what cities he visit. You have to look for him so I ended up not finishing many quests because of that.
- Graphics are really dated and ugly but this is an old game to it isnt really a con but still with all landscapes looking alike and the same grey cities this game just looks ugly. It could use some more colours to be honest
- After 26hours of playtime I lost interest in the game as all of it felt pointless. You can be jarl and conquer kingdoms but the main character lacks personality and agenda. He is driven by revenge but the plot just gets lost somewhere and you end up grinding for money and expanding your warband without higher goal to achieve. I had this feeling that I lost time on this game

So all in all this is a game definitely worth looking at as it is unique - you may like it. But I cannot recommend it due to all the cons I listed and I do not think it is for me. I also think a lot of people who leave positive reviews (and have 1000s of hours of playtime) do it because of nostalgia (and multiplayer perhaps?). Plus yeah actual fighting gameplay is second to none so that is that too.",1691329273,1691329878,False,2,4,0.508062303066253662,0,True,False,False

The added features make an already great game even better, and basically adds more opportunities of economical and diplomatic tweaks and twerks aswell as some added weapon and armor upgrades, making an already substantially enjoyable game experience better.

Start of every war both sides go on a village burning spree that will disable your ability to gather more troops or generate passive funds (of which are few options) to further combat the enemy faction, factions being a very loose term as lord will jump ship or be booted out like its a catholic church.

So much potential and still such a let down, get it on sale and mode the crap out of it starting with fixing the troop placement at the start of battles.

Regardless, single player isn't what I want to stress on this review, I wanna talk about the multiplayer aspect.

Where should I start... I started late at 2016, at the time all the ""Whor3banders"" who dwell in GK TDM and TG_Arena are pretty much autistically good at this game already, so as you might have guessed it, I was severely tortured physically and mentally (no cap, those guys are absolutely ruthless). However, something about the gaming mechanics kept me going to reached the 3300 hours (roughly) I have now.

You know what it is? I think it's because the combat mechanics is fundamentally flawed if you factored in the ridiculous ways of feinting, spins, and footwork those aforementioned MAXIMUM AUTISM players have introduced. This is probably the greatest irony I have seen in gaming, a game that was never intended to be ""perfect"" ended up beating its sequel - Bonerlord in terms of multiplayer close quarter combat. If you played both and have invested ample amount of time in their online TDM servers, you will know of the difference I am stressing.

Gonna sound like a cringy old fool to end this rant: ""Off it goes the good ol' days of Warband, just thankful the bastards in GK_TDM cured my autism, but I guess all banquets come to an end""

It starts out really fun: you recruit some farmers, fight some bandits, sell equipment, purchase armor, fight in tournaments, upgrade your units. Quite often you will accidentally run into a big army that will devastate all of your progress and you essentially start back from the beginning. Once you get your army up to around 100 units the game becomes pretty stagnate. Once you start your own faction it gets very tedious. Your lords wont conquer as many cities as you want so you have to do most of the work which gets very boring as sieges truly suck.

To be honest, its a guilty pleasure of mine, but that doesn't mean its bad by any means.  In fact Mount & Blade is kind of like a premier chef handing you his hat, and letting you into his own private kitchen for a whole day before merely saying, ""Have fun, remember to clean up when you're done,"" before walking out of the room.  That being said, what that terrible analogy kind of means is that its a very experimental, do-whatever-you-want-sort-of experience.  You can fight bandits all day, raid villages, engage in petty squabbles with fellow lords (or ladies), challenge drunks to bar fights, you can play the trade game and invest wisely in local business ventures, or you could just read books while watching the world burn down around you.

Truly there is no better freedom in a game then being able to literally retire and then come back to adventuring as if its quite simply a minor inconvenience.  This sort of freedom to go wherever does have a few caveats of course, you will get into trouble, whether its random dice-rolls of bandits attacking YOU in the city streets, or deserters from local armies asking you for money very impolitely before steam-rolling you with cavalry if you say no, or literally losing a tournament because a stray pixel from a blunt jousting lance struck you for 6 damage due to insane RNG causing you to be eliminated.  Basically most things in Mount & Blade are resolved through conflict, with very little not being resolved by conflict.  So in many ways, the easiest things to do to make money are kind of boring, like hiring a bunch of cavalry and fighting sea raiders ad nauseam till you can afford some decent equipment.  Or fighting sea raiders till your renown is so high every Kingdom within 50 miles wants to hire you ASAP, so you can get a fief that will be instantly raided by the first lord in whichever adjacent kingdom you happen to be at war with.  Politics?  Politics are sort of goofy.  You can bait kingdoms into wars, you can join up with outcasts to reclaim kingdoms, and you can even just do dirty work for one particular lord (in each faction) to cause untold disaster.  My favorite is joining Swadia and causing every single faction to go to war with them at once, which is hilarious.  Swadia sucks, and is typically first on the chopping block as far as elimination is concerned.  Their AI also causes them to often throw tournaments and feasts- even when they're constantly losing castles or cities.

The AI is terrible.  I mean its all pretty funny when a level 0 looter can knock you out with a rock to your face, but they also aren't programmed to adjust tactics quickly enough to avoid getting a sword in the face by a drive-by horse assault.  I would say the worst offenders in terms of clearly getting a handicap are the tundra bandits, forest bandits (who get some crazy two-handed bonus damage resulting in instant K.O.'s on your troops), and steppe bandits who are absolutely terrible in combat, but if they charge you with a lance its lights out.  The horse combat is atrocious, but its the best the engine can do.  Same with sieges, though I understand the idea, its just the way they play out that make them aggravating.  Basically everyone gets bunched together slowly walking up a ladder to get.. instantly killed by archers or elite infantry and its pretty bad.  However, even with all these flaws, the game is never really boring.  If you get bored of something, you can ride somewhere else, start a new army, hire manhunters, go slave hunting and selling.  You can go do combat trials, arena fights, hire various party members to bolster skills you don't have.  If you want the ultimate challenge?  Try playing as a woman in Mount & Blade.  That's literally the hardest difficulty in the game- seriously.

I could on and on about everything in Mount & Blade, but I'll tell you this: I don't even like Action RPG's, but I love Mount & Blade.  Its that good.  So I seriously recommend it, though the combat system takes some time to get used to, after that its pretty smooth sailing.  Just don't pick crossbows.  Just don't.",1629057442,1690389659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am recommending this game to people with busy lives and people with a lot of free time as the game plays well for both. The nature of the game is such that it is what you want it to be. You want to go on a 3 day binge then sure that's great but its equally fantastic if you'd rather spend an hour or two each day. The game is gripping and interesting and you can decide if you want set goals or if you want to set your own goals so it truly is a game for the masses.

It's this legendary game developed by TaleWorlds Entertainment that takes you back to the medieval era. It's like this sandbox RPG where you can build your own army, fight epic battles, and become a true legend.

The beauty of Warband is the freedom it gives you, bro. You can carve your own path, forge alliances, or be a lone wolf. You can recruit soldiers, upgrade your gear, and conquer kingdoms. It's all about building your reputation and becoming a force to be reckoned with.

I gotta keep it real, though. Warband is an old game, so the graphics might not blow you away. But trust me, once you get into the gameplay, you won't even notice. It's got that addictive blend of strategic planning and real-time combat that keeps you hooked.

If you're into medieval battles and epic adventures, man, Warband is a classic that you can't miss. So grab your sword, saddle up your horse, and prepare to enter a world where legends are made.",1688973321,1688973321,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Mount & Blade: Warband is a game released on March 30th, 2010, by the Turkish company ‘TaleWorld’ Entertainment. The game is set on a fictional region of Europe called ‘Calradia’ in the year 1257. The objective of the game is rather simple: rule all of Calradia. You start as a lonely man (or woman) who during your childhood dreamt of being a warrior and a leader of a mercenary warband. To recruit more people to your warband you can either recruit villagers or go to taverns located in cities and recruit more experienced people such as Knights, Paladins, Bandits, Hunters etc. (tends to be more expensive). What needs to be kept in mind is that the more people you have in your warband, the more money you need to have to pay their salary, because if you don’t, then lots of people will start deserting from your group. 

The game has six different factions you can be part of: Kingdom of Swadia, Kingdom of Rhodocks, Kingdom of Nords, Kingdom of Vaegirs, Khergit Kanate and Sarranid Sultanate. When you join a faction, as either a warrior or vassal, you’ll from then on fight for that faction, besieging castles and fighting against vassals from enemy factions. You may also create your own faction, but then ruling Calradia becomes way more difficult. There’s also the possibility to strengthen your relationship with a vassal by marrying someone from his family.

The way economy works in the game is simple. The currency is ‘denars’ and you can earn them in various ways, such as completing tasks delivered to you by vassals, buy a land to manage a mill, you can, after battles, sell the gear from the enemies, or even raid villages. If you conquer a city from another kingdom or conquer back one of yours, and you become the lord of it, you’re able to hire people to manage the economy of the city, the garrison, and the prisoners. 

Overall, my experience with Mount & Blade: Warband was and still is very pleasing. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple this game is. What I liked the most is the combat system. You can choose from how you want your sword to swing to if you want first-person or third person. However, what I disliked the most was the fact that, sometimes AI (Artificial Intelligence) gets stuck in some corners, and I end up losing a lot of troops because of such programming errors. I would certainly recommend you buy the game!",1688835520,1688835520,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Build your character and army up to whatever you want to be and do. 
It is very open ended you can be a bandit hunter or behave like a bandit yourself. 
Strive to build an army to fight in the many kingdom wars all over.
Build friendships and create enemies.
Today I charged into a dozen battles at least with my army who most i trained from village volunteers to sturdy soldiers and knights. Then I went and helped in seiging castle charging up the ladder or sniping the snipers whatever you want your playstyle to be in a battle like that.
Commanding your troops on the battlefield with great care or my favourite tell them to hold position and i charge about on horseback hitting and running the enemy all over.
You can fight alongside other armies that are friendly , you can save them from defeat if you see them on the open map and come to their aid.
Do favors for different Lords and get rewarded and build your friendships with them. I had a difficult task of rescuing someone from a castle so i snuck in beat up the guard got the key and got out with the prisoner. I had help from nearby but im not going to give away any tips here.
Which leads onto the next thing there are lots and lots of guides out there to help you and i recommend reading the manual and indepth guides there are a lot of layers to this game but how much you go into it is up to you, you could walk around the map just trading if you really wanted to.

I recommend Viking DLC since not only it offers just as much as the main game , but also improve it and add a good story campaign as well.

From the Third Age of Middle Earth to the Napoleonic Wars, I have so many incredible memories of playing this game:
Forming the lines of Rohirrim and breaking the ranks of Isengard and Mordor,
Reclaiming Moria for the great descendants of mighty Durin,
Becoming Oda Nobunaga's right hand vassal and the most powerful woman in Japan,
Fixing bayonets and charging through volleys of musket fire while standard bearers wave our glorious flag,
Seizing enemy positions and chasing them to fallback lines, while Les Mis blares in my headphones,
And many more. I love this game!

It is fun to use the medieval weapons used in the game to simulate duels from the old times. I think the online is smooth and works very well. Most of the people in the game are nice and it is very easy to learn the game. I think that there are some downsides though. I don't like that you have to buy the gun dlc for the game, as I would love for it to be in the original game. I also think that some parts of this game can be a little bit boring when doing things offline. Overall solid game, would give a thumbs up :)

The basic gameplay concept is genius - lead your own medieval army, fight in massive battles, develop your skills as a warrior, and forge your own path in a realm rife with conflict.

There's just so much freedom in how you choose to play. You can follow the main story quests, become a mercenary captain, build your own kingdom from scratch, or just roam the lands as a traveling adventurer for hire. Everything from trading, tournaments, bandit-hunting, and castle sieges are at your fingertips. And as you progress, you really feel your characters grow in power and influence.

But what keeps bringing me back again and again are the amazing mods. I've spent over a hundred hours in mods like A Clash of Kings (based on Game of Thrones), The Last Days (Lord of the Rings), and so many more historical or fantasy-inspired mods. They provide an entirely new campaign and scope for Warband's already addictive gameplay loop.

The A Clash of Kings and The Last Days mods are prime examples of how Warband's modding community has breathed new life into the game. A Clash of Kings transports you to Westeros during the events of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels. You can champion different houses during the ongoing civil war and shape the fate of the Seven Kingdoms. The Last Days mod brings J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth to life, allowing you to fight for Gondor, Rohan, or Mordor during the War of the Ring. With overhauled factions, troops, quests, and environments, these mods feel like entirely new games crafted within Warband's framework.

More broadly, modding has given Warband unprecedented longevity, allowing it to remain relevant and worth playing over a decade later. A constant stream of new mods means there are always fresh campaigns, settings, and historical periods for players to explore. From ancient Rome to the Viking age to steampunk worlds, modders have turned Warband into their own personal sandbox for creativity. The game's mod tools and robust systems make it easy for motivated fans to develop new mods and reshape the gameplay in almost any imaginable way. The result is a level of variety, customization, and ""replay value"" few games can match even a decade after launch.

Even though Bannerlord improved the engine and graphics, I still come back to Warband thanks to fantastic mods that enrich the core experience, giving me many new characters and stories to immerse myself in. The basic gameplay and sandbox structure are as fun and timeless as ever. If you enjoy open-world RPGs and medieval strategy, Warband without a doubt deserves a spot in your game library.",1589918920,1686867608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros,

I am going to start with the modding community, just incredible and better than the DLC's, even some better than Bannerlord which is a shame.
This game will run on a calculator.
Easy learning curve which isn't too brutal.
Plenty of troop trees, tactics, formations and battles.
A story which allows you to do whatever you wish.
Satisfying combat and character progression.
The option to go from a somebody to a nobody with no forced paths.
Graphically pleasing but only in the sense it makes me feel like I am playing a game from my childhood.
Many battle areas which all bring their own challenges.
An almost Fable like good/evil system where choices you make on day 30 might screw you over on day 300.
Combat that is easy to learn and hard to master.
Ways to make money that don't involve killing everyone and everything.
Sound design that is basic but fills the need it is required for.

Cons,

The game still has some bugs, some which mean resetting long sieges.
The DLC's don't have achievements and are rather pricey.
Native balancing is an issue which shouldn't have been left to modders to fix.
Battle size limited to 150 which is nothing on modern hardware.
The game can be a little grindy when you are conquering the final few factions.
The persuasion system is strange and doesn't always make sense.
The XP curve is crazy for levelling up.
The morale system is somewhat flawed.


Warband is an amazing game, but you truly have to be willing to learn and have patience.

I would recommend buying this before purchasing any of the other games in the series as this game was truly the first time anyone took notice and there is a good reason for it.

Mount and Blade Warband is a great game, even after many years.

You can create your own hero, edit his or her stats (yes, you can play as a woman), his tactics, bow abilities, long sword abilities, and so on.
 After that, you can choose your own place of origin. You can choose Khergit Khanate, Kingdom of Nords, Sarranid Sultanate, and many others. You can even create your own faction if you have the resources necessary to do so!
 In the early stages of the game, you play as a somewhat poor soldier, businessman, thief of whatever you want to be, later on, you control massive armies with other counts or kings, make thousands of denars or even be the most feared thief, you can choose your own story and gameplay.
 You can battle bandits, villagers, and enemy soldiers or even lay siege on castles and cities.
 Just imagine, battling with other counts and kings against the enemy's hundreds of soldiers, using soldiers, cavalry, terrain, and formations to your advantage. Then having a large battle over some small castle or city that can turn the tide of war. There are many things to do, and you choose what to do.

Graphics are somewhat mid but in some places can be beautiful. If you really want 4k graphics, try looking for some other game or try mods which I will talk about later.

The game is playable even on low-end computers (like mine). I am playing on somewhat high graphics settings and I am getting 60+ fps, even on some big battles. So if you have a low-end pc, it's the right game for you.

The game has a variety of mods, including more variability in editing your character, better graphics, bigger battles of 1000+ units, playing in a fictional world or some even change the game completely, castles, cities, units, kings, terrain, and so on...

If you are still hesitating, get it on sale.

Siege battles are tedious and very stupid (what with one ladder access) and the gate can't even be opened. 

The spear, the fundamental melee group weapon, is completely unplayable either on foot or mounted.

Success in battles with lords quickly feels as it becomes: inconsequential. You defeat a Lord in battle, they then likely escape and in 2 weeks they will have another army.

With 100% damage to you and your troops, the need to specialise your character becomes paramount. The exponential decrease in experience gained over time means you realistically need to focus on a INT or CHR build. 

One leads to great surgery and pathfinding stats (but a max army size of around 100), the other provides a bigger army (perhaps around 180), though it's likely you will move too slow to move around the map and you will take a boatload of casualties.",1663928700,1682160695,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Starting from the most important aspect of all games- the price- You can buy this game on a sale for like 2$ so it's terribly cheap, and I love that fact.
Game itself provides sufficient amount of content, and many, many ways to play it. The main goal is to create your own kingdom. You can achieve it in many various ways. By starting as a mercenary for another king and eventually become their vassal, being a merchant, or even leading a bandit lifestyle raiding caravans and villages. When you'll save enough coin in your pouch, you can start to build your own, strong army and conquer other realms on your own and become your own, powerful ruler. But let's say the game starts boring you. No problem, there are plenty of modifications that turn this game into completely different level. 
But let's also speak about the disadvantages:
To be honest, the graphics are not breathtaking in 2023, but they'll do. The game still have some minor bugs, but most times you won't even bother about them. The only one really upsetting issue is there are only 9 save slots, so you can't have multiple campaigns with many safety saves at the same time. 
Overall the game is still worth playing despite Bannerlord being available. If you love the feeling of building your own empire, army and managing it, then I recommend giving Warband a try.

If you have heard of games such as Chivalry 2 , Prime & Load : 1776 , Battle Cry of Freedom and some might say War of Rights then you really need to give this game a shot !",1546084232,1680816042,True,3,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

Mount and Blade: Warband is a medieval action RPG that offers players an immersive and unique gameplay experience. The game takes place in a fictional world based on medieval Europe, where players can create their own character and embark on a journey to become a powerful ruler.

One of the most impressive aspects of Mount and Blade: Warband is its open-world gameplay. The game allows players to explore a vast, dynamic world filled with a wide range of characters, factions, and enemies. Players can engage in various activities such as trading, fighting in battles, sieging castles, and recruiting troops to their army.

The game's combat system is also excellent. The game features a complex and challenging combat system that emphasizes player skill and tactics. Players can use a wide variety of weapons and engage in different types of combat, including mounted combat, archery, and close combat.

Mount and Blade: Warband also offers a deep and engaging character progression system. Players can level up their character and develop their skills and abilities to become a more powerful warrior or leader. The game's diplomacy system is also impressive, allowing players to form alliances, negotiate with other factions, and engage in political maneuvering.

One of the few drawbacks of Mount and Blade: Warband is its graphics, which are somewhat dated. However, the game's graphics are still impressive given the game's age and the complexity of its world and gameplay mechanics.

In summary, Mount and Blade: Warband is a must-play for anyone who enjoys medieval action RPGs. The game offers an immersive and challenging gameplay experience that emphasizes player skill, tactics, and character development. The game's open-world, combat system, and character progression system are all excellent, making Mount and Blade: Warband one of the best RPGs of all time.",1638015842,1680725565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game cons:
Bad graphic ( its not that bad but not recommending for those who really care about graphic )

Small battle size 

Bad siege battle ( hopefully bannerlord fixes all that cons ) 

Pros:
You can play this game multiple time ( one time trying to be trader  one time trying to help faction one time try to build your own faction  and even trying to play as bandit )

Big amount of content ( City management.  Prisoner management.  Marriage. Trade. Raid. Recruit companion.  Siege the city/castle.  Diplomacy.  Build up honor Or Destroy your honor.
Complete quest. Read book. And even more ... ) 

Mod able. you can even download mods  in Steam workshop or Nexusmods to make your game even better

Everything about this game is great. The music, the combat, the modding, the base game, the graphics aren't great but have a charm and somehow I find the ugly graphics beautiful. Walking in a village at night and looking at the sky is amazing. This game has so much freedom and while most people playing this game usually set their main goal as taking all of calradia with your own or another faction, you can be an outlaw who raids villages and attacks caravans, a trader who makes a living by trading your goods with different towns, or you can just take whatever jobs come your way. And with mods, there might be more. I haven't even beaten the game or played the multiplayer which has a loyal and alive community within it keeping the game breathing after 11 or 12 years and I find this game to be the best I have ever played. Now, for modding I would recommend using nexus for most mods but if you are going to use the workshop, you should go for total conversion mods. Speaking of which, the mods are amazing. There is a mod that transforms the setting into a star wars setting! How sick is that? And there's a viking dlc which comes with a storyline as well as a napoleonic war (multiplayer only, excluding the custom battles mode) dlc. I haven't played any of that (as well as the many other things I plan on playing) for more than five minutes but I am excited to. This game has a ton of replay value, you can sink thousands of hours into this game and not get bored. I can't remember getting bored playing this game. Learning this game is a challenge at first but you will get the hang of it if you try. The game is a very hard game to play even with the easiest modes/settings. A very harsh world, especially if you are a woman or a stinky peasant.

With all of this, I have to say this is a must-buy. In my opinion this game is a masterpiece, even without mods or the two expansions. Also, if you can't read at all and you rely on voice acting, then learn to read before playing this because the only voices you hear during this game are funny voicelines that you hear by talking to certain npcs and the voicelines have nothing to do with the dialogue but they let you know who you are talking to if you are for some reason playing this while being blind. Farmers say things like ""it's almost harvesting season"" and ""my lord"". Bandits say ""that's a nice head you have on you shoulders"" as well as ""you better not be and man hunter"" and much more. The voicelines add to the charm and humor of this game.

If this review isn't convincing, you can create funny looking characters.",1637908285,1679178168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is:
- still one of the best combat oriented games
- very good mods
- you're not going to get bored of this game easily
- easy to learn , but hard to master, this game
This game is essentially about your
character going from unknown poor adventurer, attracting (wo)men to join
your team(party), and hunting bandits, to becoming a conqueror of lands,
building alliances with powerful lords and rising your rank
on the hierarchy, generating enough wealth to afford armies and
land holdings, and maybe (just maybe) eventually becoming the
ruler of all.

It is one of the only territory games that I actually had fun while playing it. Instead of just controlling and creating troops like other games, in warband you have to recruit and train them, while you can also join the battle by controlling them in the field and by fighting with them

There, you are free to either create your own kingdom with a lot of struggle, or join an existing kingdom and help them.

That's how good the game is, I highly recommend as running around as a petty lord with a single village, killing bandits, raiding and joining sieges is very entertaining, its also one of the only, very good games I can run on my shitty laptop at a solid 60fps (like 4gb ram and an amd athlon silver bad) on medium graphics which is a very nice bonus.

update having played some more:

I have since upgraded my pc and this game is amazing with mods some good ones are diplomacy for a slightly better vanilla version and Gekogujo Damiyo edition 3.1 for a mod set in the Sengoku period of Japan (you cannot download the Damiyo ed from the steam workshop just Gekogujo 3.0 I used Moddb). Those are are the ones i have been using but there are many, many more amazing mods. Also for a game made around 13 years ago it still holds up reasonably well in terms of graphics and modded gameplay.",1658102651,1678584953,True,13,0,0.619396448135375977,0,True,False,False

[b]Mount & Blade: Warband[/b] is a medieval action RPG that was released in 2010 and quickly became a cult classic. Developed by TaleWorlds Entertainment, the game is set in the fictional land of Calradia, where players assume the role of a warrior who must rise through the ranks of feudal society, amass a powerful army, and eventually conquer the entire land. The game features a unique blend of real-time battles, character development, and role-playing elements that make it a compelling and immersive experience for fans of the genre.

[u][b]Character Development:[/b][/u]

One of the standout features of Mount & Blade: Warband is the depth of character development that it offers. Players start out as a lowly warrior with little more than a sword and some armor, but as they progress through the game, they can gain experience, level up, and acquire new skills and abilities. The game features a wide range of skills, including archery, horseback riding, swordsmanship, and more, and players can allocate skill points to these areas to customize their character to their playstyle.

[u][b]Real-Time Large Scale Battles:[/b][/u]

Another major highlight of Mount & Blade: Warband is the real-time army battles that it offers. Players can gather troops from various towns and villages throughout Calradia and lead them into battle against other armies, bandits, and other foes. The battles are dynamic and intense, with players able to issue commands to their troops, ride on horseback, and engage in close-quarters combat. The battles feel authentic and are a true test of a player's tactical abilities.

[u][b]RPG Elements:[/b][/u]

Mount & Blade: Warband is also a deep and immersive RPG, with a wide range of quests, factions, and characters to interact with. Players can pledge allegiance to various lords and ladies throughout Calradia, engage in political intrigue and diplomacy, and even get married and start their own kingdom. The game has a nonlinear structure that allows players to pursue their own goals and objectives, whether that be becoming a powerful mercenary, a wealthy trader, or a conquering warlord.

[u][b]Choose Your Own Path:[/b][/u]

One of the most compelling aspects of Mount & Blade: Warband is the sense of freedom that it offers. Players are not restricted by a linear storyline or forced to follow a predetermined path. Instead, they are free to choose their own destiny and pursue their own goals. This sense of agency is a major selling point for the game and is one of the reasons why it has such a dedicated fan base.

[u][b]Modding Community:[/b][/u]

Finally, Mount & Blade: Warband is renowned for its modding community, which has created a vast array of custom content for the game. From total conversions that transport the game to other settings, to smaller mods that tweak gameplay mechanics, there is no shortage of user-generated content available for the game. This adds tremendous value and replayability to the game, as players can constantly find new experiences and challenges to tackle.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Deep character development
[*]Dynamic real-time large scale battles
[*]Immersive RPG elements
[*]Nonlinear structure allows for freedom of choice
[*]Modding community adds value and replayability
[/list]
[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Outdated graphics
[*]Steep learning curve for new players
[*]Repetitive gameplay in later stages
[/list]
[u][b]Conclusion:[/b][/u]

Overall, Mount & Blade: Warband is a fantastic game that offers a unique and compelling blend of real-time battles, character development, and role-playing elements. While it may not have the most cutting-edge graphics or the most accessible gameplay, it more than makes up for this with its depth and replayability. With a dedicated modding community constantly adding new content to the game, it is a title that players can enjoy for years to come.

It's a good game (I wouldn't have 465 hours if I didn't like it), but it is dated  and there's a new Mount and Blade out.  In fact, most of my early time was spent with Warband, but most recently I've been playing mods such as Prophesy of Pendor and Perisno.

Honestly, the game is basic enough that there's not much I can really say about it other than I usually reach a point at the end where it's just boring - I can beat every army, but trying to track them down to fight them gets tedious.  The Lord system is annoying.  Anyone except good aligned and Upstanding lords complain when you don't give them land, but because of their nature, the good aligned and upstanding lords never abandoned their lords.  Worse, I could never attract them no matter how much land or money or anything I had - they always went to other kingdoms (where they would just get slaughtered again).  

There's not much diversity in troop trees either with Warband only have like three trees for each nation (infantry, archers, and cavlary) and there were clear winners (Swadian Knights).

However, there are lots of mods, some of which try to improve things like more troop variety.  However, they still use the game's engine which again is quite dated.",1677800734,1677800734,True,10,0,0.54112321138381958,0,True,False,False

While there are other titles that are also excellent, this game takes the cake. I have never had a game that pulls me back for more year after year of game play. Despite the now old looking graphics, its a game that keeps on giving. From Warband to Viking Conquest, the game has forever held a grip on what I love about games. The immense complexity, the love of both first shooter and RPG style gaming and sheer quality/quantity of the game mechanics. 

Now I waited for Bannerlord for what seems like years when they first announced it (I'm not even that big of a geek I just love this game). And when it dropped, it was pretty, it was fun and then... it fell bland. The complexity, the diplomacy, the absolute fun that I had come to love from this game simply just doesn't exist in bannerlord. So, even though I committed 250 hours into that game, I am back here looking to spear a pig in Danmark after a solid monetary sacking and lead a contingent of Vladian knights through the irritating masses of Rhodokean Sharpshooters above a glitching out hill side.

An amazing game that stands out on the market from other productions of this genre. This game owes a lot to its faithful community, as evidenced by a workshop full of various modifications, and constant activity on various multiplayer server modes. The community of this game is peculiar, but it can unite to do something interesting from time to time. One of my favorite Mount & Blade games. The game is great and I have a great fondness for it.

As a kid I used to play the Mount and Blade on my neighbor's PC. I am not sure if it was the Mount and Blade or the Warband. Then, it always mesmerized me that there is a game like this. It was open, it was free, you could do everything you want. It was letting you play your own story in an extreme way. I could only learn that it was actually a worldwide acclaimed Turkish game, I always had a hearsay that it was Turkish and I was suspecting it might be true, years after I have played it on my neighbor's PC. 

Then I've rediscovered it as a teenager. And it was... I've gone on to a journey- I've joined the journey of my character Nathan Drake. It is not yet finished. Then I've played mods. The stories in them were also quite immense. Especially in Game of Thrones. I was now reevaluating it now through my knowledge in games. And I have revaluated it for long years. And I think i may re...
-What are you doing here Uncle?
-Just sharing some of my stories?
-Stories of what?
-A game called Mount and Blade: Warband.
-What? What is that? What is a game? What?
-It is a game that you play in medieva-What?
Do you tell people of your great kinsmans' stories? Did they make a... game? Out of it?

And the mod Napoleonic Wars-WHAT?
You fight in Napoleon's wars.

And it is a full game in so many ways. Lots to do, lots to live, lots to experience, if you get yourself taken down the stream. 

So good. 

Of course.

Whelp, here a quick heads up for you.

This game is fairly simply to understand, you make character, you go in the world, do quests, recruit slobs to fight for you, conquer, prepare to nuke the world because you become a force of nature that nobody can stop you, rinse and repeat until you happen to discover the workshop menu or nexus, experience the joy of the extreme fashion statement that is modded Warband.

To put mildly, this game is truly like an addiction of sorts once you get stuck in the endless loop of war, you never stop. You go on and on sinking maybe what could be humanly put 200 hours of gameplay because you simply having nothing better to do.

Then if you are lucky, you get to experience the amazing world of meme posting that is warband, a truly terrific experience to say the least, maybe if I wasn't high on king Harlaus's butter after he hosted the twenty-sixth feast in a row while Swadia is under attack.

Nowhere else will you find the freedom to go from lowly mercenary to emperor of Calradia while having to juggle your kingdom's economy, political situation, and your 'friendly' neighbours. 

Is there a grind at the end game? Yes, eventually it gets boring to siege and conquer over and over again just to finish off the map. But Warband is one of those few games where I don't mind taking a palate cleanser and starting a modded playthrough, and STILL finding the vanilla game fun when I come back to it fresh.

Speaking of mods, I whole wholeheartedly recommend Prophesy of Pendor. As far as total conversions go, I think it's the best transition thematically from vanilla and only makes the game better. Also harder. But still better.

Now I think the only two reasons you would touch it is:

More modding content available.
Many have said and still say to this day that modded warband makes singleplayer a whole lot replayable and enjoyable than the vanilla of both this game and Bannerlord. I say try to play vanilla singleplayer at least once for a little while and if you think something is missing, head on up to the workshop or nexus to spice things up a bit. I for some reason just played vanilla a couple times, aced it, and promised I would never touch it again. It can be lackluster a bit. 

If you really want the same thing but with better graphics then by all means go to Bannerlord and never touch this game.

JUST KIDDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You forgot the other reason. The best reason! This is actually the best reason!

Background details barely show up at all, the people look two generations removed from Gumby, and the weavers couldn't even keep the lines on the border straight. Yet it's stunning to hold.

It's also arguably one of the best games in the tactical battler and RPG categories alone. While many years old now, the game still holds up great.

The many positives include, but are not limited to:
[list]
[*]Solid combat mechanics that feel good, with directional attacks by mouse or keyboard, directional blocks, kicks, chamber blocks, shields working from the side and on the back, weapons with different strengths and solid mounted combat (including powerful lance attacks and horse archery.)

[*]Order system in battles so not only do you get into the feeling of being a warrior in combat, but also that of being a commander giving orders to their troops.

[*]Different battle terrains.

[*]Solid menus with overview of statistics, levels, gear, characters, fief ownership, fief prosperity, etc., including nested links to other relevant sites to currently viewed character, fief or faction.

[*]A nice, sizable world map for the time, with decent backstory and fillers for the fictional world of Calradia.

[*]A very moddable game for its time, having many, many mods made by talented and passionate developers over the years. You want to add magic, fantasy creatures and new factions to Calradia? You can do that. You want another fantasy world instead, built on the game mechanics of Warband? You can do that too. You rather want historical settings with time appropriate factions, lords and armors? Go for it. Even troop trees and skills can be edited, added and removed by modding.

[*]In addition to a solid singleplayer, multiplayer battles were a fun addition for friends and strangers to come together and battle it out.[/list]

The only negatives I can think of are:
[list]
[*]Somewhat annoying inventory system in the base game, with items generally snapping to the top even when you don't want it (still okay for its time though.)

[*]Even though Calradia is a fictional world, a few of the armors in the base game feel a bit anachronistic, with plate armor generally not fitting in with the rough time period and technology depicted in game. On the upside, mods and especially historical mods for the game generally do this better.[/list]

All in all Warband is a great game even without considering any nostalgic feelings, and with all of the solid mods out there on Nexusmods and/or Steam, you won't run out of entertainment with this one. Get it if you like RPGs, tactical medieval battles and/or you fancy any of the great mods for the game, such as for instance ""1257AD - Enhanced Edition"" (light bias may apply) or ""Prophesy of Pendor.""",1669662569,1671737715,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Warband with Direct X9c is the better version than the Original M&B but still has many of the issues that effected the direct 7 version.

It's probably the more stable branch for modding the game now in the M&B series as developers have moved on to constantly update the new game Bannerlord so you might get a game that doesn't break every patch playing Warband.

It's old now so going back to this game can be hard to look at considering newer graphics look so much better than anything in direct X9c, you can only do so much with these versions they do not support the next level graphics & physics which direct X 11 & 12 games do.

You won't get ray tracing or advanced physics systems & good particle render in old direct x9c games, it's like going back to low res image format 680x440 after using 4k hd + settings.

For an old game still playable, good for older potato systems, so it belongs in the veggie patch you just harvest it every now and than don't bother fertilising it, most times this fruit just rots on the vine because their are better games on the market to spend time in than this old game.

Mount and blade is a really fun game, if you play it right. You start on your horse and ride out in your early days in the fresh air and a new adventure! At that time youre not at war with anyone, so the world is peaceful.
Find the places where you can buy low and where you can sell higher. Bandits haunts the roads and the forest, sometimes they are too many but if you defeat them you can get nice gold. 
When you have enough money, you can buy an establishment to produce money every week adding more to your money.
It is about building up! Trade for good prices, make money from that, recruit mercenarys to fight for you, fighting and defeating enemies will make you strong and the more you recruit and the more you fight you will see them becoming more and stronger. 
Up in the north the searaiders can give you good chainmail armor and steel helmets, that will protect you well.

When you have a strong enough army you should join the land you want to fight for.
Heroicly ride to defeat your enemies, win victorys with your men, make them strong, with time you will be able to swear an oath to become the king's personal vassal, that gives the privelege of when you take over your first castle, you will keep it. 

Alot of gold can bring everything, great armors, great swords, tough and sturdy mercenaries and when you are mighty you will see it, on the battlefield it's pretty cool when you ride with your many and armored tough men, for your cause, with the command in your hands!

Mount and blade is an interesting game and the thing with it is that it is full of choices. You can choose to be a beast of strength, a tactical genius a tough trainer or a fast athlete. 
 Trading is also a big part of it, if you find the right places to trade to you can go from 0 to 50000 denars in about two days if you know how to do. 

It is realistic and you should maintain a good relationship with its masters, war chiefs and kings especially those you should ally with. It is very much about diplomacy. And certainly you feel like a lord when you sit high up in the saddle with shining armor and an army to protect you, a castle to go to.
I really got a good and happy exciting feeling from the game especially the first days I drove it. So much to do and see...
I have to say that I've seen that gleam in Mount and blade, the light of a wonderful time ...
Mount and Blace has it's charm. And when you in your clan siege and take over fiefs and castles, that is a good feeling. It has gotten me inspired about writing storys about of how we in the kingdom toast high for our victory and for health of our clan!

ABOUT IT

It's about making smart choices and if you succeed in defeating dangerous bandits you get gold, which you can save to make it more or buy a good horse or a nice shield.
The forests and the plain land are riddled with dangerous bandits, but once you have collected 50 men you can escape them.

With high charisma in stats, recruits follow and with leadership you command them. And you do really feel like a commander, it's a really good feeling.
The first people to gather and recruit are ordinary men and peasants, but after a little while of fighting you can upgrade. When you have enough strong and trained men or women(Sword sisters are awesome btw!) then it is time to join the kingdom you want to fight for.
If you successfully win over the enemy and capture the lords, then after some time you will be able to swear an oath to the king. You become his vassal. 
If you succeed in the tactics and cleverness of cutting a castle afterwards, with the high rank of vassal you can take over it.
What I think
After traveling the world for a long time and winning golden victories with your men, you feel like a true warlord and even better if you helped villages with a good heart(for that you also get honor) personally I've got nice golden memories from it.

BUT ALSO
When things go wrong and you lose money and things feel hopeless, then it's not fun, but when you together with the lords siege castles and citys and they say: ''I will not forget how we sieged Dhirim together!'' that feels very good and when your plans go well to.
But the game is much about that if you think and do wrong you will fall if you do the right choices you will rise!

CASTLE SIEGES
Are awesome and when you stand together with your friends(you can have the colors of your clan) that is cool. And you can nicely hide behind the walls of the cozy little castle, and it's highly immersive when the heroic music comes and you go to attack.",1555942443,1671120986,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

I picked this game up during a Summer Sale after watching SovietWomble's video on it.

I can happily say that I love it.

Warband is essentially an updated version of the original Mount & Blade. I can't compare Warband to its predecessor or [i]With Fire and Sword[/i] since I haven't played them, nor can I comment on Napoleonic Wars since multiplayer isn't why I play.

The game takes place in the land of Calradia, a diverse land ripped apart by war with several kingdoms vying for control of the realm. You start the game by generating your backstory which affects what skill you start out with as well as your position among the Nobles of Calradia. You could be a commoner, a hunter, a bandit, or an impoverished noble.

Once you create and name your character, have fun. There is no linearity to the game. It is an open sandbox where you can do whatever it is you wish. Tell your own story, become a banner-man or a king or a queen. A champion of tournaments, or the leader of a mercenary band.

It is simply amazing, despite its outdated appearance and rough patches.

[b]Modding[/b]
This game was built for mods. TaleWorlds perfectly crafted this game catering to modifications. One notable mod I can name is [b]Diplomacy[/b] which adds more to the political aspects of the game as well as some other neat changes. I needn't say much about the full conversion mods on the workshop, it's always good to come back to a fresh campaign.

Now, the game sounds pretty cool right? Well, I wouldn't be calling it a flawed masterpiece if I didn't explain why.

[b]Flaws and Problems and Frustrations[/b]
I can only name three off the top of my head.

[b]AI[/b] - The AI in this game is unbelievably frustrating. The over world AI is fine, they do a good job, but the battle AI is the worst. Unless given proper commands they simply rush the enemy, bunch up together and get stuck on each other or consistently get in your way. It's like they have a one track mind.

the moment a battle starts, they are already rushing off ahead.

During melee's and Tournaments the AI can be especially unfair. Ganging up on the player, shield stunning. The Worst case of the AI's one track mindedness is especially noticeable during jousts where they will follow you in a circle trying to hit you, forcing you to maneuver yourself in a way that you can get them without being hit yourself.

[b]The Character can't keep still!![/b] - If this one doesn't frustrate people I'd be surprised. When making a character, you get only a window with your character standing there, close up on the face while you mess around with the sliders to give them your desired look.

Unfortunately, creating a character is a chore most of the time, thanks often times to the aforementioned problem. There is never a moment during the character creation process where the character won't move. this is especially annoying when trying to notice the subtle changes you make. I honestly wish TaleWorlds would release an update to freeze the characters in place while editing their appearance.

[b]Nothing more at the End[/b]
Once Calradia is conquered, either in your name or anothers', the game slows down. There's no more wars to fight, only bandits to slay and wealth to accumulate. I think the game should have had foreign invaders come in and storm the land, taking castle and what not forcing the ruling faction of Calradia to spring into action. Missed opportunity methinks.

[b]Personal Thoughts[/b]
While the AI issues and the character creation can be frustrating beyond belief, I do love this game.

It is addictive, and I would be lying if I said I didn't get stuck into this for hours at a time, upwards of five for two weeks before I can get a handle on that and start playing sparingly. I love being free to make my own story and take my characters where I want without them being restricted by level or story. [strike]I've never become king or queen in any play through since that is a lot of effort I never felt worth it to me.[/strike]


[b]Update:[/b] So around about early 2022, I actually did become a Queen in one of my newer characters and successfully conquered Calradia. It was honesty a miracle that I even managed to do it, and rule successfully at that.

It feels good to immerse myself in my role and roll with it for a while, problems be darned. The lack of dismemberment in the game has allowed me to imagine my attacks inflicting grievous wounds or beheading some poor soul even if it physically doesn't occur.

I have never touched the multiplayer and I do not intend to. I am extremely wary of online play in games, especially if the community turns out to be trash. And so, my experience with Warband shall remain singular.

I personally think it's a shame that the game lacks fantasy elements. I wouldn't mind it if Calradia had a history of magic and monsters and that information was sprinkled in he background.

the game being limited with what you can do and how much playable space you get in towns is also a shame. I am hoping Bannerlord makes the appropriate improvements where needed.

I truly love, Warband. it's one of my absolute favorites and well worth a go if you haven't played it already.",1556448446,1669898441,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

It is light on the computer and it is a game where you command your own army to fight on the battle field.

You recruit your armies and get to join any of the factions, or make your own.

This leads to tons of variety between playthroughs. From being a knight only small mercenary band, to leading the charging horse archers of the khan, this game has it all.

The real main plus is that it has a massive pool of mods to allow all sorts of types of warfare that you could want.

This game that was just a fantasy strategy game can suddenly be in the middle of the napoleonic era, or you could push it back to the rise of Islam.

You can even play mods with your other favorite fantasy worlds from other media.

The game also has a decent multiplayer scene still alive, its fun to hop on and do a large siege against enemy players, or to have one on one duels in an arena.

You are gonna start your trip across Caraldia with barely enough coins to feed yourself. 

You'll have fews options to counter this. 

- Loot.
- Scam.
- Fight the bandits.
- Engage yourself for a lord service with a band of warriors.

Otherwise you can straight engage fews guys in your squad to keep a chance to survive. Although your mens'll protect to keep you alive, you have to pay them. Each wages'll definited in cases of the class and positions of your troups. You can meet and hire some companion in tavern as well. 

Every companion is working as the same as your proper character in this features as (level, stats, skills). But be carefull, your companion might quit your squad at any moment if you have bad behavior for looting, scaming, crimes... 

During the battle you might get a fight into a castle as attacker or defender. It'll be your task to be the most strategist and organized ! 

An ennemy wave in numerical superiority agains you and it's over ! 

During the standard fights, you have to supervise every parts of the battlefield. Indeed, If you and your army is located on the top of hill or in the other side of a river you may have chance to counter the ennemy or shoot them with your crossbows and bows. 

The strong point of this game is the immersion and that what I like. 

When your reputation is building up step to step, the differents kingdom will know more about you. You'll have the choice to build up strong alliance, trade with them, marry with one of lady (daughters of the lords) or perhaps be in war with them. 

Every actions has to be smartly evaluate if you don't want to be surrunded by the ennemies or send into a deep cold and dark  dungeon. 

Finally the BEST part of this games are the diverses modes playable. 

Thanks to the generous community which procures extra hours to us for enjoy it ! There are for diferents tastes ! Antic, viking, middle-age, even for the fans movies or series we can find Game of Thrones or Star Wars adaptation ! It's huge ! 

So now, put your helmmet, wears-up your irons gloves, look after your war horse, feed your mens and take away your best sword, because the conquest of Calradia is waiting for you.

Update

Even after Bannerlord came out the fighting system is still better here then i na new game. You feel every movement of your character unlike the Bannerlord where all your movements feels like you're in a water and everything is very slow. Even slower then in a ""Mercenaries"" mod for Warband.

The base game gets somewhat tiring quickly (~35-40 hrs). Your first experiences with everything will be incredibly fun and exciting. Large battles, castle and city sieges, getting your fiefs, all of those are great fun your first pass. Despite this, the general gameplay loop begins to become a bit tedious. Once you're in a position of power within a kingdom, you do a lot of sitting around and waiting. There's always something to do, of course, but doing nothing and waiting for the AI to call you to action or to give you something new is often the best option. 

The more hours you put into the game, you will quickly realize that you are the both the most overpowered thing on the entire map and also completely unable to do anything of meaning without ""help"" (meat shielding) from the AI. It is entirely too frustrating to be appointed marshal only to have your computer-controlled army run away from you to go defend a Very Poor village when you're trying to take a city. 

I assume there are many mods that fix the myriad issues that the aging base game has, but at what point are you playing a different game in the same engine?

Overall, would recommend it if you are looking for something old-school that you'll get about ~30 hours of gameplay out of.",1669011062,1669159772,False,4,0,0.524916946887969971,0,True,False,False

It is a perfect mix of strategy and skill, as having only one of those options alone will never award you victory in this game. You know that the game is balanced upon this, as the battles that you are not personally involved in (order troops to attack without you), you always lose more men than you should have. 
          The AI of enemies is superb, especially for a game of this age. The scale of battles is greater than any other game of the era, especially considering just how many ai's can be on-screen at once, each in their own battle. Builds are interesting little tweaks to how the game can be played, with just enough spin to keep it interesting, but not allowing for the game to be completely cheesed by a particular build. There's even town management, investments, diplomacy, tournaments, training fields, random encounters, and at least 80 different ""armors"", as well as romance, reading, and so on. it still holds up, gameplay-wise, to this day, and that is why the core gameplay itself was not changed much in the sequel game, Bannerlords II.
       The bulk of complaints to be made about this game largely revolve around limitations of it's time, like textures and models, but they are still great looking even now. There's also a bunch of outside-of-combat skills and small details not present in the original game, compared to the sequel. To clearly see this list, look up ""Differences between M&BWB and M&BBL2"". All in all, if you enjoy RTS games, fantasy games, medieval combat games, action games, adventure games, or even simulators, you should consider playing, as this game may be 100 or even 1000 hours of play material to you.",1668994313,1668994313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a Medieval strategy sandbox, but you control your character in first person.
You start somewhere on the map, and try to make your mark on the map by creating or joining a kingdom.
The concept is simple, but to the point.

What is best in life?
To crush your enemies. See them driven before you. And to hear the lamentations of their women.

mount & blade: warband is a 2010 standalone expansion to the original mount and blade from 2008. developed by taleworlds entertainment, warband expands on the original by adding a 6th faction to the base game, increasing the amount of political features in the game, adds the ability to start your own faction eventually (the best addition), among many other improvements. there's obviously the strategy element but there's also a action-rpg element as you go from the strategy of navigating the world map while also having too go into first/third person for big battles between you and your army and the enemy army. it can be very fun and chaotic, which is why this game is so good. it blends the two genres beautifully and everything in each aspect of the game is awesome and detailed and just almost creates a sandbox where you can go and do anything you want and take as long as you want, and that's not even including the fact that you can mod the game and add in so many extra things, all right through the steam workshop. there's a steep learning curve, but once you finally get it, it clicks and the game takes on a whole new identity and you feel so much freedom in the ability to basically go wherever and do whatever you want with whoever. this is one of the greatest games on steam and one i can't recommend enough to basically anyone, especially strategy game enthusiasts. getting this for 75% off is an absolute steal and i'm so glad i saw this on sale in 2021 and decided to pull the trigger finally.",1668623332,1668623332,True,1,0,0.485011786222457886,0,True,False,False

I bough this game many years ago and even though it offered me many hours of entertainment there's one thing that absolutely killing it for me, and that is lack of polish. To be more exact combat and character interaction with environment is fundamentally broken. 

(Note: This review references Multiplayer almost entirely, most of these issues are nonexistent or minimal in Single player)

1. COMBAT CONTROL

It's clunky, imprecise and fundamentally broken. How so you may ask? Well, the attack/ block direction is controlled by movement of your mouse. (there is an option to change it to your movement keys WASD, but then if you want to move to the left and block right swing you're in trouble) The feature would be alright if it actually worked properly, but 50% of the time it does not and as far as I know there is no ability to key bind attack/block direction. (here I'm talking about multiplayer) 

To give you an example. You can play round one of some map and do great, get many kills, score hits, do damage. Then on round two everything changes, all of a sudden you can't hit anyone. Your 1st thought must be hey it must be my ping, so you check it and see that it's exactly the same as last round. Then you think to your self, hey maybe this round the players are better than I am, but you look at their names see that guy that you dominated twice last round now all of a sudden is untouchable and kills you in one or two hits. Now you start wonder what is going on? Am I going insane? Is he hacking? You ask in chat what is happening, everyone tells you to ""GIT GUD"" and calls you a noob. In reality it's none of the above. It is just the game it self, a broken combat system that has more in common with a game of roulette than a sword fight. 

For some reason there is also an inconsistent induced lag for any action. Say you want to do a right swing, you find a target, aim up, get your swing ready and release it, but your swing goes through the target, you get stabbed and die. You once again wonder what is happening and find out that for some reason now when you release LMB for an attack there is a ~.5 sec delay even though 2 min ago it was ~.1 sec, so you adjust. You go for an attack and again your attack misses, you get stabbed and die. You check your delay now it's ~.2 sec, so you start looking at your ping and find out that it varies by only 10ms at worst through out the entire round. So what's the problem? 

Often times you will find yourself looking all the way in the air or at the ground, due to the attacker's continuous stab or overhead attacks. There isn't much you can do about it, because if you try to change you view your attack/ block direction will go with it.

There is something fundamentally wrong with hit detection, hit boxes and combat speed; and may God have mercy on your soul if you're fighting in tight quarters or surrounded by friendlies. Your weapon will get stuck on everything and will be borderline impossible to strike the enemy without accidentally striking a friendly. From what I know this issue is only present in Warband and its derivatives, not the original Mount & Blade.

An additional frustrating issue that is exclusive to Napoleonic Wars is the weapon mode switch (X). Sometimes you press it and it works, your musket is now in a ""bayonet mode"", but other times you press it and it doesn't switch, so you press it again it doesn't work. By that time it is too late and you get stabbed by the enemy, because a basic and crucial game function didn't work. 

2. INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENT 

This issue is not as evident in Warband (Native) as is in Napoleonic Wars, but what it boils down to is interaction with cannons, barricades, horses etc. In order for one to interact with any object you must be in an exact precise position and look direction in order for it to work. The worst of all is that this issue doesn't exist with the doors, they work flawlessly and respond immediately to interactions. You come to ""arms reach"" of a door, look at any part of it, press F and it works, 100% of the time. This might make one wonder, if interaction with doors works so well, then what the hell is wrong with everything else. Why, when even I want to get up on a horse I have to walk up to an exact position and look at a specific point and even then it requires multiple tries and ""F"" presses for it to work.

Why when I place down barricades as an Engineer, in order for my build hammer to interact with the barricade and build it I have to move around and swing like an idiot 5x more than necessary, because 2/3 of the build hammer swings aren't recognized. 
Like before all of these issues are not consistent, sometimes the game just works and you have a blast. 5 minutes later, everything goes to shit and you're left wondering what happened. It's a roller coaster of functionality and I simply don't understand why. How do you build a program that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't unless you do it on purpose, due to incompetence or sheer malice.

This game earned TaleWorlds so much money that they could've hired someone to at least patch up some of these problems 50x over, but they didn't. Why? I don't know.
 
From what I've seen of the new Bannerlord footage, it suffers from exact same problems, but of course rabbit fans will defend it to their dying bed. Saying it's just beta, give it time. Warband has been receiving updates up until recently and Bannerlord has been in development for roughly 8 years. We're ways past the ""it' just Beta"" excuse.


3. LINUX PORT

This is just an issue for Linux users, I played on both Windows and Linux. Linux version is just poorly made, even more so than the original. The module selection doesn't work and you have to fix it or change modules manually in game files. Graphical issues and performance issues. It's mediocre at best. 


4. COMMUNITY

This game has borderline cult like following. They can take no criticism what so ever, the game is perfect and it is just you who suck and should ""play more"" to get better. I expect nasty comments on this review, so feel free to call me a noob all you want, but that won't fix the issues mentioned. 


CONCLUSION

I will continue playing the game because there are still many good things about it, mainly in Single player, but I feel hesitant when it comes to recommending it to someone else.

Games like Battle Brothers or Darkest Dungeon are really zoomed in with very little strategic abstraction (you directly control all party member's moves), and games like CK2 are really zoomed out (tens of thousands fight and die and all you see are numbers). Warband is zoomed in just enough so you can feel the power of commanding a big army (or a small band of hooligans) while still providing the feeling that you as a character meaningfully impact the outcomes of battles, right down to your sword strokes. Couple that with a modding community that has produced some of the best player-crafted experiences I've ever played, and you got a recipe for a real banger of a title. There are some multiplayer-only mods that don't have as many players as in their heyday, but the single-player mods still shine to this day (with the added benefit of Bannerlord being out already, meaning all the mods out now for Warband are more or less finished and aren't going to need updates anymore). On top of that, Taleworlds as a developer is really close to their community in a way that's pretty cool.

Now a personal note: I bought this game because I checked out a book called Ivanhoe in middle school and fell in love with medieval stuff. Then, one glorious middle school summer, I put in like 600 hours over 4 months. The cycle was literally: wake up at 9am, eat breakfast, hang out until noon, microwave the chicken tendies, then play mount and blade for 6-8 hours. Years later, when mental illness reared its ugly head, this game was one of a few anchors that kept me going. This game literally changed my life for the better, and I will very likely play Warband into my old age. I love it with my whole heart, and I encourage anyone who likes RPGs, strategy games, and games with really tight combat systems.",1466494098,1666478340,True,1,0,0.510752677917480469,0,True,False,False

The combat is great, fighting on foot you can block and attack in four different directions which keeps you on your toes while also having more advanced moves like parries and weapon chambering. Horse back gameplay is also great, some of the best in most games that have mounted combat, as long as you aren't going up or down a hill as it slows you significantly. Your character also has stats that get better over time making you more and more effective at combat as the game goes on, especially when you get better gear and feel like a true knight butchering peasants.
Gameplay outside the battlefield is also good, as Calradia, the low fantasy world in which the game takes place, feels immersive and alive, you can interact with the various lords, go to each town castle and village and walk around them, and interact with them such as doing trade, raiding them, or eventually conquering and ruling them. You can join the various kingdoms as a mercenary or pledge yourself to them and become a proper lord, and the game offers various roleplaying opportunities. If you want to play the entire game as a peasant, you can, if you want to be a bandit, you can, if you want to be a merchant you can. You can participate in tournaments, attend feasts, marry a noble, and conquer the continent. You can even form your own kingdom if you don't want to serve one of the starting kingdoms. 
The gameplay is great, although graphically Mount and Blade has never been a good looking game even back when it came out, and the sound design is serviceable, however if you're playing this game it's more for the game play than the graphics. Music is also serviceable, nothing really notable. 
This game really shines however with the modding community. This game has many great mods available for it and chances are you'll be spending more time in one of the many conversion mods to play in your favorites settings than you will in the base game, especially since these mods add many new features that greatly improve the immersive gameplay.
If you enjoy being a medieval warrior that gets to conquer things, and don't care about graphics, this game is a definite buy.",1666025025,1666025025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It took a few starts until I got a feel for game mechanics, but the learning curve is gentle and honestly I didn't NEED to restart, failure is pretty forgiving. It's easy to get wrapped up in the adventure you're crafting for yourself.

Admittedly, probably only about 1/3 of those 400 hours are on the native version. The rest are in mods and as much as I love native there's many more adventures to be had. You can fight in feudal Japan, Dark Ages Britain, Middle Earth, fantasy worlds, Ancient Greece, Calradia in the renaissance/1900s/etc, North America in the Civil War, etc etc etc...and etc etc etc. There are tons of mods of diverse lands (but also quality).

Okay, I'm going to try for criticisms. Even with mods, sometimes it can feel repetitive. Some of the politics can be light. Juggling the interests of my Lords doesn't interest me, once I got a few castles established under my rule I lost some interest in playing (once things got easier and repetitive and I start a new campaign).

Want to start off as a noble house? Nope. Even if your father was a lord or noble and you are a lesser noble, no one acknowledges your banner.

Want to hire an army to fight in the war? Nope. Hiring units is ridiculously expensive and every unit besides peasants are out of your budget.

Want to do tasks for a lord to gain his trust? Nope. Most of the ""tasks"" involve raiding bases or killing armies of bandits. Completely impossible when you have only a few peasants by your side and can't afford to recruit more.

Want to roam the countryside and find a better place to start? Nope. Prepare to get stopped every 10 feet by a pack of raiders or bandits, demanding either your money or your life.

Trying to at least finish the main quest? Good luck. On top of raiders and bandits ensuring you can't move without being robbed, and being unable to hire any defense, you also have to deal with the Lannisters attacking you on sight. Usually outnumbering you 10 to 1.

Out of options, you decide to enlist in a lord's army to at least make some money. Well here's the thing:

You only make 50-100 stags a week (not enough to hire men of your own, let alone keep them fed and armed). You don't get to keep the armor that you're given by enlisting. Resigning reduces your reputation with the lord so you can no longer do anything for them. And worst of all, enlisting in an army consists of sitting there AFK 90% of the time trying to scrape together enough money to survive.",1498802562,1664834445,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a game that exists on the fringe in many ways. It's not a particularly common genre: the most similar game in the last few years would be the last Pirates! remake. It's enjoyed by a number of people, but never reached the huge success of even the most popular indie PC games. It offers many mechanics that are challenging both to one's skill and to repetitive industry tropes.

In a decade marked by re-releases of Skyrim, medieval combat simulators that run almost entirely on scripted sequences like Kingdom Come, ""meta""-based fighting games like For Honor, and Chivalry killers like Mordhau, Warband offers remarkably unadorned, yet skillful combat. There's no magic or executions. There's no shoving or unlockable abilities. There are no unblockable attacks, yet these are the very reasons that you feel your victories are earned. Mount & Blade differs from these games in that it's uniquely plausible and skill-based. To succeed in the game you don't just have to have a high-leveled character or to read a forum post about an exploit - you have to actually understand the game. Regrettably, if you stare into this abyss for too long, the demons start coming out, and you begin to understand why I refuse to recommend it after all this time.

You see, Warband is great, but it has a number of problems. Bugs, technical and mechanical, poison your experience a bit. If you don't find the secret option to force single threading you may find the game crashes frequently or NPC AI may behave strangely, such as when prisoners you're rescuing suddenly turn on you. Even if you do find the option, you will occasionally see lords of vanquished factions floating around freely, like ghosts, unable to join anyone, or NPCs floating after the siege tower they've been standing on departs, or opponents in the arena melee inexplicably teaming up against you and then freezing like robots once you're knocked out. In multiplayer, the emphasis is on dealing maximum damage as quickly as possible, as the actual tactical component is missing, and as such Warband is infamous for its ""naked men with 2-handers."" Ultimately these little niggling problems pile up on your conscience. An optimist says, ""don't worry, it'll be fixed in the sequel."" A pessimist says:

""The sequel has been in development for over 9 years, has no release date, will probably be sold for $60, omits the most requested feature of campaign multiplayer, and buying Warband now only serves to lengthen its development time. On top of it all, there's no guarantee there won't be a host of new bugs to annoy us for an entire decade.""

This is the heart of the matter. Why should I pay $60 for arena AI that behaves like it should, or for oft-bragged about graphical features that predate the first alpha of the first game? What I want is a functional game, campaign co-op, a reason not to run directly toward my enemy and hit them with a 2H sword in multiplayer. When I talk about the game with my brother or friends, people who play games as a social event and not as a private addiction consuming their free time, I want to mention they can play it along with me - not just nominally, but actually experiencing the part of the game that made it popular. TaleWorlds have literally spent all but 3 months of this decade building a sequel with virtually undemanded features like accurately animated horse reins while their characters still have potato faces, or children that allegedly take over the game when you die even though a war that goes on for as long as a human's maturation time is absurd, and so on. They are now just skating along on old revenues from their periodic latecomer sales of this video game - a video game that they don't intend to truly fix unless you pay them full retail price for the next game.

For these reasons I cannot recommend this very interesting and addictive game.

Edit: 3 years later, the sequel finally has a release date, but the game itself is a train wreck of broken promises and, like Warband, will be abandoned with countless bugs and missing features after release. This is not a developer you want to support.",1468384801,1664717515,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
Its a fun game That you can play for hours.

Okay graphics and little dull Environment.

Okay side characters story's.

Standard Commands For Army's.

Simple Combat Controls.
                               
A good selection of a verity of weapons.  
                
You can make your own story.

No major Bugs So Far.


Cons:

Needs Basic siege options and equipment.

Can't edit your army's uniform.

Not many Enemy Factions max I believe its 5.

You cant interact with much buildings max 4 Tavern,Shop,Prison,Lords Castles.


Summary: Its a good game for 2010 it has most of what you need for a Medieval style game castles,Lords,Constant War,Running away from Big army's then chasing them down with your King,Schemes to lower a different lords position so you can become a lord yourself and maybe become king and so on however it has limits such as lack of sabotage on enemy castles. 

Example: You can sneak into the castle but you can only rescue a prisoner or steal, you cant break the gate,you can't set a fire, so you can force the enemy out and there is only 1 way to get into a castle a ladder no siege equipment at all and you can easily die by arrow fire get pushed off by your ally troops and own troops or getting pushed towards the enemy and get stuck and become a punching bag for about 15 seconds before your let free of your misery by a arrow in the head.

Other than that you cant customize your troops colors/armor and in big battles that's a pain when your fighting 100 different enemy and you troop looks exactly like the enemy and sometimes you focus on them find out that their your troop with the tag above them and die from a enemy beside you cause they where similar armor, sometimes you might a flag the is painted on the shield but your don't have the time to focus on that and it could use a bit more environment details.

  ""Its not that important just annoying when they had both these options on the phone which is weird that a phone had the army customization and siege equipment other than that its a 7/10 for me."" Hope it helps.",1663392493,1663392847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My first attempt was to play this on xbox, which the controls were just terrible but it gave me an idea of what I was getting into. Here on PC none of these issues persisted, combat is so much easier, despite still a steep learning curb, and having that little bit of knowledge of what to expect in how the game worked for me before has paid off.

The game overall is enjoyable even though there is a rather steep learning curb for it. The graphics and the AI are a bit dated but considering the age of the game, this is to be expected. But AI is where this game has its shortfalls. Every ally gets in your way during any conflict, no matter what you're doing. I end up relegating myself to doing wide sweeps around my own army and attacking enemies from the rear because I simply cannot get close to enemy units otherwise to do anything else. Meanwhile, the enemy AI goes into a state of ultimate hyper-aggression once you pick a nation to join and hunt you down in a massive wave of the combined forces of their entire nation, and will, in fact, hunt you to the ends of the earth for it.

I am a little over 60 days into the game, I have less than 40 units in my main army, mostly a wide mix of cavalry with a growing horde of well-trained commoners. For an example of the latter of ultimate hyper-aggression, I tested this multiple times. I join a conflict, I reach a siege point, and the entire enemy force bares arms to over 1000 and wipes me and the attackers off the map. I don't join up and the enemy horde is a no-show, but still exists idly somewhere, and the army I would have joined takes the city without further resistance. If I don't join I don't become a mercenary, which is the point of the game, if I do join the enemy horde instantly targets my position in overwhelming force, because instead of joining the Siege I left the area, only to find the 'horde' ignoring the siege entirely to come after me, crossing literally 2 nations to do it by the time they caught up with me.

Doesn't make a lot of sense, and maybe it's just me, but I am just having fun hunting down criminals and amassing a militia of peasants regardless.

After the introduction, the core gameplay loop is essentially traveling from location to location gathering soldiers, raising enough money via quests and pillaging to feed your growing army, and eventually waging war on whoever angered you that particular day. 

The game's controls are a little difficult to get the hang of, and certain weapons feel way more useful than others (archery is especially effective at taking down enemies quickly without putting yourself in harm’s way). The AI also isn't exactly amazing since all they basically do is charge headfirst into one another until someone falls down dead. But as the size of your battles increase, you start to really feel like a hero on the battlefield, commanding your troops as you charge into enemy lines and wreak havoc. 

The graphics aren't the greatest, as many people feel the need to point out, but that really doesn't impact the fact that the game itself is endlessly replayable with hours upon hours of content to consume. If you're looking for a great RPG in a realistic medieval setting with large-scale battles, then it doesn't get much better than this.",1541624762,1662600901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your actual participation is fun because the combat is surprisingly great with being able to respond to attacks at different angles. You have to respond to blocks, incoming projectiles, and charging horses. You also can give orders based on the current environment and the makeup of your army, such as ordering your crossbowmen to take the high ground on a hill while the cavalry charge. I never got tired of besieging castles, clearing out bandits, participating in tournaments, and going head to head with rival nobles. You can customize yourself and companions by getting armor, horses, and weapons. All towns offer different goods and different prices, making exploration more rewarding.

Outside of combat you move around on an elaborate chessboard where the simulator chunk of the game comes from.
There's different factions with unique troops you'll be training or fighting, and your actions matter relative to your reputation with other nobles. Climbing up that ladder with the other vassals to become likable so that you can be rewarded more territories. There's factors like honor, renown, and right to rule that determine your standing with the rest of Calradia. You can get married, take tasks from other vassals in your faction, rebel, recruit, attack, and everyone seems to respond to it. There's also your troops morale that requires you to manage the size of it, your food supply, and other tasks that I really didn't find tedious because of how interlaced it was with the exciting parts of the game.

I am waiting for a reply and I can't recommend this game to anyone in the event the bug will happen to them aswell.

I only found it a few days ago on Steam and since it was on sale, I thought I'd give it a shot, considering it's a relatively old game (obviously not ancient).

The combat gives you a unique first person perspective on warfare in the medieval period.command your troops to outsmart, outmaneuver, and massacre your enemies. engage in political intrigue, either to install a pretender to a kingdoms throne or seize your own territory and declare your own empire, your fate is in your hands. 
or forgo the glory, honor, and bloodshed and become a traveling merchant or a vagrant champion fighting in city's tournament.

Nowadays you won't find a game with such a simple but at the same time competitive combat system.

Great tools for clans, custom servers and community events (and also modifications if you like that).

Most of the players are guys between 15 and 30 who are interested in history, and that's great between it leads to a common ground.

Mount & Blade: Warband is dated, with graphics that already looked old back when it was originally released. But honestly, this game has so much heart and is such a unique experience that I wouldn't let that hold you back. It is hard not to lose yourself in this world, which is surprisingly rich and imaginative. There is story for those that seek it but also suffeciently addictive gameplay loops that can keep you entertained if you were to ignore it all.

If you like RPGs, fantasy and strategy, then this game might scratch several of those itches. If the vanilla game doesn't compel you then make use of the vast wealth of mods to finetune your experience.

Absolutely nothing is handed to you as you first have to make a name for yourself to even be respected by the nobility and raise your troops yourself from peasant villages whilst trying to keep those poor buggers alive by providing them with food and battle experience without losing them all in an uneven fight until they are proficient enough to survive battle on their own. Or you can roam the world as a bandit and set upon every peasant and nobleman that crosses your path. Or maybe you want to become the medieval Jeff Beezos and just be a filthy rich trader that tries to outwit the shifting economy of the kingdoms of Calradia, profiteering off of war and atrocities like no other by price gouging raided cities in dire need of food after they've been sieged for weeks. It's all yours for the taking

You start as an idiot peasant with a stick and become a ruthless warlord, after a lot of grinding. Phenomenal. More games should have the rags to riches grind like this one does, because THAT is how you make a fucking game.

It can be a bit hard/confusing starting out, it doesn't tell you much but with the help of google I had no trouble when I first tried vanilla Warband on console way back when. If you're brand new, play the base game and get the hang of it before you download any mods, as those are usually a lot harder than the vanilla game.",1660030391,1660030391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

its an Action-RPG with good, solidly deep and satisfying melee combat, archery, and cavalry riding and generally feels a bit like Daggerfall in its open-endedness and sandbox nature. There is virtually no story to follow here, only you get to choose how a single character's narrative works within Calradia. Its all too commonplace for an RPG to feature the player character in a fashion that is too grandiose--Skyrim's protagonist is always the Dovahkiin, the protagonist of Fallout New Vegas is always the catalyst for the battle of the Hoover Dam, regardless of what side they decide to fight for. In M&B, you are just you. are you a nobleman who's taken up the sword to participate in tournaments all around the realm? are you a lowborn bandit, plundering trade routes for money, killing civilians all over the place? are you a common sellsword, taking up arms for whomever pays best? are you a merchant? are you the count of a village or the king of an entire land, in this game, it REALLY is up to you, character creation is surprisingly robust and due to the nature of the game world's design, choices really kinda do matter (not for story purposes, but for lore, trade, and personal canon purposes). Mechanically, aside from the obvious classic Elder Scrolls comparisons, it plays like a large-scale battle game, with you able to command units at a pretty granular level. Others make comparisons to Total War, and while my experience with that series is limited, i'd agree. The real kicker is the depth of interaction with the world. Instead of quests that direct you to remote caves and hideaways, most quests are battles for resources and clout, taking place near villages and castles and under command of one of the key leading figures around the realm. Or you could be leading the forces for yourself, looking to take your own kingdom. Think Crusader Kings mixed with Daggerfall and you've got a pretty decent place to start thinking about mount and blade. its not a hard game to actually place, but like both Daggerfall and CK, the beginner's learning curve is pretty severe--if you are a gamer who likes making their own head canon, such as getting overly attached to specific XCOM soldiers, this is a great choice and its price is very hard to argue with, just be prepared for a significantly dated looking game and a bit of a curve; what you'll end up with is one of the best ""choose your own adventure"" games out there, only really easily compared to Divinity or again, Daggerfall.",1659951519,1659951519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is probably my favorite game of all time but that will be surpassed if Bannerlord gets fully finished and gets as many mods as Warband does. Most of my time is probably in Native Warband (or Diplomacy mod as that is just QoL changes and doesn't do anything drastic to Native) and Viking Conquest DLC. However, the mods for this game are insane and a lot of people spend more time there than in the base game.
     The base game could be described as a ""historically authentic RPG."" It's not historically accurate as Calradia is not real and neither are its kingdoms, but there is no magic, all the kingdoms are inspired by IRL cultures (Khergit = Mongols, Nords = Scandinavia etc.), and the combat and gear are authentic (reasonably within the time this game was made)  to different medieval peoples while still giving each faction their own unique identity and fighting style as this is still a game so it makes sense to have some factions excel where others fall behind. 
     Viking Conquest leans more into historical accuracy as it focuses on real cultures, religions and kingdoms in the late 800s after the Great Heathen Army invaded Northern Britain and formed the Danelaw. You have Angles, Saxons, Norse, Gaels, Frisians, and Britons. The factions fight more similar and are armed more similar than in Native as the scope of the DLC is the British Isles, Southern Scandinavia and Frisia. The heavy differences lie in culture, religion, etc. This one is really immersive and makes up for its lack of variety with how much it makes me feel involved in the storm of war and politics following the establishment of the Danelaw.
     I have spent most of my time in what comes with the game, but in terms of mods, there are many spotlights: Prophecy of Pendor,  Perisno, Game of Thrones mods, Lord of the Rings mods, a Warhammer mod, a Star Wars mod, Sengoku Jidai Japan mod (Gekokujo), Napoleonic Wars singleplayer (L'Aigle), 1500s Southeast Asia (Suvarnabhumi Mahayuth), 1930s-40s (The Red Wars), and many more. I have not played a lot but I enjoy The Last Days of the Third Age as I am a big Tolkien fan and have enjoyed many hours of Elvish archery, Orc hordes, and Dwarvish steel. Needless to say, it is my favorite mod and I recommend it after you get used to basic M&B mechanics from Native.
     So, I recommend Mount & Blade: Warband. Even if you have Bannerlord or if Bannerlord has this amount of mods in the future, you should still go back and try Warband, janky and bare-bones graphics as it may be.",1659827500,1659827500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character-creation process gives each character some individuality, if you have a character concept and follow it (rather than optimizing stats), and the appearance options are flexible. The sandbox character of the game (and the size of the world) give great flexibility for one's goals, whether to join an exiting faction as a vassal, to build one's own empire, or simply to be a caravan trader. One can make moral choices that affect one's reputation. Also, if one gets tired of the vanilla game, there are dozens of mods that can change the game setting immensely. I really enjoy the Viking Conquest mod offered by the studio, which is an official studio-made version of Brytenwalda (the studio hired the Brytenwalda creators to make the VC mod). Finally, I like the variety of equipment and the fact that different grades of it are available.

The market is more complex and provides challenge to know the best prices to buy and sell at. One area where i would have a little moan would be the directional swinging of the weapons, no matter which system i use now i cannot get the same precision and ease of fighting that i got in the first game. It is a minor grumble as i cut my way through dozens of enemy's without issue. I can't believe this game and the original were made so long ago, the graphics and game play do give it the air of a modern game, but as they say, the classics are the best. Loving it and very much enjoying starting out again, hoping this time round to get to become king. Buy at any price, well worth it.

1. Start as an impoverished noble son, setting out to make a name for myself.
2. Collect a few Vaegir men and start hunting down bandit parties patrolling outside of Reyvadin.
3. Find their lair and destroy it.
4. Compete in a local tournament and win, gaining more renown.
5. Over time, my party becomes a band of warriors, and a herald comes to say that the Khan of the Khergits wants me as a vassal. I respectfully decline, as my warriors do not want to live in the snow.
6. Eventually, King Yaro of the Vaegirs sends a herald to offer me vassalage. I accept and am given a small fief that I care for.
7. Start making money with my fief and workshops.
8. We war against the Nords, I take multiple castles for the king and have many victories.
9. Nords are done for.
10. Turn towards the Swaedians, and my party of 100 men rip through Harlaus and his knights. 
11. Swaedians done for.
12. Yaro calls me his personal champion and after a high ranking lord defects, Yaro gives me THREE TOWNS.
13. MAKE BANK FOR MONTHS.
14. Vaegiers start destroying the Rhodoks. Seeing that we will quickly own half the map, I know that if I ever want to be King of Calradia, I cannot allow my own faction (who I love) to keep growing.
15. I defect, and Yaro is sad to see me go.
16. I attack the Rhodoks from the other side and take Almera Castle, declaring it property of the United Kingdom of Calradia.
17. Sweep across the Rhodoks and take Jelkala as our capital. By now I have 8 vassals who all like me and own fiefs.
18. Old Rhodok territory is now mine.
19. Sarranids war against me in the summer. I announce a crusade, and with all 12 of my vassals at my side, we conquer them completely by autumn. The sultan offered peace many times, but we denied.
20. It was now only myself, the Khergits, and the Vaegirs. 
21. As soon as the Khergits war the Vaegiers, we strike and take all the Swaedian land once held by the Vagi.
22. I want Sargoth. Yaro sits upon its throne.
23. We march on Sargoth. Yaro meets me outside, and I shed a tear as I charge towards his army. We win.
24. Now the Khergits are the only ones left in the snowy mountains, and over a long two years we take their lands.
25. Calradia is united. I am king. I walk out of my palace doors in Sargoth, and see my empire. Arch Silverblood has made a name for himself.

Puts you in a perspective of what kind of power the cavalry holds and what kind of brutal chaos is the medieval battlefield. On top of mechanics there are classic role-playing elements and surprisingly unique concept with what I can describe as mercenary sandbox strategy. Also m&b has well balanced and expansive trading system which potentially allows you to earn money without ever engaging in battles, which feels like playing a completely different game.

M&B is rough around the edges and occasional bugs, glitches and strange npc dialogue influence the overall experience substantially, the longer game goes along, the more notable the unpolished nature of the game and, possibly, budgetary constraints are.

Sill amazing experience for me. Has things other, more marketable games couldn't do better

But I'm not alone when I say it is the mods that truly elevate it to best game.

Historical mods: Aut Caesar aut nihil (Rome), 1257 AD - Enhanced edition (Crusades), Gekokujo DER (Japan warring times), Between Empires (WWI), American Civil war revived, Age of Arthur, Bryten walda (dark ages), Sparta (ancient greece).
Fantasy mods: Prophesy of pendor, Perisno, Paradigm worlds (this one is a mix of scifi), ACOK + Ice and fire (both Game of thrones mods).
Vanilla based-mods (stays closer to the factions): Bannerpage, Diplomacy, Floris, Novas Aetas.

There is much more mods to be found on Moddb, Nexus mods, steam workshop, or Talesworlds forums. These are just the mods I really liked in my time playing.

If you enjoy RPGs, or lean a bit more towards strategy, this game is the best mash up of both wolds in my opinion. I bought it on sale for five dollars and I will absolutely put a few hundred hours into this game. It's worth the price tag.

Edit: Countless hours of offline play later, at least ten mods later, thousands of fallen/slain troops later. I wish i could rediscover this title all over again, at least its still fun for some mindless conquest every now and then. 

10/10 will destroy Calradia again.

Its totally worth five dollars.

  I created this review years ago when I first initally played this game and enjoyed it. Finally years later I have 100% the game along with beating Viking Conquest and trying the waters of the other two expansions. With that said this is probably one of my favorite games of all time. I love the simple but hard to master combat that you can really test the skill ceiling of in MP. Even with my completionist status and a couple hundred hours I still suck in the MP lmao. That with the buildup from a single man trying to get by to becoming lord or even king of one of the kingdoms is such a difficult but fun progression. I love raiding other kingdoms to make profit and having to delicately select where to raid or who I can or can not fight as I help my kingdom expand and eventually take Calradia. It allows you to do so much that I didn't even know I could get married until 200 hours in and watching some reviews (thanks Sseth). This game has its jankyness with the exact systems of how things work, the graphics, and ai, but I think all of that gives it a charm that helps my experience overall in it. If those bother you as well you can install the countless mods it has that allow you to overall certain mechanics or change the setting of the world completely. I always go back to Native but do occasionally find it really fun to play around in Floris, LOTR TC, or the Japan TC. With all that said, I give it a 10/10 and if any of what I said interested you then I highly recommend you go play this butter-loving game.",1518915136,1656360204,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

And what I got, was a New, Unique, and frankly Breathtaking take on the survival genre. This game is incredibly nuanced, with an extraordinarily deep, Intelligent, yet still challenging story, that will play with your emotions at every turn.

What this game feels like, is as if you gave an expert team of developers an infinite budget, and no time constraints, and told them to make what they want. Further, the graphics that this game provides are some of the best looking, realistic graphics that I've ever seen come from a video game, and it manages to keep My PC cold while doing so.

This game has one of the most intense, and rich story's out there, good enough to rival the likes of RdR2, the entire persona series, the kingdom hearts games, and much more. And with doing all of this, the game is still able to make downright genius social commentary on many real world issues. but not so much that it hampers the story in any way.

To play this game for free, truly is a blessing, Anyone who is out for money knows they could make millions off of this tremendous piece of art. and while, maybe we cant pay for this modern Picasso we can support the creator in other ways

Basically they have all these aspects:

Pros:

*-Morale System*
*-Active Economy*
*-Prosperity and Management of Fiefs (Cities or Castles)*
*-LOTS OF MODS*
*-Combat, EXP, Stats Systems*

If you want Cons I'd say:

*-Battle Ends if you Die but you can stop that by downloading some workshop mods like DIPLOMACY*
*-Some Game Ruining Glitches (Rare)*

Good Mods I found:

Perisno, Prophesy of Pendor, Aut Caesar Aut Nihil, Bellum Imperii (Aut Caesar and Bellum are for Roman Era Enjoyers), DLCS and some others I forgot the name, but you could try searching Game of Thrones or Lord of The Rings.

Basically: *9.9/10*

Not 10/10 Because of the Bugs, but its the proof you don't need good graphics to have a good game.",1655933735,1655933735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're a b!tch.

You do work.

That's how Mount and Blade: Warband is played.

You grind. And grind. And grind. Doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.

Every once in a while, the game screws you over. You take a loss, maybe even a significant loss to undo the hours of ""progress"" you've previously made.

It certainly doesn't help that finding things to do is a massive pain in the @$$. Quest givers move around the map constantly and are even taken out of play frequently. Quests are random. Some are easy and pay well. Some are needlessly difficult and pay $h!t. But you won't know until you ask someone to do more b!tchwork for them.

Then, when you're done with your b!tchwork, you have to go find the quest giver again. He could be across the map, or currently an enemy prisoner. Who knows? But good luck finding him. And if the time limit on your quest expires before you do? Well... sucks to be a b!tch.

Everything else you can do is completely random and pretty much entirely dependent on whatever's happening next to you on the map. 

Combat is rough and janky. AI pathfinding is silly. Controls are ridiculous. 

You could be playing a million other games, so why waste your time with Mount and Blade?

If you're really that desperate to do bitchwork, ask the local 7-11 if you can clean their bathrooms. Or pick up the dog $h!t in the park. Pull some weeds out of your neighbor's yard, or whatever.",1655585275,1655585275,False,0,1,0.401441067457199097,0,True,False,False

I am always a sucker for a game that allows you to start as a relative nobody and work your way up to something great. That is not the same as games that treat you like the dirty peasant you are, although those definitely have a place in my library. Warband, partially I believe due to its non-true historical setting allows me to step into another time and place that isn't just a fantasy world. I can play as the leader of a troop of bandits, maybe mercenaries, though let's be honest most of the time I either pledge to Swadia, or try to strike out as a new kingdom. I don't think that Banerlord is a bad game by any standards but for some reason, I still feel more at home here, maybe it's just the nostalgia but it is what it is.

Edit after a couple of hours:
The game keeps crashing, i found a solution, its works with native fine, but asoiaf keeps crashing.
First, the game was difficult, so i started play with cheats on until i understand the game. And its so much fun now.

BUT: I played multiplayer for achievement, its a big disappointment. There are some servers with good players, it ok. But there are the cn servers with cheaters, aviod that. There are some players, who you fight against, then he leaves a few steps, and that time he kill you with a sword. From 4-5 step away... And bares a lot of hits.
So as i found in an advice: create your own server for achievements , with bots and password on arena map. Ohh, bots are  terrible. They are brainless, they stuck behind horses, the horses block you. AI bares 2-3 hits, you die from 1 hit. So unbalanced. Maybe its settings..",1645021124,1655037938,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You may do whatever you would assume you could do in a Medieval Fantasy world and more. You can become a vassal, siege castles, raid villages, build an army, attack others, etc.. but the main premise is to conquer Calradia as your own sole kingdom. This is a daunting task and will take you many 100s, maybe thousands of hours of work to finish entirely. You must conquer every single castle, town, and village of all the other factions under your own name, uniting Calradia once and for all, so eternal peace is restored. This can technically be considered beating the game, even though there is not an official end screen. However, this is an extremely difficult thing to do, and if you do want to do this, it takes a lot of patience, skill, and ambition. It is truly an amazing feat. 

However, there is one minor thing that makes the game a bit less polished, and that is the graphics. To be quite honest, the graphics really are not very good. They are decent; it doesn't look like a NES game, but they aren't great. You can note however that the armor and weaponry does have some nice finer detail, but other than that, the game is not particularly graphically beautiful. 

The thing is though, every Warband player can easily ignore this fact because the gameplay is so amazing.

The gameplay is unlike any game I've ever played, and it's a game about really going from the lowest rung of society to the very top as a powerful king as just one of the goals. Starting from the very bottom as a peasant with maybe some leather armour and a few rag tag troops with farm tools as implements of war, then slowly building your way up through battle, looting your enemies, selling their spoils and wearing their better gear, gaining new troops through the recruit of prisoners and from the taverns and villages, narrowly winning close battles and seeing your character grow stronger, wealthier, more renowned and more respected, honorable, or villainous is indescribably satisfying. You go from a withering peasant who barely can afford a club to beat his way through the rugged, individualistic world to a mighty lord or king who has an army of 100s of powerful troops that can smash nearly anything in its way. You can buy enterprises to bolster your income. There's a whole trading system where you can buy and sell goods for higher prices dependent on the current supply. You can battle in tournaments, court ladies, conquer, raid, and destroy anything in your path in your pursuit to betterment. Even when you get to the heights of regal kingship, the very tip of the hierarchy, you still feel like there is so much to accomplish because suddenly you're targeted as a high value person who needs to be taken down. Your vassals can revolt, kingdoms will declare war on you, your kingdom can crumble without careful consideration. And, like I've said, you can apply so many different mods that add so many new features that freshen the game to a point where it almost never gets boring.

Another point I'd like to make is how the story-telling in this game works. Any companion you hire has an interesting story. The quests you partake in have interesting backstories. Companions can feud with each other. You can literally have assassins sent after you to murder you. Even in vanilla, the stories and narrative are interesting and give you a basis for the story that you yourself can create. This game really is the pinnacle of freedom, because you can literally almost do anything you could possibly want. Even if you don't care for the medieval era, you can get mods to play in the zombie apocalypse, WW2, fantasy settings with orcs and elves and goblins, LOTR, Star Wars...etc. There is almost any setting you could possibly want with any story you want to play through.

To show you even more good things about this game..its value. This game is only 20 dollars and is constantly on sale for extremely cheap; it's only about 5 dollars. This game is so worth the price because of the sheer amount of modifications you can apply to the game and the insanely huge amount of activities you can do. 1000s of hours can be spent in this game and you will still have fun with it.

This game has crack in it and the unending ambition to keep improving keeps you going for 100s of hours.

This game is excellent. If you like history, warfare/battle simulators, RPG's, action, and extreme progression, this is your game.",1397988021,1654753616,True,5,1,0.575163364410400391,0,True,False,False

Mount & Blade: Warband é um dos melhores jogos já criados. Embora não pareça na frente, este jogo é extremamente complexo e profundo. Cada decisão que você toma tem uma reação e nenhuma jogada será a mesma. Você pode se sentar para jogar por uma hora e rapidamente se envolver com isso e se ver atacando a escória Swadian várias horas depois em um piscar de olhos. Isso é apenas no jogo single player básico também. Assim que você entra em mods e multiplayer, seu horizonte se expande exponencialmente. Você aprecia cada detalhe em uma intensa luta corpo a corpo e desenvolve as habilidades para superar seus oponentes. Ao longo dos meus 8 anos com quase 5000 horas e contando, não me arrependo de um único segundo do meu tempo jogando este jogo. É realmente uma obra-prima que nunca será recriada, nem mesmo em sua continuação em Bannerlord honestamente. Se este jogo não estiver em sua biblioteca com pelo menos 100 horas, você está efetuando um grande desserviço a si mesmo.

The game promotes freedom, choosing whatever you like and being absolutley not restricted or even linked to a main story line, you are free to write your own story ... at least that is the theory

In reality it's is terribly restrictive, if you don't do what the game expects you to do within the first hour or so, you get fucked ... plain simple ... you keep wandering around with your 50 man army which looses all it's moral, keep paying bills you can't afford, running after enemys you are too slow to chase .... or wandering around for hours in forest where noone else is, visiting all the counts in search for a stupid quest which give you no money, or which is not scaled to your level ...

Strangely the bandit skrimishes were a good way of leveling and getting money, but for whatever reason 99% of bandits vanished after 4-6 hours into the game ?

See, the game expects you to do certain things in your area, then travel there or do that ....

To be honest I wanted to play a good guy in medieval times, maybe the game just wants to be realistic there and you need to burn every village and kill all peasants to get along .... but no I fell for their advertising of freedom of choice in this game

Costum battles are no good either, you only have a handfull of maps and the fun ends quite fast

UPDATE: After giving it another try, I can only say that the multiplaer community is full of little racists and the general experience there is that it is terribly unbalanced and everyone runs around with 2h weapons spamming overhead attacks for one hit kills .... singleplayer is still dull ... well all the M&B fanboys in the world can't convince me, this game sucks!

What can I say about Mount & Blade? It is quite possibly the best RPG game created. I will first talk about the singleplayer campaign. Mount & Blade gives you the creative freedom to fabricate your character in any way you so well please. Whether you want to be a brigand raiding villages with your band of baddies, or a helpful person going around with your group, helping villagers and lords with menial tasks, or perhaps you want to be a vassal to a King, fighting battles and laying siege to castles in the name of your liege. Perhaps you want to be King commanding your own realm and warring with other Kingdoms expanding your power.

In Mount and Blade you start off as someone low on the social ladder, you can probably handle a sword deftly enough to vanquish your common brigand, but you certainly wouldn't be able to take on a knight. You can hire peasants from villages to join your war party and watch them rise in skill as they become knights on mounted horses or expert sharpshooters with bows or crossbows. Eventually, throughout the course of the game, you will have a powerful army that can crush big war parties led by Lords or Kings.

The combat in this game is relatively difficult, (especially in multiplayer). When first playing without automatic direction blocking you will very much find combat daunting, but don't let this dissuade you from playing, you will eventually get better at it to a point of being able to hold your own against most players. I'd say learning to combat in this game is one of the most fun things. Actual experience with other players is undoubtedly the best way to get better at fighting.

Moving on to the multiplayer side of the game, this is where the Napoleonic DLC comes more into the equation, you can partake in duels to better your fighting or you can fight in sieges and big battles against an enemy team. I can't speak for the vanilla Mount & Blade MP, however you can also partake in commander battles, commander battles is a type of game mode that leaves you in charge of a detachment of 30 men and you must command these men, alongside the rest of your team, to win a battle against an enemy team that are in the exact same position as you. There's all this and more to Mount & Blade MP.

If there's one thing that one must mention about this game it is the mods, you haven't played Mount & Blade properly if you haven't experimented with modding. One mod I must recommend is Gekokujo, in which the premise of the game is the same, other than the fact that you are in the Sengoku Jidai period of Japan. There are brand new weapons, armour, troops, and many other things that basically create a brand new game for you, (you can even get matchlock samurai units). Again I have to say if you are going to play Mount & Blade, you have to use mods.

STORY:
Your story is whatever you want it to be. However there is little bits of lore about the world of Calradia sprinkled in by companions and Lords, I'll let you discover it for yourself as not even I know everything about the background of Calradia.

AUDIO & MUSIC:
Upon opening Mount & Blade you are hit in the face by perhaps one of the most awestriking main themes ever created, it feels like being bombarded by a shockwave of awesome. The music in this game is very befitting to the type of game it is. The main theme begins with fanfares from trumpets, which gives you a heroic feeling. The texture of the music thickens which leaves you feeling overwhelmed by the possibilities of what is going to happen to you in your adventures through Calradia, and after roughly fifty seconds the music ends, the silence beckoning you to press the ""start a new game"" button.

The rest of the music throughout the game varies from calm, as you walk through villages and towns talking to lords and peasants alike, or chaotic and heroic as you make battle with brigands or lords. 

Mount & Blade has a great soundtrack, one that I shan't forget for a long time.

GRAPHICS:
The graphics are as to be expected from a 2010 game, but they absolutely do not take away from the immersive experience you will have. I think Mount & Blades aesthetic is what makes this game so much more different to all the other RPGs out there, you will never have a game as aesthetically alluring as this one.

The game itself is a basic set up at the start. You'll travel around and learn about how the game works. It's not terribly hard but in the first hour you'll immerse yourself with what is going on. You fight bandits and do simple missions from Lords or villagers. You can fight in tournaments and declare you victories to a lady when heading to the castle post event. 

There you'll meet lords and ladies. Either who want you dead or happy to meet someone new. Once your renown is know (150 renown) you'll now begin another stage of your adventure. You can become either a mercenary or pledge yourself to a King. Expected to fight in military events and so on. Though it is a bit cheesy. 

Marriage is limited to just marrying a lady of a family and securing ties but also it is spiced up when you can challenge another's hand to a duel of fates. Who ever wins will either win the love of the lady or you'll be scolded for it. That is clear prior to the choice made. 

Sieges and battles are kept at 150 pop in any case. Understand is is taking in the factor of 1 x 1 = % advantage. If you have more troop count youll gain more numbers in the battle. A ratio factor is made by the game allowing a small but 'fair' advantage. 

You can build your villages and towns and depending your engineering level it will decide how long it will take. Take care of your fiefs otherwise no money will be made. 


Many features in the game are great but limited. Bannerlord expands and has many reworks of the game I wished for. I never knew about bannerlord until 1 year prior of release and it has been a great design of improving and implementing all we wanted in Warband.

-Graphics:
For 2010 they're alright, but nowdays they're just charmingly bad. Animations are smooth, the randomly generated faces of npcs and players are very oblivion-like, terrain is washed off and very blurry, towns and cities are copied and pasted all around. You would say that these qualities make them bad, but as I said, they are charming. They grow on you over time and you remember fondly the monstrous faces you encounter around the world. From me: this gets a 8/10 but from nowdays it would get a 6/10.

-Music and Sound: 
One thing that time didn't gnaw on, and was even made better as the years have passed. The warcries and lunging sounds with the gibberish talking is memorable. The music of every Mount and Blade game are spectacular and very nostalgic. There is just something special going around this dangerous world with a squad of mercenaries while some soothing strings play on your adventures. One of my favorite one is Mounted Snow terrain calm (Nice name isn't it).

-Gameplay and Atmosphere:
 Now this is the one part of the game that didn't age the best, even though it's still a nice experience.
The game is divided into a topdown boardgame-like map where you can go around, find some fights to participate in, go from town to town to trade or carry out missions, recruit mercenaries from towns or camps etc. it's very fun and engaing, seeing wars and battles take place and even helping your own faction in sieges and stuff is really fun. Other fun feature is that every save you make is different, so in one the Swadian towns and castles get ruined and one of their trade items like flux or something else go up in price because the demand is higher.
 The combat in the other end is fun for the first half. In the beginning you do most of the work, with a combat that is simple, you can hit in 4 different places and you have differing weapon types that specialize in different things, like axes kill shields good, and maces can stun, but after the first half of the game, you participate in fights less because you have an army that you need to use to fight of difficult battles, this is when the game becomes ""who has better units and more of them"". Also the AI is stupid, like really stupid.

Overall, I'd say this is a game worth buying, and it's really cheap too. For me, who has lots of nostalgia for this game, I'd say an 8/10 is fair, but at times I'd say it dips into 7/10. All around a classic and very nostalgic game.",1650142718,1650142718,True,9,0,0.554222285747528076,0,True,False,False

                                The games unique and lots of fun, get it in a sale!. 

This is a hard game to review, one of my personal favs.. but there will be so many little things that piss you off I'm finding not much point in playing it.. when I say little things.. the game when it decides to cheat to keep things ""fresh"" forcing me to also use cheats. Bandits can't be wiped out so end game is just you killing bandit hordes over and over and over and over and over.. if you ignore them then they ruin your economy which in early game makes it harder to take on lords.. because I'm stuck taking on bandits. 

People will also say about mods but I've had nothing but issues, these aren't like Skyrim mods that all seem to just work.. tried the Star Wars mod out.. seems to be a bug where player can't own land.. no ones really sure, played Lord of he rings.. even though I won the battle I still lost it and lost all my men and gear (ragequit mode activated).      Brytenwalda wasn't bad but seems quite hardcore historically accurate. 

Think with this title it's time to stop noticing all the things wrong and find a new game to play!.

The player is a foreigner that comes to the country of Calradia (an alternate medieval Europe) with the wares of your choice after creating your character. He or She could make their name as a trader within the world’s economy which changes in response to war which was common during the medieval era or work as a mercenary for any of the six kingdoms which would to many historical fans could draw parallels with historical kingdoms up until they become a vassal. Each of the player’s choices impacts the game as lords and your own compatriots react to robbing, fighting and supporting the peasants, and will sometimes affect how the lord’s view you. Thus is the problems with vassal systems. The game’s other systems open up as you start to receive land under your name and perhaps dream of being King/Queen where your enemies will not be the common thief but lords and their armies. Lord’s relations also changes realistically in respect to your position as king when the game switches from individual allegiances to managing an entire kingdom, entrusting its security to vassals that could defect if your go too far giving land carelessly. The game is an open world sandbox with all of this taking place within a single game and typically last 500-600 in game days, so while it is slow to build up the game allows players for a deep gameplay that makes each playthrough an experience in spite of its age. The Game also has an active multiplayer with players all over the world roleplaying as medieval era knights or a napoleanic soldier should you the game's fantastic Napoleanic Wars expansion, both optimized for PC for all around control in bayonet fights or when swinging a sword",1574377803,1649631189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game remains challenging even once you do become powerful, as you can accidentally get outnumbered and overwhelmed quickly. The directional attack mechanic can take a little getting used to. 

It doesn't say it in game at all, but CTRL + Space speeds up game time to make it actually tolerable to cross the world map in a timely fashion. If you're the impatient sort, cheats are also available to add EXP and cash to speed up your in game experience.

Despite its simplicity, there's a tremendous amount of depth. Mod support is incredible and the game is cheap anyway since it's on the older side. I highly recommend this game.

STORY
There isn't one, since it's a sandbox game. You, the player, create the story through your actions in Calradia. As a consequence, I can't really rate the game in this area. If you have no imagination, the game will be lame. But a player could also weave a thrilling and personal tale beyond anything a team of writers could devise. 

GAMEPLAY
The player character is a foreigner who has arrived in the vaguely medieval land of Calradia, which is split between 6 warring nations. From there, the player can choose to play in an abundance of different ways. They can eschew combat and try to play as a peaceful trader; they can jack their combat skills and become the most renowned or infamous warlord Calradia has ever seen. Marry into the nobility, work as a mercenary or swear yourself to a nation, even take over Calradia yourself; all these options are open to you. The world is dynamic and changes with both the player's actions and the movements of NPCs. The incredible freedom of gameplay against the backdrop of a world which changes with or without the player's input makes Warband incredibly deep. The game also has a simple but intuitive combat system with a similarly surprising amount of depth. It's not perfect, and there are a number of glitches which can force you to close and reopen the game, but overall Warband's gameplay is solid. However, it can also get very repetitive, particularly if you are playing ""optimally."" 8/10

LOOKS
This game was made in 2010 and it shows, but in all seriousness, who cares? That being said, yes, it didn't age well. Even when it first released there were presentation issues. Enemies hilariously spawn T-posing out of nowhere. The font is pretty ugly. So on and so forth. However, most of the animations are actually solid, and for that I give props. 3/10

VALUE
You could legitimately play this game forever. The modding community has magnified that by several factors. If you don't want to play in Calradia, you can play in Europe, or Japan, or Star Wars, or Middle-Earth. Modders have taken the framework Warband provides and made it even deeper with mods which change how the player manages relationships between lords, alter and balance combat, etc. And since the game was released in 2010, it costs a very reasonable $20. The value cannot be overstated. 10/10

OTHER NOTABLES
The community is a bunch of memers
Also I'm pretty sure this game was made by two people so what am I even doing with my life aaasdsagsd

OVERALL: 21/30. 7/10, Good. If you enjoy Mount & Blade, you could be playing it for a very long time. It's a flawed but unique game with a devoted community and tons of ways to play. I look forward to seeing where Bannerlord ends up!",1648612571,1648688215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Native Warband was a great start but theres numerous game dynamics to learn.

Viking Conquest mod was a massive improvement, but dang!, im still fighting the british and irish to this day.. it just goes on and on... and on... and on! I am a well renown-ed (5k), highly feared (-3k reputation), ruthless raiding warrior, annihilating the cree-sti-an factions, with 10k warriors under my reign, yet i can not defeat time.

There are political figures and economic forces, wars and diplomacy that truly shape the nature of gameplay. You're able to play as a mercenary party, a trade caravan, a vassal of one of the distinctly designed and historically inspired factions, or even a group of mere bandits. The possibilities range from wandering as an individual to being the actual king of an actual kingdom, and leading your forces to conquer the entirety of the map.

Throughout this there are battles ranging from scraps with bandits and assassins to great sieges with hundreds of soldiers at battle. You control your own character and can lead your soldiers in specific formations and battle strategies to gain an edge on your AI foes. With the right troops, the right moves, perhaps the right terrain, you can surmount any foe.

The visuals are ugly even for its time, and there are some serious polish issues in vanilla, like the weirdness of getting knocked out, autoresolve, retreating from battle and thus resetting everyones' positions at will, and other weird bugs that you'll have to get used to as you play. This game is, after all, my favored example of Eurojank. However, many of these are corrected in mods. The mod community is thriving even today, and mods range from the smallest of enhancements to total overhaul mods to a variety of universes, ranging from Lord of the Rings to Game of Thrones, medieval Japan, fucking Touhou, and even original universes like in Prophecy of Pendor.

I could talk about this game for hours. There's really nothing else out there that matches it. The game is very, very addicting and generates wonderful war stories for years to come. It is definitely one of my favorite games of all time.",1648522054,1648522054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While that's totally fine the standalone expansion pack to the celebrated Mount & Blade game takes and continues to the opposite direction by going more realistic and historical while also getting you involved in both the politics as well as the large scale battles with you commanding your troops on the ground at the politically intriguing lands of Calradia once again. If you enjoyed the base game then this expansion pack will add even more to what you already like by enhancing visuals, adding a new faction the Sarranid Sultanate (Medieval Muslims), improved animations, bandit camps, improved combat gameplay (chamber blocking, kicking, time-limited couched lances, changing side of melee strikes, auto-blocking missiles with your shield and troop moral during combat); better balanced party system, better balanced food, more quest types, buy land even manage enterprises; found, command even rule your kingdom with ability for vassalage and lastly getting married. Multiplayer is now a thing too with up to 60-250 players/AI bots duking it out in class based customizable combat with a variety of game modes to pick from as well as Modding being much more easier then before. If you haven't played Mount & Blade before its quite literally make your own adventure in a giant sandbox third or first person action adventure role playing game where you decide your fate with words or the sword. The main feature is the large scale combat and realistic Medieval era world they made while its not the most authentic (plate armor losing to swords) it sure will punish those who just rush in to the fight without considering tactics and strategy. A ton of replayability each playthrough especially with mods and how random things can get in Calradia.

It's from a different generation, another style of video-gaming. The art, the style, the dialogue, the gameplay and loop, are all from another time. 

But this is a timeless game. The mechanics work so well, the gampeplay is so solid it still holds to this day as an absolutely incredible experience, feeling smooth and fleshed out. Though, the game is complicated, and it does little after teaching you the very very basics (some fighting mechanics). The rest you have figure out on your own: Troop management, battle tactics, political choices, etc. Those more advanced mechanics are hard to figure out without help from a guide and the community, which are absolutely fantastic. 

You won't be sucked into an beautifully immersive open world with complex characters. 
There aren't fancy weapons, or shiny spells. 

There's just you, some weapons and armor, incredibly solid and fair mechanics under the hood, and an world for you to conquer. 

It's just a different style of game made for a simpler time. If that's what attracts you, get this. And you will be immersed in possibly the most robust medieval RPG game to have ever been made.

A lot of my time is in mods, but I still played the DLC(Viking Conquest also counts towards the base game) and the vanilla a lot. While it has it's flaws, and the start is almost ALWAYS slow and boring, I also think it's rather necessary. It gives you a great feeling of progression to try and solo a group of 10 looters and die, only to come back later and kill them all in one hit, taking 0 damage lol

Overall, while I admit, the game does have many flaws, for example, if you go ahead and start a kingdom too early, you might end up just being destroyed when all the kingdoms gang up on you and attack your towns with armies of 1000= soldiers lol. Also the game gets very boring near the end, when you're finally building up a big enough army to take over the world, the game sorta just... loses it's meaning(keep in mind, this takes a very long time to get to this point lol)

Well, enough about the negative, this is quite possibly my favorite game. And if i wasn't poor, i would be Bannerlord immediately, too bad it never goes on sale lol. I still play this from time to time, alternating mods and sometimes even just playing the diplomacy mod(which is base game with a few added QoL features). It has an awesome level of progression, you start off with a small group of 10 soldiers(it actually starts you with 1, but it's quick to recruit more) and gradually building up to an army of 300+. 

After all that exposition, for anyone that doesn't know this game, it is a mix of a strategy game and a first person/third person game. You move about on a world map with a small ""unit"" and when you encounter an enemy, it goes into a real time battle where you directly control your main solder while the other soldiers fight around you. Battles of up to 150 soldiers(I believe that's what it's limited to in base game, but some mods go way higher) and realistic weapons physics, for example, if you swing your sword but hit the enemy before your sword picks up speed, you will do much less damage, but if you charge at them while on a horse, you will do considerably more damage. Certainly never played any game like it, probably number one of my top favorite games, along with Kenshi and Rimworld(believe it or not, this game does have some minor similarities to those games)

Last note, while I am a long time player of this game, imo higher difficulties just make the game frustrating. Even in early levels on the easiest difficulty you can die in one or two hits if you're unlucky, so my advice is play it one 1/4 damage and poor AI quality, but idk, maybe some people like super frustratingly high difficulties lol",1648115073,1648115751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a significantly expanded version of the original and completely supersedes it. Everything that Mount & Blade had to offer is here, there is simply more of it. Mount & Blade is not easy to place using standard genre terminology. I have heard it called an action-RPG, with strategic and tactical elements. But the most relevant term I believe is sandbox. The concept of the game is enchantingly simple. The empire of Calradia is long gone, the lands it used to occupy are now the battleground of several factions fighting for supremacy. You are an adventurer that somehow ends up in this volatile land. That's it. Make your own own story, the world is your oyster. 

The game provides a dynamic world with different kingdoms fighting wars, vassals shifting allegiances and changing borders. The world is full of towns and villages that can be visited in pursuit of quests and activities. The player is encouraged to build their own retinue of loyal soldiers and seek fortune and glory in whatever way they please. You want to roam the map hunting bandits and protecting villagers? Or roam the map pillaging villages and robbing caravans? You want to join the faction wars as a mercenary for one king or another? Or perhaps swear fealty to one of those kings and gain your own land as a vassal? You want to start your own kingdom and bring Calradia to heel? You want to travel from town to town and participate in knight tourneys? Or start various industries? Or simply become a trader in pursuit of a good deal? You can do all that and more.

As can be inferred, the game takes its simple concept and elevates it to great heights, thanks to a series of complementing mechanics. That's why Warband is great. But, however deep or engaging its gameplay loop may be, its presentation is downright awful. Jankiness is the name of the game. Poor graphics, horrible interface that obstructs more than it helps, laughable animations, clipping, bugs and a generally amateurish feel complete the set. To say this game lacks polish is to say the Pacific ocean is slightly wet. This is really unfortunate, it tarnishes the experience. Many times I was caught by surprise by an event that was poorly explained, or simply got bored to tears waiting for that siege tower to slowly reach the walls. I can't help but wonder how much better Warband could have been if there was a mere modicum of polish.

In the end, do I recommend this game? Definitely yes. What fan of fantasy hasn't thought of experiencing what Warband has to offer? An open world that you can just roam free in. Janky or not, there is a lot to like here. It does help that the game has a significant number of mods too. The developers do in fact encourage people to try out mods. A possible concern would be that the true sequel to Mount & Blade, Bannerlords, is already in Early Access. If you don't mind incomplete games, perhaps that would be a better option long-term.",1647698851,1647698851,True,14,0,0.681732237339019775,4,True,False,False

This was one of my first games, I fell in love with it in three different ways:

1° When I was a kiddo medieval design won me over for the aesthetics of the game, every day after my history classes I couldn't wait to get home and play and establish my own kingdom, it was one of the few games my father played with me too...

2° Around my teenage years, when I played it, the strategy of building a balanced army and how to do ambushes and sieges, the economy to maintain your army and improve your equipment and other things.

3° The last time I played it, the way you interact with npcs, you can get into fights with nobles, marry and run away with your spouse, rescue the nobles, interact with your unique followers with their own personalities, change lords to your side with your persuasion and military prowess. This kind of content being present in an old game, like a very old game, the graphics are really bad BUT I think it's amazing how they build a game this way when no one has done it something of this scale (total war is more city manager in the old days). Also the add-ons especially fire and sword I loved the gunpowder fights and fighting for my northern kingdom there.

P.S: Don't get me wrong, but you can fight with peasants so even being a villain in this game its ok and ""fun""(avaible) UHSAUHAUHAUSHUAUASAHS.

With that said, this is one of my favorite medieval franchises, I can't wait to play Bannerlord and enjoy the improvements. :^)


[h1] Pros: [/h1]
Economics
Your looks after the fights
Owning a army and empire
Good roleplay
The ost its relaxing
Cool armors
Siege Battles

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
Well... its really old, so i don't think it aged well, so i wouldn't recommend it to people who cant enjoy old games mechanics, because there's a gap in mechanics for newer generations.
Some Lords are snitchs and i wish i could kill them, sadly you cant.
I really don't like using polearms, its very bad to handle them, in another hand, axes are very good.

Warband has to be my favourite compared to both the original Mount & Blade and Bannerlord for not only it's gameplay or it being easy to learn but it's modding community too, sure it's textures haven't aged well but it's soundtrack still sounds great.

Like you can go from playing a mod about Starwars, being in Europe during 1257ad and a 16th century Japan! Hell there's even a mod about World of Warcraft and LOTR! like i could go on forever about the amount of mods Warband has though your more bound to find more of  them on mod websites [b] (i'd recommend moddmb) [/b] rather than Warband's own workshop!

- Mark Twain[/code]
Gonna be honest, I realize I'm going against the grain here. There's over 100k positive reviews so take this with a grain of salt.

My experience with [i]Mount and Blade[/i] was similar to that of a smoker to Malboros. It's not a good game by any means and yet I was utterly addicted to it. You assume the role of a noble within the continent of Calradia, with six factions warring to conquer it, sculpting an army and conquering territory. And, well, that's it. Perhaps my favorite bad game.

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]This is a very organic RPG, perhaps the truest form. No story - you write it yourself. It's like the nemesis system from [i]Shadow of Mordor[/i], blown up to over 200 individuals, kingdoms, factions and cities. 
[*]Party management is a lot of fun. My armies have always been something that I hand picked and oversaw
[*]Sieges are a blast, even if they've got huge bottlenecks and the AI has absolutely no idea what is going on
[*]Fief, castle, and city management is straightforward and self-sufficient without too much distraction from the core game loop.
[*]It feels like an authentic medieval experience. The art direction for models and score is on point.
[*]It was hilarious when the marshall let me marry his daughter, then defected, and was jailed in the castle with his daughter holding the key.
[*]Cranking up the difficulty doesn't require skill per se, but it does require a different mindset. I played with the difficulty and had an easy time finding where I was comfortable.
[*]There were lots of times where I was [b]deep[/b] into a power fantasy with a small but drilled army that could take anything on.
[/list]
[h1]The Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Graphically [i]Mount and Blade[/i] is not impressive at all, even when it released in 2010.
[*]Allied AI is super frustrating to work with since they can't count. If the sum of our armies exceeds one enemy, there are many instances where they'll still run away.
[*]The only line of dialogue is ""YEARG"", screamed dozens of times each battle. Well, maybe also a ""My lord"".
[*]Finding people, allies or enemies, is a huge chore and often leaves you like ""but I was just there""
[*]The mid-game is boring and aimless. Late game is sluggish.
[*]If you're not in command of your faction, late game combat can be extremely cumbersome and boring. Like you can absolutely capture every castle by yourself but the AI will just swoop in while you're gone and undo all your progress.
[*]Battles are not significant enough. Without a place to stash enemies, they come back incredibly quickly. Once you have a town or castle, it's much easier to snowball an enemy which is why the mid game is so boring.
[*]The interface is bad. To the point that text will be on top of text and things highlight in lime green which is impossible to read at smaller font sizes.
[*]The book merchant's inventory never renews
[*]Combat areas look procedurally-generated and many locales are not enjoyable at all to fight in.
[*]This game is simple to the point that it feels barebones, like it isn't finished. While I liked the simplicity when getting started, I was constantly seeing places where I'd make improvements if I were a developer.
[/list]
[h1]The Indecisive[/h1]
[list]
[*]At its core, [i]Mount and Blade Warband[/i] is a huge grind. Speedruns are over 9 hours on the easiest difficulty and on harder difficulties it may take dozens at the shortest. Skim some other reviews and expect a single playthrough to take you at least 50 hours.
[*]The score isn't half bad but with how long it takes to get anywhere, you've heard everything for several hours when you're reaching the endgame.
[*]Combat is simple, but also feels somewhat unrefined. Blocking is borderline overpowered against AI whereas thrown weapons are almost always a hindrance. Attacking is based on the vector your mouse takes, so your camera will be going all over the place. But after a while, this gave it a bit of charm in ways that the simplicity of the overworld, dialogue, and progression failed.
[*]Couched lance damage hits like a Serbian father-in-law, which feels great to deliver but never feels fair to receive.
[*]Renown, honor, and right to rule are still systems that I don't entirely understand. Fortunately, you don't really need to.
[*]This game potentially has a lot of reading if you really want to know the lore. This reading is primarily functional and can change as your saves progress, so the lore can be hit or miss.
[*]Khergits specialize in horses, which makes them take twice as long to fight because of how annoying they can be. Playing as them is great!
[*]By the late game there has been a lot of flip-flopping between factions and from a cultural perspective, there is little to distinguish the combat style of one faction to another.
[*]If your horse goes down in battle, you're basically a potted plant.
[*]This game is highly moddable, but I haven't really explored that at all.
[/list]
[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
My first sesh was 13 hours of bliss. Once I knew what I was doing, however, the gameplay lost most of the wind in its sails. So why did I stick with the grind in such an underwhelming game?

Well, do you like [i]RuneScape[/i] for the numbers? Do you play [i]FIFA[/i] for the single-player campaign? There's an audience that this title is perfect for. Watching numbers slowly go up is satisfying. In this title, you're able to directly tie it to a power trip and the poor graphics, gameplay, and audio can seemingly melt away. While I loved it, I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

I'm glad it got a sequel that's addressing most of the cons. This game frequently goes on sale for less than 5 bucks, so if you want to test the waters this is a good choice. I never played the multiplayer or modded it, but there is more to explore which isn't addressed in this review.

All that being said, it's a different kind of grind than mainstream experiences will give you and unless that's your cup of tea, this game will come across as a bland hog of your time.

Playing Warband is making me wish i got into this game around it's release when i had all the free time in the world as a teenager and it would have probably blown my mind back in 2010. Playing it now for the first time i can see why the game has gotten so much praise and love over the past decade. I love the scale and open endedness of the world and the freedom you're given. It does feel dated in different aspects but it still holds up nicely overall.

You start off as a generic guy (or gal) in one of a few different factions' lands. You can recruit villagers from towns to join your little war party, meet companions (heroes with names who can join you) at taverns, trade resources between different areas, or even make a play at trying to achieve nobility - either by working your way up, serving a Lord until you can become one yourself, or through marriage, or probably through other means too. It's a really open ended game and I imagine most people will play this differently.

I always try to go down the Berserk route of being a very strong fighter with a small but skilled party of fighters. Being a mercenary for a nation and then impressing them by decisively winning key fights for them is a springboard to being named a vassal yourself, and then you can go on to try and make your own kingdom!

Or you can just roam around and kill bandits, defending the smaller villages from peril! It's really up to you.

I don't get the impression this game's graphics were anything special when it came out, and they're definitely not in 2022, but everything looks like what it is supposed to be and the game isn't 'ugly' or anything.

while playing on brother account before final relase I remember some weird bugs happening to my character like reseting my apperance and stuff but as I am writing this review today with 200hours+ I didn't noticed any bugs at all

mount and blade warband is a little bit of everything; character progress feels like little rpg, in battles you can give orders to your troops like in tactics games or simply lead your soldiers in to battle - after that ypu have to move soldiers, recruit more, feed them, keep their morale, upgrade castles, villages, recruiting lords, promoting companions that part feels more like strategy game for me
worldmap is divided to couple of regions with specific troops from nothern huscarls to nomad horse archers to noble knights to dessert mameluks

game starts with character creation (few questions about your character past leading to your skills and apperance) after that you can do whatever you want - game doesn't force ypu to anything but obviously more dedicated ways of playing is supporting one of factions, setting up rebelies against existing factions, or trying to run your own faction but yeah nobody is going to shout at you if youre going to attack caravanes all your time or if you decide to become merchant with some factories around world

early stage is so random due to your power and quests which you are supposed to do but you can't take because your faction is at war and you can't help them because formaly you're not their ally yet and you're too weak to fight on your own (or you're lucky enough to start on your own tho)
if you manage to get into middle stage in which youre strong enough to defend versus other noble lords or if you're already a vassal, then everthing including final stage should be more fun and less boring or even less annoying than early stages

after some hours doing most of the things over and over again game may become boring, and then it's time for jumping into steam workshop mods from simply diplomacy which will only upgrade the hard repetable aspect of native game to lord of the rigns, game of thrones or even star wars mods - complete conversions

also you don't need to start from the scratch always, there is option to import/export your character with all stats and with some gold

it's very hard to say anything bad about game which you love, but for sure companions which could be more interactive, more dynamic quests, more events like sickness, weather changes but most of that things you get with most popular and relased mods, and vanilla game is best for learning basics and how to play mount and blade warband",1645163040,1645199960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solid fighting mechanics a la Age of Chivalry but in some ways enhanced, a Total War-esque level of strategy and troop leading in battles make for a great experience, and the module system achieve making this game very accessible to modding, which can go as far as to break what has been thought to be the boundaries of the game engine itself, not to forget the customization of the player character's face and equipment, both in single- and multiplayer. Still, while I personally adore Mount & Blade: Warband very much, it is not perfect. Gameplay and graphics wise, it feels and looks visibly old, which might deter people not as familiar with it from playing. Lighting remains one of the strongest aspects of the graphics but in every other way, for example textures, models and such, it falls flat these days. Even the HD texture update the game received a few years ago doesn't save it, and the shadows of NPC's and players being limited to what feels like 15 frames per second is slightly jarring. Still though, it is easy to overlook the graphical flaws with everything else that Warband provides. The multiplayer scene is still booming also, even more than that of Bannerlord at this time of writing.",1478547391,1645041422,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

It has some of the best melee & ranged combat in any game ever, great commander controls, a well crafted medieval world with lots of player freedom, and a huge modding scene. This lengthy review is only a basic overview. 

The combat of Mount and Blade: Warband is excellent as it is easy to quickly understand, but difficult to master. The game has a large number of melee weapons that can attack from a variety of different ranges and from up to 5 different directions. The default setting is that right click slowly automatically blocks attacks from any direction, but for higher level play blocking should be set to either mouse direction or keys because players and higher level AI enemies use fake outs and attacks from angles with jumps + spins. Weapons include many different kinds of swords, scimitars, two-handed swords, axes, two-handed axes pikes, hammers, maces, spears, lances, and many different types of shields. Lances can be couched while on horseback to do insane amounts of charge damage and weapons work differently against different types of armor. Ranged combat also has alot of depth as bows can do more damage and be fired while on horseback, but require a large amount of skillpoints to be put into the Power Draw and Horse Archery skills to access their increased utility over crossbows. Crossbows lock aim in place and can be fired like snipers from the start, while bows require leveling the skill to reach that accuracy. There are also thrown weapons like knives, javelins and throwing axes that have their own complexities. 

Mount and Blade is not just about fighting, but also about building and leading an army made up of many different kinds of units. The army command system is very basic, but it allows for skirmishing, flanking, rotating charges, and even hit & run tactics. By default commanding is done through the F1-F8 keys and the 1-8 keys with each key linked to menus that let you command different kind of units. Units and companion characters can also be rebranded to being different types of units. There are 6 different factions modeled off of historical medieval regions that each have their own specialized units and you can use any of them and even create mixed armies. Mount and Blade is probably the best game where you lead soldiers in battle. 

Alot of attention has clearly been paid to developing Calradia. Before you start you have to build and design a character. Skill points, weapon points, starting items & reputation are allocated based on the many different backgrounds you pick for your character as they age up to adulthood. Gender affects how the points are allocated and how your character is treated throughout the game. Calradia is a patriarchal society that gives women a harder time, but marrying a lord can also give your character a fast pass to riches. The backgrounds can be mixed and matched and most are affected by gender. The game has alot of optional text for those who want to learn, but these traditions, economic lessons, peoples concerns, and conflicts all manifest as mechanics. Money can be made by killing bandits, trading goods between cities & villages, investing in manufacturing, doing quests, fighting in tournaments and more. Players can set any goals, from conquering the whole of Calradia with themselves as monarch to making a fortune as a merchant or installing a pretender on a throne.The game has companions that all have their own skillset, backgrounds and dramas with other companions. The sheer number of different party skills makes creating a balanced party a good idea, but picking characters you like is also an option. 

Mount and Blade: Warband is a game that you can pour thousands of hours into without getting bored. Its limited number of skillpoints, large number of factions and political system justifies specialized characters and many different playthroughs. It has mods that fundamentally change the game and even represent epics the Sengoku Jidai, Viking Era, Romance of the Three Kingdoms,  and Lord of the Rings. Its eighteenth century combat mod had hundreds of players organizing into regiments for historical line battles and this eventually became its own DLC. This game has endless content for both singleplayer and multiplayer.",1644094874,1644094874,True,23,0,0.734753131866455078,1,True,False,False

This flaw takes the form of Mount and Blade. Mount and Blade is humanities greatest sin, deplorable in all right, yet unable to end. Like a dying animal, I wish only to put it out of its misery, yet it struggles to live. Shall we continue this streak of sin, we might as well eliminate ourselves and our legacy as humans now. But not even the words of I or anyone else will not change the undying cycle. Why do we bother to try if all that awaits us and our forthcomings is great calamity? What a cruel farce of God.

I don't know if I would recommend it, genuinely, now. As it is insanely old. It's a bit of a conundrum really. The thing is that this is very definitely worth having. I just can't picture a person who is alive right now and doesn't own it. You must be a teenager or super old. There are many attempts to surpass the heights that this game has achieved, and none have come close.

It's mods are equally impressive in their scope and variety. From modern warfare sims, which I have never even touched to warsword conquest (If you love warhammer, you can thank me later) to the prophecy of pendor. The limits are nearly endless.

I doubt the developers understood the ease of modding this game and it's basic integrity are what stood it apart from the masses of games out there. I cannot sing my praises of this game high enough.",1643944957,1643944957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
