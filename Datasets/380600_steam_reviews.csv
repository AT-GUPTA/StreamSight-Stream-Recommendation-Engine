The grind in this game is unlike any other game I have ever played.. It is far too tedious to rank up, you can spend days at a time catching big trophy and unique fish trying to rank up a level even with paid boosts!

Fish spawn in the same spot over and over and over and everyone just sits in there with their 4 rod stands fast forwarding time after time once the bite gets slow.. The game gets really boring once you start doing this.

The game is monetized but you don't really need much, once you have figured out whether you like the game or not you can spend $20 for a pack that will take you to the endgame 

Overall a good game but they need to diversify spawn locations and not have just one hot spot everyone goes too.. they should also tone down the grind by a factor of 5..

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

When I first played I though for sure it would be just another arcade-ish game. I was VERY wrong. Many things are near perfection. For example, Weather matters, Temperature matters. Other things that are realistic include the following:
1. The right lure/bait for the right fish.
2. when retrieving your lure, the right action matters. Walking, popping, stop and go, slow retrieve etc.
3. If you do not have the correct license, you will be fined!
4. You can snag your line on logs and rocks.
5. Even the color of your lure can make a difference.
6. If you're in a kayak and you hang into a decent fish, be prepared to go for a ride!
Now there is also some items that the game misses:
1. You can not tangle lines with other players (this is a good thing at times)
2. You need to mount specific reels to certain rods. (sometimes you need to add a casting reel instead of allowing you a spinning reel) 

Overall, the scenery is beautiful, The sound effects work are terrific. It's a great, relaxing fishing sim that will also prove to be challenging at times. If you're looking for a realistic fishing sim, I recommend this one. 8/10",1590436414,1590436414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Only fishing simulator I have played on PC, and I find it pretty enjoyable and relaxing. 
None of the DLC's are required to advance but they do make life much easier. 
Game does take some effort to advance to higher levels, which IMO is a good thing. 
Lots of different fish to aim for, as well many tournaments available to those who are interested. 
Over-all a pretty solid F2P game, only really feels like fishing boats (other then Kayak) are missing. 
Game runs smooth as butter, regularly running over 200fps.

In addition, most of the people I have meet in game are very down to earth real people.

This dynamic MMO was clearly developed by avid fishing enthusiasts for anglers to bring the full thrill of actual angling.

For now I'm stick with free play (You can play for Free no problems, but if premium, your life is much easier). I'm considering paying to help develop, just waiting new patch to alter costs that devs said, because now it's pretty much expensive for my point of view for and unfinished product, I can live with low lvl lakes and unlimited licences for that, but high level lakes need to buy with real money to be viable for playes that don't have much time everyday.

Devs are very active and make patches almost weekly, respond fast in forums/mail so it's has a solid base, but need tweaks to be more enjoyable long term.

Update Oct/2017: Was especting better response from devs and faster development. They done good job, but baitcon cost doubled for Brazil since my first review, I was going to buy... not anymore... cannot travel and freely play for 10min-30min a day without going banckrupt on higher lakes... started going to some events... can even get half way to the best (some cheaters?) players... so it's a no go for me anymore... it has developed to a RUSH/GRIND/SHOWMETHEMONEY game and not to a calm let's fish here or there game...

While it is ""Free"" it is worth investing in ONE DLC pack. It's not pay to win as such but it's too much of a grind otherwise.

Loved the game . I had payed extra for tournament gear and sports gear joined a tournament was awesome. 
Thought this game was so great that i paid for a lot of bit coins to buy advanced Fishing permits that were unlimited to several fishing areas . 
Now for the reality once you pay the large amount of money i paid . over $80.00 USD  you would think i would be able to play the game right ? since i bought unlimited to each fishing area ?   
    Answer     ((   Wrong )))  !!!!!!!!
You get paid for fish you catch .  the amount is extremely  low and the fish are not stocked well enough to pay for your trip even with the best equipment also when the game freezes or glitches while fishing you have to shut down your computer and go back you should be able to return where you was right ? Nope charges you again to enter fishing area . 
So you can't enjoy the game and go to several fishing holes to check them out without running out of game cash. this  is where im at now after Only a few days of playing now cant fish anywhere out of game cash so only way to play the game now is to buy their bit coins and turn them into game cash and no there is not an option to buy unlimited travel to any fishing hole you have to pay $100.00 United States Dollars to get enough bit coins to turn into game cash to try and play as you would like each month So if you have $100.00 a month to burn to play this game its awesome but if you are poor like me you cant play the game after $80.00 for a couple weeks play time you make the call is it worth it to you .
I have never felt the need to review a game you like it or you don't but this is the first time i have felt so violated as to the game sucking money out of you like going to an arcade, i felt i should worn people like myself that do not have this kind of extra income to play these sort of games. you should have this info before purchasing other wise your like me spend all of this money for a game i only played a couple of weeks and will never be able to play again total 26.9 hours of play time before locked out of ability to play anymore .",1499713849,1499716745,False,3,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,True

1) It's freemium, so while you certainly can fish, level up, and acquire new gear without forking out a dime, the progress is slow and the gear costs make no damn sense (why plastic bubble bobbers are the most expensive type in the game and require the highest level is beyond me, the things literally cost less than a dollar in real life). You're gonna be stuck with flimsy rods and low pound test for awhile until you build up some cash. I recognize that fishing is expensive, but if I'm going to be relegated to ultralight and light tackle for the first few levels, then rods, reels, and tackle shouldn't cost as much as a license and a fishing trip. 

2) Object scaling. Fish show up as tiny little things in the water until you yank them out from 2 feet away and then suddenly they're full size. Floats stay the same size (though you can change the size from small, medium, large in options) no matter where they are on the water so good luck with spatial awareness, and lures on the end of your line might as well not even exist because you can't see them while you're waiting to cast or while retrieving (even in the clearest water). 

3) Details. I crack up every time I see the shadow of my fisherman walking along trails, the sun at his back casting a long shadow through the woods.... and he's got no arms. Then he approaches the waters edge and the casting arm and its shadow suddenly materialize. Little details make or break great games.

4)Controller support. You can use a controller with this game, but there's no touch sensitivity to speak of. Tap the trigger to twitch the rod and your line goes flailing around as if you've just tried to set the hook on a lunker bass. Trying to aim can be a bit spastic, as your rod goes darting all over the place with no fine movement control. 

The free lake is nice, I've already managed to hook some respectable bass and unlock a few in game achievements. For it's flaws it's still relaxing and realistic enough to pass as a great fishing game, but then I feel like the fishing genre never really evolved past the old Bassmaster games of the late 90's....",1487727217,1489182658,False,0,0,0.499846428632736206,0,True,False,True

I have been playing for about a year and a half now,seen the economy change,seen the game grow and mature into the trophy it is today,with my experiance i can say i have felt ""hooked"" to this game,I am an avid gamer and I usually enjoy fast paced games,this game is my meditation,the atmosphere helps to disengage from the trivialitys of reality.
Engaging me into a welcoming paradise where I can enjoy the scenery and challenge myself to fish.
It is still in development and I can assure you that the developers care about there community,they promise to deliver and they Do.

Some people might find it scary trying new things out,researching new methods to fish with..testing the waters so to speak,i can understand people getting frustrated and upset,however that is the joys of fishing..you have to practise.

You can bobber fish,cast and spin for fish,you can enjoy fishing next to your friends and enter competitions for the chance to win real money,they are going to be introducing some different gameplay soon so hold on to your life jackets and try out this fantastic game.

I dont know how late game goes,however early game you can start at a free location and practice fishing there,eventually you can discover other locations and fish there to your enjoyment..

Have met some interesting people,the community is positive in game.
There has been changes I like and some I dislike however I am not dissapointed.
a bug and a glitch here and there,however that wont stop you from enjoying this simulation.
You might enjoy this little paradise.

overall I give this game a 8/10

33 hours in the first week I downloaded it.

I originally downloaded this game last year and after 30 minutes promptly uninstalled and didnt touch it again.
I recently came back and I see alot of complaints about price changes but I have been able to spend a very minimal amount of money to achieve maximum satisfaction with this game. Prior to the recent chagnes, I dont see how this company made money. 

All the negative reviews are about minor price changes on items. I have absolutely no qualms. You can still play this game 100% free as long as you play smart, read/watch tutorials and dont blow your money on trips you arent prepared for.

The game is a thing of peace and beauty. 
I have extreme anxiety and depression and this game really provides a quiet and welcome atmosphere. I lose hours at a time to this game. The atmospheres are tranquil and delightful. The effects on the lake are so realistic its surreal.

I came into this game after the most recent changes so I wasnt spoiled rotten with free days skips, but thats truly the only thing that is annoying and its a great way for them to make a couple extra bucks. There arent skins and the DLC is laughable at best. I dont see how a negative review is fair for such minor and necessary changes. 

The game is free, try it until atleast level 5. If you enjoy fishing or just want a game to get away from CSGO or another shooter... Theres nothing better.

The graphics are beautiful, the effects like bugs skimming the water are stunning, the background ambience is incredible, and the actual gameplay stinks. They spent so much time making everything realistic looking that it feels like they forgot to allow time for the actual mechanics of the game. If you throw your line in the water and a fish bites at it, you have to wait for quite a while otherwise it says ""strike too early"" and you lose your bait. If you wait to long, it says something like ""Strike timed out"" and you lose your bait. The actual window, it seems, for being able to actually hook the fish is around 2.5 seconds out of the entire ""strike zone"". Add to that that it's nearly impossible to buy anything OTHER than bait like grasshoppers and worms and such, and when you can, you can't even use it because you can't buy the correct pole for lures, the game becomes infuriating. Wait to download this game until they actually fix the mechanics and make the game more open. After all, why should I wait until I'm like level 50 to be able to buy a particular fishing pole?

Free to play but works best with a quite expensive premium account. As a simulation it's quite amazing with different types of fish having different habits, preferring different baits, and each kind can vary greatly in size. You really need to plan your approach and know your trade to be succesful. Definitely not that easy to learn and pretty hard to master. 

I can easily recommend this one, if you are prepared to buy premium, at least in the beginning, to level up a bit and have more fish to choose from.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
1. It's free so you can check it out for yourself. 
2. There are many different kinds of fish, including normal, young, trophy, and unique variants. Each fish has its habits and preferences so you can't use the same approach all the time, you must really tailor it accordingly.
3. While premium account really helps a lot, it is not a requirement as there is no way to simply buy levels or high-level equipment without hard work. Premium speeds it up significantly, but if you are patient enough, you will achieve the same thing. The main hindrance of not having premium account is cash - you really need to make your stay in each state profitable and this is much harder without premium account and lower prices for fish that you catch, especially on lower levels. 
4. Graphics are pretty good.
5. Community is really friendly and other players can tell you how they are so succesful using in-game chat. I have not encountered even one instance of real rudeness. 
6. There is a lot of gear to choose from allowing a lot of customization. 
7. You can always check which fish are available at each lake, along with what to catch them with.
8. There are a lot of decent guides on Steam and YouTube so you can learn the ropes without too much trouble. 
9. The game is pretty stable and I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs. 
10. I love the travelling system. You can't just go anywhere you please, you have your home state, and each trip costs some money - you really need to plan them well to make them profitable, especially at lower levels. 
11. You can still catch quite a lot of fish, contrary to most reviews here, it just takes skill and luck. I can catch 35 lbs of catfish in about 15 minutes, although I never really counted it, and I don't have a very high level, nor DLC or baitcoin gear. 

[h1]Cons[/h1]
1. There are some graphical glitches, like people warping across the lake, but nothing annoying. 
2. Premium account is pretty expensive.
3. Rooms are small, I would love to play with more other people, exchanging experiences and competing. 
4. Weather changes are definitely not subtle. 

Note - I do have a premium account, I bought baitcoins once, and own no DLCs.",1487403166,1487405781,True,5,0,0.603573262691497803,0,True,False,True

When I was playing intensely I set myself the goal of buying unlimited licenses for all the areas using ingame cash from catching fish which was very grindy but totally possible to do, now its baitcoins or whatever they call it to get unlimited. It had a well balanced economy, now I look at prices and my mouth falls open. 

The durabilty and pay to repair items is ridiculous, in the real world I have fishing rods from my great grandfather that still work beautifully with out having to ""repair"" them after fishing for a day, so I see no practical gaming reason for this mechanic. Sure I snapped a rod once in the 25 years ive been fishing, ten minutes later with some bamboo splints and string I was back to fishing. Yes I should get a new tackle bag, the one that was given to me as a kid is pretty worn out, But I think it will last me another year or two.

This was a great game once upon a time, a bit grindy a bit buggy but overall I was astounded at the promise it showed and laughed at other lesser fishing simulators.

A license that I ground for hours to obtain, now costs about $20 real money to obtain. This developer has essentially lied to their community through and through. I would not recommend this game anymore. It's not even fun with all the nerfing they have put into the game.

I used to really enjoy this one, in fact it was my go to game, until they ""rebalanced"" the game a couple of months ago. I could log on, kill a few hours, have fun chatting with folks and catching fish. 

Since the rebalance, it is nothing more than a grind game. And a slow one at that.

Heres what I used to  like: The game worked. rod and line physics were reasonable, i could catch enough fish to make a few in game credits and didnt have to micromanage.

All of that is broken now. the fishing line is like rubber. the rods are like slinkys. The fish don't bite enough to keep things entertaining. Costs are so high that i can't see how a new player would get anywhere. Heck I'm having trouble making the new economy work at level 38. And the social aspect is ruined as well. They added stupid 3D avatars that basically fill up every fishing spot and ditract from the experience. I can't turn them off, so I fish alone to keep from having <insert name here>'s arms and rod in my line of sight.

The devs have claimed that they fixed some of the issues by lowering travel costs at certain places and tweaking the physics. I don't see any improvement.

The way i see it, its a game. It should be entertaining, and this just isn't anymore. If i want to catch only six or eight fish a day, I'll wait for spring and walk down to my dock and do it in a couple hours.

The idea here is that if people don't know about the bug then you don't have to worry about fixing it. I'm guessing the devs hate me because I exposed the fishing mechanics that this game uses to spawn fish. Basicaly there are no fish in the water and one just spawns based on a dice roll from a few factors when your bobber lands. Moral of the story here is don't play buggy and broken games by money grubbing early access devopers who only care about making money and not about making a game that works.

Edit: I reached out to support about my ban and video take down.
Support (sent by *****@fishingplanet.com) 
Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.
You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.
Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.
This behavior is unacceptable. We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.

Me:
Not sure if you are trolling me again but:
""Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.""
First the bug was never used as a cheat but merely a way to go under the river. Second the developers are disrespectful to their community. Also I did report this bug on the forums so, no.  And again WTF are you going to try and arrest and sue me under? The CFAA? GL.
""You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.
Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.""
What is this contradicting bullshit? How can posting a bug on your forums be considered not telling the developers when you read and deleted the thread in minutes?
""We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.""
Go **** yourselves. Don't worry I deleted all that trash from my channel. I would hate to have anyone even think I supported a developer like you.

Pros:

- Very realistic experience
- Extensive gear customisation
- Beautiful scenery
- Social features (better integrated since recent update)

- Some items in the Shop can only be purchased using real currency.

I normally like to support devs that are working hard on making an awesome game; however, for a reasonable price.  It is not for casual players, unless you don't mind fishing at a single lake that my circle has begun calling noob lake.  Everyone in the game is now from Texas, and that is the only lake you can reasonably fish until you are at least level 16 when you can get decent sized nets.

I have calculated the cost of going to the next level location, which is Missouri, and it takes a minimum of ~20 lbs of the most profitible fish in the area, large mouth bass to break even, but only if you spend baitcoin (the in-game premium currency) to get an advanced license permanently.  The good thing is you can earn some baitcoin through achievements, leveling, and by logging in every day for a bonus (every 5 gives 1 baitcoin).  So getting these licenses is not impossible, just takes a loooong time if you want to stay free.

If you have plenty of time to grind fishing noob lake, then go for it.  If you really like fishing, get bored easily in the same spot, but don't have a lot of time to play (like me), then stay away.

I also see there is changes with the way the game has money. I have 32k.... cool, I spend 4k on a license and 11k to get there. 

Well - when I try to pull out a pole - none. So I go to inventory and find nothing. I'm now assuming everything is gone.Not happy. I try to buy a new reel at 12k and a pole...not enough money.

At this point, I'm really frustrated and irritated enough to quit and uninstall the game after a being around since it got on Steam. I bite the bullet and go home... only to find all my stuff there. Now I wasted all that cash.

I'm writing because I'm at the point where I finally frustrated and hope you guys can fix it - maybe return the in game money I started with.....if not, it's been fun and well, I'd rather spend $20 for the game and not have a F2Pay kind of set up and may look at the Euro fishing game. 

I wrote to them on Facebook and the answer I got was lame:

""Hello, every time you go fishing you have to make sure you have everything you need - from gear to lures etc, that works in real life, too.  We also stated in update notes that all gear has been moved to home.  Therefore we cannot do refunds, because nothing happened due to bugs. You can however go to a free lake and get yourself up & running there.""

I don't want to spend 5 to 15 minutes reading game notes of drastic changes. NEVER before did our inventory stay at home. We log in and our items were on our body and in our bags. Bad excuse. So - I'm uninstalling and will be looking at Euro Fishing or hell, I'll get a pole out in Minecraft and have a better time. 

What a shame. It's beatiful, relaxing and all that I like. This last patch for Freemium just blew it. Not going to dump money into another game like Planetside 2. I will pay the chunk ($10-50) up front and call it good from here on. Milking people for cash is lame anymore.

Yes the old version was better than the new one but only because the balance was there and had been put out of wack with the update, once the balance has been sorted which the Devs are fully committed to, the game will be back to where it was before but a whole lot better to play than the old.

They removed items from the game that I paid money for. This so called upgrade to the Heavy Casting pack, Its not a upgrade its a peasment cause they took the 660lb Fish Net out of the game so you couldn't carry as much fish and would have too end your day sooner.  Thats fine but dont screw with something that I paid my money for.  If it came with the DLC leave it and figure something else out. The amount of money it takes to travel too and making it back while there has become way more difficult but not impossible if your willing to spend the money. But the licenses that you have to buy to fish there is completely insane. Adanced Unlimited License for Alaska is 1000 baitcoins. In the Premium shop 1090 bait coins will cost you 49.99.  All I can say is WOW WTF!  WIth the introduction of the 3D avatar's, that causes even more problems. For example in Flordia there are 3 small T docks to fish from and when you have 5 or more people standing there it's hard to see. All you see are fishing poles and fish flying in front of you.  These are just afew issues the game has now, there are many many more. With just these examples you should be able to see where this game is headed.

I have seen many reviews commented on by the developers about how money needs to be put on the table, and that you can't expect it to be truly free to play without some sacrifice. I myself put food on my table by writing software, and take it from me, people that write software in this manner do not mean well. They think that you are a sucker, and if you continue to give money as they reduce functionality, then you are what they think you are and you deserve what you get.

The only way to change the outcome is to uninstall. Without a decent player count, the money supply is cut off. They have two choices at that point: cut bait and move on to another cash grab, or restore gameplay to a decent state.

I will gladly change this to a positive review if the devs come to their senses, but I doubt it will happen. Devs rarely change tact if they have a cash grab on their hands. Hard to change your spots once they have been seen.

Honestly, if this game were $5-10, it'd still be worth the price. It's great for casually fishing and having a peaceful time with friends. The game has the perks of both a fishing simulator (fish behavior is very realistic and knowledge about real fishing can apply to the game) and a fishing video game (there are certain places where fish can randomly spawn if you want that kind of stuff).

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Very easy to get into (no difficult mechanics, but there are ""hidden"" mechanics, discussed in cons section).
    [*]Not as grindy as other fishing games (still there, but it's a fishing game, so of course it's slow :p).
    [*]Very accurate, you can tell the devs know a lot about fishing and care for the game.
    [*]Updated regularly.
    [*]Relaxing music/sound effects.
    [*][b]Multiplayer is optional and enjoyable.[/b] (There's no voice chat and you can even hide other player models if you want, very nice mechanic in a fishing game. Alternatively, you can see where other people are fishing if you want to look for a popular spot.)
    [*]Tons of fish!
    [*]Huge variety of rods, reels, tackle, nets, everything. Very in depth when it comes to customizing your gear and tackle.
    [*]Wide variety of places to fish at all around the US and one location in Canada. 
    [*]Fishes' (?) habits affected by weather, temperature, and time of day. 
    [*]Appropriate bait and techniques also affected by the above.
[/list]


[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Retrieval mechanics could be explained more (or [i]at all[/i]).
    [*]Some things such as rod properties, usefulness of baits, etc. are not explained, which can be a source of ire for new players.
    [*]No boats, canoes, or kayaks yet, though the devs spoke about adding them eventually.
[/list]


[h1]Other[/h1]
[list]
    [*]There is a premium currency called Baitcoins (lol), but it is [i]mostly[/i] for things like unlocking certain equiptment early. They [i]are[/i] however the only way of buying unlimited advanced fishing passes (which allow you to keep any fish you catch, otherwise you have to throw back certain fish like trophy or unique variants). [b]You can still buy limited (24 real hour, 3 real day, week, month, etc.) advanced fishing passes using regular currency that pay for themselves very quickly.[/b]  ***At the time of writing, there was a recent update that overhauled prices. This lead to unlimited advanced passes becoming ridiculously overpriced, but another recent patch has lowered them again.
    [*]The fishing [i]is[/i] a bit grindy sometimes, but that's because it's a fishing game. The fun is supposed to be in the relaxed natre of fishing. (My two cents ahead). [spoiler]You won't find a single fishing game out there where you can just hop in, grab top level equipment after a few days of playing casually, and catch a record holding fish. You need to earn it.[/spoiler]
    [*][url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/steam_community_announcements/84840457402632025]There was an update recently[/url] that overhauled the game almost entirely. Due to that, most of the videos or guides you look for will be outdated.
    [*]There are of course bugs in this game, but nothing game breaking that I've encountered.
[/list]

Akin to a Hollywood movie, which having employed a quality writer, director and cast, is sabotaged by producers and editors imposing a 'lollypop' formula upon it. 

Having lost sight of the fact that fishing is the most popular sport on the planet, the producers decided to change direction mid project. Distancing themselves from an audience seeking a long term relationship they opened the door on a casual fling. This compromise will leave both the non fisher and fisher feeling unfulfilled. Great promise replaced by short term gratification.

‘Lollypops’, in the form of paid DLC, throw balance out the window. They provide a short term ‘hit’ for those not seeking a simulation, though hardly encourage any hopes of longevity for the project.

To continue the Hollywood theme. Here we have a movie which will benefit from a ‘Directors Cut’ sometime in the future.

Meanwhile, enjoy the initial free to play part and don’t grieve too much over the producers missed opportunity.  

Their loss, my disappointment.
