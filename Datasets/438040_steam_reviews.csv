It is an international web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with many other players. This game is translated into many languages, so there will be many Non-English reading players.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is light on resources used, so it will be runnable on any computer.

Has funny quest text and gear descriptions.  The artwork is cartoony and funny. Has varied weapon sounds. Has some animation.  Has a manual and official wiki in English.  Pretty Easy to play.  

The level cap is 600, but it will take you long time to reach it, very TIME consuming game.  (At my current hours, i have a 144 scout and 135 warrior)  Quests and other things take an amount of real time to complete or cooldown reset.  More time you put into it, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.

Mushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from quests rewards and gambling.   Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward.   You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount.   There is hourglasses that you can buy with gold for skipping the travel time on questing.

It has PVP and PVE.  It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you some edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. Difference in Level between you and target is a factor of success. You can make 2 characters per accont, picking one of 4 classes ( warrior, mage, scout, assassin).  Has an PVP Arena where you have a choice of 3 players to attack for gold, honor and xp.

You can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat.   Gear you can buy or get from quests can now be modded in the blacksmith shop and in the tavern watercloset. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are many other things that you can do to improve your stats.  

It has 31 dungeons you can unlock and raid.    Finishing Frost Blood Temple Dungeon, you unlock The Tower which gives you three companions (Mage, Scout, Warrior) to raid with through 15 harder dungeons that unlock with the Tower.  You have to outfit your three companions with gear to improve their stats.  But ends up having to wait for your level to catch up to the dungeon level.

You can make your own fortress, with some buildings that improve your character and other building for protecting your fort or raiding others forts.  You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort.  There is an Underworld that you can build and other players can raid. It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks.  Guilds have stuff they can build that increases gold and xp gain for guild members.  But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that Buys mushrooms.  You can increase your guild level also by completing guild house raids. 

The 22 plus servers are located in Europe somewhere (Central Europe time zone).  Devs keep adding more servers, which pulls active players from the established servers.  Leading a guild is easy but hard to get enough active dedicated players to reach the very top of the guild leaderboard.    

Try it, maybe you might like it.  You can play this game for free, and it keeps you busy several hours a day.

One of the better mobile games ported to Steam.

Pokes fun at common MMO motifs.

Complete afk-style timed quests that give your chosen hero xp, gear, gold, etc.
Join a guild and participate in afk-style guild-vs-guild fights and climb the guild leader board.
Compete in auto-attack duels against other players and climb a duel leader board.

Overall, winning relies heavily on time gated quests, joining the newest server is advised.

Fairly pay to win but still enjoyable as a f2p imo.",1487232097,1564023446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well first of all I was motivated to write this review(my first) by a promise of 5 mushrooms (in game currency)... (although it did say rate, so maybe I'm mistaken, think I got the mushroms though so I'll be a good sport and write something) *edit* here I would like to say that 5 in game currency is not much and the review is not positive because of this, it is positive because i really like this game hence the 55h+ game time*

First glance, I like this game, it's nice, it's casual and it helps me relax (except when it frustrates me, but it doesn't do it often so it's ok, trust me). The main components are questing (gold and exp grinding with a touch of gear drops), the dungeons (challenging oponents that make all the grind worth it), and pvp fights (for honor&glory, with honor determining the position in the rankings, I made up the glory part). There is the guild feature which allows you to socialize with different players and has it's own rewards. At this point I haven't accessed the full features of the game(castle and pets) so I can't say much about them. 
It's basically every rpg once you passed the main story and have only the grinding part left, except, here you don't have to actually run around the map, find distant areas, kill swarms of monsters, or push a lot of buttons. 

To keep the spoilers minimal, the initial progress is a bit slow but it gets fun and exciting afterwards. The quests don't require a lot of attention and I like this type of games since they can be played in the background(usually in the mornings when my brain is still booting). The in-game currency can be purchased but it is also obtainable from questing and other sources so it doesn't make such an great impact. I don't believe this to be an play for free but pay to win type of game since paying will mostly just speed things up but will not give you unbelievable boosts, and I don't feel like I'm missing out on alot for not paying (although maybe you should ask me on that in a few weeks from now when i get to levels where waiting is frustrating). As for that, quests have time durations and you can basically sit back and fiddle your fingers while the time doesn't run out. So if you are impatient types maybe this game is not for you. 
Battles are instantanious and while you do not actively participate i found the waiting and anticipation thrilling, especially when you are on your death door and hope the next hit will be a crit for win...

I do not have a lot of negative stuff to say, because the concept of the game is simple enough and at this point it has not let me down, I'm looking forward to the new stuff and features (level unlockable) and hope it will not let me down. Maybe a background story would be nice but then again I'm grinding clicker heroes so what do I know.

I am not a Chinese robot paid to write this review

Second of all if you run out of the ""thist for adventure meter"", which allows you to do quest, it does NOT regen on it's own..you HAVE to spend thier ""mushroom"" currency to refill it.. if you run out of mushrooms and exaust your questing meter and do not want to pay $ for mushrooms to play the game, it is literally done for you.

Many players quit it. I played a couple of hours to find out my character is stronger than 76% of players. That means many early quitters. 
I believe, most players quit ""Shakes and Fidget"" after first couple of days while finding it ""too slow"". 
If you have an urge to quit it too, think again. The problem is not in this game, the problem is in you. You are in a rush. This game rewards you for not being in a rush.
Enjoy it as you enjoy a nice cup of tea or an afternoon nap, You will feel good about it.",1485597567,1485597567,True,2,0,0.456863820552825928,0,True,False,False

I hope it doesn't notice this review as I rather not take advantage of that ?feature?. I find the game to be rather good. It has its glaring issues. The fact they think rewarding someone for leaving a good review is a good idea is just one of them. 

It has the sense of being a mp game. Though there is little actual player interaction possible. I enjoy the small level that is possible and find I interact with other players much more then I do in other games. Taking part in the pvp, guilds, etc. Which I skip in most the other online games I've played.

The pay model seems to be pay for convenience. As all I have seen that they accept realy world money for is to buy a currency in game called mushrooms. Mushrooms are given in game as well. There are even weekend events where every other quest rewards randomly adds a mushroom. The mushroom can be used various ways in game. Though the game has other currencies that it uses for things. Mushrooms don't replace those currencies. They might be added to them though, from time to time. There are a few things that can only be purchased with mushrooms. From what I have seen though those can all be gotten just by not playing the game for a extended period of time. As timers will take into account when the game is not running that is a valid option that I find myself using often.

It is best to play it while doing something else. As much of the game  involves waiting to be able to commit another action. I tend to play it while watching videos or playing other games that take waiting on.

The biggest issue I have with ""Shakes and Fidget"" is the stamina system. It seemes like I could do a ton of quest per day before I was worn out for that day when I was a low level. Now I am only level fourteen and can barely do a handful of quests before my stamina bar depletes. The only way I have found to refill the bar is to use mushrooms to regain a little stamina. That has a hard limit too. I can only use ten mushrooms a day for regaining stamina. Which means for the longest section of day I can't do quests.

Overall I find it to be worth playing. I strongly recomend it to people that have very little ""free"" time. Especially if they are able to play this while they are doing other things they need to do.",1485077776,1485213028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
