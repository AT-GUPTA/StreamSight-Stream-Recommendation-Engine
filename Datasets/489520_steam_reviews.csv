* NEW REVIEW *

TOTAL CRAP: half-dead, bugged and full of griefers as developers ignore player reports and feedbacks.
Like if it's not enough, they promoted to moderator a lamer who exploited a bug (just to give you an idea of how ridiculous/amateurish is the management of this game).
They are also trying to MONETIZE with Season Pass, even if they sell DLCs and life-time bonuses. It's probably going to be P2W.
Don't waste your time here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, since it's free to play, it's unplayable as there are griefers (and noobs) everywhere, but griefers are not getting banned, and they are not even improving matchmaking. Be sure while griefers don't get banned from game, that you get banned from chat if you tell something to griefers. So, not only you suffer injustices from griefers, but you suffer another injustice from betadwarf devs that ban you and not the griefer.
Like if it's not enough, they are releasing console and mobile x-plaftorm support to fill the game with unskilled players.
Here is an example of what kind of players they are not banning (he's intentionally inactive at max mana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja3kGo9O7TA
I'll rechange my review if they'll start doing something, but since i changed my review, nothing has changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** OLD REVIEW ***

One of the best free-to-play games i ever played. Much fun.
I followed this game since EA launch.

It's like ""Clash Royale"". A perfect mix between MOBA, TCG and RTS genres, where your hero is your base (every hero is unique) with abilities that you unlock by exping during the match, and your cards are your minions; they differ in attack speed, HP, movement speed, attack range, abilities, stealth, flying or non-flying minions. You are free to unleash them everywhere on your side of the battlefield, but not on the enemy side. Choosing good counters against the enemy minions is very important and positioning is important as well. The bridges of the arenas are two control points that generate exp over time, which is useful, as i said, to unlock perks but not only perks, as you go in ""Mana Frenzy"" (you generate mana much faster) when you hit the exp cap, and that's why the duration of the matches is never longer than 5-10 minutes.

I find that this game is well done under all aspects: good gameplay, humor and quality.
The devs are friendly and very active.

Is it Pay-to-Win? NO, NO, and NO. It's extremely friendly. Just play.
There are tons or free rewards, you can easily earn legendary cards, and there are no overpowered legendary cards, or be sure they'll nerf them.

Golds, Tokens and Shards can be earned by completing Seasons, Mayhem mode and Expeditions mode (which is a map where you fight to move ahead).
Also, you are rewarded with Golds by completing daily quests or by winning PvP matches as well. In Draft mode you earn both Golds, Shards, and sometimes Cards.
Golds are used to open chests with Tokens that you buy in the shop, but a card is guaranteed with every single Token. If you salvage a card, materials (Shards) are used to craft more cards.

In addition, there is a classic hero rotation (for those who don't own all heroes), and one free Token every day.",1494675962,1702950946,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

You will constantly be at a disadvantage in the beginning of the game because you lack the selection of cards everyone else has. The upside is you can buy some DLC that will help you but they are rather expensive unless you catch them on sale. That is not to say this game is pay to win because you can get the cards over time for free but you will have to endure getting beat down a lot until then.

The ranking seems strange and broken at times especially when you are trying to play team matches, you will constantly get paired with people who seem to lack basic deck building skills and have difficultly understanding game play mechanics. This can become rather annoying from Platinum Rank and up.

Solo battles are a wee bit better since it is all you but if you have limited cards you will be at a HUGE disadvantage. It is still doable but it will be a struggle, so be prepared for that.

There are various mini games in the main game also, some are fun and others...ugh.

Overall the game is FREE so well worth trying it out and seeing what you think. The most fun comes from Premade Team matches that you can do with a friend, these are what carries the game.

There are regular updates and the Derv team seems to care about the game which is huge in this day and age, at least on the PC version.

- Very well thought out game in terms of balance and variations on decks. Has clear flaws in balancing with such a large variety of deck combos, but still manages to be one of the best I've seen across all genres.
- Does an outstanding job for a PVP to make matches very non-toxic by restricting communication to emotes and signals. I found that it's much more laidback but still maintains a very high skill ceiling.
- F2P is an actual option here. There are obvious limitations in masters/legendary card deck builds, but the grind is actually attainable.
- Very fun and addicting, team battles, solo battles, mayhem and draft make for multiple layers of strategy for all characters.
- Global chat is active, and is usually funny or people flaming, but it makes the game feel more interactive overall.

Cons:
- Crashing. This game crashes more than any other game I've ever played.
- Adventure mode is straight fucking broken in hard mode. The structure is punishing and counter intuitive, with many of the encounters being actually impossible with certain heroes.
- Power creep is huge when it comes to the player base for two reasons. 1. There is no quick play or unranked option, making it hard to test deck variations that may not be as powerful. Testing decks is a risk for losing SR, that usually takes hours of wins/losses to accumulate. 2. Once you get into Masters and above, you start to really sense a change in the community. A lot of experienced players who have years of gameplay under their belt and every legendary can get you stuck in elo hell for a bit. Not a big issue, but there's also a ton more griefing and int'ing in higher elo that I've noticed. You can get pigeonholed into sticking with a meta/countermeta deck in most cases.
- Guild participation is rare. I haven't had much luck finding any active guilds.
- This game is littered with cheesy strats that just aren't fun to play against (doomcleaver, scrat launcher).

I'm currently taking a break from the game. I'm not having a lot of fun in Team Battles (cheesy metas) or in Adventure Mode (skull fuckingly difficult). I think it's a brilliant game though, and absolutely worth your time. You will have a couple of months of fun before any issues become more glaring, which is totally worth it in my opinion, especially for a F2P game.",1685596743,1685596743,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-

So far, sooooooo good.

This easy to pick up, difficult to master collectible card game is fast paced, frantic and FUN. The games last a maximum of about 8 minutes so losing doesn't feel like a waste of time and there are plenty of progession rewards to hold your interest.

There are currently 2 ways to play: 1v1 and 2v2. I personally prefer 2v2 but enjoy both.
There is also an expedition mode, but that is currently being changed in some way by the devs.

As the game is currently in alpha, there will obviously be a lot of changes, improvements and additions, but you currently have a very playable game that will hopefully just continue to get better!",1516355477,1676336369,True,7,0,0.570871293544769287,0,True,False,False

---
While I truly enjoyed this game, Update 60, 'The Visual Rework Update' has ruined my enjoyment of the game.

The Visual Rework has made the game more crisp, and defined with deeper blacks and shaper edges. As a result, the game has lost its cartoonish charm. Update 60 also changed the viewing angle and warped the players sense of unit sizes that we've become accustomed to. Its also introduced a wierd imput lag that feels like some sort of Vsync that is over compensating.

It's a good take on the genre and a great casual game. Easy to pick up. Each game lasts a few minutes.
At the core it is still a collectible card game, with some strategy on how you construct your deck based on the cards you have and then pilot the deck. Don't feel obligated to sign up for newsletters for gifts, you don't have to.

Good game to play as a free game? Absolutely. If you like the gameplay and want to spend some cash to support the Devs, then I would recommend you read some guides on where to get the most bang for buck. Otherwise, it is perfectly good as a quick game in between daily life stuff or more serious games.

Updated Review:

I have been working around The Archer, he can be countered by a tank (high health) minion. The new updates have been keeping the cards reasonably balanced. The newest Master has been a lot of joy to play. I am looking forward to seeing who the next might be...

Updated Review 2:

The game has gone down hill. The updates are making the cards unbalanced to the point of a uninstall. The graphic issues have NEVER been fixed. Dead minions will ragdoll/strech the model. Masters now have true damage so it makes shield useless to them. I was looking forward to the new remaster.

Minion Masters offers players one verse one or two verse two competition taking place in small arenas. Players choose between different Masters with unique hero abilities. They then use these masters to summon collectible minions to the field. Once they‚Äôre on the field, it‚Äôs pretty much up to them what they‚Äôre going to do, so choose carefully.

Minion Masters offers several modes, standard one verse one and two verse two, one verse one draft, mayhem, expeditions, and solo challenges. In one verse one draft, players build their deck from a random selection of cards. During this mode, three loses means the player is out of the game. Mayhem offers different rules every week. Expeditions are the game‚Äôs story mode. And solo challenges allow players to practice against the game‚Äôs AI.

To progress in the game, players will need to learn how to utilize their masters as well as unlock or craft an increasing number of minions and spells.

Minion Masters promises nearly constant new content, with the developers adding new things all the time, including events and cosmetics. 

Minion Masters taps into an unused format seen in free to play titles, let alone gaming itself.

Over the time I have been playing, the developers have systematically destroyed what used to be a great game. With their lack of dealing with the real issues of the game, and focussing on money grabbing, they have now a very broken game. Constant disconnects, a useless reconnect feature, horrible matchmaking and a toxic community. Betadwarf stated that they wanted to go down the ""friendship game route"", but with MM they have failed.

The card selection is to vast and only a few cards decide a game, ones that get spammed over and over, and a far to OP (Nyvirs breath for instance.) This highlights a very unbalanced game with the vast number of cards, just useless. 

If you want a game of endless hours of frustration and feeling like you are getting nowhere, this is the game for you! If you want a real game with great community and balanced, then try League of legends, by far outstrips MM.

Original Rreview:

A very interesting twist on a combat card game. I really like the representation of card play as characters (minions).  Its fairly fast paced game, with most matches ranging from 1-7 minutes. Great for getting a few matches in, whilst on a coffee break.  The graphics are outstanding and i think the dev's have done a good job with the sound, voice overs (which are a good giggle) and ambient music/sounds.  There are a coupla drawbacks with crashes and network timeouts (annoyingly during an epic ""we are winning this"" games). But the dev's are always working to improve things under the hood, and have regular content updates to keep ya coming back for more.",1575368387,1607986346,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

UPDATE: New cards that are introduced in each season are strong (too strong) and others get nerfed. So if you want to stay competitive you have to buy season pass. If feels like this is slowly becoming Pay2Win game.

Quality game with really nice graphics and lots of different minions to choose so you can tailor your own deck to play.
Minions are unlocked with Gold, Shards or Rubies. Additionally you can spin gears which will unlock random minion. All this can be purchased with real money (it is F2P game after all). One could argue that this gives paying players advantage, but I don't really see it that way (it only boost's their unlock progress instead of grinding and they could buy some fancy skins).
At the moment of writing, there around 200 minions in game (but at start you only get about 20 if I am not wrong, rest of them you have to unlock through progress).
You get daily challenges that are sometimes interesting to solve.

BUT, when game starts you get RANDOM cards from ones that you picked.
So you can use only 4 cards at the time and this makes it a lot luck based game. It is impossible to create deck which will suite for in most scenarios, you can only hope get opponent which has weaker deck (and/or less luck) than you.
Additionally, if you reach higher rank with only weak cards, you won't have fun at all (you need to unlock stronger cards if you want to counter some tough combos from opponents).

Minion balance might be questionable. There are some cards which I never saw that anyone played simply because they are too weak.

Been laying this down several times now whenever i¬¥ve reached my BS threshold, just to come back and get more annoyed at the devs months later. The game ""used"" to be very rewarding, but constant very poor decisions slowly shifted this into a mess.

If you are new to the game and haven¬¥t played anything similar, you won¬¥t get dissapointed. It is free, so you may aswell try it.

Update 2019:
For whatever reason i tried it  again, and who would have thought - constantly shoveling more untested garbage into the game did not improve the experience. Piling up more and more Cards just to lure players into the game lead to the expected powercreep, so if you want to be competetive - you better pay up and buy the recent busted season cards for double the price.

Until the next season comes around, stuff gets nerfed down to the ""normal"" value and new busted cards get introduced again, that you can buy for double the price. Welcome to economics 101.",1501806650,1574963490,False,2,0,0.52944028377532959,0,True,False,False

We were looking for a simple time waster while we waited on a group of friends playing some other game we didn't care for.  I've been hooked every since and have spread the love to many others.

The basic concept of the game is fairly simple, build a deck of cards that you instantiate into the arena.  Those cards (minions/spells/etc) then autonomously follow their developer coded instructions in eliminating other minions or making their way to attack the opposing master(s).  The deck construction mechanic is fairly straightforward where you attempt build a deck that takes advantage of synergies between the cards and your master's powers.  It won't take you long to realize just  how easy it is to steal decks from other players.  When a strong meta emerges, fully two-thirds of the decks you face will be so similar as to be identical.  Most of the remainder will be decks setup to counter the meta.

For me, the best part is taking a deck and becoming comfortable enough with it that you can counter strong meta decks or even decks that take advantage of the weaknesses of your deck.  Achieving victory from an underdog position through superior play is a blast.",1572996673,1572996673,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Quick (most games are less than 3 minutes.  I have been crushed or crushed others in less than 30 secs.)
Fun
Easy to learn
Consist of deck building skill AND;
strategy and tactics during the game as you and your opponent summon and send minions at one another.


Cons:
-Cost.  $20 for the premium be be too much for many but as the early access has progressed, I am begining to see great value it..  Sure, it is gonna be f2p.  But the want to spend money will probably be strong.  Why?  Because it is fun as hell!,and:

-the earning of ingame currency to craft new cards and buy new masters is a tad slow ( I have 100% bonus for a year from premium account, that helps.)


Good game.  I like it.  I want to play against you in it.  I used to think the $20 premium account was high, but now I am not so sure, as they continue to release new cards, masters, and constantly balance and hold events. 

update:  Game is still fun.  Real money is not needed.  Like many games, it is mainly pay to speed shit up.

You might say, ""[i]another one of these Multiplayer-Tower-Defense-Games[/i]"", [b]but you better watch your mouth![/b]
Minion Masters takes this genre and adds great graphics, many cards, and with it, various strategies, as well as the ability to choose a hero, who has different abilities to support your minions on the battlefield!

In short:
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Fun (50%)
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Graphics (10%)
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ Sounds (10%)
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ Polishment (30%)
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ Overall (4,3‚òÖ)

[b]Fun:[/b]
Alright, so, I agree: Other people might not give a full five stars for the fun of this gem - uh - game, it depends on you and if you like the genre! I, for myself, can say that I had alot of fun!

You basically play a hero, to be more precise: a Minion Master, who spawns minions to let them fight for victory. Which basically means that they fight to destroy the enemy tower, or die trying. The various amount of different cards and the seemingly endless card-combinations make this game quite attractive for competetive players!
You'll be put into leagues, so there is a matchmaking in this game, which will make you face enemies, who are (hopefully) around your skill-level.

What really boosts the fun is that the game doesn't support the levelling up of your cards, you'll never fight a level 9 dragon, while yours is still stuck at level 4. matter of fact: The balancing of this game is basically great, there are enough ground and air units and also enough buildings.

The only things that actually count negative towards the Fun are the bugs, but yeah, more of that in the [i]Polishment[/i]-Section!


[b]Graphics:[/b]
Graphics are not really important for this kind of game, as long as you can distinguish the different units you have basically done a good job!

But that wasn't enough for [i]BetaDwarf[/i]! They actually implented great graphics to this game, and released a graphic overhaul, after they worked enough on the polishment (see ""Update 60 - Looks matter"").


[b]Sounds:[/b]
Sounds don't really serve a big purpose in Minion Masters. They basically just work towards the authencity of the battlefield, and imho it does a bit of a difference!

But what actually gives the game an extra pluspoint in sounds is the commentator, who gets triggered at the beginning, at the end and in the running game, if something important/amazing happened.


[b]Polishment:[/b]
So yeah, this game offers quite a bit already:
- Guilds (and special events for these)
- Mayham-Mode
- Matchmaking (1v1 and 2v2)
- Expeditions
- Single-Player-Mode

Updates are coming in regular intervalls and they improve the polishment of the games in many regards: Balancing, additional modes, overhauls, etc.!


[b]Overall:[/b]
To sum it up: This game is great, if you liked Clash Royale and wanna try out another Multiplayer-Tower-Defense-Game on the PC with more cards, better balancing and (imh) better graphics, try this one, you probably won't get disappointed!

Also, it's free right now!",1553108617,1553108678,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game is easy to understand, the strategies become more advanced as you progress through ranks so you won't be overwhelmed as a new player.

All that being said the upper tiers of the game are absolutely dominated by people who simply paid more for the game.

Pros:

- Free.
- [b]Not pay-to-win[/b], this is a very important point. Many reviews claim that this game is pay-to-win, but top tier players can reach top 1-5 with almost only basic cards.
- Very quick battles, often over in under 5 minutes.
- Good card variety allowing for different strategies.
- Your deck consists of 10 cards, and your hand of 4. This means you can quickly cycle your deck, and the game revolves a lot more around skill than luck of the draw, like other card games.
- Next to no RNG. Some cards are pure RNG, but they're a gamble you chose to take. The only RNG that's forced on you is the initial hand and draw. Some decks rely on a single card that you buff / heal, if you don't draw this card first, this can be a problem. However, this is also a risk you chose to take. You can make a versatile deck that has an answer for almost everything, so any draw can be useful with those.
- Looks great, and sounds nice.
- Draft mode and 2v2 if 1v1 isn't your thing, this means you can play with a buddy.
- You can customize your arena, as well as your master. There are also emotes you can use while in-game.

Cons:

- Some balance issues, as is often the case in PvP games.
- You need a good computer to be able to run it on max settings.
- Not a huge playerbase, this means you will see the same people often. This is a bad thing for some people, a good thing for others.",1502009493,1550772251,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Great game, like heartstone or Clash Royale but much more balanced. Has 1v1, 2v2 premade and 2v2 random different ranks. Its still on development so thats good, has room to get even more better. Easy to twitch with it and does events that helps Twitch channels to get more people with event keys.

Everyone was spamming harbinger, after everyone spammed crystal archers and escort, there was a time everyone had dragonball in their deck because it was most broken thing and they nerfed too much afterwards, now it's wolf among us. Dragonball meta was the worst thing in the game, nearly every deck was rush deck.

 But generally speaking game forces you to play around specific cards too much, it's always been like this. If some cards are unbalanced, then all you can do is put them in your deck so you can be even. There was scott meta, prowler meta, upgraded prowler meta... All we can do was put them in our deck too so that we can play.

 2v2 is unbalanced and I don't think they'll fix it any time soon, since problem is with the hero skills. They have to make different hero skills for 2v2 or I don't see anyway they are gonna get fixed. All the hours I put in this game, I learned to counter broken or just let it go when a broken combo is against me.

 I don't really think that game is p2w, far from that actually. I nearly never use legendary cards in any of my deck and I can easily go into Grand Master with some grind. But to understand a cards weakness, best way is using them in your deck so, having every card is always a plus.  Btw, I nearly have all the cards in the game and I never bought anything with real money.

 Other than these factors, game is okay overall, there are not much competitive games that I could really enjoy playing for this long. But after sometime it feels really linear, every season/meta you only see 10-20 cards being played in total. And mostly people just take 2 or 3 of the broken cards and fill the rest of their deck with basic cards.

The game is extremely easy to pick up and play. The develepors have described it as easy to play but hard to master, and that is very true. There are a lot of subtle nuances to how each card plays and you can only figure them out by playing more and more.

[h1]The Mechanics:[/h1]
You have a deck of 10 cards that you can customize outside of a match (just like in other TCGs). When a match starts, your deck is shuffled and the top 4 cards are dealt to you. When you play a card, it goes to the bottom of your deck and is automatically replenished by the top card. Apart from just seeing the 4 cards in your hand, you are also able to see the next card you will draw. Thus, you have some control over crafting the state of your hand and making combos happen more than once in a match.

You can get new cards by using power tokens in a roulette-style gambling system. Power tokens must be bought using either gold or rubies. The only other way to get cards is via single card offers that change on a day-to-day basis (usually cost rubies but occasionally some high gold cost offers do come up). For example, 1 random legendary for 16000 gold. So, make sure to save up some gold for those offers once you have a sizeable collection. 

Along with your deck, you also get to pair a Master with it that represents your life points in the game (always starts with 3000). Each of these masters has 3 perks (abilities) that are either active (card(s) added to your deck) or passive, and are unlocked during the match when you maintain control of the two bridges in the middle of the arena. There are 9 masters as of this review (12-20-2018), and one more might be added by the end of the month. You can acquire masters by spending either blue shards (earned in-game at a steady pace) or red rubies (must pay $$$ to get enough).

[h1]Lots of game modes and events:[/h1]
In the beginning, you have to get through a short tutorial before you gain full control of the game itself. By level 9 (i think), you unlock most of the game modes: draft, mayhem and expeditions, along with the basic battle and team battle modes. Pairing up with another player is extremely easy; it only requires you to be steam friends with the other player.

The devs always have something new going on in terms of events. The events usually have 3 different houses, each of which has 15 keys associated with them. If you collect all 15 keys for a house, you get a legendary card. Keys can be earned by winning prize fights, which is just randomly determined at the start of a match, and by using streamer keys (watch out for those in the global chat!).

[h1]Pay to Win?[/h1] [b]I don't think so.[/b]
I got to Master league without paying anything with quite a few supreme rares and a couple legendary cards. I played so much last month that I got upto level 75 in the battle pass with only two season gold stars. I had earned 1000 rubies just by way of in-game rewards then finally coughed up 5 bucks to get 200 more rubies to purchase the battle pass. I got so many rewards at once (33 season tokens lol), it was beautiful. This is one of the most balanced free-to-play models i've seen in a while.

This update has just skewed the game completely into a cheese fest. 

How? It's centered around that ""Bats Bats Bats"" card and dropping either Commander Azali or the 8 Mana Ram+Cleaver. It's completely dominating Diamond+ team battle scene.

It just does not feel good right now to feel shoehorned completely into a cheese strat. My buddy and I have not lost a single game to those running the older, more conventional decks. We drop the cheese and you just sit there and watch the opponent unable to do anything AT ALL.

The other part of the problem? It's extremely expensive and luck based. It's incredibly strong if you have Legendaries to back it up, such as Commander Azali, Xiao Long's to counter spells, and the new Season legendary, Bahra the Witchwolf.

Don't even get me started on that guy. Not only does he root every single ground unit when you first drop him, but I've used him to solo Brutus and several other minions nearby. He can hit the ground and sky units at the same time and move his laserbeam around to the next unit if it kills someone. 

My personal strat is to use him, the new Grasping Thorns card, and the Snake Druid to stop enemy pushes dead in the water. This combo punches WAY above its weight class in stopping power or equivalent mana exchange. I haven't run into too many people doing this, but I'm putting my strat out there. My buddy will just follow up and drop a Commander Azali with the Bats card and now they're dead. Boom, easy climb. Unless we get out cheesed! lol

Other strats I've seen rely on black holes and Xiao longs because your knee jerk reaction is to pop spells. But if you drop the combo right, there's just too many minions hitting your base to effectively do anything. Pop a spell and you'll die to dragons or whatever follow up they've got. If they've got a Bahra, rest assured he'll just clap whatever you drop in a last ditch effort to save yourself.

All good right? I'm winning the majority of my games! Nope. I can't help but sit here and just feel absolutely horrible for my opponents. Can't imagine how much it sucks to lose repeatedly to this cheese. I'm just thinking that if I didn't get lucky with my draws (as well as my buddy), I'd be writing a review from the other end of the table.

This isn't really a skill battle that feels rewarding.

You ever play certain Mayhem setups, get completely creamed by the good players that know the perfect deck strats to just sail to easy victories on the mode, and  pray they win fast enough and get out so you can have a fighting chance? That's what the normal play feels like right now. There is no hope for ""Well, maybe these guys will finally be out"" on the main ranked ladder. You're either in or your out.

Honestly, this is such a painful review to write because I love what the devs have done with the game...until this update (I'm also annoyed because Steam didn't let me copy/paste my original text, but I digress). I'm going to try hard not to get all doom and gloom here, but I cannot help but feel that the longevity of the game is threatened if things remain as they are. Hell, I wouldn't even mind if that ""Bats! Bats! Bats!"" card got completely removed. That would solve the main problem right there!

I really don't think players will continue to play once it really starts to catch on that you're now shoehorned into one archetype to win your games (again, this is team battles. I don't know if it is the same in 1v1s). Perhaps you will read this and believe I'm being melodramatic. That's a fair judgment for you to make, and I'll leave you to that. But, at the very least, I'd appreciate it if the devs took a deeper look into what exactly these cards are allowing people to pull off. 

In the current state, however, I cannot recommend the game in good conscience. Not if you're looking to play with a buddy and get into the higher ranks (unless you get lucky with some decent legendaries). My buddy and I probably won't be playing as much until some things change. This just isn't very fun.

Particularly the Battle Pass soured me something fierce; it's heavily intransparent and does not inform new players properly about how it works or how you obtain rewards. In particular, nothing I could find informed that the option of ""buy Battle Pass"" in the store only granted me the most basic of access, and that I'd have to spend additional premium currency (or, you guessed it, a very hefty grind) to unlock further tiers. I imagine the only actually decent rewards are at the most basic level and at the very late levels, and you have to pony up a subtantial amount of cash to get to those later rewards.

really, give it a try! it is free to play, but for those who are serious about this game, some minor investments are neccessary: the premium upgrade, and the seasonal battle pass (i bought it once, after that i could buy the next battle pass with the rubies i earned during the duration of the battle pass). 
this game is no pay to win at all. premium and battle pass just accelerate your progression in cards an currencies, but there is nothing you couldn't accomplish without investing any money. it's a ""pay for being impatient"" ;) a got all the cards and masters (with decent glory), by just buying the two above mentioned...

the gameplay is amazing - easy to learn but hard to master! amazing to play with a friend! new cards and card themes are released with every battlepass. there are several game modes to play and adapt your strategies to.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this game! On sale it was less than a dollar..I don't even think I waited a week to bump myself up to premium. **Buy it!** Get past the bots(they must go until at least Gold) and really enjoy what the developers have going on. They do update the game regularly as it is still in Early Access, but the devs are doing good! A recent change to a card that was somewhat broken made it extremely reasonable! Now you don't see that thing in literally every deck. It's a competitive market, premium-feeling game for almost nothing. It's not even that unrealistic to get the highest rank but know you're going to battle the same 10 people right now...Sometimes like 5 in a row!! That might be a selling point to some but I wasn't a fan. There's a few avatars that still haunt my dreams.

It offers random 2v2, premade 2v2, and 1v1. If you're not into PvP, unfortunately there's not much going for you here.

Before i explain the game, let me just tell you why:

After three days i already have 75% of the cards unlocked, without paying any more money (just 5‚Ç¨ for the game) and i have almost all the cards, that the top players are using! 

Its a moba game, where you spawn minions and buildings and play spells strategically to destroy the opponent. There are 1v1, 2v2, Draft mode, Adventure Mode and Challenge (vs AI) mode.  The game itself is super fair, you just have to collect the cards (about 120 right now) and you cant level them up. On my first day i already collected 55/120 card and now, 2 days later i have already more than 80 cards in my collection, without paying more money  There are a few legendary cards that are harder to get but they are not neccessary, and u get 2 from quests and i already got one from a chest. 

The only thing you can buy are other masters, which give you some special abilities and basically defend your base. There are 9 different masters right now, and you start with one of the best ones already (They are all good and there is no ""best"" master, they just support different strategies). And there is a weekly rotation of 2 additional masters, so u have at least 3 out of 9 masters available at all time. After 1-2 days i got enough crystals from quest to buy TWO more, and i then i decided to paid 10‚Ç¨ to buy 3 more masters, because i rly liked the game and wanted to support the developers. So i have 6 out of 9 masters now, after 3 days and 15‚Ç¨ total for the game. You dont have to use any money, but getting enough crystals for the masters could take some time. 

The gameplay is AWESOME and you can try out soo many different decks and strategies and every game feels different. Some are RLY close and that are the coolest ones. 
Dont get fooled by the negative comments, its NOT grindy and you unlock the cards soo fast. Playing with friends in 2v2 and work out some strategies is super fun and exiting.

This may sound too positive but im super hyped about the game, you should just try it, its worth the 5 ‚Ç¨ and its even worth much more! :D

The developers were fairly swift in fixing the bugs/glitches I had personally encountered. They also seem to make an appearance in-game via chat every now and again, allowing you to contact them directly if need be.

People seem to highly discredit Minions Masters for its cons, yet make no note of the games pros. There are PLENTY of both. The game is still changing quite often, the cards people use are often changing too. The meta shifts in this game with every patch. They also release new cards and balance previous cards every so often, which of course forces the meta to change as well.

I've read some negative reviews in regards to ""leveling up cards"". This mechanic is 100% irrelevant when it comes to the cards strength, despite reading negative reviews for this (I don't even recall it being a mechanic in previous patches). Currently, powering up a card simply awards you more points for a victory if you're using the card in your deck. This point system is only relevant to the some-what new ""season rewards"" that were released.

You DO NOT need to spend money on this game to make decent progress, at least not at this time. Investing $20 will give you a boost of a couple of weeks, but other than that.. Yeah. I have personally only purchased the ""Premium Upgrade"" and have been set ever since.

Overall, it reminds me of a mixture between Clash Royale and Hearthstone, two games I've invested a lot of time and money in. If you enjoy either of them, you'll probably find enjoyment in Minion Masters as well.

This has become my go to game when I just just wanna have some fun at seeing things explode or using a spell to kill a large group of enemys. 

BTW if you play this you need to read the cards and cardtexts they are pretty funny ;D

There are cons though and though i feel that it isn't neccesary to have, there are dlc's that have to be bought that really do help to have especially after the last few updates. Those are the premium upgrades and the premium battle pass, both in which help you get resources, masters and cards faster. I will say the hard work you've done to grind something out is always less than what someone who bought the premium upgrades would have in half that time you put in, especially in regards to the battle pass, ALTHOUGH none of which affect ability or win rate so it's cool.

Its like chess in that u have to use strategy and defend as well as go offensive.  Lower cards are more quick but do less damage. Higher cards take a couple more seconds to use but they are usually worth the wait... unless your opponent is attacking you with numerous minions at once.  Different heros u choose have different special attacks that are incorporated in the match along with your cards.  Fun strategy game.... I recommend this game for a fun casual gaming experience. Matches last anywhere from 1 minute to 10 tops. usually matches are 5 minutes long.  after getting the game i have not spent a penny and i have a deck that can compete with most anyone.  it takes a lil while to get the hang of it but all u do is click on the right cards at the right time and your creatures will do the rest.  There are different choices for main character with different special abilities and skins too...all of which you can get for free just by playing ...and game is fun so playing is actually more fun than a grind.  I hope this game stays poplular so the ques to get into game remains at only a few seconds to find a match usually. u can solo or team with randoms which is actually super fun with the 2v2. but 1v1 is great too.

NOW for the Bad NEWS:

OK now its been months and nothing new except a couple cards. I want new characters with new card abilities and maybe rework some of the cards nobody uses.  its fun for a while but game is standing still right now which saddens me because this game is a blast to play....just not same stuff over and over. also if the characters had a bigger difference and or a skill that was actually useful that would be fun too. but really so many cards could be so much better.  now its hard to get enough cards for a deck that I like. when i first started it was fun but now i see 75% of cards are prettty unuseable.  I hope they update the cards soon... and make the characters have better abilities.... and add new characters we can use with different abilities.  like an archer character that makes all crossbow skills cost one mana less even. just something to make the characters more different and fun. so as of now this game was fun for a bit but due to nothing exciting happening i hardly play. i dont know. i do know its worth a couple dollars though.",1525499661,1530523424,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

matchmaking is somehow fast and fair even with a relatively small playerbase

there's still fairly typical mobile phone traps here though. the game is very front loaded with one time rewards associated with specific achievements and profile levels, and when you first start out the rewards come at a good pace. after a good few sessions, you'll have exhausted everything and what you're left with is a fairly long grind that will demand a lot of your time, one way or the other - either by pacing yourself out over literal weeks, or playing matches for a pittance of income.

card ""packs"" cost 1,000 gold. a win, even with the premium dlc upgrade, is in the range of 50-90 gold depending on a few factors. a single ""pack"" gives you ONE CARD. there are roughly 115~ cards in the game as of this review, and you can have 3 copies of each. roughly 3.5 hours of play will convert to a single card for you, after you've exhausted your quest / one time reward resources. even if you somehow never draw duplicates, that's already converting to hundreds of hours of grinding. the newest ""battle pass"" update provides more rewards for you based on the number of copies of a card you have in your collection for your current deck, which provides exponential reward increases for players that (probably) don't need them. Basically, the system is set up to get you spending money as soon as possible to bypass a very lengthy grind. other elements of this system try to encourage you to play every day so you don't feel bad about missing out on once per day lump sum rewards. it's manipulative as hell and i really don't like it.

a couple of things work in its favor. the basic cards are VERY high quality, and even people topping the ladders right now primarily use basic and uncommon cards, which you can craft with (relatively) little time or money invested. a playable deck only ever has 10 cards, and the structure of the game is balanced around only ever allowing you to keep two duplicate cards in this deck. even very high quality cards you will likely only want to run one of, so you're more likely to draw playable cards in any given situation. 

is it fun? yes. for a (currently) $5 entry fee, which also includes a bonus key you can gift to a friend, it's not too much to ask. it occupies a weird space where you and a friend can competitively play a tactical card game against 2 other people, which is a somewhat unique feature in this space. 

but the playtime:reward balance is so poorly adjusted right now, seemingly to push you into buying gems to get more card packs. i feel that a reduction in price for cards and maybe a slight bump in the cost of cosmetics would be a far more fair method of extracting money from the playerbase. hopefully we'll see those adjustments by the time they remove the entry fee - i would like to see this move farther away from a ""Free to Start"" model and more towards a ""Free to Play"" model.

I have since revised this review. The monetization is getting worse and doesn't really show any signs of improving. It's still fun and there aren't many options for this kind of game on PC yet, but at the end of the day it's becoming more and more like a mobile phone game, the exact opposite of what I'd expected or hoped. This is leaving themselves open to competition, anyone that can do the same but with a retail price or a better free to play model can probably take the entire market for this product. For now, it's still an okay game to try with a low barrier to entry, but if you want to take it seriously you are probably going to be forced to spend money to stay competitive, and the game doesn't even make you feel good for putting money into it.",1525662167,1529120059,False,9,0,0.548022031784057617,0,True,False,True

After a few hours I just realised that it's much more about strategy than having the ""Legendary cards. When you just start playing and learning the meta game, gold and rubies will start adding up in you account, just by playing. Each 1000 gold will basicly give you a new card (via Powertokens), and quickly you will start adding up in your collection. You can earn every card in the game just by playing, or even trading (for shards) and craft the card you need be yourself. Admitted your collection will grow faster if you pay for power tokens, but its not mandatory.

The game it self is really a ""rock/paper/scissor"" kinda game. Added to that there is the deck building aspect, and the sneeky ways to combine cards that makes this so much fun, and a really great strategy game as well. No matter what card your opponent throws at your there is for the most part a cheaper counter. And getting the ""upper hand"" in mana management is a big factor in beeing succesful.

I wont go into details on specific cards, but with currently around 100 cards in the game there a endless combinations of making a deck of 10 cards and see the minions battle it out  :)

Reminds me of an old game called ""Magic the gathering battlegrounds"" , and thats not a bad thing.

After giving MM another try i also had to change my review.
Expeditions were changed and are less annoying, at the moment there are only a few balancing issues left but balancing is always something that takes a long time.

I had plenty of good and balanced fights over the last days with only a few questionable masters and cards.

// EDIT END

I had to edit my review based on the Economy, the fun went downhill really quick after a few days of waiting for expedition ressources. 

For 49 cents i payed for it, i had a ton of fun for 61 hours.

Human psychology needs rewards to keep the intrest up and after the first week the rewards stall. 

You log in, the daily gives you some ressources to move in expeditions, you do a few matches and thats it, matches give way to less ressources to go anywhere.
You are stuck with the few cards you got and the time has arrived were you grind over and over with builds you don't like to hopefully get a card you want to use.

You can't blame the dev's, all trading card games have the same issue, you are limited by the cards.
I am not saying that you need ""legendary"" cards to win, i am just saying that being stuck to less then 50% of the cards is not fun, all builds look and feel the same without the options.

At the current state i can not recommend it with a headsup price of 5‚Ç¨ and on top of that an ingame store.

The cards are a lot of fun and the more you play the more you will understand that they have direct counters. It‚Äôs not a pay to win but a pay for looks because all the ""High"" lvl stuff is easy to obtain for free. They are also not that strong in comparison, some of the commons are stronger in fact. I don‚Äôt lose very often, and I have mostly commons in my deck where I play vs a lot of rarest. The current event is a ladder game where you chose a deck out of random cards and try to win. You get 3 losses before you need to start over, this however is a very HARD game mode. Personally, I keep getting high tier cards and lose quite often because the energy required to play the card is a lot, when the other player has multiple characters to counter my single one on the field... but even with the bad luck and challenge. it is still a very fun game and I fully recommend this game.


I feel like the developers have a LOT in mind for this game and I am personally Really excited to see what they do with it and where it goes! The current card set is a bit small, but it is still in the early stages of development and I‚Äôm sure there will be loads more content to come... I believe the playing field should be a little bit larger than it is now, and the 2v2 should be a person at each corner instead of next to each other. This allowing one person to die and the other to live to fight on. But to counter the death the energy increases by 2/3s so they have a fighting chance. It also moves them to the middle of the field instead of staying in the corner.  

But in the end, I do suggest you try it out for yourself because I really enjoy playing this game.

In my opinion it hits the sweet-spot between depending on lucky cards and creating strategies to take down your opponent on the spot, which makes it so that after playing the game for a while and learning it, you'll know how to counter your opponent's moves, even if the hand you got isn't the most suitable. 
After the beginning, there aren't slow moments in each battle, since as time passes (usually 1v1 games take from 1:15 to 10 mins), your cooldowns get reduced, so that you can create complete mayhem in the battlefield. And once you understand the game well, it's super satisfying to take down an enemy's horde with a single Grenadier, or open way for your Cleaver to deal tons of damage with each swing, or even hold on to your 100hp and manage to comeback in 15 seconds with an awesome combo. There are tons of strategies and deck possibilities, so you can try something new everytime.  Totally recommend giving it a try.",1524082127,1524082127,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I would say its more like Electronic Arts mail order monsters on Steroids. Reason I have not reviewed this game from the time I bought it was to give the company plenty of time to fix issues that involve modifications, things I like to do with my games. Id like to thank them for not banning me too. Its highly appreciated.
When it comes to modifying a game, NEVER modify a mmorpg. It can get your game banned, and possibly your steam account too. Only reason I modified it, was because when I purchased the game at the time, it was a cheap game I got with one of those 90% off coupons, and wasnt advertsied as an online game. When I tried it the first time around, I got slaughtered so made my modifications, and slaughtered every boss monster that was thrown at me. It wasnt till I got a message in the chat window I was going to be reported, that I found out I was actually playing against another player. I quickly contacted the company and asked for a reset. 
After that, they replied, and I gave them all information on what I had done so as it can be fixed so no one else does the same. 
[b][h1]Minion Masters is a great game. As you level up, you get rewards to modify what you have, or just buy new things from the store as well. There is even a shop to buy things with real $$ if you choose to, but its not required to play the game. This game is not single player, so please do not modify it thinking it is.

It boasts competitive deckbuilding, promotes good play and reactions just as strongly as good cards, and a wide amount of playstyles are very viable.  The interaction with real-world money consists mostly of pay-to-not-grind as opposed to any real pay-to-win, which I can appreciate.

The real issue, honestly, is the INTENSE learning curve, which I hope can be smoothed out somehow.  What you're not initially aware of is the fact that the baseline cards actually do allow you to deal with almost any situation, but you have to know 1) what the biggest threats are  2) how to play around those threats, and  3) what cards you have to include to deal with said threats.  Now I understand that may be inherent to card games, but this is a bit more 3-dimensional than just card vs card, stats vs stats.  With the addition of field positioning and real-time placement at stake, it's a lot of mechanics that can overwhelm a fresh player - myself included, once upon a time.  Also, 2v2's are a bit... hammy, but the game was designed initially around 1v1.

It's a very satisfying experience if you stick with it and understand it, though.  As I'm growing into a decent player myself, I have no deal-breaking gripes and mostly good things to say.

Pros:

(-) Micro Transactions
(-) Can get boring pretty fast

It's the same fundamental issue I had with Hearthstone, of which this is a clear (and probably superior) successor.

If, in Hearthstone, you played actual minions (instead of cards) that moved across a battleground and fought each other before attacking the hero, you'd essentially have Minion Masters. The same issues are very obviously going to arise - mastering the meta and collecting ""legendary"" cards is going to trump anything else. So if you can do those things, you will win, and if not, you will lose. The game board adds a small amount of spatial variation and reactivity to the formula but it's not enough to free you from playing by formula. You don't need to buy the in-game currency but you can, if you want to speed up your chances of getting better cards, more heroes, and some aesthetic upgrades.

The ""expeditions"" portion of the game is fun and rewarding. Here's where I have a suggestion. I would love to see this fleshed out such that it could constitute a full single-player (or co-op) experience without the necessity of grinding ladder matches to fuel your expeditions. The AI is pretty straightforward in the expeditions; it doesn't seem like a technical challenge to build this part of the game out to suit casual gamers or people who just like to have adventures with their friends.

I don't care about being stone or wood or diamond or fish tier or whatever. I don't want to fight battles against random strangers that much. At this point in my gaming life I can see the addiction hooks immediately and I'm grizzled enough to stay away from them. 

The real reason I don't recommend this game is that it's clearly designed to be addicting, and consequently to siphon money out of those without the awareness or willpower to resist. Plenty of people CAN use responsibly. If you're one of them and you'd like a well-executed CCG, go ahead, and enjoy yourself.

I can't comment on the overall balance of the game with my playtime, but I played ten or fifteen ladder matches and didn't lose any. I am pretty sure this is because I lucked out on my first spins with the ""power tower"" and got purple and orange cards. Maybe I just played against muppets.

The game is rather generous at providing the coin necessary to get another power token for an additional card. Also, the cards once found are none upgradable. That means a person spending cash cannot wipe a person to the floor with their upgraded versions.

There is 1v1 and 2v2. There is also expidition mode where you bring a chess piece around the map for additional gold and cards by using supply points received by leveling up and fighting battles.

I really didn't expect much from this game when I got it.
Minion Masters completely took me by surprise. 
You are forced to duel against npcs or players on a small field. 
The goal is pretty simple kill the other duel master but it has a fair amount of strategy involved.
Minion Masters is a very impressive early access game with a lot of potential.
I have only played the game for 14 hours and it has already become very repetitive.
The game only has a handful of masters and cards to pick from. 
Minion Masters only has one map with a few different settings for me this is the games biggest problem.
Addressing and fixing the lack of maps for this game has to be the first step.
Adding new masters and cards will also be a key issue mainly will players be forced to buy these cards or not.
Hearthstone is a major card based game but buying cards is a big part of the game.
Minion Masters will have to decide if they will also force players to spend real cash to obtain those cards or not.
Hearthstone will say players can earn those cards but they go so far out of thier way to restrict those players.
Hearthstone puts out insane OP quest on hardest setting with new OP cards just to force players into buying.
Hearthstone restricts players progress to further force them into buying cards.
I realy enjoy Minion Masters but if turns into a cash grab like hearthstone I won't stick around.
Giving players the option is fine as long as they don't start restricting and punishing players for not buying cards.
Minion Masters needs to add new bigger maps with new objectives and ways to fight then a few masters and cards.
Early Access so hopefully will we see a lot of new content in the future.

The game revolves in the Forced universe. Betadwarf has made two prior games, Forced and Forced Showdown. I have played extensivly Forced Showdown and had alot of fun with it. WIth that in mind I had very high hopes for betadwarfs third game, Minion Masters.

Minion Masters is the PC-variant of Clash Royale were players aquire cards (minions, spells, buildings) and put togethor a deck of 8 cards and battle an random opponent. The goal is to lower the health of the opponents master by 3000 points.

Tactics and counter knowledge is crucial to be a winner. All new players gets rubies, shards and gold because of the premium upgrade.

Shards are also rewarded in the same regard as rubies, but are not purchable and can also be aquired if by spinning the power tower wheel (it is where you spend gold to get a random card). If you get a dublicate card, it is salvaged and you get shards in relation of that cards rarity.

The game is still in beta and under heavy development and balancing. Some cards might be a bit OP. But players with OP cards that plays badly, looses very easily against opponents with common cards. Many people complain over others that have aquired the rarest cards in the game (Legendarys). But the first Master rank I know of (Master is the highest rank in game currently) only played common and rare cards wich are the two lowest card tiers except for regulars that are awarded during the initial level up process. WIth that said. Rare cards does not equal a better card. Tactic and the know-how to counter the opponents card is crucial.

THe single-player campin consist of 3x5 battles I belive and is lack-luster at best. These servers more like a tutorial for the player to learn the game and level-up so that you can get most of the regual cards before you get to online-fightning and raise ones battle-rank. THis is a bit sad since I am a heavy single-player player.

You get one Master at the beginning. Other Masters go through a free-roatiation system that you can play for free at those time. If you want to be sure to always play those Master you have to buy it with the in-game resources. A Master have diffrent attacks and also a perk system. By controlling bridges in the game you get XP that levels up the Master. Up to 4 Perks can be aquired where that fourth and last perk is always Mana frenzy.

All in all I'm happy and surprised how much I enjoy this game. Updates comes regualary and new cards get added with it. New Masters are gonna be added soon. The devs are very communicative and listens to feed-back. Nerfing and buffing is gonna be frequent in teh early stages, but that is to be expected in an EA-game.

(A tip to new players: Before you spend all your rubies and shards. Read forum and play a couple of battles and ask for tips. THat way you gonna know wich cards to craft and what tactic to use.

It's like clash royale but more simple. You have no archer tower, you only have one king(master) tower. You can choose your king(master) from a variety of kings(masters) and each of them have their own different skills. Also your lane and the opponents lane are connected by bridges. You will have control over a bridge if your minion is the last one there(standing or passing over the bridge) and vice versa. Controlling the bridge will make you level up faster. Yes your king(master) have level. Everybody start on level 0 and will start gaining xp to level up with the max being level 3. Each king(master) will have 3 skills and you'll unlock your first skill on reaching level 1 and so on. Your king(master) tower have more HP than in clash royale. 
Also, unlike in clash royale, your cards dont have levels, meaning your opponent cant have an advantage of having higher level cards.

TIP: This game is more of spamming your cards (units, spells, etc), because there's not that much space to let you strategize a lot (strategizing don't have that much of an impact on the gameplay, unlike clash royale). Also, unlike in clash royale, if you get swarmed, you'll most likely end up dead, so don't get swarmed. That's it.

- You start off with the most OP champion in the game.
- Game has above average grahpics
- Fun for the first few hours.
- Has potential, but I sincerely doubt the developers can steer it into the right direction. Hopefully I will be delightfully surprised in the future.

Cons:

- Pay To Win
- Leveling up in Ranked is incredibly easy, you stomp your enemy so hard you feel bad for them. This is the case until you reach a full stop. You get to a point where you just can't climb anymore because the tables turn and you get stomped instead.

Minion Masters incorporates many of the same ideas in a multiplayer environment, while adding in-app purchases.  

I'll be the first to admit, I'm biased against the ""Free To Play"" model.  Though from a business standpoint, it can be quite profitable if there is a substantial player base, it quite often simply milks the player for more money in the long run.  Should the player base die out, a substantial amount of money can end up wasted.  Being an older, more casual gamer, that simply isn't ""my cup of tea"" so to speak.

That is not to say this game does not have merit, there are those who clearly enjoy it.  More serious and competitive gamers who don't mind a possible long-term investment may really enjoy this game.  That being stated, more casual gamers are liable to be sorely disappointed, as I was.  

Bottom line, if you are a more avid competitive gamer that doesn't mind a long-term investment, this game might appeal to you.  On the other hand, if you are a more casual gamer, this title is not liable to be what you are looking for.

Rush decks have been changed, cards in general are  changed(not nerfed into oblivion like other developer handle such things) regulary.

Lots of problems have been addressed

Overall positive

I left the bad things in my old review that still stand. Deleted the outdated problems.

Old review:
In short:
If this wasn't free to play, it could have been good.
Its extreme slow in getting new cards after the initial phase.
And you need a good pool of cards to stopp different decks.


Problems:
1: Slowness of getting new cards:
1000 Gold per Card. a won match is 8 Gold (with premium upgrade 16 Gold). Losing gives like 4 Gold. O.O
daily quest give you one card. Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.

The other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.

Also you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer. 

In the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches. 
Then it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.

Obviously, if you do pay then you can get things quicker, but it doesn't really have any major influence on winning or not. I have been using a combination of cards that is mostly made up of the ones that I started the game with and have won more than I have lost. With regular playing and completing the challenges, you can build up a good deck and save shards and rubies to open up new characters and arenas. Obvously, if you are impatient and want to get everything immediately, then paying for the premium upgrade will help you to unlock all the main masters and some arenas. Some grinding will always be present in games where there are unlockables.

A lot of people have made the comment that the game is dependent on luck, which I don't think is entirely true - tactics can win the game. Spamming low cost cards will sometimes work, but carefully using the deck will get around this. If you don't invest time in the game, then it will feel superficial. Give it some time, try out new masters and card combinations until you find soemthng that works and then go with that.

The graphics are great, the animation is smooth and the community isn't full of people shouting obscenitites at each other. Gameplay is well paced and balanced - but it does take time to master.

A long time player who even made it into the top 3 of the global ladder this season:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=950681417

The basic concept of this game is ""Clash Royale"" - but this game has A LOT more depth to it, better balancing and very active devs, as well as weekly updates and regular events.

[u]Accessibility?[/u]
While a lot of bad reviews of - sorry to be so direct - bad & salty players claim that this game is pay to win, this game is truely not. I've made it to mid Platin with a deck consisting out of only basic and a single common (green) card which is accessable to anybody who played for 20 minutes.
Here's the deck (might be outdated when you read this)
http://steamcommunity.com/app/489520/discussions/0/1354868867706847916/
(Also - as you can see in the first screenshot - the top 2 decks consist of 8 basic cards)

[u]Variety[/u]: 
A lot of people at lower ranks complain about about low variety - resulting from bad players tendency to copy the same, expensive top player deck and wasting all their resources on something they don't need. At higher ranks however variety increases a lot. From gold rank onwards - and especially within the top 20 - the meta is incredibly fluent with everybody tweaking their decks against each other. 

[u]Summary:[/u]
This game deserves a lot more positive attention than it gets, it's simply that a lot of people see that this game's underlying concept is Clash Royale and judge a book by its cover instead of reading a few pages first. This game has a lot more strategic layers than other games under its seemingly easy surface and skill is getting rewarded incredibly well.

Also notice that while the recent reviews are mixed (because they had server trouble and a delayed patch ONCE in a year...) the game still has  2867/3507 positive reviews which equal a 81,75% positive review rate.",1481246516,1497900500,True,2,0,0.501915693283081055,0,True,False,True

Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some highlights and this game has more than enough potential, but the devs will have to actually bring it to that point first.

Obviously, with this game being an Early Access game means it's not complete. I accept that. Recently I was a bit discouraged when I ran across a bug and then found it has been reported 6 months ago, with a dev response stating they weren't planning on fixing. Rather, they sort of just accepted it as an unusual mechanic in the game. Since this game only offers competitive queues, thus pushing a competitive agenda for the game, I find it hard to support it given the dev's take on bugs.

Any bug, big or small, should eventually be addressed in order for a competitive game to be taken seriously. Due to the nature of competitive games, there needs to be balance, and game mechanics need to be as solid as possible. Imagine if some of the top competitive games on the market today had devs that left clear and reported bugs untouched and wanted players to just play around it.

Anyway, I suppose my biggest issue just seems to be with the devs and how I feel they have been and will handle the game. It makes me worry about longevity.",1495224234,1495224234,False,8,1,0.586122870445251465,1,True,False,True

The card system is just a grind for the current best cards. Current ""best"" decks make competitive play a boring, stagnant mess based on RNG because the game requires very little skill.

The gameplay itself isn't bad, but it's shallow. The game boils down to picking a card to play and playing it on a location. 

There are spells and minions. Minions can be flyers (making them invulnerable to ground melee units), buildings (meaning they're stationary and lose health over time), or building-focused (they ignore other minions except buildings). Spells are all variations on temporarily or permanently removing minions from play; some require basic MOBA-style targeting skills to use effectively.

Masters are the avatars you can choose to play as. Each has its own attack style (for defending itself when minions reach your end of the board) and special abilities (cards that are mixed into your deck, or passives) that are unlocked with in-match experience.

The board itself has two bridges (which give experience to the master of the last minion that walked/flew over them), a gap in the middle that flying units can bypass.

Each minion has its own quirks in addition to basic types (flying or not, etc.), but it feels like some are far more viable than others. This is given evidence by the dominance of successful builds used by top players‚Äî leaderboards can be dominated by a single deck until a new patch arrives. Which leads me to my next point...

Deckbuilding is the only thing giving this game any longevity besides its competitive leaderboards (which can be meaningless due to the current dominant deck). You earn pitiful amounts of gold by winning matches, significant amounts by doing daily quests (ex: win X times), and pitiful amounts of shards (card crafting ""dust"") by gaining more than 3 copies of any card. As far as I'm aware, the third resource, rubies, is limited to a few handouts that every player will quickly receive via achievements (ex: reach X competitive tier). Gold is used to buy tokens for a single random card, massive amounts of shards can be spent on new masters, boards (just graphic changes to your side of the board), and cards, rubies are used for masters and boards.

PVE is just a set of matches against bots. You receive set rewards for beating each bot match once. This was a major disappointment to me‚Äî I enjoyed the randomization and depth of Forced Showdown.",1492536190,1492536190,False,1,0,0.459098488092422485,0,True,True,True

-> more like ""Forced to Pay""

The good:
- very nice and polished look
- cool units

The bad:
- unbalanced
- tries too hard to be different
- some bad mechanics
- greedy pay model
- huge grind

I wish they would have stuck to the good old card game formula we all know with this one. The polished look is something I find missing in most other card games out there and I would be so hooked on this if it was just like any other card game - turn based and without a battlefield that units move around on.

However they tried too hard to make something different. Nothing feels natural, the slowly regenerating mana bar, the two bridge set up that allows whoever holds them to gain abilities for their hero unit, the placing of units on the battlefield. It feels like a bunch of different mechanics thrown together without them really fitting together. 

My biggest gripe with the game is how hectic is and that you can't control your units. The unit ai is pretty dumb, often you will see your units stuck on an enemy they hardly deal damage to while another enemy they could have easily defeated picks them off one by one. The developer says this is a game mechanic that the players need to learn but to me it was nothing but frustrating and didn't add anything to the strategic layer of the game. Talk about strategic, I think the developer tried to make it count where and when you place your minions and to a degree it works but the game is just too hectic and the battle fields are too small for this to really work. For example your units can be attacked by the enemy while they are still spawning, so you are forced to think about where to place your minions. The problem is that the battlefield is just way to small for this, which makes enemy minions reach your hero too fast and gives you too little room and time to properly do attack routes for your minions. 

And don't get me started on the pay model. It's insanely greedy. You earn between 5 and 30 gold pieces per match depending on if you win or not. It takes 1000 gold to roll for another card. You will often roll a card you already got multiple times. There are several currencies, shards, gold, candies... experienced f2p game players will know this is all to make you pay for the game. I think we all know these kind of ""free to play"" games by now that are addicting but only enjoyable if you pay. I don't think I really need to explain this further, it's not f2p done right.

Over all I can't recommend this game. The developer tries to bring in new strategic layers to the existing card game formula but at the same time takes away on the strategy part by not giving you control over your units and basically turning the game into a hectic clickfest that is normally decided by how lucky your card draw is.",1485025971,1485025971,False,0,0,0.456707894802093506,2,True,False,True

It plays a lot like Clash Royale but there are two bridges in the game you need to control, the longer you have them under your control the more exp you get which enables your hero to do get some skills. IMHO it's a vast improvement over the Clash Royale game because each hero you has a a distinct playstyle, this leads to a lot of varieities in decks you play against. One thing I don't like though is deck slots are locked till lvl 20, it's a pain to make decks or search for the card you want.

I find the business model to be both fair and a bit unsatisfying. On one hand you get a pack a day, there is dust to craft cards you need and there is a ""free rotation"" on heroes. On the other hand though, the ""pack"" is really just one card so buying power stones isn't that satisfying, once you have a decent collection good luck getting new cards as you will just get duplicates which will get dusted. I bought 10 power stones and got dust and a crappy card.  Another thing is you still need to buy heroes separately, of course you can also grind for it using freemium currency but this game isn't exactly free to play so why are we paying more stuff for heroes? If this is the business model then just make it F2P outright, they have a promotion giving out free steam keys for people following their newsletter which essentially makes this game free, but for the average Steam player who has no idea there's such a thing he'll be paying for the game, and then pay for it again in micro transactions. At least right now though paying $13 gives you the Premium upgrade for free so you're getting something for your money and players who didn't get a free steam key don't feel like they got ripped off. 

Even with these gripes though the game is still pretty good and addicting, I find it to be much improved version of Clash Royale both in mechanics and business model. I highly recommend it.

A game from the company that created FORCED (Superb co-op game with friends btw) and FORCED shutdown (Somekind of a card arena brawler, which TotalBiscuit enjoyed). Minion Masters has to be something different right? Well it is!

Minion Masters is essentially Hearthstone which plays more like a fast-paced RTS than a card game. You don't have turns, your only limiting factor is mana which replenishes over time. You only have 10 cards in your deck but instead of dissappearing after being used they are re-entered to your deck. You draw cards each time you spend one. The objective is to destroy the enemy's altar and master by using any means necessary. Matches themself generally last around 2-4 minutes and can be dominated in less than a minute as well.

The card types are minions, spells and buildings. The first two function similar to Hearthstone but the last one can be different. These are structures you plant on the map and they slowly decay while performing its' abilities. 

Instead of Heroes the game has Masters which each have a different passive attack (this essentially functions as your altar's defensive turret). Some attacks are small range ground AoEs while others are ground-air single target attacks etc... In addition the masters have other abilities which are unlocked through gaining XP during the match. XP is earned passively as the match progresses and also for controlling the two bridges in the middle of the map. These abilities range from adding new cards into the deck to improving the range of your ranged minions. The purpose of the abilities is to end the match and avoid stalemate thus they are very powerful. Each Master plays completely different and you must adjust your deck to favour that Master. Three of the masters are on the free rotation and you can purchase them permanently through crafting materials (earned by playing) or rubies (microtransactions).

Minion Masters is fun and fast-paced 1v1 duel game that has similarities to RTS and Card games. It shines compared to its' competition by removing turns and rewarding for quick thinking and fast decisions. Ever had that Hearthstone match where the opponent spends 95% of his/her turn every time? Well do that in Minion Masters and you are going to lose in under a minute.

PROs:

+ Easy to learn, hard to master. NO TURNS.
+ Short and intense matches (1-5 minutes), a single mistake or a good counter can turn the tide.
+ No casual mode, every game is a ranked game (exception friend matches).
+ 2-3 ""free"" cards each day by completing the daily. You'll get a decent deck running a lot faster than in other TCGs.
+ Card crafting + duplicates into crafting resources.
+ Rewards skill and tactics, higher rarity cards are not like legendaries in HS although still powerful.
+ Very polished and constant updates considering it is early access v 0.11~~.
+ FREE after launch (free keys still going around for EA).

CONs:

- Balance Issues (although very typical for ErAc games).
- Reliance on dailies: The game rewards you very poorly for playing (even with the premium option they offer). ~30 matches for a card with premium, ~60 without, dailies are worth 2-3 cards. So essentially you need to play closer to 100 matches with premium to equal a single daily -> Much rather ONLY play with dailies.
- Sometimes even too punishing, very difficult to come back after making a bad high cost play.

-----

If you are looking for a card'ish game without TURNS to play for 30 min - 1 hour a day then Minion Masters is probably the best and only choice in the market even in its ErAc state. You can play the game for free by getting a key from giveaways/friends or waiting until it launches. The 20$ premium DLC package allows you to play instantly with some additional goodies. While this might be a bit steep, after this purchase you most likely don't need to spend a dime on the game, ever.

It seems simple at first, you have a few cards in your deck, 4 of them in your hand all the time, you continously acquire mana which you spend to place them somewhere in the battlefield, then most of them start walking towards the enemy and they fight whatever they meet on the way. 
It's simplicity is deceptive, to be really effective one needs to know many things and make good decisions quick. At heart it's a game of countering as the trailer suggests, but to effectively counter you need to know the cards in the game well. On the surface it might seem enough to know which card is able to damage which, but in reality their placement and even the timing of casting them matter a lot, sometimes an effective counter is nullified just by placing it half a second earlier then you should place them. Of course it matters what cards you have in your deck as they can be built for synergy and also variety to be able to counter whatever comes your way, but in my limited experience how you play them is more important. 
It's one of the better examples of the easy to play, hard to master concept and a lot of fun for a game that you can play using just a mouse in a minute or two.",1482078818,1482078818,True,4,0,0.535128891468048096,0,True,False,True

I hope they continue to add to it over time as I love games that give agency through a selection of units.  Beta Dwarf really knows how to strike a nice balance in visuals and depth, giving their games a very distinct feel.

One thing you're going to see throughout all the reviews so far are that people really enjoy this game, despite not liking the payment system.  I wouldn't let complaints over the purchase model sway you away from trying it, though.  It's something easily changed and I'm sure they're taking that feedback seriously.

My suggestions would be:

 - Persistent elements of some kind.  Either per-player or even with the cards in their collection, still waiting for a game to go down that path and this seems like a great place for it to happen!
 - Clean up the UI when not in a game, having my arena is okay, but it feels cluttered at times.
 - Add polished transitions between UI-mode and actual game mode.
 - Add multiplayer modes where I can play with a specific friend, not just random matchmaking.
 - Add different types of and larger maps.  Not just the two-bridge design.
 - Clearly this game would be awesome on Android and iOS!
 - Address peoples' concerns over the pricing model. I'd hate for all these negative reviews to sabotage this title as I would like to continue playing it!

Again, these suggestions take what is clearly a solid concept for a game and would make it twice as compelling.",1480945462,1480985400,True,6,0,0.506597578525543213,0,True,False,True

The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale. So if you want to experience a good PC Clash Royale game, I can recommend this one for you :-)",1480862728,1480862728,True,13,1,0.498121321201324463,0,True,False,True

it has a lot of depth and customization that lets you play the game according to your own play-style, the matches are pretty short but can get very intense and there is a lot of comeback potential.
As a dedicated League of legends player I still see myself playing Minion Masters  in between league matches or in the late hours. it has the same competitive and addictive feel but is a lot less Taxing and quicker matches.

I like the fresh vibrant and funny style of Minion Masters and the reward system

This game is still in Early Access and even tho the core game play is great, I'm look forwards to the User interface and introduction to the game getting some more polish and clarity, more Champions would also be a Plus

all in all great game with a lot of potential for the future (and im picky with my games) 
think i would rate it 8/10
