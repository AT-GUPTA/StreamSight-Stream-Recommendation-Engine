Its has nice huge maps to play on and if you are in a good outfit it can be fun BUT 90% of the time no one works together or even follow waypoints they all just fight at one middle base to ""Farm"" exp which defeats the point of the game  , The Vanu (purple team) basicly have the advantage in most things eg  in hover vehicles and no bullet drop off . 
The Devs keep nerfing things in the game that people actually like and work hard at making it pointless to bother with anymore (construction).
If your a new player be prepared to be insta killed by literally everyone you meet because they all have asp lvl 100 Br weapons , your only hope is to join an outfit and try lvl up fast but then you have all the above to think about ! 
Countless times i get sniped or shot through walls and when i ask the player how? they all say its ""clientside "" meaning my connection to the server must be slower then theirs somehow ?
Devs took away the ability to revive Maxs making them a waste of resources to pull because engies rarly stay with them to heal them .

I can finally sit down and write a review for this wonderful, beautiful, like no other game. What makes this game so special? What separates it from Battlefield, or Call Of Duty. The quick answer, a combined arms game with anywhere from 80-90 bases. Each with its own unique layout, its own bias towards Defenders and Attackers. This is a procedurally generated nonstop battle. Is there ""meta"" to playing the map? Absolutely. However, no matter how good of a strategizer you think you are, there will always be moments when you lose control. 

This game provides you the tools to be apart of a much larger group known as a Squad, which consists of 2-12 players. From there you advance upwards to a platoon that consists of 13-48 players. All following their leader's instructions and working together towards a victory. When you grow tired of running in public squads and platoons, you join an outfit. This is where I would say the core of the game is centralized. Not to say you won't have a good time being a solo player, but playing with an outfit is a far different perspective. You see these people daily, you play with them daily, eventually, you begin to trust them, and coordinate with them, you know they've got your back, and you've got there. A level of trust is formed, now the entire squad trusts one another, they excel where others would have failed.

What makes this game great is the adrenaline of capturing a base with underwhelming odds. The taste of victory when all seemed lost. Drawing from the past, I can think of a moment where my squad (10 players) assaulted a contested base between 2 other factions, each brings 24-48 players. The enemy had vehicle superiority, air superiority, and outnumbered us 8 to 1. Under normal circumstances, this would have failed miserably. Due to the level of communication, trust, and to a degree skill, we were able to hold off this entire group, right down the moment the base captured in our favor. When that last second ticked over, we were all dead but 2 of us, and the enemy was right in our faces. That moment is what resonates in my brain. The pure adrenaline of battle.

This game is better with friends, yes. However, you will gain even more on this battlefield, some will be enemies, some will fight beside you. You will gain familiarity with everyone on the server. This game is a community. There's no other way of saying it. It has outliers sure, but it is a community-driven game that stands the tests of time. 

A closing note, I started this game back when it first launched in Beta. I am, to this day still playing, and in fact, alt-tabbed out of the game right now to write this review. There is no short explanation. This game is battle on a grand scheme, where movements of platoon and squads dictate the entire flow of the battle. Where solo players can make differences. Where outfits clash in all-out war. You will die. You will die a lot. This is Planetside.",1486091736,1581747944,True,4,3,0.535936415195465088,6,True,False,False

TLDR:  New player?  Talk, join a talkative friendly outfit, learn, profit.  Older vet?  Return, partake in battle, communicate with devs about issues, teach the youngsters to lead so you don't have to (as much), and satisfy your [REDACTED].

I finally got rid of my potato computer to play this game in high settings and it is great.  Where to start?  New player experience?  It think thats a good place:

What should I do when first loading into the game?

Take a few minutes to either go through the tutorial and learn the game.  If you don't you *will* miss out on basic mechanics of the roles, the weapons, and the team-play.  The jist of the game is that their are three factions fighting on a literal continent for control of territory and resources.  With that being said, it is three TEAMS, and there are no ""silent"" teams.  Learn to use the voice macros and text, if you don't have a mic and if you do, join an outfit.  Those guys have the ""salty vets"" with the knowledge and know how to sharpen and hone your skills even at the lowest level.

What about all the guns, and weapons that everyone has?  Are those guns OP and isn't it pay to win?

No and no.  The salty vets have unlocked very specific *SITUATIONALLY BASED* weapons.  Yes you CAN pay for the weapons, but you don't have to, especially if you learn to work with a platoon or a squad.  The cert currency is based more on how much you help your team.  Engineer and Medics are great for getting the first few thousand certs, especially at high pop fights.

Moreover, the starting weapons are the most among the most versatile.  If you can learn to shoot and move so that you are only taking on 1on1 or 1on2 fights (fights equally for or in your favor), you can actually outplay many weapons.

Performance and bugs, is the game buggy and what about content and community interaction with the devs?

The game is seven years old, so some of the textures show age, but the lighting system and the recently implemented Dx11 (""Aren't we on Dx12 now?"" Yes; little steps) give great lighting for cinematic and epic battles.  It is never completely bug free, but compared to some triple-A titles coming out, this is God-like.  The restructured Daybreak games have now officially designated a core team to take care of PS2 and have been doing a great job so far with the time that they have been given to resolve these issues.  As far as content goes, they just released a new ""capital ship"" that will have many, many functionalities at the platoon and outfit levels.  This also comes with a new arena for the outfits to compete in, so don't be surprised when we start to see a more ""pro-gamer"" level of play style come around.  I would say that there is plenty of content coming on the horizon.

H@X0rs?

They exist but are far from gamebreaking.

Overall review:
9/10


01/31/2017
The community that supports the teamplay make the game a fun and envigorating game.  The form of ""Instant Action"" play that drops you in the heat of battle makes it quite fun solo, but also nominates you a ""blueberry"".  This simply means that solo players tend to be harder to work with when it comes to strategy, but the community generally finds a way to handle this.  Another note:  This game is not for the faint of heart or faint of hardware.  This game, in order to have the best chances of fun and success, requires some $$$.  The huge PvP gameplay really stresses the system.  Nonetheless, the constant updates and the pretty good community, along with (generally) balanced gameplay, I would say:

Oh man, Planetside... Where do I even start with you?

Okay, let's start with the noticeable stuff first:
- The abyssmal performance:
The performance has been quite bad since launch. After years of patches, it still hasn't really gotten any better. The one trick they pulled was to label the old ""high"" settings to be the new ""ultra"" settings. I think you can see where this is going...
- The weapons:
A billion iterations of every weapon there is, with little to no differences between the guns themselves. Originally the factions were designed to have strengths and weaknesses. Now there are guns which every faction can use, which have no apparent weakness.
- The lags:
Oh god, the lags. Dying behind corners is pretty normal here. Also, other forms of glitching around, bad pop-in (like literally other players popping in 2 metres in front of you... yes, enemies aswell)

I could list several additional problems this game has, but I'm just tired. There is no hope here,



OLD REVIEW:

The game can be quite frustrating at the beginning until you get the ropes. Then it starts to be incerasingly more fun.

It may not be the most graphically stunning or on par with more modern FPS open battlefield shooters but it has it's own flavor with its varying fights. Although people whine and complain about P2W because it's a F2P game thats not true, all weapons are to be used in their own way and Environment. Cross faction balancing is pretty good, seems one faction has better weapons? They really don't, theres always a downfall between factions.

The NC are hard hitting and close quarters, weapons with a high damage but low rate of fire is their specialty. At distance they are weak but if they get close they hit like a truck. One MAX unit with dual shotguns can quickly make way for allied units behind it and clear out the most clustered of areas.

The TR are fast firing and large ammo capacity, their weapons fire faster and need to reload less, at medium range with controled fire these guys can easily become the lead flinging harbingers of death. One heavy can easily clear a room of unexpecting enemies in one long spray of fire.

The VS are fast reload and almost no bullet drop (Damage drops at range still), Their bullets travel straight so no need to compensate for drop and coupled with a fast reload to get that last needed round downrange, Watch out for Vanu snipers, they can easily drop a man from long distance without the need to take extra time to gauge how high they need to aim.

I've been on every faction and have heard the many complaints about other faction weapons being too overpowered, or their weapons too underpowered. They are just not using their weapons properly or don't know how to control them. Same with faction specific vehicles like Light Aircraft and Heavy Tanks.

Planetside is a good game to try and very fun to get into when you learn the game mechanics of bullet drop, bullet travel, Nanites, Weapon Effectiveness, and squad strategy. The devs were even nice enough to throw in koltyr which used to be a place for new people to get used to the game mechanics in, but now is a great place to test and understand new weapons.

The planetside community is still active, we just need new players to liven up the servers a bit more. Most of us are willing to help and there are plenty of open outfits for you to join.

6: Black and gold weapons are EXACTLY the same as their standard variant! They also cost real money.
7: Learn your Keybindings! It Helps Alot!
8: Pick smaller fights untill your used to the game mechanics!

2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :P 
So thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!

3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are   
1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.   
2) use the terain around you for cover.  
3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell   
4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.


P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.

P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics.

pros
Broke gunnies world record of over 11 thousand players participating in this MMO battlefield of a lifetime
3 different factions, i'll sort them by today's equivalent: russians, murica, and purple spandex
number of people on one map can reach max 2000 at once, battles for a base can have 48+ to many hundreds if its a techplant or bio station
4 continents to capture, faction captured ones give vehicle discounts to make vehicle spamming easier
can join outfits like the all so legendary P4LE (australian mostly) and FPS Korea (suspected aimhacks, always us purple spandex clan)
you have your different classes with different abilities to suit their role
bullet physics are similar in many ways and weapons include details about range/damage output
maps are large scale and there are 4 of them with varying terrain and bases to capture
use vehicles of different types providing their own benefit to your team
organized platoons and squads for better communication and objective completion
pay2win is not existant for every weapon/attachment can be earned free through ingame currency you earn as you play, and those that do cost money are just cosmetics for swagger and showboating.
premium account is cheap and gives you monthly premium currency you'd normally have to pay money for(for the swaggerous items or faster unlocking of weapon/attachments)
hackers are pretty rare and weeded out very quickly once spotted.
stock turrets are already pretty amazing
stock weapons still pretty effective
galaxy raids
c4 fairies (allahu snackbaring aircraft and atv's)
map is absolutely huge and there is no ""loading map"" like they do with guild wars, warframe, or WoW.
Platoon leadership is 85% competent

cons(just things you can easily adjust to mostly)
difference in servers can lead to difference in active player population depending on time of day so pay attention to location of your server and respective time zones. I use Connery server which has south korea/australia/ west coast america on it overnight and early morning. populations may seem tiny at first until you find the server that matches your daily schedule, in which case you'll start seeing over 300-400 people fighting on same map. mind you this is over small territory that they fight for so you won't be feeling lonely AT ALL.

runs on DX9 so don't be suprised if you have performance issues that would normally be unusual. It likes high clocked single core proccessing so your overclocked CPU like an i3/i7 series would run this amazingly butter smooth. currently using geforce NOW beta to circumvent any of this.

being an individual sucks, join a squad with high coercian (they actually act like team and have good leadership)
server merging now has some squads speaking foreign languages even on english servers :/
dark souls of fps, don't rage to hard over dying alot because everyone does, your all a bunch of well armed cannon fodder in the end.
lacks matchmaking so you will have absolutely skilled people on your server, though this means they can be on your side too so yeah :D
depending on your server it may be lacking in action in some parts of the day
people can act as moles and be helping the enemy through private messaging and 3rd party communication, watch out for these asshats.
takes a little while to earn the certs to unlock weapons free without taking out of your wallet.

being a pilot has a learning curve, just be very careful of how you move your mouse until you get the movements down. not very joystick friendly at first but can make a difference in a turnfight vs using a mouse.

infiltrators are assholes and so are anyone using magriders
being painted by 4x missile launchers tends to cause severe anxiety and happens often, so boom and zoom as a pilot don't linger ever. stealth and fire suppression coupled with increased agility is key for a good turnfighting and stealthy groundpound runs


overall it is an extremely good full scale war fps that takes off where box office game franchises like battlefield and call of duty have epically failed. 

oh and don't ever join chinese squads, they have absolutely no clue what they are doing half the time.

F is for friends who gun down eachother


U is for unOptimized


N  is for network lag you cannot play at all, but hey come on it's free.





4-503 error and You've been disconnected from the server get used to seeing that right now no rhyme or reason to that error sometimes the game works sometimes it doesn't.


First, I've played since beta and it was great ran fine was optimized decently balanced as well as it could be 
NOW daybreak has it and with a smaller team than soe and less money being thrown at it. it's gone to shit it chugs and struggles I even had to ugrade my graphics card like 


I had to upgrade my rig to run a game I could run fine, No seriously.
*update* 2months later runs like shit again because they fucked up the optimization again.


now I'm gonna bitch about balance cause well there is none.
I play vanu have since ps1 and we get the short end of the stick Terrans have bigger magazines and higher fire rate, New conglomerate has high base damage

We get less bullet drop, and since most of the fights happen indoors at close to medium range where bullet drop doesn't matter it's useless or if you can aim good like me it doesn't matter anyway. we're kinda punching ourselves in the dick by picking vanu(but I like the lore).

And since it's free to play you get hackers and not like oh that guy shot me he must be hacking you get speedhackers people warping around the map and lagswitching...and aimbots. also brazillians and russians have clogged it so get used to flash spamming teamkilling idiots who don't recognise colors and clear labels and the concept of trial and error.

This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.

Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms? Shit’s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!

The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.

The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue. 

Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals shits), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game.

      Planetside 2 is an online tactical shooter in which you choose to be a soldier in one of three different factions that are involved in an eternal struggle for various planets. Each faction must capture control points in order to gain control of the planet. There are 6 different soldier classes which allow for large differences in personal gameplay. Give it a try because it is free.

==============
-The best F2P MMOFPS

-Not pay to win. Tactics and positioning reign supreme. You can pretty much predict how a battle will end based on the terrain and numbers. All starting weapons are decent (except for vehicles).

-Fun, easy to join communities

-Air, Ground and Infantry on the same map

-Massive maps with hundreds of players, no loading zones

-So many unlocks, you will never get them all

Cons:
===============
-What's up with repairing in this game? It takes many shots to destroy vehicles and combined with powerful repair tools this leads to long, drawn out and just plain stupid standoffs where you are literally standing there and holding the mouse button down for minutes on end. You do this because it's necessary, but it's not fun for either the repairer or the shooter. I've sat with my teammates repairing our landed gunship while a fighter ran out of ammo trying to kill us.

-Long Time To Kill anything. It takes many bullets to kill infantry, similar to Halo. This leaves  you feeling unsatisfied after enemies get away from you time and time agian even after the element of surprise is on your side. This is true for vehicles as well. This also tends to make the game more ""tanky"" and what I mean by that is that whoever has the most health, be it infantry or vehicle will generally win.

-Bait and switch business model. You spend your time/money on perfecting a play-style or vehicle loadout and then the devs nerf the **** out of it, completely breaking it. They don't give refunds, so you're forced to buy something else or **** off. They do this because new players get rolled by vets that picked a play style and perfected it. In other words, it punishes long term players to keep short term players. It doesn't take a genius to predict how this will end..

-Occasional cheaters, not a big problem though

-MAJOR performance issues have plagued the game ever since the beginning. The engine is slow and buggy, and another game by the same developer failed due to this problem. That game was H1Z1.

-Updates are frequent, but every update slows the game down even more. You will need a top of the line PC at all times if you want to play this game. Right now, you need 16GB RAM, i5 or i7 with high clock speeds (3Ghz+) and a good video card. Next year you will buy a new PC or turn down your settings because this game will demand even more.

-The game needs to keep vets onboard, because they are the bread and butter of the communities. They run outfits, which make the game much more fun. Air drops aren't possible without organization. Unfortunately most have left after waves and waves of nerfs. The devs have made it clear through their actions that they don't value long term players and the game has suffered because of it.

Conclusion:
===========
It's a love hate relationship. I love it because there is nothing like it. I frequently think of reinstalling again after my last rage-uninstall. But then I don't because... I hate it because it keeps changing, sometimes backwards, sideways, but always more laggy.  I can't keep buying a new PC all the time. My PC runs 90% of the games available on Steam, and I won't drop $800 to play a free game. Also, not as obvious but a huge impact on the game is that vets have left the game a long time ago, something that makes me sad. The best times I've had were with experienced people that lead squads and used voice chat. Now there is hardly anyone because they all got burned out. Most YouTubers have stopped covering the game, aside from Wrel, a YouTuber/developer that only plays infantry, driving most of the recent nerfs to vehicles and air. I think he wants to turn this game into Call of Duty.

Still, Planetside 2 lives on because it sits uncontested in a niche. As soon as a competitor pops up without the performance issues, this game will finally be laid to rest, and not a moment too soon if you ask me.",1485611365,1489359338,False,0,0,0.501689493656158447,0,True,False,False

Once upon a time, gas-mask mooks took over the world.  The good news is, they were nice gas-mask mooks, and so created a benevolent Terran Republic that set out to colonize the stars.  They found a funky planet with wonder materials, but their wormhole was recognized by God as being a physics bug with the universe, so He patched it out.  Two factions split off, and thanks to the power of nanomachines, neglectful alien precursors, and someone liking Battlefield 3 a bit too much, we now have a forever-war that you get to play in.

Planetside 2 is a MMOFPS for both PC and PlayStation 4.  You can have [i]absolutely friggin' massive[/i] battles, in real time, with strategic elements in positioning, loadout, and what hexes your Empire controls on the map.  There's three Empires - TR (Terran Republic), NC (New Conglomerate, think United Space of 'Murica!), and VS (Vanu Sovereignty, AKA ""The Purple People Eaters"", ""We Love Spandex"", and ""Scientologists with Halo Plasma weapons"").

In this review, as usual, I'm going to discuss [b]What Works[/b], [b]What Doesn't Work[/b], and ultimately the [b]TL;DR[/b] for this title.

[b]What Works[/b]
First, the business model.  [b][i][u]This is easily the best free-to-play game on the market right now, bar none.[/u][/i][/b]  It's not pay to win in any appreciable capacity - paying just lets you progress more quickly, but even then, not in all areas, or in general.  You start the game with the most versatile weapons for your faction - some call them the best, but as you'll quickly discover, all weapons in this game are sidegrades that fulfill different roles, and can be customized to work differently.  There's many possible camoflage options you can buy to make a loadout unique.

On a related note, this game is highly skill based, in a good way.  If you die, you did not do something right (or your spawn room is getting camped, that does happen from time to time.)  The main mechanics of the game are standard staples of FPSes, and modern infantry combat in general - headshots, choosing good positions to fire from, using cover, flanking opponents.  Even if you have more money than sense and buy [i]every[/i] upgrade you possibly can, if you can't use them effectively, a BR 1 noob can - and very well might - headshot you into a quick rank-up.  

If you're not a seasoned FPS player, the game's structure has you covered: this is a MMOFPS.  You're not the only soldier on the battlefields of Auraxis.  You can earn XP through non-combat means (healing, fixing devices and vehicles, having squadmates spawn on vehicles, spotting enemies, the list goes on.)

Lastly, in its own, odd, frustrating, butt-clenching way...this game is [i]just plain fun.[/i]  I usually avoid nebulous terms like fun, in pursuit of things like discussion of actual mechanics, or cool technical features, or whatever.  I just can't understate that I find this game fun in general, though.  There's always something to learn and improve on.  I can always experiment with loadouts.  I can do troll-y things to amuse myself, at my opponent's expense - my favorite thing is running into a room as an Engineer, with the room full of enemies, drop an ammo pack for them to confuse them, then pull my shotgun and going to town.  It doesn't always work, but you can practically [i]feel[/i] the stunned faces on the opposing players.

[b]What Doesn't Work[/b]
If you have a weak system, I'd suggest getting a PS4 and playing on that instead, if that's an option.  Despite being 5 years old now, this game has difficulty running on my factory HP 500-217c.  You can drop the graphics to squeeze out better framerates, but with this game, you absolutely need reliable framerates for sharpshooting (a key mechanic).  If your system isn't up to spec, you'd be well-advised to pass.

Speaking of mechanics, this game doesn't teach them well at all.  The VR Room is a pre-purchase place to test weapons - it provides no training to speak of for the concepts you need to master to be competent.  On PC there is a tutorial for a fresh install, and it's woefully inadequate.  Part of the frustration with this game is that it does a crappy job of preparing you for the challenges you will face.  To resolve this, the developers need to [b]really[/b] consider the skills they require of their players, and devise better training and VR scenarios to help players exercise those skills, so that a newer player can provide a better challenge to their more seasoned counterparts.

Also on the subject of lack of information, let's talk weapons.  The information about weapons is highly technical, and nearly useless.  There's a YouTube channel for a person who was inducted to the PS2 development team, [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/WarpathWrel]YouTube Link: Wrel[/url], who has a great series of Weapon Reviews.  Unfortunately, if you want easy to understand information about weapons, you need to watch those, as the weapon details in the game are impenetrable graphs and stats, that miss critical pieces of information (recoil pattern?  Is it a full-auto, burst, or semi-auto weapons?  Relative to other weapons, how powerful is it?  What's the role of the unmodified weapon?)  I have to penalize the game on this count for the reason - and try to follow on this one - that if you don't include something in the game, and it's something I need to know, then you have made it harder for me to play or to get better.  To fix this, I recommend keeping the advanced notation of weapon traits, but also having the simple 'need to know' traits presented first, with the advanced details being able to be seen if needed.

The map design has problems.  It's very easy to get in a 'blitz-blockade' situation, where - upon losing a fight - you respawn at a base that is already under capture, with the spawn room (and the outlet where the teleporter leads) being already under blockade.  This is exacerbated by the fact that infantry has very limited ability to deal with armor, as far as I'm aware.  Put differently?  Armor is king; getting to an armor terminal is king.  To counter this problem, infantry needs tools to better deal with armor; additionally, bases need to be much harder to spawn-camp than they currently are.

Lastly, this game has serious morale problem.  People do play this game, and have lively battles, but if you listen to the Wrel channel above, or others, veterans of the game say that this game is flagging.  That's not to say 'Silence the critics!'  That's to say, you need to make this game noob-friendlier if you want to improve morale.  Being a MMOFPS, if the first M isn't true, the experience will suffer, and if the quality of the noobs isn't helped, it's not going to lead to good, memorable fights.

[b]The TL;DR[/b]
This game is an unquestionable [b]Recommended.[/b]  It's probably the only running MMOFPS, but it does what it does well, though not without issues.  The community is a good one, but is suffering because the game just doesn't help newcomers do what is being asked of them.  The monetization system is [b]very[/b] fair, and I think should be the gold standard of how to do microtransactions (contrast with Star Trek Online, the polar opposite.)

If your system can support this game, and if you can endure B.S. deaths, and if you don't mind watching YouTube because of poor/useless tutorials and training, then this game is totally for you.  Even if you can't endure those things, this game might well still be for you.  It's free, so give it a shot, I think you'll be impressed.",1488221053,1488233940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is in general good, massive fighting on large maps, lots of weapons, vehicles, but of course there is always a catch

first, you get basic weapons and you need to grind like hell to unlock others. There is lots, if not tons of stuff that you can buy only with real money, which is dissapointing, you cannot customize your armor, color of armor or weapons, that you must buy. Yes i know its F2P game, naturally there will be stuff to buy for real money, but come on, almost everything. 

If there is more weapons we can have on start, and that we can customize stuff without paying that would be nice, this game is big enough for both free stuff and premium ones. 

Now to say about each thing in game:

Weapons: You have large selection of Assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, machineguns, side arms(pistols), weapons can be customized, optics, grips..., you can even repaint them but you must pay for that, there is also cold weapons at least i saw knife.
Vehicles: There is several ground and several air vehicles in this game. Like for the weapons, they can be customized with different weapon packs, which you need to unlock. You can even repaint them, but again you must pay
While ground vehicle controls are more or less good, moving is clunky. Air controls are terrible, at least to me, i crash every time, well maybe i didnt add controls right, however in these few hours i spend i only play once or twice with air
It is shame that there is no mechas, walkers, that would be interesting.

Armor: several types for each of main classes but you must pay for them to unlock and customize them.
There is serveral classes in game, light inf, heavy inf, medics, engineers, inflitrators (basicly snipers), each of them having its own good and bad points and each of them having its own equipment. 
Maps: well i cannot say anything bad about maps, they are huge, but there is huge amount of players, but even with large number of players some maps are pritty empty, i love smaller ones, but it become crowdy if all thre factions are present. 
General: I like this game, its fast, intense, i could say real war. However you will get pissed really fast, there is lots of campers, snipers that love sniping from a far with advance equipment while you that just start marching around with basic weaponary. (there is a weapon trial every 2h or so, i recommend you use it when in game, every weapon (or most of them) are capable to try, actually only one every 2 h.), that is not so bad. 

I didnt saw any cheater, that is good. But lack of classes or mods make differences. You are thrown into the fry from beginning, with beginners like yourself and with people who have hundreds of hours in it, advance armors, equipment, weapons, in 70% you stand no chance. 

This game have lots of good things and again lots of bad ones. I first try to play this game when it was released two years ago, my pc was crappy then and i couldnt play it. Now i can, but do i like the game. no, not in this state. Game works fine, there is very little or no lags. Ok sometimes there is, but there are servers, for all regions, so chose the one that is closest. If you are from EU chose EU, not NA or Asian, otherwise you will experience lots of lags. 

Game lacks in dedicated mods. Everything in this game is simply capture that, defend this. Take enough points and your team wins. 
You cannot chose teams. Your character belongs to one of three factions, since i didnt really bother to remember the names, simply Blue, Red or Purple. Each with its own differences and unique weapons and equipment and story. So faction you chose at beginning will be with you as long as you play or until you decide to make another character. I dont know if you can change character Factions, doesn't really matter.

PlanetSide 2 have lots of players, so you would  never have problems with lack of players. and target:):), but game is rather difficult, you will die in it, a lot, but you will learn to play it if you really want to.

Do i recommended it or not. It is shame that Steam didn't introduce neutral option for reviews, i guess they will one day.

It would be unfair for me not to recommend t his game, and brag how its bad how it lack this, how it lack that, but if you like grinding, if you like fast pace shooters, with lots of people on maps, this is game for you, i personally wouldnt recommended this game, not in the current look. but il add yes for all those who actually like it. I play it simply for fun, as i didnt play shooters in years, but again, expect lots of hours in this game if you want to unlock something, and lots of money(real one) if you want better stuff.",1487956025,1487956025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I made an account a couple of years back and tried it on a friends computer but didn't have the specs on my own to continue (I know that's pretty sad).

And frankly, I am very glad that I rediscovered this game! It doesn't have the ""arena-batlle"" feel that most online FPS games have, which I personally find to be very positive. You are a soldier in a futuristic sci-fi setting on very large maps and are participating in not just a battle but a war! Just remember one thing... you will die and you will die very often. Don't let that get you down.

 As I am quite unexperienced in FPS games I think it is a very good testimony to the game when I say I'm having fun playing this despite having a K/D of around 0.15... Yeah I know I'm a noob :D

Another few positive aspects are:

- I'ts free! Who doesn't love great free games?! I may or may not consider buying a temporary membership sometime just 
   to throw some money in the devs' faces to let them know I like their game.

- 6 soldier classes with special abilities. Have to get used to that fact that the abilities can be used very frequently!

- Lots of customization. You can choose between many upgrades in almost all apects of the game.

- Surprisingly large variety of vehicles that play a big part in the wars. Very fun to share vehicles with your squad. 

- Starting weapons are good and it is very possible to compete with players that have better equipment. So I wouldn't say 
   it's P2W

- Last but not least: a very friendly community. It is after all, a game built on teamwork.

As of now, I can't really complain about anything because the only thing that sucks about this game is my lacking skill but I'm working on it ;) 
So I definitely recommend this game. I already got 4 of my friends to play it with me and I hope to have more fun!

- The concept
- The factions 
- The possibilities
- The pew pew of lasers
- The vehicles
and so on...

But I did quit playing it because of several gamebreaking issues for me
I cant play competitive or without rage because of:
- The lag compensation 
here a really good video about the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3fUok2AoaU

- High ping players everywhere who make the above even worse

- Server performance

- Still many fucking hackers

I was hoping for years now that they will fix it.

Pros:
- Free
- After a short, but detailed tutorial you get deplouyed straight into the action
- Great community
- Extremely epic large scale warfare across miles and miles of land

Cons:
- Little bit of a learing curve, but after you set your keybinds it's pretty simple
- The older community makes the people that have played for 2 - 3 years gods among newer players
- They ask for you to purchase credits and memberships a lot because this is an older game and they need the community to help keep it up and running",1487771888,1487771888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.

INGREDIENTS:

1 c. unsalted butter
2 c. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. flour
1 c. cocoa powder
4 eggs
1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella
5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbled


DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.
4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)
6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)
7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.

Despite what some people are saying in their reviews, It is not pay to win. The guns that all classes start with are very good and in some cases, the best overall guyou can have. 

You can purchase in game currency to buy new guns, but they are side grades to what you currently have. The trick is finding the gun that suits your style. You can also purchase skins, camo, helmets and even voice packs (Arnold Schwarzenegger ftw) as well. They are all purely cosmetic/for show. 

The ""camouflage"" you can buy is also purely for looks and really doesn't help you hide, you just look cool. 

I've played both in outfits and solo and both can be fun. It's easy to get into the action quickly by using the map or you could just hop into a vehicle and drive wherever the hell you want.

I had FPS experience before I started to play PS2, mostly just casual gaming with various titles from the genre. Sadly I got spoiled too much of the scale that it is difficult to go back on those. The only reason I will play other FPS games too is to have more competitive and very controlled environment to try out own reaction times and skills in well known titles.

If you are expecting very polished and smooth experience with always balanced and fun fights, then PS2 might not be for you. There has been ups and downs during the game's life time, but dev team has done their best to keep the players satisfied.

At this point I want to say that put the game already to download, because it takes a while, unless you have limited data plan or small storage. Otherwise there is no reason to try out, except if you are easily addicted or do have unsupported operating system. Some of the older computers will have performance issues, but my oldish rig is doing fine with competitive performance.

What can you expect from the game:
[list]
    [*]You will die, many times, all the time.
    [*]There are people who have been playing this game since beta and they know every minor detail of their favourite weapons and good locations to kill you. But don't worry, there are also same people in your team, who will probably save you before you get in danger zone.
    [*]Game has cross faction textual chat for the area you are fighting, so expect to see people cursing how sad other team is by bringing too many players in the fight to break the population balance.
    [*]Some people don't have legs so they just sit in their vehicles all the time and try to shoot infantry with easy to kill cannons if they aren't in real danger.
    [*]Maps are quite huge, but usually the killer is hiding nearby even when the shot comes out of nowhere.
    [*]According the chat many people have RTS background, specially from StarCraft and from zerg faction.
    [*]You can play alone or be part of a squad of 12 players, which can be part of platoon of four squads, which can be part of some outfit public operations to run multiple platoons. Depending the situations you are alone or there are 96+ friendlies with you in same fight.
    [*]There are no matchmaking or any custom game etc. You are in your character in one of the five servers, in one of the four continents (not counting Koltyr the new player training ""continent""), in one of the many bases. There will or won't be enemies or friendlies, but you have all the right be in there.
    [*]It is very confusing at the first, because shots coming from all over the place or from nowhere. There is an in-game map, which you can use to navigate in the fights (think as joining a match).
    [*]You can get all the stuff with the in-game currency you get by playing the game. Only the swag and character vanity are restricted to DBC, which you get only with real money.
    [*]Weapons are ""sidegrades"" so that they specialize in certain roles, like gaining firerate by losing damage, etc.
    [*]You might get fully upgraded vehicles with swag from veteran players if you ask kindly.
    [*]There is no Pay-to-win, but you can buy XP boosts and premium membership to get more value out of your in-game actions, which will make your cert (in-game currency) gain faster. Also paying players might have squad boosts, which will affect to other players in the group, so F2P players can get extra XP boost without paying.
    [*]There are three different factions, that have different style of weaponry. For new players some might be easier to start with, because more controllable, but over the time it is just personal preference which backstory you want to support. Spandex babes, teamkilling blueberries or oppressive internationalists.
    [*]Community can send own cosmetic creation to player studio to get them in game.
    [*]There is no PC-PS4 realm, so can't show the PC master race dominion to console plebs. (/s)

This game can run fairly well with 150v150(which is the most i've seen around 4 grids, however there are usually around 800 or so players on a single planet). 

Most factions have empire-specific things, you will hear the term ESF for example(empire specific fighter). However, some factions are also shared, such as the Valkyrie, Liberator, Flash, and some more which do NOT have empire specific things. The development and hype isn't as great as it was many years back, but don't listen to the guys saying 'oh its dying' it's not. not even close to dying.

You'll be able to get into a full continent no problem(although there will be 1 continent which isnt as heavily contested usually), and updates are still coming regularly.

Last I checked, steam discussions didn't have any moderation here, so it's no good to ask questions here(lots of flaming, bait, and trolls). Try their official forums if you have questons.

You will want some pretty good specs (i5 2400 / gtx 1050 / 8g ram) for example, and that will only give you 30-50 FPS on most firefights involving 50v50+. 

No reason to not install this game, it's free. Hell, I played it for 200+ hours running at 9 fps.

This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned. 

At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.

If Daybreak expect new players to join the game;
Study what builds and weapons they need to dedicate their certs to,
Grind experience through unconventional and unfun means,
All the while getting assfucked by their older playerbase.

you want to kill that ship, well you have to buy a gun for that

want to kill that tank, need to buy a gun for that

want to have people spawn on the point you made, need to buy upgrades for it to live long enough to get noticed

dont want to buy these guns? THEN (EFF YOU SEE KAY) YOU CUZ YOUR GUNNA DIE A BUNCH

""but the game has ingame credits called certs you can use to buy these things""

 Ya as long as you get a 20 player killstreak without dying, revive your entire platoon, then have another entire platton spawn on your spawn and cap 3 to 4 bases you might get onely 5 or 6 certs when everything in the Duking store cust a minimum of 650 to 8000 certs and you might as well not buy the cheaper ones since they do nothing to improve your gameplay

also your life is shorter than a stormtrooper in a fire fight with the main character no matter how good your aim may be so dont think getting that killstreak is gunna be easy

PlanetSide 2 came out five years ago and much has changed. From the old SOE days to now DayBreak, PS2 has changed somewhat substantially. There has been good and bad with every update and I should know; I admit I have a founder account and even played in the Alpha and Beta. This game has slowly and lethargically evolved over the years. While there are many that show disdain for the DayBreak I do not find them to be that horrid. Sure it feels somedays that the server population for Emerald isn't what it used to be (Remember when Emerald wasn't a thing and there were about three other servers/player account that got merged into it, I do.) but that does not mean that the game is dying, I keep running into new players every time I log in. Many of them are great and many are little sniveling CoD kids. The main draws of this game are and will forever be:

-Massive maps
-Massive fights
-Coordination/Teamwork
-Forward Operating Base/ HIVE building

I hope that this game will last for many more years as there really isn't anything else like it right now. I give the game a rating of 8/10, it's solid and I have stuck with it but there are still some old issues from the SOE days that were never addressed.",1486830576,1486833141,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

I recently had to restore my computer so iam gonna install it again right now and start playing again. Absolutely worth downloading it has everything you would want from a shooter and more. 3 empires fighting it out in one huge continent (huge fucking maps, not your call of duty or battlefield bullshit), Different terrains that suit different playstyles for example if you like playing pilot dont play on Hossin because its a dense jungle and you cant see infantry for shit. Hossin is more for infantry. Its pretty good for inflitrator because you can use the trees and stuff for cover. It has Exellent weapon customization and really gives you a veriety to choose from once you have enough certs (in game currency). By Level 10 you should have at least 1000 certs and that can get you one of the best weapons. Say for example you like playing inflitrator, by level 10 you can spend your 1k certs on the most powerful sniper for whatever faction you are playing as (each faction has different weapons with different capabilities). Each faction has different vehicles also. Last time i played there was atleast 500 players in the game and it was fucking mental. Its one of those games that just keeps on going. Huge attacks and defences, massive firefights, and just an all around great fps. one of the greatest i have ever played actually. idk if this happens on pc much because like i say, only having a few hours on record, but on ps4 there were a decent amount of team killers. They werent everywhere but they were numerous. In all the time i played on ps4 quite a few tried to purposely team kill me, some succeeded, but on pc it only happened once and it was an accident because he said sorry. So if you like a good firefight and you like big maps with many ways to play and contribute toward your empire, go and download it right now. start of in koltyr (the noob area, you are forced out at level 15 and cant go back) then when you are level 15 go and join everybody in one of the four massive continents and prepare to fight with and against hundreds if not thousands of people at a time. you can go to any continent at any level at any time as long as one of the opposing factions hasnt won and locked it down but it is better to start of in koltyr because it is smaller and there will be people of roughly the same level as you and you can gank some easy kills. (hossin, amerish, Esamir and indar are where the big boys play). Download, play and enjoy is all i can really say. If anyone Team kills you, i can assure you that he or she will get their comeuppance. Everybody is generally nice and play as a team really well. Every game has their knob heads, but on pc, i havent found any yet. just on ps4. You can also purchase helmets and cosmetics for vehicles and camos for your weapon or character using Daybreak cash or DBC (in game currency brought with real life money). But that is just cosmetics, The wapons and attachments are all obtainable in game with certs. (on ps4, by level 20 i had a damn good loudout, never spent a dime). And the vehicles are unlocked through levelling and you can use your spawn tokens to spawn them, the same as the max class (walking tank). These spawn tokens will recharge over time. So, there you have it, i could type more about the game but these are the basics, i dont have time to go into depth right now, i need to go play lol. Nothing bad i can think of apart from team killing noobs that i havent managed to find yet on pc but they will exist. Its a thumbs up from me and a solid 9/10 ( i would give it a 10 but the team killers drag that 1 percent down, ik its not the games fault but i refuse to lie). Like i said, havent found any on pc personally yet but i know they exist. But i gave the game a 9 because other than the team killing there is nothing bad i can think of right now.

I absolutely love it, but let me tell you one thing. NEVER run solo. This game can be overwhelming to lone wolves and new players. There are no spawn limits, so you might end up in a war zone with dozens of players, vehicles, and aircrafts swarming around you and you WILL die, no doubt about it. Yes, the graphics are a bit dated but that is ok, they need to be. There are multiple areas with over 2k players and it can bog even the best of systems down.

Pros:
- Multiple classes that stick to their purposes
- There is always action to jump into
- TONS of enemies to kill
- Buildable Platoon bases (completely destructable aswell)
- plenty of vehicles or aircrafts to ride in
- AMAZING dogfights
-Gives you a pretty good idea of what war used to look like (WW2 for instance) 

Cons:
- Sometimes to many people for some new players
- REALLY easy to die (can be considered a Pro aswell)
- Pay to Win (Better guns you otherwise couldn't get)
- Hard to keep good vantage points
- Platoon leaders tend to be easy to upset (at least from my experience)

I highly recommend this to any veteran or beginner FPS players as it works your reaction timing, distance judgement, and aim a lot more than other games.

I rate it 9.85/10 Would play again",1486613397,1486613397,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I've only ever played as Vanu so I'm biased but you can pick from two other unique factions. Each faction has strength and weaknesses. When you first log in you get a basic run down of the pros of that faction , so there is help in that regard. 

The customization is great, and you get six or seven player types (medic, infiltrator, etc) plus several ground and air vehicles to choose from (all can be customized). Plus your faction pays you certs every min so you can load out in a vehicle or Max about every 5 mins.

The game looks amazing and the immersion is excellent. From the sound of crickets at night to the roar of aircraft overhead, this game gets intense. 

Speaking of intense, the battles (good battles) can be down right nerve wrecking. Hundreds of fighters, tanks moving across the battle zone air craft raining bombs and bullets flashes of rounds from every direction, it can leave you exhausted after two or three long sessions. 

The game is also good about giving you good starter weapons. You earn certs for upgrades by kills, controlling points, overtaking bases etc. as you earn these certs (different from pay you get from your faction for vehicles and maxes) you can upgrade abilities, weapons. You can customize your character to excel at different things. Maybe you want to focus on taking out enemy vehicles, or you want to mow down hoards of other enemy - you choose... 

In my opinion this is the best mmo/fps out. Nothing compares to the massive maps (four or five continents) with snow, jungle, desert, and a multitude of bases. The mount of weapon and character customization options. The ranking system is fun and keeps you going, along with rankings and ribbons, and xp... Also it's free!!! I still can't believe it's free. 

So it took time but I love this game and have stopped playing anything else. This is however not a perfect game. There are log-on issues occasionally, glitches (after I play as a Max and go back to infiltrator my infiltrator no longer cloaks) but overall it is 100% worth the investment of time. Also spend time on watching videos about how to play. YouTube or in your player load-out screen they have basic training tutorials. So get out there, have fun and play with friends or just join a squad and work together ( this is key).",1486606969,1486606969,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

In freemium, the game is provided for free, but certain features are locked behind a paywall. In pay2win you pay immediate money to get ahead, buy buying weapons or skills that non-paying members have to grind for a long time to get, or cannot get at all. This game falls under the pay2win model. 

Its not skill based, its a ""who can find and shoot an enemy before they can see you"" type of game. Or whos weapon does more damage than the others in an equally skilled engagement. The anti-vehcile weapons are GARBAGE. It takes 10 anti-vehicle hits to destroy a lightning, which is a light tank. A single engineer can repair a light tank through a single heavy infantry (anti-vehicle). 

I have over 100 hours logged on vanu, I have 40 hours logged on TR, I was in closed beta. My vanu has 1468 certs and several unlocks, as well as a kdr of 1.46... which is not great but its certainly not bad.

I tried to take on a light little buggy, a car with a tiny little machine gun attached to it, in a mosquito, a vtol with the same machine gun. The buggy won in that fight, despite both of us constantly hitting the target (it was a stationary battle for god knows what reason).

I have used the NS annihilator, which takes 6 hits to the front of a vehicle to kill and has a 4.7 second reload. The S1, which takes 6 hits from the front to kill and has a 5.2 second reload. I have used the ML7 and ASP-30 Grounder as well, both equivilents of the previous ones I have mentioned, respectively. A basic repair tool can easily repair 1800 damage in 10 seconds or less. So yes, a single heavy Assault could never take down a tank, as I said.

The only realistic way to take out vehicles is to get into an anti-tank emplacement. Have an armored column of equivilent or more tanks, focusing fire. Or have 6 to 10 heavy assaults hitting the tank at the same time, with minimal misses on weapons that are extremely inaccurate at the realistic range you will be fighting tanks (over 300 meters). 

The NS annihilator requires 1000 certs to purchase, while a single alert provides you with around 50 certs. Lets do a bit of math for how long it takes to get a weapon now. Each alert can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple of hours. On average its 40 minutes per alert, with a big battle. In order to be able to unlock a rocket launcher at 1000 certs, it would take 13.33 hours to purchase one, on average... This is not including the 10-20 minutes it takes to go to the alert location... So realisticly, for those who have a life, you will be looking at a weeks worth of a grind per cert, or 6 dollars. So yes, pay2win does exist.

The base weapons can do a decent job, but other weapons tend to do more damage or have better accuracy than the base weapons. The ones you can unlock with certs are more situational, but they are better in those situations.

I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND A PAY2WIN GAME, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! The development of this game is so flawed, I will never give it a positive rating, nor a recommendation. The positive reviews are typically made by sheeple or fanboys who have not played better games. It is the only real mmofps on the market, but its set up in a way that is just piss poor. The original was slightly better than ps2, but not by much.

There is a reason this game has several low population servers and only one medium population server, the game simply sucks. Dont waste your time downloading it, go find better. Mind you the wepaon data is backed by the data from the planetside 2 website. This review was altered slightly to show that cistapade has very little data to back his statement up.",1486415485,1486583281,False,5,0,0.473737388849258423,7,True,False,False

So i complete my tutorial and join my first battle just a mere 100 each side , I decide very quickly im not a killer so i switch my char to an Engineer and start to fix stuff like tanks and gun implacments i also throw ammo packs down , Another great addition to this game is you can switch your char class mid battle.
The battle isnt going well and i jump into an anti aircraft gun and start firing , Before i know it ive shotdown over 12 enemy planes and my exp is shooting up , I then get on the ground with the rest of the grunts and start to fix tanks and guess what in the middle of the battle and people actually thank you for it.

By the time the battle was over which they seem never to finish i had enough exp to revamp my char give him more skills and abiltys so you actaully feel you have been rewarded.
In total i got 7 kills and 21 deaths and never had so much fun , A community that dosent roast you and is very polite and free to play at that.

In summary this game is amazing its not p2w as even your starting gear can kill a pro and while Daybreak do have a store in the game where you can by cosmetics and such none of it effects how you play really.

One Membership like 14$ amonth = all of their Games as a Premium, Which are 

Planetside 2, Dc Universe Online, Ever Quest 1 and 2 and i beliave that Day-Z Game they have, and their Currancy that you need to pay for with real money, also connected to all games, so you gotta think ""Should i pay 50$ For a bunch of points and spend it on one of their games, or spread it out to their other games, it would be nice to run around as harley Quinn (Custome wise) in their DC Online Game and have a nice gun or two in Plantside""

You have different type of classes which use different type of weapons. Nothing is pay to win as all other weapons can easily be got through playing the game. The only thing you need to buy with real cash is camo's helmets and other skins for vehicles. (which do not affect your stats in any way)

The vehicle play is amazing, you can go from footsoldier to tanker to pilot in mere seconds. I would like to recommend watching the youtube channels by Wrel (a dev of the game) and other players to see what it's like.

Even though bugs are be getting more common, you will only start to notice them after a few hundred hours of game play. 

The game has frequent updates where they tweak weapon stats, add new skins and features. The last big update was construction where you can build your own bases inside the game itself.

I would highly recommend giving it a try, it has a rather steap learning curve and if you join an open platoon they will help you out with most questions! (and it's free)",1485955328,1485955328,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is casically a mix between halo, cod, battlefield, wolfinstien, and a little hint of starcraft. There are three factions: the Terran Rupublic(TR), which is the red team use balistics with all weapons and are generally the bad guys, use balistic weapons and are most likely to swarm one single area with a giant army. The New Conglamorate(NC) is the blue team, basically the good guys and obviously inspired by our own US as i like to call them the space america, normally fights the TR on every map in large numbers on one area, usually stalwart defenders. Then last everyones favorite the Vanu Soverieghnty(VS), the purple team is the only faction who use only laser weapons and are the team that will have small skirmishes with each faction or infiltrating undefended territory and winning the game because the other two are busy fighting each other.

Pros & Cons:
Pros:
-2000 player max per map
-Capablility to relocate to most bases via redeploy or join combat, the maps are big so this is a plus
-Multiple classes and armor and vehicles to spruce the gameplay and give roles to people
-Has a squad system that rewards players with larger xp for playing with other people
-Has base building aspect, where an individual can mine resources to build a small outpost and generate a victory point
-A small small map dedicated to new players is available to build skills call koltyr
-It's free
-Directives give you goals to achieve to unlock items and gain a few certificates and xp

Cons:
-Certificates, the in game money is difficult to earn and most items are 1000 certs to buy
-Has a pay to win option that many seem to delve into
-The NC has an unfair advantage in starting weapons that have a better damage output
-The Vanu seem to be mostly played by p2w players or hackers
-You have to be ok with dying all the time, because you will die literally all the time, sometimes as soon as your spawned
-The devolopers no longer own the game and its new dictators only care enough for it to reciebe the money you put into it. Its 5 years old so dont expect any big updates anymore
-It's boring to play this game for any longer than an hour by yourself, you have to play it with a friend or two or you will hate this game. This is a con because that means without friends this game has no leverage of its own
-There is some lore to the game, but nothing besides what little they give you at the character creation screen. After that you have nothing else to learn and obsese about

My advice is to play this game only with 1 to 2 friends and try to have fun, but remember that dying is a part of the game",1485610827,1485610827,True,0,0,0.499821484088897705,0,True,False,False

//Game Credentials:
-It's been around for 4 years, yet it's still going; with new content!
-And even though the Player base has shrunk somewhat, 
it still has a core dedicated player base that is Amazing!

//The Game itself:
-The graphics are still great.
-The Shear amount of content is amazing.(HUGE Maps, Weapons galore, Usermade Content for player appearance, etc.)
-The gameplay is great. (Each team's playstyle is different, for example.)

//What might drive you away:
The importance of teamwork.
While you still can have plenty of fun soloing things, it could make you feel small and insignificant in certain fights.
So I hightly recommend you find some people to play with(at least from time to time), and work with them.

To a new player this game can be a bit daunting and farming certs (at first) comes slow and turns many away.

To gain certs faster (at first) you need to be an engi/med, stack your ability to gain more certs by spending certs in things that help others, forget weapons at first, if you work on your repair tool, ammo giving, health/shield giving, remote repping/ammo in a sundi while acting as a passive mobile medic for people close to your vehicle etc. Maybe spend a few certs on a scope if you find time to use it.

Join a platoon/squad and actually fight with them as support and your +% bonus to certs increases giving you more certs. Joining a platoon/squad is also a great way to find big battles. Some outfits can be a bit authoritarian e.g. if you do not come and fight in the spot they are fighting in then they will kick you. Personally I think that is a bit lame, however you want certs and being in a constant battle is the best way to earn them.

It is a hard slog at first and I made it harder by buying a gun for 1k certs when I could have increased my passive cert making skills as above, now however I make so much passive certs using engi/med with little work that I have 1k certs to spend on guns etc every couple of days.

I have never spent a penny on this game, some customisations are given to the non spenders like me, such as the big christmas bow and the salty paintjob etc.

There is a lot more to say about this game, such as the huge maps and battles that push front lines back and forth for hours whilst trying to outflank the opposing force.

Pros:
Free to play
no need to pay to win
option to make squads, platoons or battalions.
massive map with endless hours of battle fun

Cons:
graphics are a little dated but no a problem
a few bugs here and there (got stuck in a rock and couldnt redeploy  had to manually shut the game down and restart)
people who pay for new weapons will kill you easily so alittle unfair in terms of battle.

9/10 game give it a shot it is free.

Epic, unique, one of a kind. It's 2017 and still no game like this one.
A war, vast worlds, playground, massive battles (and also opposite), variety, tactical, outstanding.
A war, free2play but no child's playground.
Well in a chaotic massive battle everyone could find his role and spot......
Teamwork, lone wolf, support, scout, infiltrator, cloaked bugger, jetpack flank warrior, mechwarrior, tank force, air force, gatherer...
Unforgiving, complex and overcomplicated.
Outstanding deep ballistics.

Very very slow progress to unlock this and upgrade that, add these and fully uncap those. 
Grind or die, grind to win, play or pay. 
Anyway time is money. Free2play can turn into the most expensive game by far, by far. No respecs, no refunds.
Brainer. One way or another?
Yea, teamwork, leadership and tactics, that's what matters, 
well you will be facing the most equipped warriors and platoons over n over, also you will be swarmed...,
and well the factions and powers are kinda unbalanced and varied on purpose here and there, 
so you will be facing some OP sh1t over n over. A war.
Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.
One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.
Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority. 

#Honorable mentions#
CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).
Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPS
Beside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.
Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help.",1485025918,1485025918,True,57,1,0.74347984790802002,0,True,False,False
