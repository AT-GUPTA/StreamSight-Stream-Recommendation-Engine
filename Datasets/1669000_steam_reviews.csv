I could talk about the game's over complicated economy that collapses to a few optimal decisions with basic math.  I could talk about the simplifying of movement with abundant teleporters makes army movement trivial and basically results in a blob fight to determine the outcome of a war.  But essentially what makes or breaks the game, and for me it breaks it utterly, is the combination of consistent unit archetypes and a shared tech tree.

Now that initially doesn't sound like a bad thing, does it?  What's so wrong with consistent unit archetypes and a shared tech tree?  Well essentially all the units in the game are designed to fit into a set of archetypes that you have access to at the start.  You never unlock a new archetype of unit, the sort of units that you start with are the sort of units that your end with.  Then on top of this all the techs that you unlock impact a certain archetype of unit, so all of your archers do some fire damage if you research a tech.  This essentially makes all the units in these archetypes blend together as the turn count increases.  Any difference between them diminishes as they get upgraded.  Your archers might get more powerful as you upgrade them, you might even unlock a new archer, but it behaves exactly like your starting archers.

So what's the big deal?  Well as you click the end turn button, all that happens is the numbers go up.  You unlock a new unit?  It's the same as the unit you were already using except its numbers are higher.  The tactical combat plays out the same way but a unit model changes.  You unlock a new tech?  It causes the numbers to go up.  The tactical combat plays out the same way but now there's more particle effects.  Almost nothing you do in this game gives you a sense of changing direction, everything just causes the numbers to go up.  It's one dimensional.    

Furthermore, since the factions you are fighting have the same tech tree, there's no way to prepare for their late game.  You don't pick technologies to counter what your opponent is progressing towards because you don't know what they are progressing towards.  You research and build whatever you think is the most powerful independently of what your opponents are doing.  So the turns go by and the numbers go up but nothing feels different, none of your decisions feel like they have accomplished anything unique other than their particular contribution to the rate at which the numbers increase.  So this makes Age of Wonders 4 feel exactly like other modern strategy games, more of a system of behavioral modification devices than an actual game.",1708807466,1708807466,False,4,1,0.509095966815948486,0,True,False,False

I like it. I've played it for 50 hours, and I'll probably play it for at least 25 more. Definitely got my money out of it. 
[strike]But I don't want to recommend it. I also don't really want to not recommend it. As a compromise, I recommend AoW: Planetfall instead.[/strike]

In a lot of ways, it feels like dumbed-down Planetfall, which I thought was the best of the series. 4 boasts customization, but past faction creation, there's no real, meaningful faction development. You're shoehorned into taking the tomes that match your affinity or you'll fall behind. That would be fine, but any and (if the game drags out long enough) all tomes are available to anyone, creating the illusion of depth. In fact, you stick with what you started with or you end up fielding T3 or (if you're quick) T4 units against the shifty AI's stacks of T5 units. Or you'll just lose to a magic victory (which you should probably disable).  

[strike]Based on PF's empire system, I expected all of this faction customization to be rolled into 4's pantheon system. That could have been fantastic. You slog through some difficult scenarios, unlocking these much-touted racial transformations as you go, making each scenario an investment in the faction you created. Not so; instead, the pantheon system is a shallow tree of cosmetic unlocks punctuated with a few lackluster faction traits, all attached to what amounts to nothing more than a character pool. You have only minimal control over which members of your pantheon will appear as heroes in subsequent scenarios, and if they do, they tend to show up when you're already capped out on heroes anyway. And instead of the badass wyvern-riding ranger who conquered the world, they join you as some low-level loser equivalent to the procedurally-generated nerds already in your recruitment pool. It's all very disappointing.[/strike]


Otherwise, 
+ City development is, overall, improved. Got a couple gripes here but for the most part I like what they did. Pop cap is still corny, but I get it. 
+/- Combat is more engaging than in AoW3 but less than in PF
- Hero development railroads you into building an analog of one of the basic unit types. Making more than 4 heroes/rulers feel substantially different is very difficult, and the end result is a disposable rando you'll never care to see again. This was a weakness of PF, too, but you could always stick your heroes in mechs and blow stuff up and that kind of made up for it. 
- This AI is whack, man
- I've heard the campaign is weak. I don't really care about campaigns, so this is not my gripe
+/- Probably more, but after 50 hours playing this game it's time to go outside 

2024 update:
The Wolf update in February 2024 makes the pantheon aspect much less disappointing. It's still not what I hoped it could be, but it's closer.
AI is still shifty, but it's much better. More control over vassals is an excellent improvement. Magic victory is better balanced, which relaxes somewhat the race to max affinities and allows you to take some non-affinity tomes if you want.  
Still haven't touched the campaign
Mods add plenty of opportunity to make heroes feel unique/significant 

I still like Planetfall better. But these updates and the Workshop have taken AoW4 a long way.

AI still aggressively expands into your face (Im talking AI will literally send their hero to your area from halfway across the map just to plop an outpost as close to your territory as possible while ignoring the vast open area around them) Easily countered before, now it's just a menace to deal with.

They needed to give people a reason to care, which means some form of narrative, in order to persuade a perspective buyer of investiture in the product.

Unlike the CIV series, there is no compelling reason to spend the time to learn the mechanics when there is no payoff in stimulation.  see the many strategy board games that no one plays, vs. Dungeons and Dragons, which has a real defining identity.

As always, the tactical combat is the star of the show and has been improved to be even more interesting and quicker this time.

The biggest new addition to the game is the custom faction creator which enables you to create or re-create hundreds of different factions just the way you like it. You can go all in with the classical tropes or do something completely unorthodox – the choice is up to you. Unfortunately designing the factions is more fun than actually playing them because the choices don't feel as different in gameplay and the freedom of choosing almost anything takes away some of the uniqueness.

Visually the game looks gorgeous and it has beautiful music. 

While this game was quite solid already on release there definitely are some areas where further improvements and balance tweaks are required as it's one of their weaker entries so far but Triumph Studios has always had a pretty good post-launch support for their games so I expect updates and DLCs to address any shortcomings and take this game to the next level on par with their previous games.",1684818247,1707980893,True,6,0,0.565154552459716797,0,True,False,False

Its unique selling point is the huge variety you have when setting up a game. Instead of just choosing ""a civilization"" or ""a race"" like in many other 4X games, you put together a package consisting of a race, a culture, two traits, and a starting tome. Over the course of the game you unlock further tomes, which gives you even more options. All of this means that you aren't limited to typical fantasy tropes. You *can* create brutish and stupid orcs, but you don't have to, you are free to make noble orc paladins instead or anything you like. That rubs some people the wrong way, but the advantage is that on the gameplay side you have a huge variety of choices, which does wonders for replayability.

While I do like the DLCs, for a new player they aren't necessary purchases at the start. Instead each DLC came with a major patch, which improved the base game for free.

AOW4 is a cookie cutter 4x game thats lost all of its charm and uniqueness from the last entry. Still, it's a very mechanically solid game, it just feels like every other 4x game out there. In particular, it's a very stereotypical paradox game that loves its ""mana"" i.e. point values to do stuff; have enough points, click button, do thing. Affinity, imperium, research, gold... all ""mana"" systems. 

The whole class system has been scrapped, and just like Stellaris you now have a bunch of options when customizing your faction. It's a nice system that works, but it's a ""mana"" system too. The classes have been replaced by ""tomes"" which provide the replability and variation, and again, it works but feels more like a standard tech tree than AOWIII's class system. 

City building has been turned into CIV 6, which again, is neat and functional, but not really interesting. The best innovation is allowing you to build buildings and units at the same time. Claiming provinces is cool, and building special buildings is also nice, but results in weird things like cities having unclaimed land right next to the city by the end game because the bordering province isn't very good. The single worst part is that, even if the city pop goes down, that land is FOREVER chained to the city. You can't redo borders, or take out a rival to steal their land. You either raze the whole city or watch as they hold on to lands right next to your cities. 

The worst thing is that this is another game that, rather than balance it's economy, has just thrown a stupid arbitrary limit to make expansion useless after a given point. You now have a city limit, in direct contrast to AOWIII's ""this is a game about fantasy war"" mentality. Now, you have to turn everything into useless vassal cities that you have no control over. They only send one stack at a time (and only after 5-10 turns), send you limited resources, and worst of all, claim provinces irrationally. I've had so many wonders get cut off from me because my vassal claimed a territory before I could. 

And there are just a ton of little nice details that were removed. Cities no longer have populations, just a single number from 1-30. Little quotes about each unit are gone. Cities really only add to their tower, but don't change visually as they grow otherwise. It's just another souless paradox game...

But despite that, it's balanced, functional, and fun to play for a campaign or two. There are worse games out there, but also plenty of better ones. Overall, it's a solid, soulless 7/10.",1707878160,1707878160,True,1,1,0.510496199131011963,0,True,False,False

TLDR: This is a very strong fun and unique 4x game. It provides loads of replay ability, Multiplayer, and a long tail progression system, and tops it off with a campaign + a new story per DLC. 

For me strategic depth with strong replay ability is a must. And this hits all the marks. The game allows you to build your race the way you want, you are not locked into a tradition of western mythologies. This means if you want Giant Dwarves that are part Dragon, have at it. Set your Form (aka how you look), your race attributes (aka your base passives) and then choose your culture (base units and more unique passives for your race), Now comes your society traits (foundational passives that dramatically change your game style), lastly choose your upgrades (or Tomes in this game. Provide unique spells, buildings, upgrades and units). 

The game really appeals to the tinkerer. If you struggle with the amount of choice you can get locked playing your favorite way each and every time and I still enjoy it as both campaign and the random missions provide unique ways to go after each game. But from other 4x games it feels as if you are more limited with this model, mostly because all the unique pieces that builds your games isnt a fixed tree. This means its up to you to differentiate each game run vs other games where your most fundamental choice is ""pick race + tech tree"". Overall with the options in your hand the breadth of customization that occurs during a game is breath taking until you start to understand how the tome system works. 

The negatives for the title for me is that the cultures which primarily provide the base units you play need to have stronger differentiation with buildings and unit capabilities. I would say as well that you could provide stronger random world events to make each world that much more unique. Some tomes (order) feel very lacking compared to the other tome trees, especially when you layer on the skill tree. It is almost always more efficient to conquer then gain trust. Lastly AI could use some help, feels it overly cheats and is not as varied in behavioral models. 

Beyond this the game is a must have for any 4x fan. I play on consoles as well as PC and both provide the same great experience.

This is the first negative review i have ever done.

[*] There is no balance at all between the tomes and affinitys. So you end up with mostly the same build all the time.
[*] traits and soceity traits are unbalanced as well, you choose the same most of the time regardless of culture
[*] At the end of each map you have researched almost the whole game, almost no replay value
[*] heroes ..oh man there is so much wrong with them it wont fit here
[*] the races aka skins have no depth
[*] no campaign ....
[*] the 3 stacks per battle cap would force you to delete your units in multiplayer. Not against AI because even the hardcore AI sucks.
[*] on release we got 4! (four) dlc announced, so its basically a 100€ game because the basegame lacks content
[*] i hate the siege mechanic, the garrisions of planetfall have been better
[*] all fights feel the same
[*] performance... how can this game have such a terrible perfomance? I mean srsly?

THE BIGGEST ISSUES - AI and shallow diversity lacking depth: You have all these customization options but no matter what race or culture (faction or tech) AI plays, it plays it the same way. For instance, In my many gameplays I have never seen an AI empire doing a military rush trying to eliminate all other players - If it did, while having an alliance with you, it makes you the game's winner!?  

A BIG issue for me is that playing single player, the biggest map with the most players is not that much fun (in Planetfall it is a very exciting experience throughout). In AoW4 most of my games get stagnant quickly, with no sense of emergency. 

Victory conditions are simplified and kind of boring to achieve. It is much better worked out in Planetfall where victories have certain steps to fulfill and strategic benefits to it - this make you interact with the world and players in different, fun ways. In Aow4 it is not beneficial and often annoying to finalize a victory. And the Seals victory is just too irritating to run for!

Building your starting hero - after a while you discover that the look options are actually limited and lacking. For instance I like moustaches only and there is no options for that. AoW4 has lots of hipster haircuts etc which I don't like.

Getting into AoW4 is a struggle. They gave up on tech trees and visual clarity of it. I struggled the most with city buildings, figuring out what implies what and what's important to build when starting.

I hate that the game's battle log is not visual. Getting a basic information which of your unit's just died is so messy to find, especially with the chaotic battle camera movement and text only battle log. 

AoW4 is a good looking game but lacks in the game play. Try AoW Planetfall instead. It's campaign mode is fantastic!",1705756729,1707750485,False,4,0,0,0,True,False,False

The bad:  turns take FOREVER once the game progresses to turn 120 or so.  Like minutes per turn.  On a new 7 PC.  It's basically mandatory to use small maps and few computer opponents.  The app uses about 75% of my 20 core CPU when it's running but not actually doing anything.   I suspect they have some ""zombie process problems,"" and the useful work of conducting AI moves gets squeezed into the tiny fraction of CPU resources left over.  

This is really such a shame.  The late stage games becomes unplayable.  I find myself switching the victory condition I am pursuing so as to avoid unnecessary troop movements. also to avoid causing the Ai to move troops.  This morning I forfeited a game I was winning in order to salvage some of the skill points I had accrued.  I would have rather completed the game for many more points, but at 5+ minutes per turn, it had stopped being fun a long time back.  

I would say if you plan to play ONLY small maps and no more than TWO opponents, and if you are also patient, then maybe this is the game for you.

I'd play this game all the time if the speed problem was improved.  As it exists now, it's kind of pointless.

The pantheon is basically nothing more then a collection of all the heroes that you either played or came up in scenarios. The problem is, you don't get to select them and use them. They merely turn up in games. What's the point? I've played a few self designed games and you have to start each game's hero from scratch. Yes, you can ""design"" your own hero, and faction, but once again, what's the point? Every time you start a new game, your hero starts at level one.
Trust me, I've given this game plenty of time to see if it gets any better. It doesn't. The designers decided that allowing the players the ability to customize heroes and factions was enough, but for some odd reason, they decided that you couldn't select them after adding them to you pantheon.

I think this is a fun aspect to be able to customise your faction to what you think is cool and what they can do or good at. 

Each main faction does have their own kind of play style which can be changed through out the game through research. Each faction has access to the same research with the exception for 3 ones that are only for that faction.

Combat can be done with in turn base using a grid unless you win to auto resolve the battles. You get heros/leaders through out the game which you can level up and customise through out the game to make them good at anything you want, either a support, caster, ranged or melee.

In the world map, you can cast spells to assist you such and changing the terrain, debuffing enemies or buffing your armies. In combat, they do a simular thing, but may assist you in turning the battle in your favour.

Throughout the game, there will be quests that pop up that give you bonuses when you achieve them. Some are easy to achieve while others might take bit more time to achieve.

To win the game, there is a few different ways to do it, you can:
Conquer everyone
Through a magic victory
Through owning the most land
Seal Victory
Score Victory after 150 turns

It might seem easy to achieve this, but it is also easy to be stopped. For the magic and expansion victory, you enemys will have 15 turns to stop you before you win as you will need to hold 3 points.

I would say it's lacking somewhat in content. But the free upcoming updates and the DLC also add quite a lot to the game. 

There are also mods, which can help you to tailor some aspects of the game for yourself. But at the moment, the number of mods isn't too high. 

There are some performance issues, like the game will randomly crash at times. But there's a resume button and the game auto saves every turn up to the previous 25 turns. So you're unlikely to lose much, aside from a minute or so loading back in.

I think the game needs more cultures, some more tomes and more customisation options. 

But there's definitely enough to enjoy yourself for quite some time. 

One thing that some people have complained about but doesn't bother me, is a lack of story campaign. Previous AoW games had a story. But I didn't find the campaign of AoW 3 particularly engaging anyway.

Each have an extremly short technology chain - only 1 Tome (4-6 active and passive skills/spells). So, majority of your technology tree is placed into Tomes which anyone can incrementally unlock, from Tier 1 to Tier 5. Can you guess what happens in tier 3+?

If you are clueless - all human players will research the most OP technologies available (and there is big difference in power level between tomes of the same tier - devs are actually trying to nerf some of the most imbalanced ones, but still). So, after everyone reach tier 5, all nations will look quite homogenous, with roughly the same buffs and abilities. Racial tranformations will stack and twist races so much that they will be hard to recognise (and discern from each other, since all players will likely use the same transformations). There will hardly be any definitive features for any faction involved in the match.

So, the devs created a game where everyone is so equal that no one is special. All matches will feel the same, since everyone will be using roughly the same technologies and strategies.

Infestations and Fickle Alignments.

WRONG THEY ARE ALL GOLD OR SILVER LMAO. Because all the infestations on your half of the world will all attack you and no one else so it doesn't really matter what they are. Enjoy the 1000 strength armies of mythic units mixed with tier 4 and 3 creatures marching towards your borders when you only have tier 1 and 2. (Your armies will perish and so will you.)
Now let's talk about Alignment. It is very fickle and easily changes for the most stupid reasons. Let's say you have an alliance with someone who is Neutral or Good and you are also of the same alignment. Let's also say that your AI ally ends up in a war. Oh dear, your AI ally has decided to raid every single province the enemy has... GOODBYE ALLIANCE THEY ARE PURE EVIL NOW AND HATE YOUR GUTS! Now you just have disappointment and more enemies. No historical or cultural weight to your friendship... it's all just AI brain go brrr because me evil and you not so me kill you now bye. This argument works in reverse too! Lets say you are evil and have an evil AI ally... great! What's happening? 10-25 turns have gone by and your Evil Friend hasn't done anything evil for a little bit... GOODBYE ALLIANCE THEY ARE GOOD NOW BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING EVIL TO DO AND JUST EXISTING IS GOOD APPARENTLY! Now you just have disappointment and another target to go after.

Also the Seals Victory and Magic Victory AI armies that spawn are kinda lame. They just spawn relentlessly... before you can heal and reinforce your armies and thrash you. But if the AI empires give it a go they do just fine because of their bonuses for being AI. Humans don't get bonuses for just existing so why should AI get the same treatment? Screw that I want to play on an even playing field! I don't want bonuses or debuffs... so remove them from the AI too. And make it so the AI NOTICES EACH OTHER!

as you can see its positive now if not barely.... with the previous review deleted as it is IN TOTAL NOT RELEVANT TO THE PRODUCT AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT.
so, about the problems and issues solved and or still present ( tldr in the end ;D ):
1) the LEGENDARY SAGA of the PARADOX LAUNCHER: once upon a time (at launch) this game could not be played at all if you had a mac or a linux OS as it would choke down and die at the first moment it was attempting any form of interaction with their horrible launcher, unless you had the most boyscout microsoft bootlicker pc setup....
this is no longer the case. the playability part tho, not the fact that their launcher is still horrid. that one didnt change at all and from what i gather from other users it gotten worse, the launcher i mean.
the game IS PLAYABLE now, but only as long as you either ignore the launcher as hard as possible OR BETTER, you put in a launch code startup line thing, which you can find online, to just go around the launcher and straight to the game.

2) the horrible optimization: yea ok this one got waaaaay better but stil chokes at the very start when you start playing the intro cutscene to the game. here is a tip when you see the paradox logo hit esc, wait abit until it says ""hold esc to skip"" or something and hold it... for a while..... other than that i didnt face too big an issue.
(some people still saying alotof stuff about crashes..... i didnt get any of them. might got lucky cuz my pc is actually pretty aight tho. you have been warned).

3) the DOG-PILING, CRAZY, AI BIAS MADNESS: now. this one got MUCH BETTER LUCKILY, and was the major reason why i blasted the game on launch. the reason was that it was crystallized pain. the ai would do crazy stuff like hating your guts -1000000 social credit score meme, at first encounter, and sending you a declaration of war the very next turn. just cuz you are an extra dimensional space wizard and they are a monarchist from this dimension i guess (cuz different faction). while at the same time every one that is also a form of extra dimensional space wizard would jump at the first opportunity to succ your privates (cuz same faction) and glomp your seamen ;). that is no longer the case, they are now more sane about their disdain/ favoritism and rather base it on what you do on the long run. THAT IS VERY GOOD, and surprised me when a dlc dragon faction (which for context are very shady... they care about power and money, so usually you can expect them to sell their mum for more magic crack crystals and cash.) went from hating me from start, to liking me very much, cuz i was fighting the same enemy as them.
another example would be that the ai factions would ignore the fact that they are sieged from multiple sides. and WILL lose in the next couple of turns, in favour of SENDING EVERY SHRED OF FORCE ON THE CONTINENT TO GANG YOU UP SPECIFICALLY..... yea, this game on launch was very special ai wise.
as i said, it is no longer the case either as they are much more reasonable in their responses, or with the fact that the ai is no longer blind to their surroundings and predicaments when they have you at their sights. (funny thing is that its not ""if"" its ""when"". wonky ai be wonky and silly still. ai be ai after all).

4) horrible miss-balance between power and opportunity cost: this one was VERY BAD AT LAUNCH. and was the second reason i blasted the game. there was no reason at launch to create a funny wizard civ based around ""SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG"" meme, where they ""LEGALIZE NUCLEAR BOMBS"", and drop like 6 magic nukes on the field in total just to do like half the hp of a 1/4th of the enemies army, cuz they chose ""feudal and hobbits with the book of warding"". sooo they get a banner carrier dude that gives their army +3 armor and magic armor thing to a 3 hex radius size aoe of friendlies EVERY TURN AND IT STACKS. so in the end they get an army of immortal tier 1 units that just A-move towards your direction and you die, cuz you cant kill 27 tier 1 immortals with like 11 tier 2 and 3 unit army that nukes their field for little to no damage, and walking through fire and flames unscathed...... this is again, no longer the case, EXEPT if you do something that doesnt logically work. i advise checking which civ elements things counter each other so you dont do the mistake of countering yourself by mistake... as long as your idea makes sense, at least on paper, and you be Gucci bro. 

so SUPER TLDR : this is another case of a game that went from an utter car crash pileup with no survivors, to a very ok game on its own. and then much more ok.... with dlc...... this is a PARADOX INTERACTIVE GAME after all so you know they gonna milk that dlc content split to the max. 
i took the time to write this review cuz i could not keep my SUPER HOT FIRE TAKE NEGATIVE REVIEW in good faith after all that happened and got fixed. with all the positive stuff they done to fix the game it sorta, VERY CLOSE TO NOT, but SORTA aight. 

 i give it a final score of AIGHT OUT OF GOOD.

if you also liked FALLEN ENCHANTRESS. get it.

There are two caveats though. First, the game is still actively being worked on and arguably should be marked as early access. The game looks extremely different compared to when it launched, because the devs have reworked the core systems of the game heavily, and are still doing so as of this review. The second caveat is that, in practice, this is not actually a multiplayer game. The multiplayer has been bugged since launch, and it is near impossible to finish a regular game due to de-sync and disconnects.

Positive:  
-  Nice visuals, both on the strategic map and the tactical maps.
-  Lots of choices to be made.  City builds, army builds, how to progress your kingdom in general.  While not super impactful, they do matter for your progression.
-  Early game is lots of fun.  Infestations (random monsters spawning on the map) can make your life tough and force you to deal with them (at a cost).
-  Tactical fights are fun.  Lots of tactical choices and interplay with unit abilities that can make a well-constructed army hit way above it's weight.

Negatives:
- AI is moronic in how it fights wars.  It can put together some decent combat power stacks but it's never a real threat - just a bump to get past.
- Because the manual tactical combat takes so long, almost all multiplayer games use auto-resolve for fights.  While the game encourages the use of lower-tier units through unit buff spells and the aforementioned ability synergies, whatever formula is used for auto-resolve HUGELY values the tier of units in the army above all other considerations.  This is SOOO bad it makes fighting with anything less than Tier 3+ units a complete waste of time (other than in the early game).  18 stack vs 18 stack armies will see the winning side (the one with more T4 and T5 units) lose 1 or 2 units and have 2-3 units slightly damaged (20% or less) while the losing side will get wiped out - EVEN when the combat value is supposedly roughly equivalent.  Additionally, forget about having all those fancy combat spells you've researched mean a damn thing in the outcome - the auto-resolve battles rarely bother to cast spells, even though ""Allow AI to use spells"" is turned on, you have plenty of mana and casting points.  This means a lot of builds with ""my guys get these bonuses when spells are cast in combat"" are meaningless.  Thus multiplayer fights boil down to who has more T4 and T5 units.  You win that, you win the fight in a landslide.  Higher tier units are more powerful and should absolutely matter, but not to the degree the combat logic currently uses.  They are godlike and all the buffed up, high experience T1 and 2 units in the world can't even dent them.  It's stupid.
- Because of the above, the only path that makes sense are paths that allow you to get high Tier units as fast as possible.  Planning a strong economy to pump out a big army is a waste of time.  The Chaos tree is massively OP as a result, as the second ability on the tree gives you a free unit when you defeat an infestation.  This is often a T3 for low level infestations and a T4 or 5 for the higher level ones.  Taking Chaos level 2 and taking on Infestations ASAP is thus the most viable path to victory.  Don't have Chaos?  You're SOL.  By the time you get another route for higher tier units, it's too late.
- Combine the above multiplayer combat issues, resulting in a limited viable path for civ development, and the weak-ass AI that makes single-player boring and you have a game that has lots of options and decisions but is really pretty boring to play. 

Without a complete revamp of the game's AI (both in auto-resolving combat and in how the AI goes about waging a war strategically), I can't and won't recommend this game.  It's fun for the first 10-20 hours while you learn the systems, until you see the massive flaws underneath that make most of the choices you're making meaningless.",1706402788,1706402788,False,5,1,0.553805768489837646,0,True,False,False

Ive played this game 26 hours so far which is nothing compared to the +2500 hours on AOW3.

First impression is WOW great graphics.
the skill tree is not bad but it seams like it has less options than before but i like how its structured in Tomes. I still haven't figure out how to stick to 3 tomes only and advance further into these rather than being all over the place and having to use tomes that my race doesn't relate to at all.
THe race Evolution was being great until one of the enchantments turned my proud human barbarians into Frogs.. seriously ?? what the royal Frog! 
 the animal legs were a bit off but id rather have the game NOT change what i created as far as race looks go.
the Music is ok but i hope later on there is a MOD with old AOW2 and AOW3 music theme.

the new complexity of the cities is nice. It Adds to the game experience. I don't like the City limit. If it takes resources to build an advance city what is the need to limit how many we can build ??!

Everything takes the presence of a Hero to build or explore. I don't like this. I need my heroes to be doing HERO jobs, Not stacking bricks or planting fields.
The scenario creator is ok but has less options than AOW3.  
All races start on surface or underground. We used to be able to choose what races start on underground or surface.
The terrain type used to have several levers with option that we could mix and match.
At least on scenario creation we should be able to decide the Heroes  for player cap. Now we have one per city.. whos idea was this ??

What saved the game for me was the multiple mods i found on stream. 
these MOD creators really read my mind.",1683828659,1706372483,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Aaaand my review is back to negative.  

We asked for AI that wasn't completely braindead.  We got an update that made the AI only half braindead.  We were happy.  

We asked for better performance, and for a game that didn't crash.  The game stopped crashing quite as often.  Progress was made.  We were happy.

It's been months.  The AI is still half braindead, and crashes are still a matter of when, not if.  The crash reporter tool doesn't work more than half the time.

None of that would warrant a negative review from me.  Progress was being made, even if it was slow.  There was hope.  Sure, the devs were too distracted with making DLC to finish fixing the base game, but there was hope.

Today, Paradox asked steam users to fill out a survey on how to improve AOW4.  They wanted to know my age bracket to within 5 years, my gender, my country, and my preferred social media.  That's when I quit the survey, but according to comments, they also asked for our taste in movies.  This has nothing to do with fixing the game, and everything to do with launching a social media campaign to artificially inflate the perceived value of the game without actually fixing anything.

I have mad respect for the devs that code, the game designers, the artists, and the UI designers.  What I do not respect is the chain of command that would rather rush out poorly balanced DLCs and marketing campaigns than let their programmers do their jobs.

Based on the current priorities of the people who pay the programmers, I have no hope or trust for this game, or for Paradox as a whole.

- Old Review -

[strike] 1) No more hard crashes (where I'm forced to power off my computer.)  If the game must fail, make sure it fails gracefully.  This doesn't just damage my gaming experience, it damages my computer.

2) No more than 1 soft crash to desktop per 6 hours of gameplay, assuming the save is recoverable, and the crash does not repeat upon loading the save.[/strike] 

Ever since using the ""graphics driver workaround"" in the game settings, crashes have become much rarer.  As long as you save and exit the game once every few hours, you might not see any crashes.  Note that some hardware is finickier than others for reasons no-one understands.

[strike]3) An AI capable of being a threat.  In a 1v8 match, stacked in the AI's favor, the AI STILL can't even ATTEMPT to fight me.  I have a single city and only three T3-T1 armies at turn 75, and yet the AI is too busy trying (and failing) to destroy my (undefended) outposts to accomplish anything.  This is embarrassing. [/strike]

Ever since the Empire & Ashes update, the AI has drastically improved.  I can no longer cheese 1 vs 8 fights, and the Regenerating Infestations mode is brutal now.  The AI WILL kill me if I give it the opportunity.

That said, players will need to fine tune the difficulty a bit.  I recommend toggling off the A's combat handicap, but putting the other difficulty settings to Hard.  The AI still isn't the brightest, but it at least knows how to manage an economy and steamroll weaker empires.",1683333739,1706353896,False,0,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

I want you to make money too. But I think it would have been far more fair to combine these DLC's into one expansion. I don't even play anymore because I don't want to spend another $50-60 on 5+ DLC's that came out within one year of the game being released. Feels shady and I don't like it. Based on the release date timeline of the original game compared to the DLC's, they fall so close to one another, that it makes you realize that these DLC's should have been a part of the original game in the first place and that now they just want you to essentially buy the game twice. I'm sorry, but this game is not worth $100 a pop. You've lost a customer for the reason being; I feel ripped off by the excessive DLC's that seemingly should have been in the original game, or at the very least, bundled into one single $25 expansion. I would have happily purchased that additional content had it been a fair value.

OLD REVIEW: Loving the game so far. Been playing AOW since I was a kid and AOW4 checks all the nostalgia marks. The audio/sound effects/music is phenomenal. Graphics are incredible. AOW3 had a superior encyclopedia for researching units and their evolved form, so if there were two things I could critique, it'd be an improved encyclopedia that includes units, as well as larger map options. In AOW3 i enjoyed playing large maps with few players but the maps in this game feel condensed with enemies always just a turn or two away distance/travel wise.

The replayability is off the chart. You can even create your own races and assign their traits. Some are better than other but for the most part it depends on your playstyle.

It pains me to write this as I was a thumbs up from early on. The creation of the underground and the inability to disable it was a major mistake by the dev team and embarrassing that they claim to not be able to correct this. THIS IS the only reason I did not pre-purchase the entire DLC franchise and have stopped playing what I think is an amazing game. Such a shame over something so simple that the devs would randomly force upon us.

How stupid can you be to think the underground is a great idea and then choose to force your customers to agree with you without having the option to turn it off? Humiliating for a dev team if I may add. Well, I will enjoy the game as is as much as I can ""when"" I am in the mood to play it again, but will never invest in a DLC or a future AOW game because of this stupidity. Sorry - I was one of your biggest fans owning all of the previously released AOW series and playing them for decades.

This game is true to its core values:

If it survives enough combat it becomes a tier 3 unit with a heavy swipe trait that hits adj units. I started out loving a materium build.

the very short story isn't terrible but nothing to write home about - feels like a game still in beta

""respond to a heroes request to join"" - this pops up every turn there is no way to stop it or dismiss it or  heroes or shuffle the hero pool without recruiting it, and sending them to die very annoying and takes way to much gold/time/effort.

did they even play their own game? - i doubt it. 

- sometimes the end turn button just stops working and you have to save/reload...

actually just crashes - some battles you can't manual fight like at the town Waypoint the 3rd story mission - you google it and its a known issue for almost a year since last May.... where people have submitted crash reports.....

speaking of crash reports after you have sent about 3 - even if your next crash is something different it just gives you error 500 and refuses to upload - i assume some kind of auto-ban kicks in where they simply don't want to know/be bothered not that they seem to beable to fix anything anyways... but ""nice""...

i'm sure they are working on more dlc... and seem very uninterested in actually fixing anything wrong with their game or making it more playable.....  - GOTCHA ?

finished the story - may try some of the regular just 1 vs AI map stuff but definitely not worth 50-100 dollars 

------> this is legit a 10 dollar game <------ loaded with bugs/poor quality of life/poor design/and a complete lack of substance - designed to be as painful to finish as possible and take as long as possible to do so without any real content or substance (long time to move a army to the other side of the map while waiting for the AI to do the same for objectives then oh guess what now you have to go to the complete opposite side ""cool"") even after a teleport 15 turns later.... now you have to siege the castle, well enjoy waiting another 5-8 or even 10+ more turns waiting for the wall to breach..............  good thing turns go by so quickly...... oh wait they don't......

if it isn't done on the same engine they've been using for the last 10 years i'd be surprised - looks exactly like any 4X game i've ever played like this, terrain, armies, movement.... none of it is impressive at all. May as well load up some Endless Legend from 8 years ago.....

 can i recommend it? no.

Pros:
-Lots of new stuff / mechanics.  Not an evolutionary sequel - lots of new things to learn and explore.
-Tons of customization.  You can mix and max races and cultures.  Your leader has several interesting origins, including Champion, Wizard King, or even Dragon Lord if you get the DLC.

Cons:
-There's so much customization that you'll notice the lack thematic cohesiveness. This is true of both races and rulers.  
-Spells seem a bit less interesting and powerful than in AoW2 and 3.  
-Because your cities can produce both units and structures simultaneously, there's a lot of unit spam.   
-The ""sector system"" from AoW: Planetfall is back.  I personally preferred the AoW2 and 3 way of handling borders and claiming structures much better.  This method leads to odd borders and lots of unsealed territory.
-Relatively harsh on the number of cities you can have, though you can expand your allowable empire size with large invesments.  This leads to lots of vassalization, though this does keep the micromanagement down.  In this way, it's not so much a map painter.
-No great way to keep lower tiered units relevant.  In AoW: Planetfall, there was a good system to buff up units and this could keep your lowered tiered units useful for a longer period of the game.  
-Music is ok, but fairly bland and forgettable.  That's a shame as this series has always had standout music.
-Graphics are good, but don't communicate as well as in AoW3.  Coupled with the lack of thematic cohesiveness to races and rulers, it's a bit harder to tell what's going on at-a-glance.",1705351132,1705351132,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

At the 200 hour mark it became a solid game that I return to every couple weeks and after every DLC.

In tactical battles if one of their champions has a movement ability they tend to suicide into your army. On the strategic map, there is a tendency to leave small armies which - due to the 3 stack vs 3 stack nature of battles - allows you to pick their forces apart. Granted, every so often they'll do the same to you if you're not paying attention.

Sieges are a great addition, as is the tome system since it allows you to choose how you want to customize your character and empire as you play, rather than deciding beforehand.

That said, it lacks a lot of the personality that made AoW1-3 and Planetfall so great.  All races can choose from the same pool of mental/physical/cultural traits, which sounds cool in theory but in actual practice means that your decisions are mostly cosmetic.  A Resolute, Desert Adapted, Feudal orc is going to play exactly the same as a Resolute, Desert Adapted dwarf, human, feline, ratkin, or whatever else.  Also, when it comes to selecting a realm, there are a lot of options for special features (ancient ruins, free cities that are easier or harder to work with, etc), but when it comes to the most basic options like map size, terrain types, etc. it seems like a step back from AoW3.

It might be my bias as a huge fan of AoW3 and Planetfall, but between the lack of personality compared to those games and the fact that it kind of bogs down in the mid game, it's just... sort of not fun?  It feels like it knows what a fun game is like and might become that at various points but for whatever reason it never seems to materialize.

Edit: it's been a few months since I wrote that, I gave the game some space, and it's kind of grown on me in the last week or two.  The DLC helps!

Making your own factions and leaders, and unlocking new customization elements for these in your pantheon is very enjoyable.

Where the game falls a bit short for me is the story elements and overall flavour. The world feels a bit small, and the length and scope of a typical game doesn't feel as epic as some other games in the genre. There is a little bit of flavour text here and there, but it's not much, and you will see the same things over and over in each playthrough.

Age of Wonders 4 casts a potent spell of fantasy wonder. It's a deep 4X experience with intricate systems, thrilling turn-based battles, and endless customization. Whether you're carving a ruthless goblin empire or nurturing a peaceful elven haven, you have the tools to tell your own unique story. I love the satisfying sense of discovery as you explore vibrant maps, forge alliances and rivalries, and unlock potent spells. The depth might intimidate some, but the game cleverly introduces its complexity at a comfortable pace, ensuring everyone can dive into the magic. Sure, the AI could be smarter, and some late-game pacing issues linger, but the sheer joy of building your dream realm eclipses these minor flaws. If you crave a rich, replayable fantasy 4X adventure, Age of Wonders 4 is an absolute must-play. Highly recommended!

Pros:

- Deep, rewarding gameplay with endless customization
- Thrilling turn-based combat with tactical depth
- Vibrant fantasy world with diverse factions and lore
- Satisfying sense of discovery and progression
- Excellent learning curve eases players into complexity

Cons:

- I wish it was a science fiction setting!

Overall:

Age of Wonders 4 is a triumph of the 4X genre, offering endless possibilities for fantasy empire building. Its depth, charm, and tactical combat make it a must-play for strategy fans, with minor imperfections easily overshadowed by its immersive magic.

The map generator creates a world according to the player's specifications and a matching number of opposing factions from a large number of properties. The player can create their own faction (as well as the opposing factions).

The gameplay itself is turn-based strategy with a clear reference to Civilization or similar titles. The big difference to most comparable titles is that battles can be fought on a separate tactical map. However, you can also have the result calculated or have the battle demonstrated ""live"" on the tactical map.

The graphic style and music are appropriate to the setting and draw the player into the generated world. This is also very important, as there are no extensive background stories that could take over. The world is kept alive by isolated events and the player's imagination.

Due to the many options when creating the world and the races as well as the many game mechanics, AoW4 offers a very high replay value and is incredibly fun. It leaves little room for criticism. My personal biggest criticism is the ""voice acting"" of the units(!) in the game. As professionally as the texts are spoken in the intro, for example, I find, what can at best be called sounds when I click on the units on the map, inappropriate. That's a bit of a shame, because I keep losing immersion due to these sounds.

Overall I am very happy with my experience with Age of Wonders 4.  The game runs well on my current system (i7 processor and 1070ti card) and overall the experience I have with this game is very nice.

However, as alluded to above, there is a rather large But that needs to be addressed...

It's much more accurate to call this game a Fantasy Turn Based Strategy Sandbox compared to previous games.  There is effectively no real story in this game other than the very basic ""Evil Wizards from beyond time are here to wreck everyone's day"" and that's basically it.  There is no real campaign, no building up characters over the coarse of numerous story missions... it's nothing but one-and-done missions with little to no continuity.

If your goal for this game is just to have a Fantasy Sandbox to play in, then this game is wonderful for that and you can/will find many hours of enjoyment making your own stories/races/factions.  If, on the other hand, you wanted an actual story and missions where characters can be built up and transfer from mission to mission... then this game fails at that.

Overall I would rate this game a B-.  For what it does it is very solid and very enjoyable... but the loss of story missions and a comprehensive and continuous story is a pretty big negative that drags this game down quite a bit in my estimation.  In general, Age of Wonders 3 is still the best game in the series (for me at least), and if this game had actually implemented a full story mode the way they did in 3 this game would have easily been the best of the series.

So far I have only played the story games.  Reminiscent of Might and Magic games but only to a point.  There is not the ""cool"" factor of the armies I felt in those games.  It is more like the army accumulation of Master of Magic but this game is more developed in that regard.  Best to put a hero in with each army so that they can do the things that require a hero as you explore the map.  

City development isn't convoluted the way it is in Civ 6.   

You get access to spell books as this games form of technology.  Units and heroes gain experience. City growth and your economy are pretty straight forward.  I guess I could limit my chattering by saying that most of the 4x mechanisms are here but they aren't overly complex.  I believe that unlike Civ 6 I could take up an unfinished game 2 years from now without being at a loss for how certain things work.  There are a lot of things in Age of Wonders 4 but they are logical enough that a 4x experienced player will need to look up very few of them to understand them well enough. 

The game does feel a bit bland to me and I cannot explain why.  Maybe it is because there doesn't seem to be any new ground covered and I have played so many 4x games before.

(1) Roleplay: Create a custom faction, have a backstory and rename the hero + cities. Its pretty easy to become detached and eventually bored after the first few initial turns. (2) Avoid auto-combat for the early game and during the late game. Midgame though auto auto auto. (3) Zoom out during enemy turns to speed it up slightly. The game can bog down pretty hard on big maps when you need to spend 6 turns sieging a city. (4) Teleporters a late game province improvement can significantly cut down on the turns spent walking through forests/desolate terrain. Road are terrible.

1.  Nests and other invading type NPC's don't attack the other NPC provinces at all.  They just sit there and get HUGE and only attack you.  This issue is extremely annoying when you invade NPC provinces and start to engage the NPC armies and then have these monsters join in with the NPC armies going after you.  More than once I've had a lopsided fight that I ended up winning, but took substantial losses in pulling off the win, only to have monsters come from more than one direction and attack me and I lost to them.  

2.  As soon as you pull your army from your territory, it's a guarantee you will get invaded by random armies sending lvl 1 troops in to just rape your improvements.  No scouts were sent, just simply appears the game allows the NPC's full map view at all times.

3.  The ""random"" events that you supposedly have a percentage chance for an outcome to happen isn't actually something that will ever go one way or another, no matter what the odds are for you pull it off.  I saved the game prior to an encounter with one of these, and reloaded the save 10 times and got the same outcome every single time.  Nonsense I tell you!

I started out by making Saruman the White, the leader of the race of The Uruks of Isengard. An industrious bunch, they set to stripping the land of all natural resources, burning the old world in the fires of industry. Equipped with cruel halberds and crossbows, they rode wargs to victory against the stableboys of Helms Deep.

After that, I beat the first campaign map playing as Lord Vivec of the Tribunal, leading the Dunmer of House Indoril.

The game is a fantasy lovers dream, as the race and leader customization allows you to design basically whatever fantasy world you want.

It feels similar to total war at it's best (M2TW), meaning not too clunky or over complicated, but you still have a lot of options regarding economy and diplomacy. 

As far as cons go, I will say it took me a few hours to really get into the game, but now that I am, I can't stop playing. The battles also aren't my favorite on the smaller scale, but I will say the large scale battles are quite strategic and good fun.

Yes I am serious. 

This is the best AOW since AOW 2 and a serious strategy game with depth and infinite replay-ability. At first, it seems your typical 4x that allows you surface customization, but when you delve into it it really, truly shines. You can craft a custom race complete with a custom ruler that is further differentiated by the traits, civ type, and tome selection. 

Beyond customization, the actual game play is rewarding and challenging. If you decide to go full on war focused with little regard for your neighbors, the alignment system will stack bad luck onto you until every encounter is bad. I am talking four simultaneous invasions by npc spawners that can seriously wreck you with fully tiered stacks. Further, if you go too far into the good alignment then noone will want to fight you besides the evil civs, leading to serious lack of expansion. This game calls for roleplay of your leader on levels that are rarely seen outside of the genres titans. 

My last comment will be to shine a light on the actual visuals of the game. They are beautiful yet simplistic enough to easily identify what is going on. The overworld and underworld (yes there are both) are beautifully crafted with immense customization options available to ensure you never play on the same map twice. The battle maps make sense as to the terrain you traveled to on the world map and are balanced to ensure both sides start with their own tactical advantages. 

Buy this game. Seriously. It is worth every penny.",1704516731,1704516731,True,9,1,0.593968033790588379,0,True,False,False

I love the 4X genre as I played the Sid Meier's games to death and back, having a jolly good time. So I (stupidly) decided to pick this game up as part of the Steam Winter Sale. Therefore proving the old saying of ""A fool and their money will soon be parted"".

The concept is good, but even on Relaxed difficulty (aka the easiest), the execution kinda falls flat as the AI gets really aggressive with you, hates you for merely existing, and even if you get allies, you're likely going to be drawn into wars by friendly AI who's likely more warmongery than you, even if you justify it with grievances.

The only way you can reliably win from what I can tell is to ally with a strong AI and wait for a score victory, as trying to get the other methods of victory feels like an excerise in futility.

One sliver of good news is that the customization is great, but what's the point in making your dream race if they're going to get murdered by the AI even on Very Easy? Or heaven forbid, your own creations turn against you when the AI take them over in a random game?

Overall, just another cash grab by Paradox as the devs try to cater to the players, but Paradox has to ruin everything. Again.

Age of Wonders 4 gives me that same feeling (more in some ways, the civilization customization is amazing), yet it’s even more accessible and seems to have less of a learning curve. That’s an A+ in my book, I’m even considering the DLC soon.

One more thing. The game’s battle system is a lot of fun if you want to go in and micromanage your units (it reminds me of a better executed Endless Legend). However, if you want to focus more on the grand strategy, so far it is perfectly acceptable to use the auto-battle function: it happens instantly, you can replay the battle to see if the computer made any dumb decisions (I haven’t seen any, sometimes it micromanages better than I would by fully utilizing everyone’s abilities, and at appropriate times!), AND it has a Retry button if you don’t like it so you can restart the battle and control it personally with NO penalty.

That’s HUGE for me, it saves so much time. I very comfortably just auto-battle if I’m more in the mood to make grand strategy progress than battle micromanaging.

1669000,154722909,76561198119437964,0,84,985,0,441,1706662693,"Age of Wonders 4 (AoW4) is a turn based, 4X, fantasy, strategy game. This is my first real experience with AoW. I made an attempt at playing AoW3 a few years back but I struggled to get into it. This game was different.

What I really like about AoW4 is how customizable it is. You cam create your own faction including your people, their traits and appearances as well as creating a custom ruler. There are plenty of pre-set ones to choose from if you don't want to create a faction, but I must say I love being able to do this. The map creation is also extremely cool with all of the different traits you can give a world. You can make some real crazy maps and combine that with highly custom factions, you can basically make any type of world you really want.

The gameplay is very similar to Civ, but for the non-civ players out there; you develop your city, scout out and explore the land around you, build units to fight off monsters and bandits in the area to get loot, settle new cities and conduct war/diplomacy with other rulers or 'free cities' which are just smaller rulers confined to a single city (these guys can be made into vassals and integrated into your empire if all goes well).

There is a tech tree, but you basically just research magic spells. You acquire some units through this, but mostly spells. Better units can be acquired just by constructing certain buildings in your cities. Tech isn't really as much of a focus in this game as it is in a game like civ. But it certainly gives you helpful magical abilities.

The game combat can be played out manually or can be done automatically, you choose before battle commences. You might just want to auto if the battle is a safe win, but if the odds are even you may prefer to fight it manually to ensure you do your best. The manual combat is really fun. It's simple enough, but equipping your heroes with certain items and leveling them up with certain skills gives them cool abilities which can keep battles from getting stale. You might have the numbers but a powerful hero on the enemy team could mess you up depending on the spells, items and skills they have. Same goes for your own heroes of course.

AI in battle is good, but AI on the world map can be confusing. I made an alliance with some elf friends but straight after we made our alliance they started crossing the ocean just to settle right beside my borders which was land I had claimed but not yet taken (automatically claimed due to close proximity to my borders. You don't manually claim regions). This meant that I kept getting grievances generated against them and I ended up just going to war with them quite soon after to make sure they didn't take up all my potential land. Wish there was a way of telling AI you are friends with ""Hey, please don't settle near me"", or something like that.

Overall its a solid game and after just a few hours I think I am hooked now. You can role play as any sort of faction you can think of and even put custom factions on the map as AI players. This is one of the big draws for me. People say this isn't as good as previous entries, but for being my first entry into the franchise, I feel pretty satisfied with this game. And maybe when I am done I will have a proper go at AoW3 and see if it's really better than this. So yeah, if you're new to AoW, this game is great.",1703865491,1704151330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What else? Characters.

Sadly, I have not enjoyed it enough to keep playing beyond the first tutorial mission.  I came back after a few months determined to get back into the game, but I just couldn't.  While the wizard/race creation process is fun and has tons of variety, I'm finding that a lot of decisions don't really matter all that much.  You generally end up with very similar armies no matter what you choose--I guess that's good for balance, but it takes away some of the sense that you're making meaningful choices.  The visuals have none of the charm of AoW3.  They're darker and smaller, and the only way to see the difference between units of different races during combat is to zoom in so far that you can't see what else is going on.  At the default camera zoom, you can't even tell what some of the units are...birds? Fairies? 
   I don't like the new city siege system, and the province system creates SO much micro-managing at each city!  The diplomacy system is confusing...I still don't have a clear understanding on ""grievances"" and how you're supposed to declare war.  Even how you win the game is confusing...there are multiple options, but I'm at the point on the first map where after 80 turns I dominate the entire map but I can't do what I need to ""win""...my options are to declare war and kill the other AI that has been my ally from the start, build 3 towers that I can't figure out how to get the option to build, or take over 3 ancient structures that I can't find....that or I can just wait around for another 70 turns and win by default.  I feel like there's no point in doing anything anymore since no one left on the map can oppose me, but I'm forced to keep playing.
Sadly, I just haven't enjoyed the experience.  Far too many choices, dull visuals, and no sense of ""personality"" between the different race/government options.",1703984601,1703984601,False,9,0,0.540532231330871582,0,True,False,False

The options available as the story unfolds allow for tons of roleplay, and the interactions are layered and complex.

The combat system is detailed enough to be interesting, but the info is presented along a very smooth learning curve. I'd have been happier with a speed control so I could slow down the action when watching the AI fight a battle. I think with further experience, I'll learn the buffs and defenses, right now I'm just trying to master the tactics of which enemy to take down first. Target prioritization is a huge part of this game. Knowing which opponent is the biggest threat, with a huge and unfamiliar bestiary, is a non-trivial challenge. Your opponents will typically be a mixture of half a dozen or more distinct critters, each with their own attack style.

* Managing 2 different map layers
* Hero customisation with crafting
* different types of Culture skill tree. 
* World Buffs for accumulating 3 types of resource
* Micromanaging Hero battles.
* not understanding how and which Tome levelling direction and how they synergies with everything.
i created 5 new different games and i was totally put off by each one of them
I totally lost interest.

The game has a couple issues though. My two biggest issues with the game are the extremely long turn time and daily crashes. The turn time can take minutes which really starts to take a toll on you as you progress. The daily crashes are annoying because I'll have to redo my current turn and then I'll have to wait for the extremely long turn time again.

3 had stronger unit designs, and racial features were more fun and distinct. The random world gen for 3 wasn't great, but the handcrafted maps were very strong.

Planetfall's upgrades made low tier units more relevant, the larger provinces felt better, and cities having inbuilt garrisons was a welcome feature.

Both had better combat maps, and both had a decently long campaign, whereas 4's maps all feel too flat and the campaign is much too short. Computer turns also take an incredibly long time.

At release I really liked it, because it was new - I had never played any of the previous titles. I thought the amount of customization was amazing. But now I realize that every game is pretty much the same - the same relative placement in starting positions of you and any opponent(s) you choose (and if you choose to have free cities available the city of your race is ALWAYS way too close to your starting position), map size always is determined solely by the number of opponents chosen regardless of how 'far apart' you choose them to be, expansion-constricting terrain seems to be generated in too many hexes and it has always been unclear to me as to whether or not you can expand your territories through certain hexes, and generally the game just trying to exterminate you in every possible way - I really don't care to play it anymore.

If I don't get wiped out early on by a race that spams the creation of military units, then I will always get wiped out 3/4 through the normal number of turns by a group of armies either from one opponent or from all the other races combined, and every army that I have at that point gets destroyed.

Play the good guys or conquer the world. Explore, experiment, defy the usual tropes and try new perspectives. There’s plenty of room for roleplaying if you are inclined to do so. You’re in for a great experience.

On the board, [i]Age of Wonders 4[/i] behaves like a regular 4X game, complete with the expected elements (medieval setting, no firearms or futuristic technologies, use of magic, diverse sentient races) along with your personal preferences. Turn-based battles allow for another level of depth, and using spells and enchantments against your enemies is very fun.

The star of the show is customization. You can either go wild with creativity or stick to convention. Want to play Tolkien’s standard-issue elves against a rising evil power? You can. But you can also play undead feudal toads, honorable faith-bound orcs, angelic moles, scholarly crocodiles or vicious, barbaric halflings. The fact that you can personalize your faction leader gives you even more fantastic options. A draconic overlord leading a troop of enslaved dwarves? A minute wizard rat as the monarch of a human kingdom? Yes, you can.

[i]Age of Wonders 4[/i] follows the current trend of “multiverses” that so commonly these days explains the infinite possibilities of characters in different situations. You play as a god or “godir”—one of many—that visits one of the countless realms (game worlds) to fight other godirs for dominance. A game within a game, if your godir dies she returns to the afterlife hub to try again, and the same will happen to your opponents. Or you can play as a commoner in one of such realms, fighting to win the right to ascend to your very own pantheon of divinities. You can create as many as you want, and play with them however you like. The only real way to kill a godir is by deleting him from your game options.

The models are gorgeous, colorful and varied, and there are lots of them. Mythical creatures, extraplanar beings, animals and people are all depicted in detail and variety. The animations are excellent, despite some clipping with capes and beards—something quite common in games of all flavors. The graphical style is fine, even if not too original, but the interface feels a little bit dated and derivative.

There’s a wonderful feature that I’ve noticed after a long time playing, that is seldom mentioned elsewhere. Depending on your chosen race and traits, you will be able to construct certain buildings that make for a unique scenario experience. My shadow dwarves were able to build experimentation chambers and underground laboratories, but those were not available to the rest of my factions.

The concept of magic is associated to tomes, which contain spells that share a common topic. While there are some more advanced and powerful than others, you will never be restricted to a specific magical school. There’s something for everyone, and you can alter your strategies on the spot. You’ll find spells that can summon mythical creatures and monsters, buff your allies, enchant your weapons, and even alter the climate and turn the landscape into a barren wasteland, a frozen desert or a lush forest.

There is a moral system in place, but I found it somewhat rudimentary or too simplistic, that tends to polarize factions and influence certain situations. An artificial “karma” of sorts will mean that if you behave in a wrongful way, you could even get worse results in dilemmas and choice events. I personally disliked this, since it takes away some of the fun [strike]of being evil[/strike].

The music is fine; sometimes overly dramatic and with little thematic variation. I found it repetitive after a while, especially in the faction creation screen. If you’re like me and most of the usual gamers of the genre, you’ll spend a lot of time here. There is little voice acting—mostly in terms of flavor text—but it’s solid.

Mechanics-wise, [i]Age of Wonders 4[/i] is best played with mouse and keyboard. Misclicks are sadly common thanks to a cluttered interface, army models and banners in the world map. Sometimes the use of right and left clicks was unclear to me, but this is mitigated with on-screen help. I did not encounter a single error, crash or bug in over 80 hours of playtime.

The triumph of [i]Age of Wonders 4[/i] is its enormous flexibility, which derives in the huge number of possibilities for you to shape your gameplay to your liking. If you have played other fantasy games before, you’ll soon appreciate this. Those titles will eventually appear too rigid and limited, but we must remember that with many available options comes generalization and a lack of focus.

I’ve heard some comments on the apparent blandness of the game, but you can’t be universal and highly customizable without being abstract and generalist. That’s the price to be paid for personalization, and it’s perfectly fine.

I bought the premium edition with a small pre-order discount. So far, the experience has been satisfactory, and the game content is plenty and adequate. The DLC so far has been nice and adds meaningful elements to an already interesting gameplay, like the ability to play as a dragon lord, and an additional race and culture.

If the idea of having a powerful playground full of alternatives to create your dream realm of fantasy tropes appeals to you, you’ll love this game.

Wonderfully recommended.

Now that we got that out of the way, I must say though many parts of the game feels amazing, I do not like some of the design decisions
Miss few things in previous AOW games, such as
- location of armies used to decided their starting position in battle map. Now you always ended up on one side. I also dislike the tactical battle map which armies always position along the line facing each other
- Reinforcement range may sound like a good idea but I don't like it removes the importance of tactically positioning your army on strategic map. Also this I believe is the reason why we are limited to 3 armies from one side
- High tier unit too weak, especially the mythic units. Yes you want lower tier unit to still be useful in late game but not in a way that you still want majority of your army to be low tier as they benefit so much from racial augment and enhancement.
- buildings from Tome are useless and landmarks no longer gives you fun special building that provides unique benefit to the city that owns them
- Landmarks need more variety and stronger effect, not just give you more income but something more game changing, like planetfall and AOW3
- Free cities are boring
- Flying units need embark to sail on water. I get it is for balance and stuff but compare to other imba things this is not worth losing the immersion
- lack of late game deathball which is tied to weak high tier unit. Even 3 stacks of tier V unit with well planned support units can be slowly grinded down by large number of well enhanced tier I-III unit with strategic spells. IMO this should not have happen. Don't get me wrong I am not saying they are weak. They can still wreck same number of lower tier AI army with ease for multiple times in a turn. However when facing other player that won't be enough. 
- The healing mechanism. I feel like it has something to do with balance and don't have the healing/regen type of ability become too strong but I am not a big fan of them going down that route
- Experience of unit. right now it is just some stat buff. Would love to have experience unlock new abilities of unit
- Unit customization. Enhancement applies to all unit that fit the requirement and transformation for all members of the race. I prefer the planetfall way which you can have same unit with different mods for different situation facing different enemies. More strategic choices to consider and option for resources management
- Campaign that let you build super strong leaders. Story realm not good enough

That's all in my mind for now. Still, it is a good game that shows many good traditions are being kept and I see much potential. This is just the 100hr review. May add more after more game time/game update",1703044113,1703044113,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

It's depth includes nearly a dozen campaigns each with a unique theme, though I've only played 2 because I quickly wanted to play a customized campaign where I customized my opponents from their species, culture, army type, to their name and physical appearance of their leader and army, including their alignment, and more. You can choose the number of ""rulers"" to play against and the size of map.  You choose the level of randomness, (i.e. procedurally drawn maps or difficutly level of each opponent) You can choose 3 different victory objectives (military supremacy, magic supremacy, and/or total score).  For example, you can choose to go against or make as your own a Good aligned Orc Paladin starting with the study of the necromancy tome (book). Or make an evil human gun toting war mongering army with starting tome of druid.  Your choice of ""affinities"" during the game determines the choices of tomes and to what level you can study.  Your choice of heroes and city structures for the most part determine your affinity or magical theme, you can dable in a few or many, but to reach higher level tomes you need to concentrate on the affinities you like.  But you dont really know in advance what those higher level spells will be like until you reach higher levels, so it adds to the excitement of leveling.  Even your army can evolve or upgrade in different ways, in different forms.  It adds to the mystery and excitement of leveling each army squad or heroes.

There's a lot of variety or flexibility as a result of the depth of ""tomes"" to choose from and you add spells or abilities from different tomes as your cities expand.  Adding to the creative synergies that you can create with different tomes are the artifacts (weapons, armor, mounts, etc.) that you discover or create!  So it seems there's a lot of synergies and styles to experiment with.

As to its replayability, I've played only 100 hours, but have only played a handful of the seemingly dozens of tomes which include more spells and abilities or upgrades depending on the style/culture/magic (affinity combinations) you choose to evolve in game.

The graphics look great and definitely add to the game's atmosphere. I play the game on my mac booting up windows.  Have had no notable glitches thus far.

I simply couldn't list all of those improvements without them being the main body of this review, but in general many of the annoyances and roadblocks one might experience in a match of Planetfall are mitigated or outright gone in AoW 4.

However, despite all of AoW 4's functional improvements over Planetfall, the game is completely lacking in terms of story and personality. When playing Planetfall, every world played on had a sense of character, every character and faction had motivations, goals, and ideological divides both internally and externally. As a point of example, I generally have a sort of ""peace and harmony"" strategy when making choices in video game campaigns, but I made several choices in Planetfall scenarios against that mentality on the basis that the characters in those scenarios wouldn't make those decisions. Put simply, the conflicts and characters within Planetfall are well written.

Meanwhile, despite having 3 games of lore to draw from (4 if you count the experience from Planetfall), I only understood what was going on in AoW 4 in the vaguest of ways AFTER beating all of the campaigns. On top of that, some of the conflicts in the scenarios are flat out cop-outs. Without spoiling, the entire conflict that the story builds up to is rendered retroactively pointless and nonsensical, and two of the scenarios cop-out the interpersonal conflict part of the story by making the bad guy corrupted by magic evilness.

All of that would be annoying and frustrating on its own, but what really irritates me is custom/random scenario tools for after you're done with the main story. Things as basic as a lighting change for the world (which the story scenarios have!) are not available, while the features that are there to be customized are heavily stripped down. I can't think of a succinct way of describing how pitiful and lacking the custom world options are beyond saying that you need look no farther than Planetfall to see it done right.

Which brings me to my conclusion: as much as AoW 4 improves on Planetfall in many ways, if this game looks interesting to you, play Planetfall instead.

PS. The AI tries to build cities as close as it can to strategic resources directly around your capital, to a degree that is both blatant and insane. If you don't believe me, this is a steam discussion on the issue, and you can find many more through people noting it through a simple google search: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1669000/discussions/0/5294588689491084454/ . To say that this is infuriating and ridiculous is an understatement; it has made my blood boil throughout much of the early game of nearly every scenario I've played, and single-handedly caused numerous rage-restarts.

City management is boring, there are no city specializations, its just build every building in every city. Deciding where to expand provinces and make special outposts is good, but there are actually not many options for that. 

The ""research"" uses a tome system that is literally just a linear research tree with randomness as to what order you get the options. Its bad. A real research tree would have been so much better. 

The diplomacy system is absolutely awful. They tried to make a complicated system that made diplomacy feel like a sort of global council, but its really an extremely shallow system that hides by locking the player out of direct choices. 

The end turn lag makes the late game unplayable. You will never want to finish a game because by the end you are spending 5x more time waiting for your turn than you will actually playing the game. 

The AI is bad. Really bad. It is extremely passive in battles and on the campaign map.

The battles can be really strategic and interesting, but the game is severely let down by a lack of variety, and the combat system is clearly designed around a single stack vs a single stack. anything beyond that and the game will struggle a lot with lag and the systems in place and strategy really breaks down. Unfortunately by the late game most combat will be several stacks fighting several stacks.

The UI is intuitive.  The graphics, while not mind blowing, are excellent for a turn based strategy game.  The mechanics all work nicely together in a logical way.

I think the most compelling feature is the customization.  You have full control to play on exactly the kind of map you want, against enemies you design, with modifiers and rules you specify.  It's like having mods built in.  Fantastic and really opens up the game to replayability.

- You create your leader, a kind of demi-god to lead your race; from a mighty warrior, champion of its people to a slave-merchant warlock able to alter reality to a goddamn dragon god anything you think of is possible, your leader doesn't need to be from the race you will play.
- Then you create the race with its visual being independent of the racial traits you choose, you want some kind of nimble undead dwarves ? suit yourself, the possibilities are nearly infinite.
- You then pick a faction from a pool of 6 (7 with DLC) each with its unique buildings, units, passive trait and leaning toward a play style that you can ignore if you want to.
- Finally the fun really begins when you select a Tome, Tomes are the tech tree of the game. They give you the ability to buy new units, build strong buildings in your city, cast powerful spells to help you on the map on or battle and even enchant the weapons or even your race itself. There are 6 styles of Tomes each having 5 tiers the first 4 containing 2 tomes. This is how you make your race and your gameplay unique and this is extremely fun even just theorycrafting builds. 

There are some Story maps you can play at start to get used to the system but you will probably use CUSTOM MAPS where you can chose a lot of settings to alter the experience and even some weird victory conditions allowing for a good hundred of hours of chaotic fun.",1702347365,1702347365,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Not tried all the dlc yet. 
Got many hours on AOW3 which I loved.
I was initially disappointed with some of the changes and almost went back to AOW3 but I am glad I stuck with it for a bit longer.
Tweaking some of the options help.
I have noticed quite a few small bugs but nothing serious and never any crash. Never seen any bug in AOW3 though.

The most annoying thing is trying to click on the army and missing and if that region is being seiged it brings up the siege menu and when aborting a spell its annoying to have exist that menu again. Also the city names being so big and showing when zoomed in. You can change some these setting though. Just feels clumsy sometimes and annoying.

The ""Campaign"" feels like a series of completely unrelated missions, that did not come to an end, but ended on a cliff hanger. The second expansion had 0 story to it, 0 Explanation on why Dragons are suddenly walking the earth again. Such missed potential.  On top of that the Young Dragon units you can train, take far to much coddling to be able to evolve into their strong forms, and they seem completely inferior to other Tier 3 units.

The Last expansion... Yeah it has new class, and magic, but the promised story. Is 2 bloody missions. That is it. And once again the story end on an seconded ""To Be continued"" So I have to wait bloody longer for the next expansion to see if they actually want to bring the story to and end, if their writers are even capable of it.

While I do think it is a solid game, the main reason I buy games is the story telling and that is rather lacking.",1700693159,1702300713,False,5,0,0.524071991443634033,0,True,False,False

The AI is atrocious, seemingly designed to be as annoying as possible, throwing down outposts and boxing you in constantly, always expanding in a direct line towards your cities like some sort of fungus, very obviously cheating, very obviously doing it specifically to deny it to you. A viable strategy, and a fun challenge occasionally, but since it's seemingly the only setting, it grows very wearisome very, very, very quickly.

The random map settings are, frankly, something that the dev team should be ashamed of. They compound the irritation of the AI by offering absolutely no settings where AI players aren't crawling all over your borders within only a handful of turns. On the largest possible map setting, in a 1 v 1 map, expect the enemy to be attacking on turn 4. For a small map, that's great, for a ""large map"" it's pathetic. ""Options"" to increase the map size only do so in terms of relative start distance between player empires, and only marginally, if you think the basic functionality of being able to determine how large the map is independent of any other setting is critical to being able to enjoy the game, look elsewhere. Additionally, the options for modifiers on the maps are limited to four, it feels arbitrary and limiting.

No custom map creation. The devs are using a tool for procedural generation that seemingly has some limitations that makes it impossible to create custom maps by hand, further limiting replayability.

Faction options are surprisingly underwhelming. The sandbox nature of the game and the highly customizable aspects of the factions would make it seem that this is not the case, but in reality the cultures you can pick from really don't offer all that much, a handful of units, some rather minor bonuses. There are a few traits you can pick that have more impact on gameplay, but are otherwise not very impressive.

A host of small UI irritations compound as well. For example, when selecting a culture, you get a visual representation of what the units it can field are, but no way of knowing what those units do. It's fine and dandy to show a person with a bow on a horse for feudal, for example, but if you were expecting horse archers, be prepared to be underwhelmed, that's the scout and they aren't really a combat unit. When casting the heal army spell on the overworld, it does not show the health of the army you've selected to cast it on, and what it will be at afterwards, making casting it in a larger game where multiple armies are grouped together sometimes a function of check, open book, cast spell, click army to heal, pause, cancel the spell, double check the armies again, and recast. Reassigning whisperstones is a chore, as there is no interface to see all of your whisperstones, where they are assigned, and reassign them with a single click, you must look through the entire list of cities, select it, select to take back your whisperstone, go back to the whole list of cities, select the one you want, and select assign whisperstone. This issue is compounded if you want to give one to a friendly city, as the option to do so is buried in the ""Settings"" menu, very unintuitive, I'm sure there are numerous players who don't even know that's an option. This is not an exhaustive list of the issues.

Patches have introduced a number of bugs, and even on a powerful computer with a 3080 ti, an i9 processor, an SSD, and 32gb of ram, frame stuttering, audio skipping, and visual artifacts are abundant. 

Lord choices aren't great either, right now you have Champion, Wizard King, and Dragon. Wizard Kings are by far the best option with their superior spellcasting, and Dragons, which were a DLC lord option, are underwhelming, performing best with a big hoard of magic items. Since you can only obtain magic items by clearing the map of mobs, defeating and then executing enemy heroes, or forging them in the item forge, you suffer an early penalty, compounded by the dragon leader having an upkeep cost. Additionally, finding items via exploration is far too slow. 

Exploration is bland, there isn't enough variety in the ancient wonders, and the rewards from them are underwhelming. Custom units which aren't of your starting race aren't worth it, and item rewards lack impact.

Itemization in the game is bland but functional, the introduction of the item forge alleviated the complaint of being almost completely unable to find sufficient equipment for your heroes, and replaced it with the bare reality of how uninspiring the equipment on offer in the game is. You can still make a powerful item, but not one that you'd think ""oh man I can base a whole new build around this.""

Hero powers are in the same category as equipment, bland but functional. Points can be spent to increase your damage output, health, allied unit defenses, and the like, they're good options, but nothing really cool, which is a running theme in this game. The most impactful choices are the abilities to summon or start with extra units, which is to be expected in a war game, but more variety is needed.

Descriptive text in the game for mechanics is weird. They rely on keywords that somehow makes things vaguer. What does Strengthening 3 mean? You have to mouse over it to get a tooltip to see what that does. I pity console players who have to do that with a controller, especially since many popups will have multiple tooltips that should just say +3 Physical damage, or something similar.

Visual customization is highly gated behind the pantheon system, I have no idea why, padding, presumably. The Pantheon system is a bowl full of slightly undercooked spaghetti, bland and not yet ready for consumption. Visual customization options are good, but there aren't enough of them. Literally half of the pantheon is made up of options to unlock new icons for equipment you can make in the item forge... why?

You can fill the pantheon with heroes and lords that have ascended from previous games, but there's almost no point to doing it. Lords will show up as rival empires, and you can set their AI preferences to guide how they play, which would be great, but see my first point about the AI. Pantheon heroes are worthless. Many of the game's most powerful buff spells, used by everyone, are transformations, and these are tied to a specific race. Since heroes will never be of any of the races in the current game (races are generated when you create the faction, and cannot be shared between factions), they will never have those transformations, forcing you to cast it again for one specific hero. Since equipment, levels, and skills do not carry over into the pantheon, there's never any reason to hire a pantheon hero, apart from RP. The main menu shows the lords and heroes from your pantheon arrayed heroically before a portal, but it only shows 5. It's such a weird choice, they're standing in a large plaza, and there's lots of empty space for them to fill still, why limit it? And the second member in the list is the one who stands in front? It's a small issue, but like I said, this is a game where there are tooooons of small irritations that accumulate.

Racial choices are cosmetic only, which is very jarring for returning players to the franchise. Traits can be selected, and the recent switch to a points based system goes some way towards improving this, but it still lacks depth, more work is needed. Mount options for races need better explanations for how they impact cultures.

There's good bones here, but a host of irritations and baffling design choices pile up to make a game that I cannot in good conscience recommend. The dev team is still actively working on it, so wait until the first entire season of DLCs is complete and then check again if you're interested, perhaps these issues will be resolved then.",1702274752,1702274752,False,14,1,0.613088130950927734,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Create your own faction
- Heroes of Might and Magic x Civilisation wonder child
- Freedom to go the path you want (Unless you want to be evil)
- Epic campaigns with your friends and custom maps you can edit to your liking
 

Cons:
- Crashes
- Multiplayer crashes
- New games crashes
- You can work around the crashes but crashes eventually
- Devs dont want you to be evil, unless you want to face a -20% penalty on events, and then it crashes.
- Diplomacy is a formality (that also crashes) that constantly bullies you to be in war all the time or be boxed in, preventing you from expanding.

Definitely one of those ""one-more-turn"" games. Crafting your own faction is a lot of fun and the highly customizable options allow you to make your own fun.

Graphics for the units are a touch on the cartoonish side in some aspects, but this has always been a feature of the series and doesn't really hurt it that much. Other than that, they do a good job and the artstyle of icons and world-map is really fitting, readable, and charming.

Sound are alright and lend themselves well to relaxed gameplay.

As Paradox is just the publisher and not the developer, it seems that DLC-content-farming is not a big problem and every DLC is actually worth looking at, instead of another lazy cashgrab.

The devs in general are very good, seem happy to communicate, and actively try to improve the game. I would rate them as one of the few in the industry that actually still do such things.

The AI does need a little help and setting it to ""hard"" or higher is something you should do as soon as you understand the basic mechanics of the game. Otherwise they will struggle to synergize the game's many feature as well as a human will.

If you like turn-based games and want something that scales quite well from simple to the complex (with good chained battle-abilities), then I would highly recommend this game, even when it isn't on sale.

For the uninitiated, this is a 4X strategy game with great combat and good empire building, with a heavy focus on customization.  Age of Wonders 4 is very similar to 3 but improves on it in several ways; Provinces are a better way of handling expansion, Sieges and initiating combat are vastly improved, no longer can you lose a city because one random wild bird walked in.  Research is still random but better with the ability to shuffle or lock particular goals.  

The biggest new feature is the ability to create your own faction.  It's fun to build a race of mystic cat people or whatever, but it does mean that it's harder to know what to expect from looking at your enemies, and there's no flavor text for units either.  

I was initially planning on recommending the game; it does a lot of things right and all of the different major faction paths that I tried felt fun and strong in their own way.  But even playing six months after release it seems to be fairly buggy, enough to significantly hamper the experience.  Issues I experienced in 35 hours of play:

-The game will regularly send you ""This city can annex a new Province"" notifications even if there are no Provinces available.
-AI players will ignore enemy spawners and let their territory get pillaged over and over.  Spawners get stronger if not taken care of and several times I found a borderline invincible spawner with multiple stacks of top-tier units near an AI.
-A city that I conquered and vassalized suddenly became un-conquered when the owner died on the same turn.
-I started a premade scenario with a ""only one city allowed"" rule, removed the ""only one city allowed"" rule, but I still couldn't create additional cities.
-The goal in another premade scenario was to defeat 3 strong AI players.  I defeated two of the three, but while I was fighting the others someone else beat the last one and instead of having some fallback goal, this made the scenario unwinnable and I had to switch to one of the standard victory conditions.
-Other miscellaneous bugs like a crash to desktop or various skills not working properly.",1701831351,1701831351,False,3,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

The game now easily runs at 60 frames a second at 4k with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, AMD Radeon 7900 XTX and 32 gb of RAM DDR5). 

In terms of gameplay Age of Wonders 4 is exactly what I wanted as a sequel to Age of Wonders 3, great tactical combat, gorgeous overview maps and a lot of replayability because of all the customisation options that are given to the player, i.e. different races, starting boons, different tomes and cultures. With all these options, it still feels fresh to start a new game because you can easily change up your gameplay style. 

I especially enjoy the new addition of districts for cities (akin to games like civilization) where you need to choose which areas you want to acquire next. This makes the acquisition of certain areas more tactically relevant than in the previous game. 

On the graphical front, the game has also really improved on its predecessor. The overview map especially feels more alive and vibrant (moving trees, operating mine animation and more graphical effects in general). When you have multiple cities, and connecting roads, it really feels like you have created a little empire. And last but not least, the seamless transition from the general overview map to a more stylized physical map is really nice. 
Some points that do warrant improvement in my opinion are as follows:

-	The ocean combat does feel a bit lackluster and could be improved upon;
-	Combat spells could be a bit more graphically impressive as well in the sound design department;
-	The underground map feels a bit boring and less content rich than the above ground map.

First, The pace of tech even on the slowest setting is so fast that it is unenjoyable. You barely have time to use a spell before everything is upgraded. This changes the battles so quickly that you can't really apply old favorites so much as constantly use new ones. This is not a game for someone who likes a developing story.

Second, you don't really get a feeling of the individuality of each faction. The stories might seem different only at first and then they are basically the same for all the factions. This really minimises the immersion of any of the narrative parts.

If you're new to Age of Wonders, don't worry too much - Unless you are desperate to learn how The Second Age (AoW2 & Shadow Magic) plays out, The Fourth Age does a good job of welcoming newcomers into the fold whilst giving returning players something to look forward to.

To recap the Third Age, you had campaigns with a strong narrative focus to them.  Some of them were relatively easy to get into, but there were instances that felt like you were playing a Square Enix game where the difficulty spikes all of a sudden.  The learning campaign didn't waste time knocking you around like that.  If you were one of the players walked passed the campaigns and played Random Map or jump into multiplayer, can't say I blame you because did exactly that.  AoW: Planetfall's campaigns objective focused whilst taking on the openness of a random map, AoW4 continues this open campaign style - I can understand why Triumph might've gone that route, but I to SOME degree I can appreciate the sentiments regarding the lack of a story focused campaign.  Whilst the story heavy stuff is great for getting a feel for all the world building that goes into these games, the open nature of the game does allow newcomers the opportunity to learn at their own pace without having to jump through any potentially brutal scripted hurdles.  Given that AoW4 builds upon the insane level of customisation from AoW3, this game offers the level of DIY world building one would expect from Dungeons & Dragons.

So what is Age of Wonders?

It's a Roleplaying Grand Strategy franchise - You manage your empire and statecraft affairs 4X overworld map, whilst battles are fought as classic turn-based RPG encounters...  Unless you prefer to ""Roll"" your battles via the ol' Auto-Resolve.
Whilst Planetfall was the exception being a 1980's inspired space opera, Age of Wonders is typically a high fantasy themed franchise.  The basic rules of a game come down to this:  Your chosen/created ""Hero"" (statesman) and your Throne City (starting city/capital) are your ""King Pieces"".  Slay a player's avatar and sack their Throne City before their hero can respawn, they've suffered a Military Defeat.  Otherwise, you have an assortment of goals similar to Sid Meier's Civilization.

Age of Wonders 4 builds upon Planetfall's annexation system, where you are able to expand from an existing population centre by placing an exploitation (improvement) on an available territory connected to your given city's border.  This particular system really fleshed out the city building aspect of AoW compared to AoW3.  Near as what I can tell, unless there's a mod or I missed the flavour text in one of the realm creation options - There's no Nomadic start, something I miss from AoW3.  For most people, AoW4's world building comes from creating your hero and empire.  Sure, you're going to have your ""Min-Maxxers"".  But, your average roleplayer is going to be taking their time considering the options best suited for the character their looking to play.  Expect to be spending a good chunk of time in the creation suites if you are a roleplayer, because you're going to be setting up realms too.  It's a good thing you have a nice assortment of pre-constructed realms and characters, because some times you might want to get a feel for what you can create for your next session or just roleplay with what the developers took the time to craft.

Soundtrack for Age of Wonders has had some memorable pieces by Michiel van den Bos, Age of Wonders 3 being the recent of them.  Age of Wonders 4 like Planetfall takes on more ""Soundscape"" oriented musical soundtrack - If you were more partial to AoW3, this soundtrack isn't going keep you captivated.  Chances are, you will let play out once or twice before firing up something like Spotify.

While the intricacies of the fantasy world and the expansive character customization are commendable, the frequent downtime may test the patience of some players.

It did however appear in my friends game despite them not owning the DLC. I reinstalled the game to check if it was simply an issue with files and it was exactly the same.

[b][u]The Pros:[/u][/b]

* Faction editor allows an unprecedented level of customization. Marauding elves, orc paladins, dwarf mages, and other combinations, both traditional and unusual, are all possible and work well due to the ability to fine tune your faction's bonuses via a point buy system.
* Six base cultures (+1 in the Ashes and Empires DLC) and two ruler types (+1 in the Dragons Dawn DLC) with multiple types of traits to choose from means you'll be able to try new and different builds for a long, long time.
* The customization extends into map generation, allowing for fine tuning of the world parameters, map size, neutral and marauder spawn types, and region-wide hazards.
* The game is highly-moddable and the community is full of talented and eager modders, allowing for even greater replayability and customization.
* As usual for an Age of Wonders game, the combat is very involved and deep, with a large variety of units from cultures, Tomes, and other sources, allowing for many different playstyles and strategies.

[b][u]The Cons:[/u][/b]

* The heavy emphasis on Tomes of Magic and strategic spells means the world map is now far less populated, lacking interactive objects or unique dwellings like past games. Rulers and factions are 
* Your choice of culture starts mattering less and less as you transition into the mid and late game, where units unlocked from Tomes of Magic tend to be far more powerful and synergistic.
* The story-driven campaign modes of 4X games are rarely standouts, and this one is about as anemic as one can get while still being present. It also doesn't even resolve the core conflict, which is still ongoing through the current (Nov. 2023) DLCs. Hopefully the last DLC will resolve the storyline.
* While some of the races and classes from earlier games can be recreated using the new mechanics, others can't. The Frostlings of 3 aren't a playable race, but instead a transformation for any race to undergo, and there's no equivalent to the Dreadnought class of 3, with the closest thing being the DLC-locked Reavers culture... which has its own oddities that make it play very differently from the Dreadnoughts of old.
* No unit lore. There's plenty of lore about concepts new to the franchise and call-backs to earlier games, but if you want to know what your people think of your armies, you'll just have to iamgine it on your own. You can't even create in-game lore pages for your units or heroes, you just have to keep them in your mind.

Overall, I'd recommend this for people who enjoy turn-based combat and 4X games, and people who want to create their own custom factions and play them in a 4X game. I wouldn't recommend this if you're a very lore-driven or story-driven sort of person, since this game goes pretty light on those aspects. But then, 4X games tend to go light on those anyway, don't they?",1701259135,1701259159,True,0,1,0.494117677211761475,0,True,False,False

1. you accept that your game might crash on occasion and is relatively buggy - this is not made by an AAA dev and it shows.
2. you understand that all the faction creation stuff, all the fantasy & rp aspects that they market the game so hard around, are extremely superficial, essentially coating for is essentially a Civ game. Nothing more, nothing less. If you have not played AoW before and are not into the ""4x"" genre, you will probably regret this purchase because the advertising will totally lead you into it with the wrong idea.
3. Your options are quite limited without the DLC.

If you are considering buying this game, I'd recommend you to wait until you can purchase AoW + all DLC for at least 50% off, or preferably 75%. You will likely still walk away disappointed but at least you won't feel like you've wasted your precious money.

Even years later, when AoW 3 came out I bought it but I barely played it and went back to replay AoW: SM instead.

Now, about AoW 4 ... the game had been in my wishlist until it's release but I was hesitant buying it, fearing a simplified or dumbed down version of the AoW franchise, just like AoW 3 was ... and now I'm happy to say that I was wrong. I enjoy almost everything about AoW 4:

The fights are fun, engaging and can be challenging. As I play, I also get better as I learn to master my own units and have better ideas of what to expect from my ennemies. 

The 4x aspect of the game is not complicated, but it is deep enough that it is possible to build very different empires from one game to the other.

The RPG aspects are as fun as ever. It is quite rewarding to see your heros and leader become more and more powerful. In some other games, it is a tedious process that leads to an unrewarding endgame, but this is not the case here for me.

Content wise, even without DLCs, there's a lot to play with and enjoy for a long time ... I'm guesstimating that I could play another 55 hours (time played at time of writing this review) before I even think about looking at the DLCs.

Unit power is a bit tricky to understand, mid tier worlds can upgrade faster than you can and if you aren't quick about taking care of monster nests you can have Tier V units at your doorstop by ~turn 25.  Expansions have been good and added contents I like to see.  I would like to seem them optimize the engine for lots of minor nation and unit buffs as the game starts chugging near the end, especially in the preview window.  The computer cheats, not sure how or why but it seems to disconnect and rollback after fights where things went poorly for it.  It also very rarely just rolls the game back a bit.  I've only seen these issues in multiplayer and they show up as sync issues, but it's never showed up when I got crushed by the computer, only when I've won impossible battles.  Likely a statistical anomaly, but it's happened 5-7 times in the last 48 hours.  I win a fight manually that auto resolve said all of my units die in, I lose no units and the turn crashes while it's calculating the back end of the battle.  Get the turn reverted, go back into the fight, and the map is different, the AI acts differently and now I have to sacrifice a couple of units to win the fight... VERY annoying but rare.  

The AI also tends to suicide low health units instead of keeping them back which can make prolonged forays difficult to do in multiplayer unless you like making your friends watch you handle combat manually constantly.  Dragon commanders have the worst auto-resolve rations.  Once you've picked up tail swipe and your breath, you can easily crush most armies with twice you commander's value just by himself.  It tends to keep the Dragon commander is reserve WAY too much as they will often exit the auto battle with no damage but kill 2-5 of your units on fights your commander can take solo for less than 15 HP.  Which also means you'll be manually resolving fights constantly with your Dragon Commander, but, that's in the Dragon's Dawn expansion, just consider this an example of how the AI doesn't know what to do with all of the units.",1701197256,1701197256,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

A very good game in its current state, with the possibility to play good, evil, or neutral regardless of your magic choices. Unlike AoW3, you are not locked into your choice of magic at the beginning of the game, but can pick and choose from magical tomes to develop towards any form of magic during the game.

Unlike AoW3, you do not have to stall unit production to make builders, settlers, etc non-combat units. These functions (road building, outposts, cities) are handled by regular units and heroes. You also produce city improvements in a separate queue, allowing for simultaneous unit production and city improvements. This makes the game more fast-paced, but on the other hand, you cannot simply capture cities in one turn; you need to start a siege process with a hero present near the city for a few turns in order to be able to attack a city. This means that even though the game is faster paced, the defender receives fair warning and can gather their people to try and defend the city while it is besieged.

Species are fully customizable, you can make forest dwarves, cave elves, super strong frogs, or swamp cats if you like. The species is also independent of magic choice or even leader type; your leader can be a dragon while your species is cats, for example. 

I have only a single negative thing to say about the game -- default scenario timer of 150 turns is too low to achieve conquest victory, or pretty much any victory other than score in most scenarios when playing on hard. It would be more fun if all of the default worlds had a timer of 200 or 300 turns, without having to go and customize it. Special score scenarios are fine though, where the idea is to reach score fast before the turn limit hits, but that is not my idea of the core AoW experience.

In the versions before the Golem patch, the AI took very long to do their turns, but in the current version I am very happy with the AI performance and the game.

There have also been some visual glitches for effects introduced with new items, but these seem to be quickly fixed by the developers. I have had next to no crashes running this on Proton on Ubuntu.

[b]In short: if Civilization games partnered with Heroes of Might and Magic (rest in peace), this would be their child.[/b] And, oh god, isn't it such a beatiful thing?

I've always had a soft spot for strategy games. I grew up with RTS mostly, but I'm no stranger to Turn-Based 4X or Tactics (my favorite genre). It all started with HoMM3 and onward with Civilization 3 and many others from then on...

To be frank, I didn't really know much about this franchise... I've owned AoW3 and didn't play it much, as I thought it was an ugly game for its generation. Moreover, 4X games tend to be somewhat exhausting as matches can last for days and some have annoying little micromanagement quirks. [b]This is not the case in Age of Wonders 4.[/b]

To elaborate, this is a game that rewards your creativity and doesn't require much knowledge or the previously mentioned genres. It is a very solid entry into 4X and turn based strategy. A lot of it's inner workings are rather simple: you have a throne city, which you must expand by capturing provinces (in game tiles) and a ruler, who acts like a hero/general unit that you can level up through combat agaisnt other factions or neutral armies. On top of that, as your turns pass by, you research magic by choosing tomes, each containing a few reseach projects that last a few turns each to complete. Here is where the beauty of this game shines through.

As stated before, this is a game that rewards your creativity a lot:
[list]
[*]You may play with any of the default rulers and their races or create your own.

[*]In the tomes system, you can make an absurd number of combinations: Want some evil elf barbarians? Game got you. Ruled by a dragon overlord? Got'cha. Eventually transform your people into draconic hybrids? Hell yeah, brutha :v

[*]As you progress through the story or random matches, be them online or single player, you unlock cosmetics and traits to further increase your options when creating races and rulers.

[*]Several events in the game in which you are presented choices which will impact the way your game develops, or even the race you created, by obtaining permanent traits through the outcomes of such events.

[*]Lords you have won games with in realms can be ascended, which allows you to have them in your games as recruitable heroes or even allies rulers, maybe you'll see some of your creations as oponents or free cities you can annex or vassalize.

[*]Every race is different from one another: different units, aesthetic and the way they usually play, their advantages and disadvantages. Some rewarding an evil playthrough or good one. Because, yes, there is an alignment meter which will come into play for your available decisions in random events.

[*]Every tome you choose will have an assortment of enchantments to augment your racial units (poison arrows, frost weapons, anyone?), spells to use either in combat or the world map or even more units (!!) which can determine your strategies not only in battle, but as you reach out for victory.

- Very poorly done online mode, constant desirchrons and crashes

- This is Paradoxes - expect 100500 DLC with exorbitant prices, but quality, so it's not a definite disadvantage.

- The bot is given too obvious advantage - they immediately possess armies several times larger than the player's army, and regardless - campaign, or sandbox. I've seen several times a just-killed hero respawn in a besieged city with a full army, leaving my battered one no chance. Instead of better AI, the developers just let the bots cheat. You could introduce a neural network that would learn from the player as they play to counter them as another player, but that's a conversation not for review

- The doctrines from the Pantheon don't feel powerful, not even remotely powerful. Interesting, yes, but they don't offer any special advantages as standard

This is one of the best strategy games I've ever played.

For one thing, it nails a very important quality that I look for in games. It's simply fun to play. It looks good, sounds good, loads quickly, and is pretty much seamless when it comes to getting you into the game and giving you the tools you need to start playing.

In particular, I like the 'Resume' option I can pick from the launcher. It drops me straight back into my most recent saved game in a matter of seconds. It makes booting up the game and jumping back in a breeze.

Performance has been excellent for me. I play on a decently powerful gaming laptop, and even at max settings it doesn't tax my system. The game looks great and runs smoothly.

Art direction is great too. I love inspecting all the different monsters and units (and there are a LOT) and the options for creating and customizing your own race/ruler are all incredibly cool and detailed.

Which leads me to the games biggest feature, and, I think, the biggest selling point.

Essentially, you can (and should) be creating a custom race/ruler almost every game you play. I have. Every single game, I create a unique fantasy race that's all my own. I customize their 'form' which is race, their alignment (think faith, nature, evil, etc.) and then I can customize their appearance. After that, once you're actually in the game, you customize them further by researching different trees of magic.

Magic research is done using 'tomes' which range from Tier I all the way up to Tier V. Tier V magic has game altering spells that can single-handedly turn the tide of a war. But the tome that you pick to take up to tier V will influence the appearance and traits of your race.

For example, in my last game I was playing a race of imperialist noble orcs, and I researched an order tome up to tier V. In parallel, I researched the astral magic tome up to tier IV. Using the various enchantments gained by these tomes I modified my race, so that at the end of the game, my golden, shining orcs had angelic wings, blue magical scars, and were wreathed in electricity.

It's a blast to create and then guide the formation of your own race, and I'm excited to play another game and do it all over again.

In conjunction with this custom race feature, AOW4 has a meta-progression unlock tree that you complete as you complete maps. You earn unlocks based on how well you do, and it adds another level of incentive to keep playing. For a 4X game, this sort of progression is novel and fun. I'm used to having no reward for completing a game, so its neat to be able to earn a cool cosmetic unlock.

I know I haven't touched on the meat of 4X gameplay, but so far, it's as good if not better than AOW3. Expansion and campaign strategy revolves around building provinces around our cities, as well as negotiating treaties and alliances with neutral cities. All of this is fun, engaging, and easy to wrap your head around.

Diplomacy with other races seems to be well fleshed-out, and I find myself inclined to negotiate rather than just to automatically go to war with the AI.

The combat is great. I love the turn based tactical battles, and you can come up with some ridiculous combos by combining certain traits with spells that compliment them.

To sum up, if you like strategy or 4X games, you owe it to yourself to try this game.",1683311780,1701102592,True,21,0,0.603821873664855957,0,True,False,False

I've played a ton of AOW3 and Planetfall and this is in some ways a combination of those two but with plenty of new stuff thrown in the mix. So far I'm finding AOW4 full of personality and charm. The game has a number of new mechanics that work well. The race customization combined with the tome system allows for tons of customization both before and during play. This game has an even greater emphasis on capturing legendary sites and engaging with independent cities than the previous AOWs. They also are updating regularly, and while parts of these updates are paid DLC there are free components that are moving the game in a positive direction. So far I'm very satisfied with the game and think it is a worthwhile addition to a series that I have many hundreds of hours of playtime in.

I haven't played enough yet to know how the endgame tends to play out. I have found that each AOW game has it's own rhythm and flow and you have to find the sweet spot to get the most enjoyment out of them. I also don't play multiplayer so I cannot comment on that.

I have noticed some reviews complain that the race customization options take away from their enjoyment of the game because any race can do anything. I am quite baffled by this criticism and I wonder if the devs changed something in one of the updates before I started playing. It is true that you have tons of customization options and can make any race play any way that you wish but each race has default traits and you have to go out of your way to turn these off. Anyone who prefers races with a clear personality and focus will find that in this game. The races are also quite fun, from traditional humans, orcs, dwarves, elves and goblins to fast cat people, hearty mole people and chaotic rat people, plus more in the DLCs.

AoW4 is a fantasy 4x strategy game with turn based combat, think total war warhammer(the only game I can think of that I've played that isn't the previous AoW3) but each army has a max stack of 6 instead of 20 and a lord leading that army is optional, the battles are turn based instead of real time and each unit has maybe 8 models in it instead of the massive formations of TWW.
It's biggest strength is customisation without a doubt, how picking and choosing map traits from what type of map, to types of NPCs that spawn and various 'fun' modifiers like enemies coming back to life after killing them, or map tiles randomly change every turn, etc. After build-a-map next you design your civ including what they look like, their physical traits, culture and its traits then finally you get to pick a starting tome(self-contained upgrades, spells, units, buildings per tome). Once that's done your ruler is next, this is the character that will lead your civ when playing in game, customisation options here are very similar to rpg character creators if you've played any. 
When in game you progress the tech tree via tomes as you pick and choose what you like, looks cool, fits your build or going for a certain theme. As you unlock more tomes, your units will change depending on your tome choice both visually and gameplay wise. Once finishing a game, your ruler maybe able to ascend into your pantheon and you'll get a few points to spend on special traits, unlocking cosmetic items or in-game skins for the item forge. All of this doesn't feel boring as each new game thereafter is completely different and keeps me on my toes on what should I do next or differently.
I think the weakest aspect of the game is the campaign because of the customisation, it does not get me attached to the hero of the story(my custom civ/ruler) so I feel disconnected, that's just me personally and you might not get this if you play it, that's understandable. 
A small thing I noticed with AoW4 when compared with AoW3 is how the devs made sieges far better in that only rulers/heroes can start a siege and I no longer have to fear random animals walking into my cities, declaring themselves king and my population turning on me the moment I out of movement range of the city.",1701047389,1701047389,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Note that my review is entirely from a single player perspective.

There's a lot to talk about here, but the key points (from me) are:

- Extreme Customisation: Each race can intermix with a variety of civilisation types, which can also match across a variety of magic types. Entire maps (worlds) are randomly-generated with player input. 

- Robust Magic System: If you like to get all in-depth with your magic types, you'll have fun here. Explore the ends of power in several unique schools of magic. Spells are used at a World, Army, and Combat level. 

- Good UI: With so much information available at any given time, AoW4 does a good job making everything easily accessible. I believe good UI is important for long-term engagement, and Age of Wonders 4 makes the game easily accessible to those familiar with 4X games at a surface level, but it's also structured to feel familiar to experienced players. 

- Steam Workshop Integration: While I'm generally not in to modding my games at all, the Workshop here does offer many tweaks to affect the game.  In my case, I use a mod that provides some better unit scaling for combat and I still get Steam achievements.

The AI and difficulty can be disastrous, however. AI and the interplay between NPC entities and the player are downright bad at times. Additionally, vassals cannot be trusted for help without explicitly directing it, which felt odd. On a global scale, it's very difficult to 'make friends' with the AI, as it feels very easily for everything to degrade into squabble and battle. For example, my lawfully-good humans won by conquest (naturally), vs my full-evil frostlings winning by diplomatic victory (difficultly). It's kind of a case where modern AI thinking just devolves in to ""combat"" so I hope this can improve.

Some players like how races transform as they gain power, some players do not like this.  What you need to know is this: you can have a race of cat people who can evolve in to beings that are not cats, thereby making them less 'cat people' and more 'new people'. Like, a cat person who is also made of tree. Or fire.  Or frost.  It's going to happen, so - be warned, I guess.

It's not perfect, but Age of Wonders 4 is a great, modern fantasy civilisation strategy game with a focus on all the good stuff like Heroes and Hero types, races and abilities, underground worlds, independent city states, battles of good / evil, allegiances born and failed; there's just a lot to take in.  It's most definitely in the conversation for Game of the Year, but in a year with so many great titles, AoW4 is an underdog.

Get it in a bundle with DLC if you think you'll probably be interested, otherwise just wait for a deep discount and grab it then.  In either case, you won't be disappointed.

If you don't like my comment fine.  If you like some of the things I do not, fine.   Only thing I'll say to that is for good studios to make good games that people like, they need new blood too, just just aow fans.  Anyways with that outta the way...

This game is meh.   Just meh.  
The pantheon is mostly cosmetic unlocks?  Like fucking icons?  Are you serious right now?  (I said mostly btw, yes there are some other things in there but the fact that most of it is literally icons/skins for gear that you can make/get.  No unique properties or anything, just a skin that you can barely see in game.  

The spell diversity is cool until you realize it's a roulette to get what you want, nothing tells you that you can navigate the books like you can, and frankly there is just way too much to actually enjoy.   Usually I wouldn't say that but lets say you're going to do a marathon level game and you want to take your campaign over time.  In games like civ, it all kinda comes in together for the most part.  I find the pacing and the needs of the game are quite in sync.  In this game, you can conquer the world before you get through that many tomes, especially on huge maps.

Maps are not reflective of the size they should in terms of gameplay and feel.  If the map is supposed to be huge, that map should take a hella long time just to find someone nevermind finish.  By what standard are we working this at?  The maps are small for what we have to do imo. 

Combat is right click and go.  Try to stack as much units as you can, very little strategy.  The fractal nature of the tech/spell tree means that a good portion of combat in games like this is missing and that's the setup overworld bit.  There are spells, just one here on this tome, one over there on another.  You can pick the tome and hopefully you get it as an option to research or you spend resource to reroll your research target.
Unfortunately there is no way to play the game without going past the 2 hour limit for a refund because it really just takes that long to even get into the thing.  The tutorial is a joke, I still do not know what the hell draft really does.  

Building has no flavour to it.  Farm, mine, conduit, research, logging mill and then some speciality stuff at the end which really doesn't give much at all really.  Just make sure you know youre prereqs and you're fine.  And lets face it, the prereqs are only for a few buildings and you'd have to go really meatheaded to not be able to meet them all.  Not cool things like in civ air strips or forts, that sort of thing.  Just meh.  

Nothing new feels good.  It's all just feels extremely clunky with clear ui/pathing errors/misteps/overlooks that would help streamline and help qol.  But hey that's all games these days.  As always the modders will save us.  

For it's price, with the dlc the price it is, I would  just go play aow3.  A way better game imo.",1701039900,1701039900,False,4,0,0.470149248838424683,0,True,False,False

So, after 45 hours - the vote is absolutely YES, get this game!

My main grievance (no pun intended) with AoW3 was the combat system that was awful and boring. 
Age of Wonders 4 changes that and ups it several notches! The combat feels fresh, challenging and the AI is much better at determining the course of action. Even normal AI seems very challenging which is a plus. The strategic map behavior is sometimes still confusing though, but it is nowhere near what AoW3 used to be in terms of how AI organizes its armies and how it determines which city to occupy etc.

One pretty big caveat with AoW4 though, is the lack of map creator tool. Custom maps are what gave this franchise such a modding appeal and as someone who loved making maps for the previous games, I am disappointed we can't do the same, especially now that we have so much customization with how the races and heroes look like! It's such a shame that they add one amazing feature only to disable the other. The auto generated maps still look amazing, but the lack of detailed design options is certainly a bummer.

I'm aware that devs have already confirmed map editor IS NOT coming in the future updates, but at the very least, it would be nice if they allowed for more specific map generation options / sliders such as 
more/less mountains, more/less rivers, etc. What I'm also missing big time is the ability to pick and choose where each opponent spawns (or at least what biome). There something specifically annoying when Nekron spawns in a beautiful valley surrounded with fairies and just keeps the place tidy  and neat throughout the game while marching with Orcs through the lands.

So all in all, the game is definitely an improvement over the past iterations, but the map generation seems to take a step back.

tldr;

I absolutely recommend Age of Wonders 4! Combat and Strategy are vastly improved, the graphics are amazing, and the ability to create your own race/leader with plenty of options is amazing. However, the lack of detailed map customization is a big minus, which downgrades the game from being 10/10 to 8/10.",1701022898,1701022898,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
1669000,152086208,76561198150336754,0,8,5666,0,5659,1701633168,"Overall a quite enjoyable game. If you liked Age of Wonders: planetfall you'll like this one as well. The game looks really nice, I really like the artstyle the animations the whole thing. The DLC faction and dragon lords are amazing (granted they are DLC but still at least they deliver). Also the whole system with the race alterations that visually show up on all your units is really nice.
Buuuuut there are a few things that are really irksome.

Main thing is the AI. Its dumb as a bag of rocks. The enemy cheats (spawning units from thin air completing construction quicker that sort of thing) which i think is fine because otherwise it would be way too easy. Where it becomes annoying as all hell is when you get the bright idea that you don't want to murder everyone. Now in that case the AI is really nice and rewards you with blocking you in with outposts, taking all of the free city vassals and just generally being really annoying.
And diplomacy is a joke you can sell territory to AI but you can never buy it (which would really easily solve the blocking in problem)

The other thing is the story. In previous titles in a campaign there was some persistent characters that you got to level up gather some good artefacts and so forth. Here there is not even a campaign. You have story realms that are technically campaign missions but for example if you want to play the whole thing with one leader you are starting lvl 1 on every map. And the storyline is kinda all over the place as well. Fair enough this last one is pretty subjective but i still want to point it out. But hey maybe you'll like it.

So yeah if you want a good turn based strategy game then its a good buy. If you liked Age of wonders: planetfall i can whole heartedly recommend it.
If you want to play something akin to Age of Wonders 1 or 3 then only go for it if you are willing to put up with the above mentioned things.

I am giving this 4.5/5 for now.
The AoW series is has a history of releasing an acceptably interesting game with flaws, then massively improving that through a single year season pass that spices it up into something with significantly more depth and replay-ability. Very good at keeping an eye on player feedback for that time, but afterwords it falls off significantly while they shift to making the next entry.
This is no exception. If the next few DLC are like the first two, this is going to be an amazing game by the end of it, but IMO DLC required for that quality experience. QoL updates are released throughout the year for everyone, regardless of DLC, but most of the most interesting mechanics and world building usually happens in the additional paid content, based on Paradox's history with the series.
I would call this a 3/5 purchase if you aren't planning on getting the DLC. You'll get your money's worth, then likely get bored. 
I also fully expect that the full DLC included finalized game is going to be 5/5, worth every cent, but we won't know until it's dropped. In the meantime, I suggest patience while we wait for the rest of the content. Definitely a solid choice if you're hurting for a 4x, but remember that the final experience is still coming.
I am NOT saying that they released an incomplete product, or that this is functionally Early Access. I believe that the primary product is acceptable, and that the player feedback after release is necessary to finalize polishing the game.",1690225828,1700946265,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

After playing the most recent Empires and ashes, i must admit i like where the game is going. Item crafting is cool, they fixed the blandness of the sea, there are mods that fix the budget cut versions of the female chest. If i could have just one gripe it would be that underground empires are not very viable. You get one massive cavern for your starting city, and unless you conquer other underground living empires you wont really get a good economy going unless you venture topside, because all other caverns are set to be 4 provinces large so at most they are viable for settling and releasing as vassals.

""Campaign"" could be better thought out, right now it's okay, but not engaging and is mostly based on events occuring in what seems like a normal game, would prefer more ""scenario"" feel to each campaign map. Also kinda wish that ""themed"" builds were powerful enough on higher difficulties",1700918232,1700918232,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Civ VI kind of sucks in the grand scheme of things. It has some highly irritating elements of gameplay that outright do not exist in this game. Furthermore the kind of blend between Heroes of Might and Magic + 4x is done so well in Age of Wonders 4.

But, the true incredible value of this game is it supports offline multiplayer. People can take their turns when they want on their own time. There is no ""host"" per se. Not everyone has to be playing at the same time. This is fantastic and I'm unsure of any other games that do this? If anyone knows please leave a comment.

On top of the fantastic support for multiplayer the game runs [i]as a Windows app[/i] perfectly. You can ALT-Enter in and out of window mode all you want. And when you resize the game Window the game scales accordingly. And if that wasn't enough it even support Windows 11 snap groups from the layout panel. So on my dual ultrawide setup I can snap AOW4 and Discord into a snap group on monitor two and either 1) Play a whole other game full screen on my main monitor or 2) Play another windowed game and/or other productivity tasks while this game sits waiting for my turn.

I will admit there is one unfortunate thing which is the game does crash fairly often. And I guess by ""fairly often"" this is when my PC or other games crash never. So maybe this game crashes once in 10ish hours. But the game loads fast and since it is supporting modern Windows 11 features I'm sure it will improve as time goes on.",1700879408,1700879408,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

1) Editor of your ruler and race

4) Siege mechanics, tome mechanics and city building are top notch (better than ever in the series)
5) The realams creation is wonderful and should get even more options (especially scenarios like three challengers to the throne)
6) Autobattles (with good AI), replays and the undon button are something any strategy would envy
7) I also like allied victories and the fact that you can play multiple games simultaneously
8) devs are really supportive with their game, which make the whole studio wholsome

1) Very poor optimization, the game is not very stable, the servers can't handle it

3) Arbitrary victory conditions kills roleplay aspects

The one thing i personally dislike is how the story was done, it being much shorter and streamlined in the base game, nonexistent in the dragon dlc, but being short if matching planetfalls story dlc with the empire and ashes dlc.

I'm going to hop around a bit as I'm pretty tired after playing quite a bit on this first day. I encountered no bugs of any kind other than not being able to claim some of my free bonus loot but I doubt that loot really matters much anyway.

Multiplayer has to have some pretty awesome replay value as well but I didn't try it and probably won't.

I created my own realm of elves which I also customized and started a custom game. I was planning to go full evil necro but my neighbors were so nice I ended up being really good and having many allies and being an all around upstanding citizen. Then a stinky Halfling decided to settle a province that I had claimed and the evil side of me shined. Now I still have 2 allies but I'm at war with 6 others. It's a total blast.

The siege maps are much larger than AoW3 and the fights are much larger than any that I saw. So many buffs, resistances and ways around them too that initially no one path seems over powering. You aren't locked in to one path either as you can research whatever tomes you want every time you finish one.  There are tons of buildings now and many have certain requirements and many also lock you out of building some other ones so you won't have 5 cities with the same 10-12 buildings like most games of this genre. You can have 5 cities with several similar building and several totally different and unique to them in your empire. It's a huge improvement over any of the similar games that I can think of.

So yes I recommend this game and I'm very happy with it even dropping the extra cash for the premium version. No buyers remorse here. It's not 100% perfect but it's really good and I really enjoyed it.

I usually hit on all the negatives when I do a review. The only one that I can think of is that it needs even more options when setting up a new game. Options like having no underground, teams, etc.. Maybe some of these are in and I just missed them but that was the only thing I really see so far that can be improved. It is open to mods right now at release which is awesome and I'm sure there's already modders working away at making some awesome mods that will make it even more customizable. So that negative isn't really an issue, just something I'd like to see added in the future.

cheers, I hope that you enjoy it as much as I am.

I deleted my long explanation about how the ai is bad after the recent update, which made the ai somewhat normal compared to other games. 

Your cities can't be taken just by a simple scout unit walking into it (compared to AoW I-III). Cities can be fortified so that they have to be sieged. That IS a good point for me. Loosing a metropolis just because a pathfinder walks in was just so... frustrating and strange.
Like in AoW Planetfall, you expand your cities strategically by one province for every count of population you gain. That needs more planning, but is somehow more entertaining and rewarding (and a bit more realistic?) than having it growing spherically.
On the world map, you see the shadows and outlines of mountains and larger structures even in the fog of war. I like that much more than going forth a single hex and ""Oh look, a mountain! Haven't seen it from miles ago."".
In terms of worldmap and battlemap the game is more condensed. You are reaching the enemies faster on both maps. You might have had 15+ cities in the earlier installments of the serie, but I never liked to mage 15 cities equally. And then you produce dozens of units to fight multiple enemy armies, some in the every same way. In AoW 4, four to six cities are enough and you have two or three armies (considering of multiple stacks) going in for the fight, which take place in smaller maps, too. Some say it's a downgrade, for me it's an upgrade. Depends on whether you want to manage a huge empire down to every city each turn and large battles - or not.
The races don't have different features anymore, but you can put two of any available feature on any race now. Again, for some a downgrade, since every race is just a form and can be anything. For me, I can finally build brutal bloodlusty elves like in the Silmarilliom... you know, the stories of the elven people before the time of Lord of the Ring. It always bothered me that most elven in games are dexterous and magical, while they have been crafty and battlehardened before. ^^' Just a personal thing, though.
Additionally, you may select any type of society and any spellbook you want for any race, too. So underground digging halflings with mushroom farms are possible as well as tree loving molemans.

Really a game where you can play your fantasy race how you like it. :)

The previous installment wasn't as great as it could have been, but I was excited and positive about Age of Wonders 4.

And when it was finally time for the game to launch, I enjoyed it a lot even in the unrefined first few versions.

It is a great Turn Based City-Focused Strategy game that offers quite a detailed city building experience, hero-centric combat and exploration as well as a loosely knit together campaign, consisting of a few story missions that can be solved in usually two or three ways.

Unlike previous games, Age of Wonders 4 lets you build your own faction, choosing from different physiques (like Human bodies, Goblin bodies or now with the last DLC even Bird bodies), racial traits (there are a lot!) and more.
It's hard to create a faction that is similar to any one other simply due to the ton of individualization possible.

Furthermore, an extremely positive thing about this game is that it is possible to be played in Hot Seat. I know, in times where people prefer to stay home, it might not feel like a lot, but most of us grew up with Hot Seat mode in games. Have X people on one PC all playing the same game. It's awesome!

Triump Studios is putting a lot of effort into this game, patching, fixing, balancing what needs to be worked on as well as working hard on their DLCs and they listen to their customers as well, offering a much sought after mechanic like the Item Forge.

All in all, Age of Wonders 4 is a great game with many options for literally anything and a high replayability. 
The campaign may be a bit short, but due to its replayability, it's more than okay.
I highly recommend the game.",1700722938,1700722938,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game just feels and looks better, and it drops that dumb class system and gives you a much more interesting tome system, like Master of Magic. The random map generator is better, with a really cool 'realm' system with traits and things. The only thing this game needs is an empire mode like Planetfall. Oh and more of .... everything. I'm confident that once all the DLC's drop this game will be far and away the best in the series. Fanboi loves this game, and I'm still learning the basics at 44 hours.

+ The endless possibilities to create your own faction.  Both in look and gameplay.
+ The tomes system makes it that you can play so many games without having the feeling that you're just following the same plan as the last one.
+ The devs are actively pushing good free updates and optional DLCs.
+ The combat system is pretty fun, intuitive and engaging. And once you get the hang of the game, you can come up with a bunch of different strategies to stomp your foes.
+ As far as performances go, it's a perfectly polished game. No crashes nor bugs and loading time are almost non existent. Being used to Civilization, it's a huge step up in that regard.
+ Terraforming is hilarious. ""Oh, you just forward settled me? Well enjoy you cities being surrounded by mountains and deserts as far as the eye can see.""
+ Although the goal is to beat the other factions, there are many map wide events that keep the game engaging when not at war with other factions and allow you to train and plan accordingly.
+ Love the aesthetic of the game. Be it the map, the special points of interests, the look of the races.. And of course you can get creative with the customization of your factions and on top of that the magic transformations that don't only alter the gameplay in the game but also the look of your people.

- The music is forgettable. Not one piece of soundtrack made me stop to pay attention to it. I compared the game to Civilization earlier for the performance, well in that regard the beautiful Civ OST are leagues above AOW4.
- The localization of the game is full of small errors or random words still in English. (french version at least)

A solid 3 out of 5 in rating, worth the cost but not something I'd necessarily recommend to others.

Fortunatly the developers have decided to dedicate themselves to improving their product, smoothing and polishing gameplay, as well as adding more content to the core experience.

I spent over 2k hours in AoW 3, and had similar records for AoW 1 and 2. Planetfall never happened. I really want to love this one, it's a blast from the gameplay point of view, but there is a single yet huge issue that has to be highlighted here.

The game is trash online due to desyncs.

Really, the more people you have, and we play 3 players v 3 AI the more egregious it gets. I bought this game almost exclusively for multiplayer and my friends and I spend most of our time desyncing, often several times in combat. Not only that, but when the game reloads itself to the point where it left, in combat there are differences regarding to the positioning of units, damage etc. which can result in a negative outcome when compared to how you did before the desync. The amount of time lost and the frustration make it not worth the preorder price we paid for it.

They are already preparing to roll out the first DLC, yet it has been nearly two months since the release and the desyncs are not getting better. I will modify this review if the multiplayer is fixed, but until that happens I strongly discourage you from buying it, regardless of how much you love the series. Such behavior must not be supported, even more so because the single player experience is lacking - the campaign is pretty lame storywise and uses the same map generator with a few twists to stitch the different scenarious in a poor way.",1687263254,1700666370,True,0,0,0.484787493944168091,1,True,False,False

The graphics are outstanding, the unit graphics have been redesigned and went from a cartoony to a more of realistic style. Race customisation is very cool and you have many options to define your starting race. Want to lead an army of Orcs as a Halfling? You can do that. The options for skills and race traits are diverse and you can fulluy customise the looks of your leader and, to a certain point, even your army. 
The music is again from Michiel van den Bos and the soundtrack is also excellent and very fitting for the game.
Gameplay is largely the same as 3, although you have some differences like city- and hero cap, but it all works surprisingly well. random maps can be generated and customised by adding various biomes, enemy types and land types. This makes you craft some pretty awesome maps where you can forge your own narrative. Map sizes are based on amount of players and distance and are of a reasonable size. There is even a mod which expands the map size, but playing with 2 players on a huge map is no longer possible. The turn times will raise rapidly on the biggest maps though, even if you have a killer computer.

The new Pantheon system works well, it rewards points by playing the game and you can unlock new Realms, traits and customisation options. When you win a scenario, your leader can ascend into your Pantheon and can join you in future playthroughs as a recruitable hero. Even if you lose a scenario, or surrender, you get points earned through your playthrough. The unlockable Pantheon tree is a bit short though, and you will unlock all the options rather quick. Hopefully they will extend it through some of the announced DLC's

EDIT: With the latest ""Wyvern"" patch (20th of June) , the game has been made a lot more stable and they even fixed most of the multiplayer errors. It now plays how it should be, kudo's to the Devs!
EDIT 1: The new Reaver class adds excellent mechanics to the game, even though I don't like gunpowder units, here it works well. Furthermore, you don't have to use the hideous Reaver Tank in your games, which is a big plus!

Pros:
A lot of customization at many levels - there are many choices to make throughout the entire game that can make games feel distinct.
4X/strategy game-play with good game length
Cons:
Light on story and lore - the focus on letting the player tell stories means they didn't provide much story themselves, which in many ways makes it feel like an Age of Wonders spin-off rather than a true sequel to the past games.
Limited faction uniqueness - while there are meaningful choices to make, many choices are often either limited enough that you get most of them in a game or low enough impact that they don't ultimately matter in terms of game-play (while still being satisfying role-playing choices)

Takeaway: A great game if you like 4X games and are looking for a sandbox for your own stories. Disappointing if you liked story campaigns like in past Age of Wonders games, the Heroes of Might and Magic series, or other similar games. I will note that there are at least 2 more DLC coming, one of which may bring more story realms, but the disconnected nature of the story realms still leaves them feeling light compared to full campaigns as in past titles.",1700626070,1700626070,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It offers many options for faction customization and allows each player to play the game how they want. The majority of my time playing this game thus far has been single player.

There is no story campaign. There is just a series of story maps that introduce unique scenarios and new ways to beat said scenarios. If you're looking for a deep story, you'll find it lacking in this game.

If you're looking for a multiplayer experience, I suggest giving it a little bit of time. It experiences constant desynch issues in simultaneous turn mode, and still does so during classic turn mode. Occasionally it'll desynch without telling you, which puts you in a position where someone seems to be taking their turn indefinitely. You'll only fix it by relogging into the game. I have been playing a couple of games with a friend, and in simultaneous turns we experienced a desynch or some other issue every 15 turns or so. It happens far less often in classic turns, but still occurred twice during a battle scenario. If you want AoW4 for the multiplayer, I suggest letting the devs work out the kinks with that first, if they manage to do so. The saving grace of this is how quickly the map reloads when you're joining the server again. If the map took 5+ minutes to load each time, it would completely ruin the experience. Loading times in AoW4 is surprisingly quick.

Overall, it's my favorite 4x game of all time. It's just such a bummer that 4x games seem to more often than not come with busted multiplayer features. Endless Legend, which was my prior favorite 4x game, also had serious desynch problems in multiplayer.

Update
______

The game's had two expansions come out, and the multiplayer is still completely unservicable. It's a real shame, because this game is legitimately an experience I want to share with my friends, but it's impossible to play together right now. Between desynchs, and crashes that seem to have gotten worse since release, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a multiplayer experience.

It's still a solid single player game though.",1684251221,1700625678,True,37,0,0.737014353275299072,0,True,False,False

I'll start with the good
The music is great.
The graphics are solid, it's not AMAZING but it's pretty good. The visuals and it's diversity are superb, but the quality of the models and such is not mindblowing for 2023.
The gameplay is very solid and varied, it's not overcomplicated and is surprisingly easy to get into. There's some good quality of life in there too, if you dislike managing your cities, you can let the game do it on it's own, same goes for battles and the ai does a good job of it most of the time.
The leveling system , the ''pantheon'' , is an interesting idea, it's not a big part of it but it's a welcome addition to keep you playing, add to that that your own heroes can appear in future games is cool.
I heard some people had difficulties with crashes and such, my own game has been flawless since I started playing, so don't let that discourage you. (I have a 4 years old PC)
Finally the best, the customisation is incredible, you can make some insane builds in this game, and no game ever really feels the same unless you always pick the same stuff, the book system is great and making you think and build as you play even as a new player and it's always fun to try new stuff and new map settings. That being said..
The middle.
The balance of units/spells/skills is a bit all over the place, with so much stuff to choose from and play with (which is an amazing thing by the way), some things may feel very weak, or in some cases, broken levels of powerful (I'm looking at you, spiders). A few balance patches could fix this easily so I'm not putting this as a negative (it's fun to build broken armies sometimes), but something is definitely needed here. I can think of a few things (Berserkers, Spiders in general, most skirmishers, Tome of the Horde, the Vines, Adept Settler passive, Overwhelming etc...) that could be rebalanced to make the game slightly less broken early on.

The negatives.
This is my one real gripe, the difficulty can be all over the place (I tried all of them), and sometimes the Easy AI felt like the Hard one, and the Hard one sometimes can be so dumb it feels like the Easy one, it all depends on what abilities they roll with, and what resources they happen to spawn on. Sometimes they'll be super aggressive, sometimes they'll never bother you. It feels like the AI sometimes break for some reasons and I can't really say why. Keep in mind this doesn't happen every game so it's only a minor gripe. (The Civ6 AI sometimes does that too even on Deity level, so I don't blame this game too hard for this).
My second negative would be the story, while I understand it was not a focus, I think they could have done a better job of it for what it gives you. If there were 4-5 more scenarios with a slightly more engaging story it would have been much better, that said, the scenarios it has are fine, just not incredible, I just hoped for more.
And finally, Naval combat... is just sad. I really hope they upgrade this if nothing else in future content patches/dlcs, it really feels like an afterthought as is right now.

Overall, it's a solid game, as a first timer to the series, this game feels like a crossbreed of Heroes of Might and Magic, Civilisation and PS1 era classic tactical rpgs, if you enjoy any of those genre, give it a go, it's a good time, I really enjoyed myself so far aside from minor gripes. I'd give it 8.5/10, with some balance patches and a bit of AI tweaking this would instantly go in the 9s.

   Graphics are also more than acceptable with detailed character models and thriving environments that bring the World to life.

Love the in depth race customization which further evolves as the game progresses and you unlock transformations and affinities. However, the game flags a bit due to the meaningless diplomacy system and the multiple unviable victory conditions, with a sprinkle of bugs on the side.

Likes:
*Race creation.* Love how in depth the race creation is. From choosing what they look like to the traits your racial units get to what kind of society they have. Lets you have fun experimenting with different builds and roleplaying. Being able to customize your ruler is very cool to give the extra flavor to your faction. Though I feel the ruler origins are a bit lobsided, the champion is by far the best and the wizard king and dragon lord just don’t compare. (Though damn if the dragon ain’t awesome.)

*Mixing matching affinities.* Love the research system. Instead of technologies just being in a big tree together they’re grouped by thematically consistent ‘tomes’ which are categorized into different affinities, which are basically just elemental forces (order vs chaos, nature vs shadow, etc.) Researching tomes gives affinity points which kindof act like a separate alignment from your good/evil score. Aside from the thematic elements they also contribute to which empire perks you can get and when, which makes for interesting tradeoffs when considering going all in on one affinity or spreading them out. Love it.

*Race transformations.* When going through the tech tree you research the usual stuff; spells to do stuff in combat, new units, new builds, etc, but the coolest stuff are the race transformations which for a high cost permanently alter your whole species, giving them a buff and visually altering their appearance. So cool! It adds so much to the roleplaying and makes you really FEEL like you’re advancing rather than just making arbitrary numbers bigger. What better capstone to your Order playthrough, emphasizing faith and going on crusades, than transforming your whole race into celestial beings with wings and halos? 

Dislikes:
*Bugs, mostly visual.* On a minute-by-minute basis I’m having to work around multiple visual bugs (screen fading in multiple times after exiting the escape menu, notifications not correctly showing their title when stacked, etc.) Some more harmless examples include clipping issues with clothing on non-human races as well as some jank around some transformations (e.g. the celestial transformation’s wings T-posing occasionally). These aren’t game breaking but they degrade the user experience and don’t seem to be getting fixed any time soon.

*Unbalanced victory conditions.* Thankfully the magic victory was nerfed in a previous patch but now the expansion victory just stands alone as by far the fastest/easiest one to achieve. Trying to do any other is just a waste of time. Military victory sounds fast but given how long it takes to siege cities and traverse the map it really isn’t. Plus even if you go for a military victory it’s likely you’ll qualify for the expansion victory long before you eliminate everyone as you’ll (presumably) vassalize or integrate conquered cities.

*Diplomacy.* Alliances are worthless and it’s very frustrating. Any given ruler has a 50% chance or lower of actually honoring one and you don’t have a choice whether to call them to war when declaring one. Even rulers who’s personality states that they ‘never’ break treaties will turn on you even when you have max rep with them and they have min rep with the guy you’re attaching. Even if you do manage to make multiple friends if they declare war with each other you are forced to pick one and you get penalized either way for ‘breaking’ the alliance, seriously?

For the first dozens of hours it is definitely a fun game. But after that you pretty much sees all and there isn't too much attraction left.

The voice acting is also good I wasn't expecting voice acting so often in the game but there is. For every story video thingy and every tome is voiced or you can just read it if you don't want to listen to her.
I played through it twice it seems like it is pretty hard to get anything but a military victory. I tried and almost got an expansion one but then 3 big armys of strong troops poped up and killed the army guarding the beacon. So I just went to take a city. It seems once you take their capital the entire empire is declared fallen. So I won that way on accident that time. The other time was story 1 realm. The stupid NPC got itself killed so when i got the enemy it was the last player alive but me so i won a military victory in story mode.

The tutorial / beginner realm also sucks there was this one magic ""Army Heal"" I got in the story one that I couldn't find in the beginner realm so i just went without it. Still won just more troops died without a way to heal them out of battle that didn't take 3 or 4 turns to do.
In battle it was easy to find the tome that does provides you with a troop for healing there are several that do that. Out of battle on the world map I couldn't find out how and probably should have wikied it instead of playing for almost a day without it.

It is a fun game if you are into turn based stragey with non-human characters. As really the enemy is not human the 2 factions I played as were closer to furries than human but it is fantasy and it makes sense that a pure evil that got Shadow Magic Teir V lizard folk lady would win in one and a slightly good ratfolk guy that didn't have to get strong at all as it was in story mode in another.

It is locked behind a paywall for lizardfolk which wasn't an issue for me as i kind of got the game and the Dragon Dawn DLC together. The only good part of the DLC in my mind is the race the tomes sucked until you get to the dragons. It did seem like the color of the dragon depends on your alignment but nothing else changes. 

It is like that with a lot of things in the game. The weapons and armor you make the only thing that changes when you pick another is how it looks. The stats come from how you put it together. So whatever you want on the weapon or armor or accessory will be able to go onto whatever you want as it is just a cosmetic thing when you are who makes it. The items in the game you do not make do have some  effects I do not think you can duplicate. For example instant death.

The story is good, the graphics are decent though  I do suggest playing on medium or higher as low makes it look bad. I do miss the ability in Fallen Enchantess to make a customized unit but the OP units I made in it are probably why it isn't in this.",1700587191,1700587191,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game feels and works a lot like the Civilization games, but, unlike in them, you can't really play long slow paced campaigns, here you need to play fast paced agressive games.
The maps are really small, so from the start you have to race for the avalible space.
The different cultures, races and heroes you can build make this game really colorful and interesting.
The thing that a i really hate is the pantheon. You can ascend your heroes there, but in the form you created them, not how they look in the end, after all different transformations druign the game. Also, after ascending, they are kinda useless. You can't modify them, or the race they lead, not even their look, which is annoying, since with leveling your pantheon you unlock new hero cosmetics, and the way they can join your game, is really meh. Good idea, but missed opportunity.
The way you can create different worlds, with lot of possibilites is really great.
The in game RNG is really annoying though. When there is something, that is decided based on chance, it is predetermined, what will be the result, until you change the chances. I understand, that this is for not be able to savescum, but still, kind of bad.

Back in the day spells were pretty over powered but it would 100% be countered if the enemy used spell jammers and sanctuaries as they both prevented spell casting within the domain and even prevented the ability to pillage the provinces. 

So in a way spells were op but also hard countered. 

Now after coming back I found the spell jammers were balanced and sanctuaries were nerfed to the ground and this resulted in the spells to also be nerfed and balanced as well. 

So now what we got is a game with average spell casting a terrible research penalty system that basically punishes you for getting high research speed and meh units. 

The thing that made this game great was being able to cast spells and create interesting combos, then also fighting gruelling battles to take out the enemy spells jammers and sanctuaries. 

There are weird nerfed too like before mimics could mimic anything but heroes but now they can mimic mythic golems but not dragons? You can astral reflection mythic spiders to create clones but nothing else thats a mythic unit? 

In my opinion its a step down and the only fun tome path to go down is Shadow now since reanimating the dead seems to be the most fun thing to do. Shadow tomes seem to have the strongest stuff that can only really be countered by golems and elementals. Kinda sucks that most summons die after 3 turns though.

The faction creation is fun and interesting, and there are many ways to achieve victory which is nice. The game has very little story, but rather procedural events that shape your experience on each play. Story is minor, as it tends to be with most strategy empire games.

Are there some issues? 
--Yes, there are. The game is not well optimized and can lag pretty severely at times. I don't have the most advanced rig, and it is getting a little older, but it should run a game that doesn't have top-end graphics like this fairly smoothly. Even downgrading my graphics settings my game can lag a few seconds between clicking on certain things (like tomes) and seeing anything happen. 
--In addition, there are a lot of things not well explained. It took me quite a while to figure out that hotseat does indeed exist and that you have to make sure you create each leader you want before proceeding with the next button like you would in single player.

But barring these fairly minor elements, the game is fun, and the system is solid. If you like tactical empire games with a flair of rpg elements, then this is a wonderful game that will only grow over time with an active modding community and the various DLCs from the devs.

""I want to love this game but, it's very unfinished and rushed.
* Maps are the most basic as ever in the AOW series, its like the when you just create the outline of a map with 2 tile sets and puts down some units and dwellings at random, total lack of terrain details or tile variation. I literally run thru a empty landscape for several turns with just 1 variation of water and swamp tiles.
* The customization is to open, the choices you make in the beginning don't differentiate your civilization enough to make any significant difference, it feels like everyone plays some shape-changer race.

With some patches to these areas I will change my review.""

Updated Review:
With the new patch Empires and Ashes and all expansions so far I think Aow4 finally got playable, the tweaked steps make choices feel more impact-full and give more variation and consequences, this is totally a step in the right direction, now I only hope they continue to improve on the map designs and add more spell-books. Water tiles still needs a lot of love and enemy variations on the maps often repeats itself a lot even if there is hundreds of possible enemy units. The way infestations grow is also often weird, they go from few low tier units to like 3 armies of high tier very fast, seems they totally misses the mid tier units, there should defiantly be a stage with 3 armies with just low and mid tier before there is 3 armies of high tier.

The level of customization is insane; especially considering Your Race/Faction is constantly being added to and updated as you play the Scenario. 

Combat that is easy to learn and understand after just a few instances of it - and refreshingly patient considering the real-time of Total War having a huge learning curve and Civilization being so simplistic and quick it can be hard to even get what just happened as your units are wiped out by opponents.

There's def some ""weird decisions"" in terms of how things work mechanically; like losing a city and the opponents chooses to make it into a ""free state"", but then you take it back but you don't really get it back: now you have to wait forever to vassalize it as if it was ALWAYS a free state.

Maybe it's that the damage flavor is so completely equal. Like the spell that adds frost damage to your units is exactly the same as all the other ones, or so close as to not matter. The devs have taken balance too far. And then if you're familiar with these types of games, basically the meta is to avoid the enemies' doom stack long enough to be able to counter it, either by throwing masses of units at it, or getting very high tier units that are basically unkillable. That sounds fine, right? Well, the problem is that the fog of war is so extensive that the enemy doom stack and just kind of pop out of nowhere and end the game.

con:
1. Road Building is somewhat complicated, making it unsatisfying:
1.a) When Roadbuilding is toggled on, it will prefer to go over Rocks/Mountains or Water/River Tiles - which it can not do. If not toggled, the Unit will follow the logic route, avoiding those tiles

2. Unclear Game Mechanics or too little explaination - sometimes completely missing, i.e. ""City Domain"" esp. what the ""Province Annex Range"" represents -> how many tiles is the start? whats max? 

3. Little incentive to create different districts. Farms are by far the best, yielding +10 in almost every game (req. correct Affinity) or +12 with River. Forester could be easily improved by giving it the same +2 Bonus from River Adjacency as Farms. Quarries should receive a Buff with Iron, Mines from Gold respectively. Both could get a +2 from Mountains. 

4. Boosts for Buildings do not match the later requirement for higher tier upgrade of the same class, i.e. the Vendor (Tier 1) gets boosted by building one farm, Market (Tier 2) by 2 Farms but Mint (Tier 3) requires one Mine and gets boosted by 3 Farms. Why not make it Mine exclusively or ""have a Mine on Gold""? Just one example, other Structures having the same issue, Granary and Store House, which both give Food excl. require Foresters, which give a mix of Food an Production

in addition, the turn-based tactical combat really shines in this game. the intricacies of army composition, terrain utilization, and spell casting adds layers of strategic depth to every battle (albeit i suck at this part). the diversity of races, each with its unique units and abilities, and a very forgiving trait system, adds a fresh dynamic to the strategic category. the powerful leaders and the ability to customize your sovereign injects a personalized touch into the game-play, allowing you to tailor your experience to your preferred play-style. if you're a fan of rich world building and intricate combat/ strategy games, age of wonders 4 is an absolute must-play.

Sure, the surroundings change, but there is not a lot of unit variety. A lot of the choices don't effect game-play, and it's even hard to roleplay as a certain faction.

Well, you can't make guns. My rat bois just made increasingly better golems and swords. Couldn't even mass produce units. But we had a ""Tank"" unit (A guy with a shield) that took 8 turns to make.

There are no traits that make you a bunch of rats with boomsticks, and i find that unfortunate.

On the other end, I wanted to make elves that were just doom-bringers. Stat-wise they should of had high HP, Magic, and damage... But they basically had the same units, just replace golems with skeletons (A slightly cheap & squishy substitute that doesn't heal without help)

So, there's that.

On the plus side, it's not a bad game for what it is. the polish is there, it's very charming, and the choices (Even though they don't have much impact) are often good story beats, and add flavour to the world. The sound track is nice, and I really do love the ability to create custom critters... I just wish the mechanics would reflect the tone of the game.
If i run a necromancer, I don't really want to research ice magic.
Rock body racial traits are cool stat mods, but it doesn't fit the theme of rats with guns.
And demon elfs are cool, thank you for letting us design them, but it's a bit underwhelming when they play almost exactly the same as the necromancer I made.",1699843921,1699843921,False,8,0,0.56591641902923584,0,True,False,False

Initially, I approached ""Age of Wonders IV"" with considerable skepticism, to the extent that I hastily refunded my pre-order after a mere half-hour of gameplay. Yet, when I revisited the game six months later, I discovered a mesmerizing realm that captivated my imagination. Today, for those ready to delve into this enchanting adventure, ""Age of Wonders IV"" stands as a pioneering force in the high fantasy turn-based strategy (TBS) genre. It not only meets but exceeds the lofty expectations set by its predecessors, firmly establishing itself as the crown jewel of the series.

The game sets itself apart with its revolutionary mechanics, seamlessly blending strategy, role-playing elements, and an intricate combat system that challenges and rewards in equal measure. The strategic depth here is unrivaled, offering a sophisticated yet accessible experience for both newcomers and veterans of the series.

One of the most standout features of ""Age of Wonders IV"" is its extensive customization possibilities. The game allows players to tailor their experience to an extraordinary degree, from creating unique leaders to shaping entire realms. This level of customization doesn’t just add a personal touch; it fundamentally alters the way each game unfolds, offering endless replayability.

The brilliance of ""Age of Wonders IV"" lies in its ability to fuse the most positive aspects of its predecessors. It takes the beloved elements from previous entries and enhances them with modern innovations and sleek design. The result is a unique gem that both respects its roots and boldly strides into new territories.

In conclusion, ""Age of Wonders IV"" is more than just a game; it’s a testament to how a series can evolve and surpass expectations. It’s a rich, immersive world waiting to be explored, and an experience that’s as rewarding as it is enjoyable. Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer to the series, this game is an absolute must-play.",1699826962,1699827879,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

For a bit of background, I have played EVERY Age of Wonders games, and it is one of my favorite fantasyworlds to 
play in. I have finished EVERY ending on Age Of Wonders 1, finished Age of Wonders 2 out of spite, and me and my friends still couch-coop Age Of Wonders Shadowmagic. Hell, I even liked Age of Wonders 3, which, in my opinion, is still the weaker one of the series.

So my opinion on Age Of Wonders 4 is simple....if you are looking for a story, dont look here. From what I have seen so far, there is some story there, but its not the important part of the game. The most important part is building your own Pantheon, a group of wizard/heroes/Dragons. 

The focus of the game lies in building your own character and play games with it. You could play some of the pre-built scenarios, the story scenarios or randomly create your own world and try to conquer it. Honestly, to me, playing some of the story scenarios with my own character is basicly what we, the old Age of Wonders fans, would want. 

The only thing I can fault the game for is two-fold. First of, the ""Beginner Scenario"", it is supposed to teach you the game together with the inbuild Tutorial and Help functions. This works, but it took me this long (11 hours) to FULLY understand every aspect of the game. I personally feel that a decent tutorial, the old school way like in Age Of Wonders 1 or Shadow Magic, would have worked better. It would make things clearer in a better pace.


Ofcourse I made happy baby noises when I saw Ham Binger in the hero screen, a hero who has been in the game since Age of Wonders 1. But where are my Frostlings? The devs made Artica, and gave her a group called ""Frostlings"", but the whole race is BASED ON HUMANS. From what I know Lore-wise, they would be more akin to Goblins, but frosty! Though, even Age Of Wonders 3 treated my Frostlings better, adding them as DLC. As a big lover of Frostlings, this is kind of a shame. I, however, love the massive, and i mean MASSIVE options when creating your own faction. Mole-kin, Rat-kin (Warhammer called due to copyright, methinks), and Toad-kin are absolute GREAT additions. I may have lost my Frostlings, but I gained allot more!

All in all, if you love Age Of Wonders, just buy the game. Its good, but dont compare it to Age Of Wonders 2 or Shadowmagic. The game is a beast of its own, and though it a little bumpy getting to know the game, now that I know it...I dont want to play anything else. I cannot wait for the upcoming DLC. I will be playing this for years to come.


EDIT:  So, after playing even more of the game, i needed to retract/delete the above part of missing the older Wizard from Age Of Wonders 2 & Shadowmagic! Guess who ya battle after the turorial? YAKA! And allot of the odler Wizard are there!! You just unlock them after playing against them in the Story scenarios. I still feel that the campaign feel less than, well, a campaign, cause you pick a new scenario every time, instead of picking a wizard like in Shadowmagic, or it being themed like Age Of Wonders 2.

It is much, much more rich and develop in terms of 4x aspects than AoW3. But still keeping everything simple and mostly intuitive. What I like most is how customizable are races and maps, keeping every game fresh and unique. For me it's 9/10.

TL/DR - Campaign plot confusing, poorly written, with an unnecessary twist, and a waste of the writers and players time. The progression system is very weak/pointless, and the rest of the game doesn't provide much to get excited over. 

So the game itself is functional, despite the odd crash to desktop, its pretty solid. Nothing totally new or exciting about the system itself, definitely not ""bad"" but nothing to write home, or a review about.

What I wish I had done however was trust the other reviews that said the campaign missions were a joke. PLEASE, if you're like me who is ONLY interested in story / lore, trust me here and just don't. 

Firstly, let me knock over the other primary irritant, the tomes of magic. When you start your faction you'll be primarily based on order, darkness, nature, chaos etc. Each of these concepts comes with 2 branches of magic - for example the death / darkness branch has necromancy/souls magic along with ice magic. Each magic tome you pick has 5 or so spells. You're forced to take another after researching 4 spells. Each stream has a total of 4 books plus one master book, so 9 books in total. Each time you choose a spell to research you pick from three randomly available books. So sadly, when you've picked your 9th - Master - book, you still have around 10 spells from your chosen field to research before you're forced to choose another tree altogether, so good luck perfecting your chosen stream.

Now for the ""campaign"" - Urgh. You start off as a mortal, fight off one of the ""dark crew du jour"". Your mortal champion takes their place in the pantheon of immortals and you find out what the bad guys are upto. So far so good. Mission 2 has you deal with another of the bad guys team, also good. Mission 3 for some reason has you SERVING the bad guys, even if you pick the team that you've just been fighting against the bad guys with, if you make your own custom team, it just feels stupid. Mission 4 has you team up with another (good) god/demi-god to deal with some (not-really-deliberately-bad) elves. Finally mission 5 - Your mission is to take the artefact you procured for the bad-guys in mission 3 and use it to open a prison to release a mcguffin monster/monsters that all the good teams, that you spend the mission wiping out, tell you is a bad idea to release and will cause untold problems. When you win, not only do you get a paragraph of text saying ""you opened the prison"" and nothing much else: [spoiler] The friend who helped you defeat the first bad guy, and helped you defeat the elves in mission three, turns out to be the head bad guy in disguise, for no reason at all. [/spoiler]

So if its trying to set its-self up for a sequel, the plot / campaign is so confusing, weak and poorly written, that I can't see any chance of a sequel campaign, let alone anyone caring if there is. Having destroyed the world in the first place and having custom races inserted into the game spoils the care factor anyway. 

Aside from the truly abysmal campaign, the ""Pantheon system"" isn't that good either, you can use your pantheon points to get some cosmetic items for your characters, and unlock the character you used in the completed level for later use. The cheat/console codes also prevent you from using this system, which is a kind of strange threat as it contributes so little to the game.

All in all leads to rapid boredom and little reason to replay.

Rantview:
AoW4 has a lot of the makings of a great 4X game.
And like mostly every 4X game it's a little barebones on release, mostly in the sense that the systems present are lacking depth and nuance.
I've held off from reviewing the game for a while now, waiting to see what kind of growth the game would experience.
Sadly, this growth has been rather disappointing.

We've now seen a 10 and 20 eur DLC, and both feel rather underwhelming.
The visual forms both packs contain are neat, but don't add anything in terms of gameplay (except for extremely minor additions in the form of racial traits).
New lord types, tomes and cultures are great, but they are building on existing systems without adding any further depth to the game. 
More bredth is great, but not if the game is suffering from being a shallow experience.

And that honestly touches on my core issue with how this game appears to be developed post-release.
They're building on existing systems and reworking systems that didn't really work as they were, but we're seeing barely any new systems, which is a damn shame.

What kind of systems would I like to see gain added depth? 

Well, greater unit customization, for one. There's a ton of different units, but most are honestly the same with a different lick of paint and element for their attacks.
When units are this generic, why not let us build our own? It'd be awesome!

City development could also really use some work. 
Currently, it can be tricky to recover from harsh starting locations if your faction doesn't play into them (looking at you, frozen wasteland with 0 chance for food...).
Beyond that, the system is increeedibly plain and dull. Somehow it also fails to feel intuitive what kind of buildings you'd best prioritize when. Not that this matters, because you'll run out of things to construct sooner rather than later regardless.

Rework alignment. Good vs. Evil feels extremely shallow right now. It's also extremely easy to be Evil, and while I wouldnt say it's hard to be Good, it usually comes at a cost that doesn't return you much in the end.
It's mostly a ""flavor"" system now, I'd say. 
But even that it doesn't do in an interesting way, because it defines Good and Evil as objective, instead of allowing factions to have their own views on what they might conisder Good or Evil. 
Personally, I'd find it much more interesting if every faction had their own definition of Good and Evil, or that this could even be formed through gameplay as a faction goes through events of significance. 
(E.g. if you constantly raid a neighbour, they might start viewing this as evil, while your people may view it as good because it's part of their way of life.)

Make Cultures more interesting.
They've shown with the Reaver Culture that they're capable of making mechanically-interesting and nuanced Cultures. And while the Reavers really appear to be quite awesome, it honestly doesn't do the game much of a service because it shows how blatantly boring the base-game Cultures are.

Beyond this, the game could also do with entirely new systems, much in the way that Civilization games and other 4X games receive post-release, with the release of major expansions. 

Add depth, not just bredth.",1699746534,1699746534,False,6,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

1. Character and race creation is not horrible. However, the majority of the attire you unlock through the pantheon system, matches about as well as a 4 year old choosing their own outfit. Never mind the hassle it is to unlock it.... which brings us swiftly to our
Cons:
1. Holy crashes. Somewhere between turn 50 and 100 you have a 50/50 chance per campaign of running into a unfix-able crash that ends your campaign. So i hope you weren't planning on actually finishing any games and unlocking those lack luster skins.
2. I finished the entire series of story missions, and I remember nothing of how why what when or where this universe unfolds or why. I vaguely remember some stuff, but not exactly a captivating read.
3. It feels like they are trying to balance a single player game for multiplayer. Do people actually play multiplayer?
4. Factions have 1 unique province improvement, and 1 unique building they can construct that differentiates them from other factions. Yes there are minor changes to some buildings, but we are talking +5 mana for mystic factions or +5 production for materium. hardly consequential.
5. After about 30 turns unit diversity means nothing. All higher tier units are locked behind non exclusive tomes and all lower tier units are painfully obsolete. Meaning every faction plays almost identical past turn 50 at the latest. Which is that whole multiplayer balance feeling. It feels like instead of creating distinct and balanced factions they just said well everyone gets access to everything.
6. Terra forming is locked behind 3 separate tomes. In the latest update however they changed it to be behind 3 different tomes AND 4 different exclusive racial features. This only compounds the lack of diversity in tome selection.
7. The AI moves every single unit one at a time. That means 5 to 10 free cities and up to 8 factions moving hundreds of units one at a time. I'm not real good at math but i reckon that's at least 3 billion hours of wait time between turns.
8. The majority of the time you will be fighting with 3 stacks of 6 units which means moving 3 stacks of 6 instead of 1 stack of 18 which is just kind of silly at least let me tether them or something.
9. AI factions have a zero percent chance of ever coming even remotely close to winning the game. However, derelict infestations have a one hundred percent chance of spawning a progenitor golem and making you quit the game.
10. Diplomacy consists of either declaring friendship or declaring rivalry. There are no meaningful quests or anything along those lines to influence other factions. 
11. You will reach the beacons of unity win condition on your way to all other win conditions making it the only win condition. Which involves unifying all of absolutely no one. 

Quite frankly i'm just tired of writing this review, but there are certainly more cons then this.

 I expected an unfinished game that's just the reality of how the industry works, but after 3 major updates I can honestly say I don't see any improvement in the right direction. In fact the game has steadily become more and more dull as they slowly drip feed content in an attempt to justify a season pass.

-----------------
I and a close group of friends have put in countless hours across all major Paradox strategy games, played for years AOW3 and Planetfall in MP games and brought all the DLC, as well as most DLC for HOI4, Stellaris, etc.
AOW4 is about the only game I pre-ordered.  390 hours later, it comes with great sadness to give it a thumbs down, in a small act of protest against Paradox development process on this one.   
Here are the problems that are killing it for me:
•	Strategically, the AI is amazingly passive, and seems never to launch effective offenses against your main cities.   There are no “adjustment” settings for this, and Paradox did a far better job of adjusting for passive/aggressive in other game (e.g., HOI4).   The developer seems to recognize how bad it is, which is why they had to create the odd mechanic of the “magical” invasion forces appearing in the final 15 turn countdown for magical victory, because the get figure out how to make AI march to the sound of the guns
•	In Planetfall they introduced an amazing MP play by cloud game system, with effective email notifications on when your turn and a game dashboard when you having many games going on, etc.   In AOW4, at least for my group, they broke it.   The emails are not working for us, and when you go into the dashboard, the indicators of whose turn is waiting a move is often totally wrong, so only way to tell is to log into individual game and wait for it to sync then maybe your turn, maybe not.   Big time waste if you are monitoring a bunch of different MP games in play.

•	Vassals will almost never leave their area to help defend/attack etc.   Again, AI algo for this already framed up in other Paradox games.  At least developers are likely to eventually fix this, but months later still not fixed and had a straight forward solution path.
Most of the “positives” you will read in other reviews are true, however, why was the AOW4 developers kept in isolation from the other Paradox developers/code bases, to produce such fundamental flaws that have been solved elsewhere and before.  Shame and sad.  No DLC for us on this one.",1689079869,1699573757,True,0,0,0.574301421642303467,2,True,False,False

So. Age of Wonders 4 is a pretty decent 4X game with tactical battles, and a pretty competent autoresolve feature at that (simulating the battle fully without rendering it). It's certainly time consuming, like most of its kind.

Age of Wonders 4's primary gimmick is the character/race customization, which replaces a more story- and lore-focused character selection from the previous games. This is ultimately down to preference. While I like it personally, since I'm more interested in the gameplay than the story, it's definitely something to keep in mind.

Anyhow, the problem with the game is mainly lack of content. The framework for something great is all there, but the base game legitimately feels like a demo, missing some part of the full content, and adding the DLC abates that issue somewhat. (I mean, hell, the civilization origins selection has room for 9 options but only has 5!)

There have been frequent updates, but all that's changed since release thus far is a reworking of the magic victory system (which was good, but was kind of nerfed a little TOO much), a fix for long end-game turn times (still an issue, but much less of an issue than at release)... and no new content whatsoever.

(EDIT 11/8/2023: A recent free update with the Empires and Ashes DLC has made numerous changes to the game, which in a shocking turn of events for a strategy game, are ALL good. At least in my opinion. The Hero Forge is a good extra, as it makes getting specific hero items less of a dice roll, and gives a bit more use to ones you don't need. Hopefully this trend will continue, and maybe with enough free updates I'll flip this review to a positive one.)

The campaign is also so bare-bones I'm not even mentioning it. You're better off just making your own custom game for how you want to play and ignoring the 'story' altogether.

But keep in mind this is a 60 dollar game! With the Expansion Pass, it's almost 90 dollars. You're essentially paying 60 dollars for a really big demo, and then 30 for actually fleshing it out. Don't get me wrong, what's there is GOOD, but it's far, far too expensive to justify buying full price.

This seems to be pretty typical of Paradox, which is unfortunate, as this game would've probably been a 10/10 if they just pushed release forward a year or two and included the planned DLCs in the base game.",1694909415,1699506779,False,12,0,0.5849456787109375,0,True,False,False

The problem of AOW4 is it's basically a worse version of Planetfall with inferior performance and inflated price tag. Each major update I'm trying to give it a chance, but my experience ends up being boring but also tedious every time.

First thing they did wrong was dumbing down of combat mechanics and races variety. For example, in Planetfall each combination of race and secret tech was more or less a unique experience, providing depth, nuance and ultimately replayability. Here they made it so you create a race yourself - however, instead of going wild with interesting mechanics like building trenches or regeneration upon getting hit you are stuck with choosing boring and trivial things like +2 damage or +8 health. 

And second thing they did wrong was trying too hard to balance the game, which for one is pointless for a game where nobody really plays multiplayer, and for the other made the gameplay feel samey and sterile, depriving the player of any chance of power fantasy.",1699506210,1699506210,False,4,0,0.502291738986968994,0,True,False,False

1669000,149717052,76561198041511101,0,2,2150,0,310,1701484394,"       Longtime Age of Wonders fan here. I put off picking up AoW 4 initially because I was turned off by the intense use customization aspect but picked it up the first sale as I knew I eventually would. Imagine a few people reading in the same boat so here's my two cents:
       First impressions... there's a lot going on in terms of tweaks, flavor, and quality of life upgrades from the previous AoW title. Triumph Studios have clearly taken a page out of the Civilization book in city development and, though intuitive and comparatively simple to dedicated TBS world-builder games, there is an added layer of complexity on the strategy map that is, for my part, welcome. The mechanics for neutral cities has also been tweaked and empire building seems generally a more important part of the gameplay.
       Combat is immediately familiar to returning AoW players and I imagine easy enough to pick up for anyone who has invested any time in turn-based strategy. There has been a deflation in skills and values which emphasizes individual unit roles (for instance, no more melee attack on support units and your archers will generally start at 1 Def instead of arbitrarily starting at 5-7 while still being the lowest defense value unit). Feels a bit more like the original AoW that way.
       Now here's the big one -- lord/race customization. Building a custom faction, working with the new synergies, finally getting to see wood elves and dark elves return if you want them -- all great. Working within a cultural type rather than a lord type (so for instance Feudal/Barbaric instead of Theocrat/Warrior) is an interesting change. However I remain unconvinced by the choice of race being reduced to essentially a cosmetic feature since all bonuses are equally selectable for all. Part of the ""Wonder"" of Age of Wonders for me was some of the weird and fantastical combinations unique races allowed. Are they really Halflings if they're not Lucky Stone-Chuckers? Feel like they missed a happy medium somewhere here.
         Haven't gotten far enough into the campaign to really comment there. Seems to revolve around a custom lord which could be a weakness in terms of writing -- harder to write a compelling campaign for Joe-Shmoe hero than someone you can actually integrate into the world building like previous titles. Though if you hated Merlin, Julia, and Meandor then I could see how you could consider this an improvement.
          Overall, cautiously optimistic moving forward. Would rally the rat Feudals Knights to my side again. 4/5.",1699380075,1699380075,True,13,1,0.592767477035522461,0,True,False,False

I was pretty hyped for it, thinking that the recipe for AoW3 with the experience from planetfall would make for a blockbuster, but it seems they just discarded all the great stuff planetfall introduced and instead made a total overhaul mod and graphic update for AoW3.

Like it literally is AoW3 with some extra features but without racial units, so all factions are kinda the same.

Which is one of the things that make this game bland and kinda boring - they swithced faction unique units from being racial to instead being cultural, which is a kinda fun, but on the other hand means that the 5 sets of unique units you can get will be exactly the same despite what race they are, and it just kinda makes it bit bland. Every unit has the exact same move speed, hp, evasion, accuracy and damage output regardless of wether it's a frog or an orc, which i am inclined to agree that it might just be me that is set in my old ways of having D&D and warhammer define my view on fantasy characters, but i just played through a couple of games and actually straight up got bored of the game.

Sure, every culture have some semblence of unit diversity, but THEY'RE ALL THE SAME UNITS IN DIFFERENT WRAPPING. Compared to how vastly different every race looked and played in planetfall, everything in AoW4 is exactly the same with the same character models across the board, the only difference being a different skin and colour scheme (look at the warlock and the awakener and spellbreaker - it's the same character model).

The gameplay is also pretty boring, much in that everything is just the same couple of slightly different flavoured units you play so there is no real difference to what faction you play, but the gameplay itself is boring and the ai is shit, so even on brutal, it's exciting for the first 30 turns, and then it just becomes a question of patience as you grind through endless stacks of enemies on your way to their capital. If you want to stop playing the game, try playing against a High opponent on brutal and their Awakener doomstacks. neither fun nor difficult.

The maps are bland, compared to the rich and diverse maps of planetfall, with good dungeons and npc factions you could progress with and the rewards you'd get that could completely change the gameplay, the amount of unique hero items that actually made a difference instead of just adding 1 defense or a minor abilities like an extra melee attack. WHAT WAS WRONG WITH DAGGER OF THE DOOMHERALD AN SUMMONING AN AVATAR OF DEATH huh? fucking UNIT MODS???? what was wrong with phasing into the mid of your enemies, blowing them tf up with psychic energy and causing the rest of them to go insane on turn 1, or launching massive firebombs that set the whole field of fire for your to send your giant death robot into that would thrive in the fire or the dudes on bikes or the big things that eat small things or psychic jellyfish or the mad max people, the dinosaurs, the furries (lmao) and even the fucking chelus pricks that would kill my wholy army, Planetfall was like a mix of borderlands and civilization and like what was wrong with the fantastic diversity of planetfall and how did they spend 4 years degrading their product.
The more i think about it, the more upset i get.

AoW3 was really good, planetfall took everything they learned from AoW3 and turned it up to 11, and then they spent 4 years making a product that was somehow worse than the game that came out 10 years ago because AoW at the very least wasn't boring and didn't mask it's shortcomings behind a bag of coloured tomes.

I'm genuinely sad and upset about how disappointing this game actually is.

There's no real campaign, and in the little excuse we got for a campaign, you can just play whatever faction you like, so there is no cohesion, no reason for you to build any relation to your leaders and factions, as they have no real reason to exist outside of it being fun to theory craft, but then again, this game is a prime example of something that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle.
It's just a bunch of flash hiding over that under the immediate cover, everything is the same and has no real meaning to it.

Maybe the expansions might add something, but when the issues are structural to this point, i highly doubt it and i'd avoid getting this to be honest.

get AoW3 or planetfall instead, which are actually really good games.

Edit after 6 months and one DLC in - nothings changed. the dragons are shit and don't play into what makes the game great - diverse leaders you can customise and upgrade. AoW built itself on being a mix of HoMM3 and Civilization, yet they do everything in their power to move away from everything they did to make a name for themselves. pity.

I have been always a huge fan of this serie and I played AoW2 for years and same for AoW3. So, I can say so far AoW4 meets totally the expectations in terms of gameplay, is exactly what you expect from a title of this serie. 

I think AoW takes the place of Heroes of Might and Magic that a certain point, many, many years ago with HoMM3 was the best title in the turn based fantasy genre, but HoMM after the third chapter  meets a total downfall, release after release, never reaching again the same level. 

So in the realm of the turn based fantasy game AoW is the mark of excellence, the highest peak, nothing stands above AoW.

PROS:
- High longevity due of the great combinations of magic tomes and races
- DLC will be keep players busy for a veeeeeeeeery long time
- Splendid game mechanics and battles requires a good dose of knowledge of spells and units and tactics
- Lots of customizations, it's impossible to not find in term of races and spells that won't fit perfectly a player's personal gamestyle

CONS
- So far I had only an annoying and severe corruption of one autosave file, once in 55 hours is not that dramatic, but it is always annoying when something like that happens

PROS: High level of sandbox, returning playable leaders from AoW2, rebalancing and reinvention of old series mechanics, as well as a whole host of new gameplay mechanics that are both unique and fun. Mixing and matching race traits adds a lot of customization and replayability, and mixing and matching those traits with cultures and tomes allow for some really cool and rewarding gamplay combos.

CONS: Overall unit balance issues, strategic AI is a cheating bastard as always, minimalist story (and no flavor text on units or spells!), and they mostly did away with the ""empire"" meta-game mode of AoW3 and Planetfall. The Pantheon is still there as some kind of overarching progression, but the rewards are mostly just leader cosmetics--that's mostly my personal preference anyway, if they kept ""empire"" in two titles and ditched it in a third, it must not have been popular enough to keep around.",1698595194,1698595194,True,27,3,0.700987339019775391,0,True,False,False

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

HOW FUCKING HARD IS IT TO UNDERSTAND?

Strategy games need KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Next/Previous City
Next/Previous Army
Idle until next turn
Go to message location
And so on.

And they need to be CLOSE TO EACH OTHER, some people have DISABILITIES, if I need to navigate through the ENTIRE GOD DAMNED KEYBOARD, from literal one side of it to the other, the function of a shortcut, which is TO HELP AND SPEED UP THINGS , the 'shortcut' doesn't work, does it?

Now, the game itself.

They changed several core mechanics, 

The first one that is impactful was limiting the amount of armies can engage in a battle from 7 to 6, and also capped the amount of armies a player can engage in a battle, from 6 ( full encirclement ) to 3, why? since the number of armies remains the same, I assume this was done for no fucking reason at all and I hate this change.

Another core change was how the enchantment of units work, and that was a HUGE change.

Now, instead of enchanting one unit at a time, you cast an enchant and it enchants every single unit of your army with it. The casting cost of the enchantment does not change, you can be enchanting one unit or five hundred units, doesn't matter, you enchant EVERYONE for the SAME COST, there is also only two limitations to enchanting, a enchant named overgrown can't be used alongside spawnkin, and you can have only one out of five major race transformations, except for that there is no limit on how many enchants you can have except for your upkeep, which means units, even tier 1 rank 0, with the RNG of luck of having more enchantments appear on your tome research, your units can get absurdly stronger than your opponents, does this break the game? I don't know why I asked that... the answer is obvious.

And that leads to the next change, research, they reduced the spheres from 7 to 6, rearranged a ton of spells from one sphere to an afinity that sometimes doesn't make sense, like in how the equivalent of earth now has all the air spells (????).

The way you select a spell, unit or structure to research is also absurd. You select a tome, then after you research a set number of spells, structures or units, you select another tome.
There are 4 to 6 spells on each tome, the first subselection is a randomized selection of 3 spells from that tome, after you research that one, the tome randomly selects 3 ( and sometimes bugs out to only 2, even if you have more unresearched options ) among ALL tomes you previously researched, that means the longer the game takes, the more dependent on sheer luck you are to have good options to research, and based on how overpowered stacking enchants is, this is game breaking by itself.

Still on the topic of spell research, there are no spells to improve mobility with the exception of two earth spells that increase move speed and give flying to scouts, and scouts only, which are by far the weakest units in the game, so yeah, your absurdly slow moving armies are stuck on 1st gear for the entire game, with the only help to mobility being the construction of outposts and provinces in your cities with teleports, which at the time of writing this guide are bugged, the research to give your units half movement after taking a teleport works at random, sometimes you can move 4-5 armies and they all get the restored movement after teleport, other times, you move a single army and it gets stuck on the other side of the teleport unable to move, and that works at random, I hade times that I moved 3 armies, the first and third had their movement restored, the second didn't, that forced me to split my armies if I wanted to keep moving, and also this has the extra effect of irritate my ulcer when it happens.

Each tome has a tier, and the only limitation of tome selection is that you can only research one tome of tier 5, everything else can be researched in a game, and each tome you research increases your casting points. The problem is, with the exception of a hero ability that allows you to cast another spell in a turn, each tactical turn you can cast only one spell, which one you cast then? the stronghest one, obvi - fucking - ously, so what happens with all those spells that you had to research in order to get more casting points? you ignore them, entirely, completely, at all, they are useful for fuck all, so, again, the the 4th ( or 5th if you count planetfall ) the overwhelming majority of spells are completely and utterly useless and you never, ever use them, the only thing you can do with them is to go to the wiki and print them all, in paper, at least then you can use them to wipe yourself, and that is pretty much the only use you get from the majority of those spells.

Am I being crass? of course I am, because I am pissed, this is happening for DECADES, when the best spellcasting system you had is from the 1st game in the franchise, you tend to feel like that.

And so far I only spoke about the game systems, and if you are still with me, believe me, that is the least egregious section of the game issues.

The second to worst is the performance, the game crawls to a halt as it progresses, to the point it takes several minutes to process EACH opponent turn, the more opponents, the slowest the game gets.

That is not all, each spell you research increases the delay to close the spell tome research interface when you select your spell, to the point that after ~50 spells it takes almost a minute to close, at ~100 it takes 4-5 minutes to close the tome... no, I am not kidding...

My computer must be bad then? it's a i7 10700k, 32GB of DDR4 and a RTX3080TI, so no, it is not my computer....

And the performance is not the worst problem.

By the time I write this review, I have around 400 hours of gameplay, and in all those over 400 hours there was not a single play section that I played without crashes to desktop, multiple crashes every section, the longer you were in a game, the more frequent the crashes were, after turn 100 it crashes every other turn, to the point I had to manually save after every action in order to have a minimum amount of chance to actually being able to continue playing.


I could speak about A LOT more, about how insanely ridiculous the new siege mechanics are, about flying not working ( it literally doesn't work on world map ), about how bad the design for the underground system is, about how frequently assets are reused, there are maybe 7 or 8 different tactical maps, and the game reuses them over and over and over again, to the point you feel you're fighting the exact same battles over and over, about how poorly designed the map modifiers are for custom maps, like, megacities don't work, literally, because of the unchanged pop cap, megacities don't work, at all. but I'm getting tired and have to do something that no-one else can do for me, thank god I printed the list of spells.

In short, this is, by far, the worst iteration of the franchise, as it is, I do not recommend anyone to buy this game, it is poorly designed, poorly optimized, poorly maintained ( just last week developers released patches that rolled back fixes from a previous patch ) and definitively not worth the price it is being sold for.

Update.

Stopped playing for a couple months, tried another go, another ~100 hours or so.

They managed to make the stability worse, the game went from random crashes to specific crashes without workaround in certain situations in the map, like when I click to move one of my units now the game crashes, every single time, and I can't cirvumvent this, this happens at random, happened in multiple games, at different moments, sometimes early on at ~turn 10, other times super late at ~turn 80, and whenever it happens it's impossible to progress in the game.

My opinion remains the same, do not buy this game, it is not only not worth the",1683131855,1698430021,False,11,2,0.516521632671356201,1,True,False,False

With the addition of Dragon Dawn, this game is pretty close to perfect for this Age of Wonders fangirl. Bear in mind I've been playing this series since the very first entry back in the day, and Planetfall is one of my favorites of all time (do not be fooled by the amount of playtime I have on Steam; I started Planetfall on console and have over a thousand hours all together). In my opinion, the changes that the developers have made to this entry have only improved the experience.

The amount of customization that you now have for creating your own leaders and factions is absolutely unbelievable! There are so many possible combinations that I cannot imagine getting bored with it any time soon, and the very same faction can play completely differently depending on what tomes of magic you choose to focus on. You can even remove and change unit enchantments after you've set them, just like modifications in Planetfall. This makes it so much easier to adapt to what's going on in the world you're currently playing, and makes it more difficult for people to easily predict one another's strategies in multiplayer.

And, for players who don't want to spend twenty minutes getting their Dragon Lord's snout just right (don't judge me), there's an option to generate a random ruler that you can either roll with or tweak to your own liking. There are also plenty of premade factions to choose from that, again, you can either play as-is or add your own touches to. 

AoW4 adds a new revenue stream, Draft, which determines how quickly your cities produce units. You can now build structures and recruit units simultaneously which speeds things up considerably! It's now possible to end a game in less than 100 turns if you really get rolling, and the new Pantheon system encourages you to do so. The Pantheon is a progression tree that allows you to unlock all sorts of things, from cosmetics to faction traits to new types of realms - it's a brilliant system that gives you incentive to actually finish every map that you start even once the writing is on the wall. 

Before Dragon Dawn, I was one of the players hit hard by the dreaded Graphics Driver error. I did manage to work around it by dialing my graphics settings back to Medium and turning off some of the bells and whistles, but once the expansion dropped I was able to turn everything back up and only seem to get the crash now at the very end of a game with a Dragon Lord. Thankfully, the win still counts and I still get my Pantheon points, but it's a bummer that I can't ascend any of my dragons to the Pantheon. ;_; Honestly, that's my only real gripe with this game, and I'm hopeful it will be fixed in the future as the developers have mentioned they're addressing stability. 

Otherwise, this game is set to be one of my all time favorites! It's gorgeous, fun, and endlessly replayable. Multiplayer works great and isn't a slog, the story maps are well crafted and don't take 500 turns to complete, and each random map that I've played has been intelligently laid out and fun.

It's less intensive on the noggin' I find, than Planetfall is. I'm enjoying it a lot. Slow paced, but a beautiful fantasy 4X game with lots of charm. Pretty smooth, but not without a bit of funkiness. It's not entirely polished.

Arguably, the flexibility of the race, character and empire creation functionality waters down the personality of all three aspects of the game, but I didn't feel this watering down in practice. The ""complete"" races of TW Warhammer 3 or even Planetfall do have more personality, but not significantly so in my eyes. The fantasy setting is so smoothly and artfully executed here, together with the story writing that your imagination doesn't have to do much work to make up the shortfall.

I created a fully custom race of diplomacy-oriented fire-magic-wielding Siberian tiger-paladins. That is, zero backstory except what I made up quite briefly in my head. It's been a real joy to play, honestly. If anything, I'm enjoying it more than Planetfall, so far. Lots of cool strategic and tactical decisions to make, lots of personality.

There is a learning curve, though, so be prepared. Nothing like Stellaris, mind, but expect to do some bumbling around the interface. Luckily, there's a tooltip for almost everything.

I can no longer recommend this game due to three major issues.
- Extremely dumb AI. Especially, when they are your allies. You will notice this when you reach late game. Allied AI has no idea what the map objectives are and often either goes AFK or just moves back & forth without purpose. For reference, try Story Mission 5 (Rise of the Godir) and you will experience the terrible AI.
- Enemy AI almost always cheats with their resources and army strength.
- Constant crashes when you reach late game rounds. There seems to be a random memory leak when you have multiple mods enabled as well.

It's similar to Civilization, but in a fantasy world, takes place on a gorgeous map, and has all kinds of monsters, fantasy races, spells you can research and cast, roleplay events, and little mini-dungeons to explore! You can choose your faction's race and customize their look, traits, and culture. You can also customize what your ruler character looks like and how they fight and govern. And you can create entirely new worlds (realms) to play on where you can customize everything from the terrain to the types of enemies that appear on the map. This is basically Master of Magic on steroids! I should also note that the game comes with a ton of pre-made factions and realms for you to experience before you try customizing your own. It also comes with several story-focused realms to play in as well as the traditional sandbox mode.

On top of all this, there's a between game progression called the Pantheon where you can ascend your ruler to potentially appear in later games and where you earn points based on things you accomplished in your game that you can then spend to unlock new cosmetics and new starting equipment for your ruler as well as new culture traits and realm trait options.

If all of this sounds cool and fun, including turn-based tactical battles, then pick this up! Oh, and the game itself is also turn-based on the world map, which is a huge plus for me. And if you get tired of playing out the tactical battles, you can just auto-resolve them (which even includes a feature to try them again if you don't like the auto-battle result).",1697994702,1697995035,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

- if each species had their own specific bonus traits on top of the selectable ones. It would make players feel more invested and force tactical plays on both sides from overcoming unavoidable deficiencies. Like how half-lings automatically all had the luck trait (AoW3), making for epic clutch dodging or mega heals. Maybe goblins have backstab, halflings luck and a host of other species specific/body build buffs some picked out of the nature and recent scientific discoveries, like the grip density of gecko feet.   

Original:
- I didn't encounter any bugs other than major choppiness after running the application for over 4-6 hours, playing or paused. It seems to have been fixed or improved on update after reporting it using their built in bug/feature suggestion dialog (a good feature).
- You can create your own personas to take part in story realms
-  Characters you spare/create, from previous realms will sometimes appear to aid you. I may not have seen all the ways this could occur yet.
-  Story Realms are not campaigns (multiple progressive story realms), needs more content, its fun but short, tiny compared to Age Of Wonders 3
-  Renders like a revitalized AoW3, so I wonder why there wasn't more base content if they didn't have to start from scratch
-  Good support and optimizations
-  Plays very well on the steam deck, reload after hours of play and needs smoother keyboard integration if you like naming everything yourself
-  Reviewed at the end of July 2023, I will revise it as the expansions mature because paradox and triumph do like to stagger major improvements over time
-  A no brainer if the price was 25 quid at base considering how much of the same content comes from AoW3, short series of campaigny story realms and price of the announced set of expansions which I don't think include their own campaigny story realms",1690687652,1697706574,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

If you are a fan of any fantasy or scifi based grand strategy, you will be a fan of this. Everything works, no major issues, mechanics seem plentiful and understandable and nice to manage. Many nice quality of life choices in design as well.

It's not perfect though. Some issues in fast paced end-game gameplay hinders a smooth experience such as pathfinding before/after teleporters. Too many notifications of Empire possibilities. Also after turn 100 in a large map the AI turns take way too long (up to 5 minutes until its your turn again on a pro gaming laptop from 2019) and like everyone says, the allied AI is silly. They just stand there 5-10 hexes away while you do all the bashing. The difficulty settings for story missions are too far apart; normal is too easy, hard is too hard

One tip for players if a game seems tedious to progress: If you dont like the manual combat, dont do it. I used to like it back in AOW2-3 times, but no longer. In my total of 50h of gameplay I have played less than 5 combats manually (and have beaten the story mode). It just feels wasteful busy work to me and I'm so happy about the auto combat. It is still very useful to know how the units and their abilities work alone and together to set up a functional army even if you don't manage combats yourself.

There are a lot of customization options, but the different factions sometimes feel like they play pretty similarly anyway. 

Okay, so there is a bug where if you push new game, it won't switch screens instantly. If you get impatient and push new game again, it will try to launch a second new game and you will be unable to advance past the realm selection screen. Sometimes you can fix it by opening and closing the encyclopedia, but if you just don't spam click the new game button, you should be good to go.

Devs, it seems like you could fix this by disabling the new game button after it's pushed until the user either pushes the back button or the select button on the next screen.

1. VERY deep faction creation - idk why some ppl complain about lack of customization - there are a LOT of customization for your faction and different factions plays really in different ways. You can create literally anyone: Gandalf, Sauron, Deathwing, Arthas e.t.c - roleplay anyone.
2. Complex and deep combat system - probably one of the best turn-based tactics i ever seen. 
3. Strategic layer of the game was greatly improved from previous title and now is a very interesting by itself, not just like addon to combats.
4. Customizable worlds to play in - from fey grass grounds to frozen wastes with superaggro mosnters.\
5. Devs listen to the community and improve game with each DLC or free update.

From the downsides... well, idk - probably the only thing is AI - it's not great (still ok to give you enough challenge for 100-200 hours).

The game launched with some major problems that made multiplayer impossible. Thankfully those issues finally seem to be patched! We still encounter the occasional desync or crash, but we're able to jump right back in where we left off now without the game reverting back several turns like it would at launch. With these issues resolved I can finally say I recommend this game!

With new features like racial abilities being independent of aesthetics and freedom to diverge into different schools of magic, this game has really taken customization to the next level. It does mean you have to self-impose restrictions if you're looking for a classic or themed play style. I'd love to see the ability to guide or limit the independent AI from transforming because currently halfway through each game every independent faction you encounter is an angel or a spawnkin or an astral ghost. And while you have total freedom to customize your people's appearance pre-magic, you're unfortunately not able to get the benefits of a particular transformation without some really stupid looking disfigurements (looking at you, Earthkin!).

But while I may have some qualms with the aesthetics, I'm far and above pleased with the gameplay! Age of Wonders has always excelled at tactical turn-based combat, and this edition brings hundreds of exciting combinations that make for fresh experience each time. The ability to manually replay a battle after a negative result from an auto-calc has allowed me to breeze through the minor battles without a worry of randomly losing an important unit.

The good:
Enchantments mechanic is a nice step-up compared to previous titles.
Units are built using Draft resource, and are created separetely from buildings.
AI turns are quite fast.

The bad:

Combat is a step back compared to tactical battles of Age of Wonders Planetfall. There's no depth, unit skills are meh, tactical spells give usually mild bonuses... generally there's no feeling in the fights. And don't start me on hereos. In Planetfall at least there was some tactics, you could try things... but this? AoW 4 fights are BORING.

Rare resources are lackluster - you're better of not fighting over them - just go straight for the enemy throat.

Too much focus on city building - but hey, on what else can you focus if fights are boring?

There are 4-5 types of units in the game, reused with different almost identical templates. Templates are basically what's the damage source (fire, physical, etc. etc.). Does it matter? No, it doesn't, because you cannot get immunity to damage source, and both defence and damage stacking are easy to do. This is another reason why battles are boring.

The UI and game options are unfinished. For example there's no way to skip/make faster world map movements for enemies only. Strategic World Map is also missing a ton of features, and distinguishing between enemies and allies there is a chore. Finding which Ancient Wonders you conquered is also a hussle. 

Keyboard shortcut to toggle between your armies doesn't take into consideration a shortcut for the army to wait a turn (i.e. if you're in end-game and have like 20 stacks roaming the map it's going to be a chore).

Underground digging mechanics seems unfinished - if you click a button to highlight diggable sectors, you cannot move the army - first you have to undo that... so infuriating.

TL/DR
Fights are boring.
UI is missing a lot of QoL tools.

Surely there are some performance issues (it won't slow down the gaem but will cause audio distortions) it will probably be patched soon (tm) and some people were having issues with crashes and not being able to play. I had a few crashes too but that will probably be fixed soon too.

The reason why I don't recomend is because while the game has a few good systems, it has some very questionable decisions that actively hinder the game significantly. Things like not being able to remove the underground which is a hinder because it doesn't respects relative player distances and therefore very often causes enemies to spawn right next to the player. Things like not being able to chose the hero limit. Things like not being able to remove the cap of how many cities you can have (this is a hinder if you play domination mode as your only choice is to raise almost every town you come across).

The whole game is riddled with some good sterps forward and some steps back too. It's not that the game can't be enjoyed, but as it stands right now it's very hard to recomend until several game start customisation features are added and some balance passes are done, especially considering the price point is 50 Euros which is 10 more than AoW3 was released at (but the same as planetfall).

Turn times are horrible at turn 150, Planetfall was bearable at least. That's with no animations and the camera view at the outer edge of the map. I could not finish the Grexolis campaign due to turn times take more than 10 mins. (Playing on hard at turn 224) The allied AIs takes too long ""thinking"" what to do with their units or their objective. 
I tried 2 builds. So far build customization is fine. Can't say much about it for now since if I play it on standard difficulty it seems that the any build synergies are viable. 
It's AOW 3 with Planetfall customization and game issues. If you want to play the game on lower difficulty or simultaneous turn mode to reduce long game sessions to avoid the horrible turn times, then it's a game for you. If you like to play harder difficulties with extended game time then you'll be frustrated wasting most of your time waiting for your turn. 
This may be my last AOW seeing how turn times and game performance has has gotten worse than Planetfall.


EDIT:
Tried the game post patch. Still not sure if i can objectively compare the results.
Subjectively the army spend less time swapping units without moving. Allied armies ""intended to attack a city"" do seem to initiate movement faster. Although, assuming that if the camera focuses on an army, the AI is ""thinking"" what to do with the army: it still takes at least 5-10 secs after the camera moves to the army before moving. 

Note that I only tried loading the previous autosave from Grexolis. I have already completed the map a few days after the initial review (shifting to another game while waiting for the turn to finish). I also only tried 3 turns (took 11-16 mins per turn) to see if it would get me to play the map again. I will see if I could hop back in, for now have moved on to another game.

Having a research tree tied to the book you choose is just a little strange, but not too off-putting. If you're a fan of 3, you might be a bit displeased with the things that were left out, (But will soon be available as DLC </3) but it's not a bad entry point for people new to the series.

I play on Brutal and the AI still plays bad ( even with AI patch ) It just try's too wear you down because they can spawn literal full stacks of units because they got pretty much infinite money(cheats). Thats not what i would call ''hard'' thats just cheating mode on. There is a mod that shows you what they get and you just facepalm and think that they just didnt bother with AI. Not make them smarter just give them more advantages. 

The game misses Tomes of Water and Desert for example. The latter one i mean there is desert adaptation yet i cannot change my tiles to desert to make use of this perk i choose? Bit odd! I also learned from other players that knows the lore more then I do from AoW1 and 2 that there are more things missing. I cannot comment on that since i dont know it but I take their word for it, it seems to me they want to add this later as DLC, judge that yourself. 

The performance of the game varies between systems, but also people dont mind 30 fps or less on games like these, i do, because it doesnt look at all demanding or beautiful compared to some other games. Yet for me the frametimes (frame times is not FPS ) on this game is horrific in battles. Everytime a unit is swapped a small spike in frametime is noticed. going from 120+ fps to -60 fps back to 120 fps is almost the same as playing it on <30 fps. (that means framtimes spike from low to high for 1-2 seconds ). 

Crashes. I had a lot, more then my 200+ games I own combined. always the same too, graphic error 0x0etcetc. I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. Oh and fun fact, just now another Driver error when i had this game alt tabbed and went back in !!

Sound and music, it seems barren, i feel like each unit of each race should have its own voice over, they all seem to sound the same. And music could have had more tracks or better yet, race specific tracks, wouldnt you want dwarfen music if you pick dwarfes? Or Gnomes or the moles!? And if you race change to undead (with tomes) have it mixed with that? Could be awesome! Immersive  it is a 4x after all!

Gameplay, I always feel like every single tactical battle i do is exactly the same way, I hug up, buff my units, summon my elemental/animal/undead. Wait for them to come to me and crush them. Works everytime! Which SUCKS! I dont want that! I want to be challenged, make me think about my actions etc. If i can win impossible battles and only loose because the AI spams so many stacks that make no sense that they can since that  probably means -1000 gold per turn, but hey gotta beat humies! It is lackluster. 

I also find that the AI doesnt help much in wars if you ally with them, they dont seem to do much at all this is painfully shown with the city states they just move around their own area and that is it. 
The Last patch of AI improvements when i played did make it better, they gather the first few rounds to buff up in tactical battle  and then they attack but the end result is the same, i spawn a few units and let them focus on those and you flank them, sadly works every time.
They like to focus down 1 unit to kill it so my tactic still works.
On the world map the AI tends to like to forward settle, lots of outposts! The higher the difficulty the more they do it, be advised because they will block you. Sometimes I wonder how they walk 100 tiles from their city just to go near me to make ouposts, like they beeline towards me and know I am there, but that cant be right? Thats cheating! :) 

The worst thing of it all, the larger the map the worse the turn times becomes, at 100+ turns It starts to go from <1min per faction {I timed it} too averaged at 3min 40 seconds per faction. On a 7800X3D, 4070TI, 32 gig ram. If i win by score (150 turns) the last 10 turns i just click next turn for 10 mins+ and win because I cant be bothered to do anything else, just to slow. 

*EDIT* They did patch this but i havent tested this! It could be better!!!

In my personal opinion, either get this on a sale or wait until all DLC is out and the game is patched (it is very buggy at times and the performance is horrible)

The short version of the review: 
1. Performance is horrible and there's quite a lot of bugs in there.
2. The UI is very unintuitive and obscure (what is a unit's upkeep? what unit is the game talking about? etc.)
3. The game is very unbalanced, not every tome of spells or society is the same (specially in multiplayer)
4. The AI has insane cheats to keep up with you (and is very, very stupid) 
5. You can't ""roleplay"" as the kind of ruler or race you'd like to be (you're gonna get stomped)
6. There are very bad game design choices (buildings are kind of useless, who thought separating building production and unit production resources was a good idea?, why does every single AI hate me upon making contact?)

The long version of the review:
Being my first Age of Wonders game, I cannot compare it to any other game in the franchise, however, what I can do is compare it to other strategy games I know. The best comparisons I can make are to either Civilization 6 or Endless Legend (specially EL since it's a fantasy setting too). It's based on that comparison that I'm making all of these critiques.

This game likes to brand itself as a  ""make your ruler, play your way"" kind of game, and gives you options to customize your race and ruler so that, in theory, you can play that way. However, what ends up happening is something like an army painter: all you do is choose the colours, because everyone can do the same things you do. Orcs are no different than humans or ratmen. Your traits can be the same no matter which race you are. Underground, industrialistic elves? If you change the race for dwarves, the gameplay stays the same. Thus, by having no restriction on what each race does, races become more like a reskin, and thus feel not impactful at all.

And that's just the race creation. The tomes of magic are a major problem: would you like to be a halfling champion with nature affinity that grows his cities to amazing sizes? Well, the frost queen with 1 tome of cryomancy will kill you off because her magic is simply that good early game, so you'll have to stay away from that kind of gameplay and pick up criomancy, or hordes, or lightning to compete, because every other early game tome gets blown out of the water. Would you like to play industrialistic tomes and play defensively until you get your wonder cities up and running? Good luck man, because the guy playing wildlife summons can get 18-24 units in the first 10 turns, and all you have to show for not doing the same is +20 stability and 8 units max.

There's plethora of problems more in the game:
The performance is ass (I can run everything on 120 fps but this game makes me drop to 30-60)
There's a lot of bugs (incorrect buff/debuff applied, unit takes a resource upkeep it never states it needs, negative traits are considered positive and viceversa)
The UI is so unhelpful it makes no sense for it to be as simplified as it is (it doesn't tell you clearly how much a unit costs, what units does the ""summon a Tier III wildlife unit"" can summon?, ""Chance to get a spider unit reward"" which tier? what kind of unit? what's the chance?)
The AI plays like Warhammer AI (gets an insane amount of cheats to keep up with you early because late game you will always win)

Extremely sprawling combinations (there is no almost no tech tree, it's just a giant lake), very atmospheric and lively, visually superb. Some very interesting innovations like temporary hit points to avoid healing abuse, turning your enemies into gold, mutating your entire race, getting random units when annexing territory, and the freedom to combine at will makes for some very fun playstyles (gilded age zombies, phantom wolf riders fighting in phalanx formation, chaos-inducing battlemages, hordes of magic animals). 

Some improvement opportunities : 
- Could probably accomodate much deeper writing (I loved the unit backstories in AoW3, please make those, and also more in-game events or even backstories, including events with follow-ups like in CK or Stellaris ; mutating your race is fun, but them having no opinion on the matter is batshit crazy). 
- In addition to investing in writing, investing in a big neural net strategic AI would be good, to help both find and nerf overpowered combos (e.g. Tome of the Demon Gate + Tome of the Archmage for Very Fast Balors that recover mobility after teleporters) and make smarter opponents, much more interesting to play against (some radically adapted combat style on their part could also nerf the combos). 
- Also, maybe mobility and survivability should be equalized more or entirely across units, including in auto-combat. One ends up a bit single-minded on those after a while. For example, in addition to the Very Fast Balors above, I just tried a playthrough with enchantment-oriented wolf-mounted glade runners it was ridiculous. Much easier to do auto-combat as well, compared to harebrained melee combinations that only the player can do, and must do by hand 30 times in a row (then again, a neural net AI could help with that).

It's a turn based 4x with heavy influence of Civ, HoMM, with tactical hex based combat.  There's fair criticism that the over customization of the game takes the identity away of the individual races, and that there's no true campaign or story.  These points are valid, but to me what I want is an infinitely replayable 4x that I can experiment with crazy combinations of spells and traits.  Which a locked in set of races would not provide.  This is the best fantasy 4X currently available and the systems focus on that.  Old World being the best historical 4X with it's systems being different and benefiting that only a few different 'races' to play.

AoW4 is worth your time.  It's currently sitting at 'very positive' with a horde of negative reviews based on game launching crashes.  I can only imagine an overwhelming positive score if these weren't present and see a bright future for this game after initial launch hotfixes.  I have experienced only 1 crash in roughly 10 hours of play.

Every update it's the same comment that they're working on it and it's harder than they expected all while paid DLC is coming out and other minor updates are implemented.

It stands out for allowing players to choose from six distinct cultures and blend various racial traits, origins, and tomes, ensuring no two runs are the same. This divergence from the traditional approach of adhering to a single race/civilization and strategy throughout a run may not sit well with some long-time fans, but personally, I appreciate this refreshing take.

The combat system is undeniably the highlight of the game. It brings together an array of elements including diverse unit types, zone of control, line of sight, adjacency bonuses, spells, and combat/unit enchantments. This, coupled with a vast array of hero items and skills, translates to an exhilarating gameplay experience.

Moreover, the realm traits, particularly presence traits, add a zest to the gameplay, ensuring each map offers a unique and special experience.

While the game excels in many areas, it maintains a decent standard in other aspects such as city management and diplomacy. These features may not be revolutionary but they hold their own.

I find the pantheon system quite engaging, though I wish the pantheon heroes had a more substantial influence on successive playthroughs.

Looking forward, here are some areas ripe for enhancement:

- Cultural differentiation: Increasing the distinctiveness of cultures in the mid to late game stages would be a welcome change. Introducing tier IV/V cultural units might suffice. I am eager to see the solutions the forthcoming Golem update will present.

- AI improvement: Despite improvements ushered in by the latest Watcher update, the AI still falters in areas such as clearing wonders and optimizing resource utilization.

- Free cities control: I envision a system somewhat similar to CIV VI's suzerain control that grants more authority over Free cities.

- Water gameplay: The current setup feels underdeveloped. I am optimistic that the impending Golem update will enhance this aspect.

- Item Forge: The existing system offers limited control over the items players can acquire. Although alliances do facilitate access to a selection of items, having greater control would be a positive development. I look forward to the enhancements set to be introduced in the Golem update.
Overall, AOW 4 has delivered a commendable gaming experience, and with continuous improvements on the horizon, I am excited to see how it evolves.

I felt that Age of Wonders 3 was the best 4X fantasy game developed.  After working through the changes with Age of Wonders 4, I can now state that it has replaced AoW 3 as the best 4X fantasy game. This includes the Warlock: Master of the Arcane and Warlock 2: The Exiled which are also titles published under Paradox Interactive. I strongly recommend this game for 4X Fantasy strategy gamers.

If the Triumph Developers see this...

The feed back that I wish to give you is that I was disappointed with the change to the Adjacent Hex Rule.  Now the most number of stacks that I can have in a battle is only 3. I liked the original Adjacent Hex Rule as it was in AoW 3.  It allowed for more massive battles and the ability to use force of numbers as a strategy to take on a more powerful stack or two.

I have always like the Tactical Auto Battle and it looks like the AI is handling itself well in battle. I'm entertained seeing the AI playing things out.  On a Strategic (game map) level, I encourage you to continue to further the AI in its  strategic ability. You have been improving in that area with each and every game.

The last point is that during Tactical Auto Battle there does seem to be short lags occurring from time to time. Changes graphics settings doesn't make any difference to that. The one down side to AoW 3 was that at 100 turns and after, the AI did take quite a while to finish its turns. I don't know if you are able to make the AI more efficient without affecting intelligent play.

Anyway, that's my feedback so far to other Strategy Gamers and to the Triumph Developers.

It allows you to make your own race and faction with a large degree of freedom in the unit roster and effects (you get a decent line of units from your chosen culture, the rest is done through research). While this makes factions less unique overall, I like the freedom.
Combat is more involved, with battles happening on their own maps instead of having a single unit take an entire peninsula for itself and shooting into the other. The battle maps themselves can get samey, but I prefer the more localized scope.
City states, or ""free cities"": Can be vassalized somewhat easily over time, after which you can turn them into one of your own cities or keep as is. Trading with them can give you more growth, production, etc. for gold. They (and some dungeons) can also provide quickly recruitable units. Useful as allies or fertilizer alike.
Magic allows you to do the expected dmg/buffs/debuffs/summons both in combat and the world map. The spells are limited to either interaction, but they are still neat.
The events during the game are fun, though they can become repetitive over time. Far more interactive than having no events.
The fact that building construction and unit production are two different things feels so much better than keeping them combined. You also get more money or food depending if you're not building or recruiting. Another nice thing is that the buildings themselves are self-sustaining. No more negative income just because you got a library in your city, and thus, no dependency on city states or other factions to keep yourself afloat.
Declaring wars is also different. Here you have grievances (which I believe Civ 6 has as well in some capacity), which can be gained from willful trespasses (yes, you can walk through foreign lands without declaring a war, funny how that doesn't seem so difficult to do, hmm...), insults, fabricated events, or even taking lands surprisingly far away from either side's cities. Finally you are 100% justified in kicking the AI's face in for settling in your backyard and it feels so good. The AI can't suddenly force you into 10 turn NAPs either for having troops ""near"" their borders.
You also have heroes, which act as your settlers and generals. They can boost themselves or their army depending on how you level them.
There are unique resources on the map, but they are a ""get one and you're good"" type of deal, so not as intricate as Civ 5 in that sense. They provide a buff to you as long as you have access to it, which can be either very helpful or passable in strength.

All in all, while the game lacks some mechanics that Civ 5 has like religion and strategic resources, the pros outweigh the cons for me.",1695062531,1695062531,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game often crashes for no reason when you do the normal playing, especially when you take some city and want to transfer it as a vassal or take over and absorb, when it comes to the turn of this to happen (after 3-4 turns after taking the action) the game crashes.
It often crashes when you take over someone's capital city and after that you kill the ruler.
For example now in my current game I've taken 2 cities from Fangir, where one was his capital city. And I can't defeat him even if I've actually defeated him around 20 turns ago. I've breached the city walls where he is hiding but when I win the fight with him the game crashes. Also I have asynchronously taken his 4th city which I can't transform because then the game also crashes...
That's the major bug which makes me abandon the game for the 4th time. Yes, this bug is since day 0 and it's still not fixed. It even seems like it breaks more often after last DLL with dragons. That's also the reason why I do not recommend this game at the moment. Thats also the reason why I won't ever again buy any game in prerelease game from paradox.
There are also some other bugs. The 2 things worth mentioning here are:
1. The game have issues with speed, computing and movement of AI players when there are few of them. Like other says, it can take even to 30min for 9 AI players to move in late game. It's the very same issue which occurs in the Age of Wonders 3 and Planetfall.
2. The AI here actually is veeeeryy pooor. Very often the AI is doing only some dumb moves to move from one place to the other, close place which changes nothing. And then flee without fight. The AI only intervene when it has superior powers. For example In this game I've fought 1v5 and even then often one of them was moving close to my borders and then flee...even if 3 of his allies were attacking me in different places. Also the other AI, not from this 5, at turn 193 had only 1 city...because all he had done was creating a small army and standing in the town, building 1 outpost and that's it. Even if he didn't have any other AI close to him and it had plenty of free space to grow. Please note that those AIs levels are the highest available in the game. Very dissapointing.

Personally I don't like that there are no campaigns like in previous versions of the universum.

Apart from these negatives, there are also positives.
The game overall is very interesting and gives pleasure while playing. It is more balanced compared to the previous versions. For example it is way harder to create 1-2 stacks of heroes armies which would defeat everyone easly. You need to collaborate with your economy, reasearches and other units to create unstoppable army.

EDIT: Day after publishing this there was a patch which seems to fix crashing problem. Good job!
I don't know did they fix performance and AI issues. According to release notes they did but I neither can confirm nor deny it.

EDIT2: Once again the AI is making game crashing. Imagine that you are playing for several hours and after some point the game is always crashing. At the AI movement. They should definitely fire the person who is developing this for such a long time and still can't make it right.

Pros:
- Finally a 4x game that good on all levels. Strategy level is complex and there is a lot of meaningful choices to be made. Tactical battles amazing. Even diplomacy have some depth to it.
- Stunning visuals. It's artstyle is coherent and charming.
- Tome system grants you a lot of freedom and control in creating unique factions. I've managed to recreate my favorite races from different games and movies.
- There is new resource called ""Imperium"" and it's role is so you could drive development of your empire in the desired direction. It's like if ""effort"" was a resource. Also the fact that strong units require Imperium as upkeep solves problem with doomstack's in the late game.
- Best fog of war I've ever seen.

Cons:
- There is no restriction on how much tomes you could learn so in the late game your faction will become the jack of all trades and master of all. You could learn only one tome of the last tier but it makes little difference. At least there should be restriction in race transformations and unit enchantments stacking.
- There is no way to sort spells(you could choose 3 favorite combat spells but it's not enough) and in the late game spellbook becomes crowded.
- In previous AOW games terrain type played bigger role on strategic and tactical level.
- Magic visuals weak and lacks in impact. It's strange contrast with otherwise visually gorgeous game.
- At the moment on the strategy level AI is...meh. Just to name a few examples: unit concealment not working, outpost spamming, stacks of enemies wondering aimlessly around poorly protected town. But it's early days and Triumph is known for long term support of their games so it probably would be tuned and improved.

It does have some rough spots, the AI is a bit lackluster but frankly very few strategy games of this genre are going to have any kind of impressive AI.
And there are some people complaining about the artstyle, graphics, or even the voice over work.

Played thousands of hours of  Age of Wonder over the years (1-4) and dabbled with Planetfall. If you have enjoyed any of these games, you will get something from AOW4 as it has common themes that run through the franchise. 

The concept is essentially a blend of HOMM, CIV, Master of Magic, Battle for Westnoth (tiny bit)- and other turn based 4X games. However, if all these name drops mean nothing to you..... this might get you into the genre as it is a well crafted example of many things done well. The biggest change is that the game is a lot more streamlined so that a 100 turn game where you hit a victory condition is common on hard difficulty. The visuals, interface and core mechanics make sense to most gamers that have played this genre - and it is generally quite a forgiving game as most combination of race, build, and spell tomes are feasible.  

However, unlike previous games in this series that had some often infuriating mechanics (lucky Halflings), or race/alignment combinations that forced radically different play-styles (undead and nomads as examples), AOW4 is quite homogeneous. For example, the power of the starting melee, ranged, scouts etc is largely the same. The decision to make race purely cosmetic and the similarity of the starting locations are additional examples. In fact, very few starting combinations are OP. In addition, rush tactics have also been neutered by artificial means. It seems the developers have actively tried to achieve balance - which is admirable but can lead to it being a bit bland. At least bland if you are not using any mods. Or if your only goal is to find the optimum way to win. On the positive side of this choice, all the cultures and societies are fun to play and hopefully, the devs will add more of these to further bring variety. 

There is a lot of potential in this game but it is unfair to compare it to AOW3... it would be like comparing CIV3 to CIV6, same franchise, radically different games. It is also a tad buggy for a full price launch game but the save game mechanic is well done (and largely automatic) so it is not a deal breaker.... reload and your good. 

I enjoy the game and continue to play it while regularly testing increasingly strange builds, strategies and map combinations. I would highly recommend exploring the mod community if you start to feel jaded.  Overall, it is a good addition to the series and hopefully, between the developers and the mod community, it will evolve into an experience that has the same longevity as AOW3 which was a great... although sometime frustrating experience at times.",1694437011,1694437181,True,2,1,0.532679736614227295,0,True,False,False

It captivated me, hitting too many boxes for me to dislike the game.
There are many bugs that might ruin someone's gameplay, but for me, all the good things justify everything else. I hope the devs can iron these issues out so that game becomes a true gem.
IMO, this game tries to be a jack-of-all-trades, and because of that it loses as a strategy to the likes of Civilization, Endless Legends, etc, and at the same time, it loses as an RPG to the likes of Skyrim, Gothic, etc. It doesn't make this game inferior, yet when you play it for a long time you feel these restrictions of a small choice pool. Before you learn all nuances and start to grasp these confines - the game feels like a marvel and ""dreams come true"".
Because of that, I think that this game is an excellent addition to your library, if you like strategies and at the same time like to create your own characters (like in the Lord of the Rings strategy series). Those who like to roleplay their own hero/race/world - there's enough stuff to do it. But if you try to replace Civ 6 with Age of Wonders 4 - you'll probably see it as a more forgettable game, one that you'll complete and move on.

Review from several hours of gameplay compared to other AOW games;

-Better than all AOW games even AOW2 Shadow Magic
-Combat tactics vastly improved and easier to grasp, since you can look up unit perks very easily with little obscurity like in previous AOW games, so you don't need an encyclopedic memory to know what you're doing
-It looks amazing
-If you're new to 4X, you have MUCH to learn and will be blown away by the possibilities and varieties of play. If you're expecting balance, I can't even remark on that yet

I really want to enjoy this game, but everything I like about it just doesn't wow me in any way. 
Race creation is cool at first, but because all assets are pretty much universal, you end up with the same clothing options on everybody and the models start clipping through each other in chunky ways.

Exploration would be fun if the game actually allowed you to do it, but you're constantly forced to send your heroes to counter enemy threats.
Warfare would be fun if it wasn't exhausting turning a 3v3  auto-battle loss into a victory, twice in a row, then doing the same thing again because the AI is somehow able to generate six full-stack armies three turns after you wiped them out the last time.

There's cool concepts here but this game's value is closer to 15 USD than 40 (or 50 without the discount *pukes*)

I had a bit of skepticism since some reviews from fans of older games in the series were mixed.

However I'm having a lot of fun with this title and have already gotten my money's worth. Think Sid Meier's Civilization series with tactical, turn-based RPG battles.

The customizable factions are great with myriad viable options and it's only going to get better as mods and expansions come out. The auto-combat feature is surprisingly useful for keeping trash fights from bogging down the experience and feels very fair in it's outcomes. For close fights you can usually do better by fighting manually, which is nice because it keeps close/important fights meaningful and you feel really clever if you pull a major victory out of a hard battle with good tactics.

It does things differently from the other Age of Wonders titles but a lot of the changes are mostly a refreshing departure. In general, it seems like many of the changes were meant to give players more freedom to be creative in how they create/play their factions, which works well in some cases, but has some drawbacks also.

The way cities grow has changed, for example. In this game you acquire provinces surrounding the city to develop farms, mines, or other structures that add capabilities or resources to you city so it can grow in size, recruit units faster, or research spells more quickly. I like that this adds more of a strategic element to how you develop your cities, and how you defend/attack them. It also helps each city's placement feel  more impactful (especially since the number of cities you can construct is somewhat limited early-mid game). There's some use in raiding provinces surrounding a city (for money and to destroy key structures like teleporters), and incentive to engage enemies outside of your city walls now.

Another pretty big change is how factions are handled. In past AOW games, factions were preset (Orc, Elves, Nomads, etc.), with set strengths and weaknesses. In this game, you can create your own factions and set their theme. You can still make tropes like elves that specialize in archery and ambushing from forests, or orcs that are barbarians excelling at melee combat, or get creative with more uncommon fantasy themes.

A current shortcoming of the game is its world map AI. The tactical AI (during battles) is good, and can be challenging. The AI performance on the world map struggles to put up a consistent challenge, or to help the player much in the case of allied AI. Allied AI generally ignores its allies, while (in my experience) enemy AI tends to stagnate once its put on the defensive.

One change I found notable is how spells are acquired now. You start specialized in certain lores (or tomes) of magic, but you can relatively easily research almost all spells by the end of a game. This is nice in the spirit of being creative with the theme of your faction, but also can create games that feel similar after you play through enough matches (especially if your matches are long). In past games, you'd be more restricted to particular lores of magic, which helped give each game more variety (you'd be less likely to experience it all in one game).

I have enjoyed 100+ hours of the game and in that time I feel like I've experienced most of what the game has to offer for now. The pantheon system is very fun, and kept me going for a while. 

I'm looking forward to future updates that will add more variety to the game, e.g., adding to naval battles, more spells,  faction customization options, features, and updates meant to address the world map AI. The game is enjoyable as is, but hopefully such changes will improve on its replayability.",1693964917,1693967012,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Was a big fan of AOW3, and so far, this feels like an excellent upgrade with some specific caveats,

*With how customizable our heroes and factions are, it would've been awesome to see them shine in an official campaign.
*Races no longer have innate traits or stats, robbing them of some of their flavor.
*I wish we had more cultures/classes to work with, not less.
*Multiplayer can be very finicky, involving a lot of desyncing and crashing. The hotseat system makes this bearable but it still needs a lot of polish.
*Selecting and deselecting units on the world map and in battle can be frustrating, especially if they're standing atop resources or structures. It also results in a lot of unintentional move-orders. Most egregious for me being at the start of a turn, I'll go to move a unit, and the camera will jump to another unit that completed an action from the previous turn (like excavating) resulting in my initial unit running in that direction. (Please fix this!)
*I want more clothing options.

Despite every complaint I have, the core gameplay is still super enjoyable and'll keep me playing for many more hours. I generally love when developers put out frequent patches and updates, and from what I've seen so far I'm fairly confident that some of my issues will be addressed or ironed out.

The Dragons DLC is solid, and I hope future content will bring more flavor to the game. What I especially hope for is that more mechanical depth is added through free updates to the base game and not solely through paid content. Thankfully with magic-victories being reworked for free and the Dragon DLC consisting mostly of additional ruler types/races/tomes, I think the game is currently on the right foot in that regard.",1693863376,1693863376,True,0,0,0.492327392101287842,0,True,False,False

Its just not all that fun for me.

I've played the earlier version of Age of Wonders set in space and I hoped there would be a lot more improvements.

So far it feels more like a re-skin and minor gameplay tweaks than anything new enough to justify actually buying this thing.

Its fun in the sense that you can mix and match a whole lot of traits, origins, spells, and whatever factors they use to define a faction for you to play as.

But at its core it still the same old game I bought years ago and the bells and whistles don't hide the age as well as it should.

I'd give it a 3/5 if I'm being generous.

Might be worth it if there is a half off sale but as is, only super fans would think its great bang for buck.

There is a story buried in the game somewhere but you'd have to slog through it by playing the game if you want to uncover it along with other features and gameplay mechanics in a slow drip to avoid overwhelming the player with too many details.

Problem is, I can't find myself caring. Its not a fast paced, griping game and I don't feel any emotional hook strong enough to burn hours if not days playing this game to unlock a few new cool bells and whistles.

It feels not like replay value so much as more make work chores honestly.

A very good attempt, but sadly not quite enough.

It also seems to suffer from bad timing since I am playing this around the same time Baulder's Gate 3 came out, and while BG3 isn't perfect either and they are two totally different kinds of game but the amount of interaction, cut scenes, actual characters, and fun to be had just makes this seem lacking badly.",1693321576,1693321576,False,9,4,0.532112479209899902,0,True,False,False

An RPG 4x game with unique races to play as and stories which partially unfold as you play.

This is basically magic civilization and that's kinda it. A lot of the unique mechanics from previous Age of Wonders have been drowned out, instead almost all focus lies on the visual customization of your species with some very minor boons which hardly change the feel of the race, only culture really matters.

This is... not great. I vastly preferred each race being different over each culture being different. The decisions are rare, quests barely happen. You can tell they wanted RPG elements, but they end up feeling like an afterthought, which is a shame.

The maps are interesting, sure, but it seems hugely focused on smaller games, and the options to properly change the map itself are rather limiting, especially when it comes to game size or length. The AI also tends to spam a lot more than anything, and isn't very interactive beyond that.

Long and clunky after you have three armies on each side. It makes you want to auto calculate all of them just to avoid the annoyance. It feels like a waste of time. There's a short window of fun when you have one or two armies, but when it gets to three- torture!
-Spells are visually anticlimactic... little zaps for lightning- little sparkles for whatever buff- no cool special effects
-A.I. can regain 3 full armies in like 2 turns after defeating wave after wave. Even if you destroy their empire and they have no means of replenishing, they do...
-Unit models are microscopic. It's hard to tell if you have elves, halflings, orcs, etc. They all look the same even at closest zoom.

NO MAP EDITOR- WHY?? So many map makers have been asking for this feature for this game and Planetfall. 

Difficulties change after you select them.

-The world map is beautiful! Can't stop looking at the little details! 
-Character and  faction creation is fun!
-Pantheon system is awesome
-Hero customization and gear is great 
-Lore is cool though I wish there was more.

They're just way too obvious, and turn what should be a fun part of the game: the tactical combat, into a complete slog. 

For one, there does not seem to be a limit on how many times they can instant purchase units (rather than wait for the units to build). They will continually send 12-18 stacks at you while you probably only have your one 18 stack. At this point one of two things happens, you get destroyed over time,  or, you re so ahead that you can repeatedly destroy their endless armies with minimal loss. Neither is fun, the former because it never feels good to lose to obvious cheat mechanics, the latter because it really just turns into a slog when you have to battle 10 armies before even sieging the city.

The AI also always seems to know where you are? I know there are vision techs and abilities in this game. But its pretty suspicious that every AI empire, regardless of my vision techs, heroes, and/or how disparate our techs are, can zero in on my armies from fog of war, often leading to unexpected ambushes from full 18 stacks. Sometimes you win these, sometimes you lose, neither feels good since the game feels like its actively working against you in a meta way.

And this is a shame too, since in theory this game would be great. The leader/race building is fun and varied, the various book combos are cool, the tile based upgrades and combo special buildings are neat. But for someone who likes the conquer and combat part of 4x games, having the least frustrating strategy to be just sitting there without interacting with anyone is disappointing. My issue is not with AI cheats generally, I know they are necessary to make the game somewhat balanced, but having the cheats be so ""on screen"" just does not feel good.

Also please fix the vassal AI, its so dumb to see enemy units traipsing in my vassals territory and making their way into my lands unimpeded when the vassal army (who is at war with them) could easily take care of it.

I am Toadlord Todd Bloodwaagh of the Primal Redtoads and the world is so big and so shiny. I will add to this review when I got some more stuff done.
/edit: So it took me 22 hours to win my first game with only 2 other leaders. One of them got nasty a little but demolished him easily and ended up with expansion win. Next will be magic sand cats.

There are many concepts thrown in but they blend well together. Many features are long expected for any 4X game, some fresh ideas and also conservative designs, so it doesn't feel too much like a muntant unicorn. I will extend on the following list in the future, 

Good stuff:
- Graphical world design - waving trees and you can zoom in enough
- Visual design of units and data sheets - best I have seen
- User interface - most of the stuff has been thought of very deeply. Clean and intuitive.
- Tooltips of tooltips of tooltips of
- Game creation (realm, race, leader) - fun to do, DLC will still add stuff I assume
- Very handy managing multiple armies as they will help each other.
- Autocombat with replay and automatics IN a manual fight are very handy to save time.
- Pace and options of fights feel very much better than in AoW3.
- Finally: reduced stacks of units do reduced damage!
- Strategic casting improved - prepare and store spells
- Savegames are finally sorted to keep the sessions separated.
- Plagues (extending bandit camps) are great
- District system - hated it in planetfall but here it actually works and gives a second build layer (like that in Civ). Also you can have Megacities with that.
- Random events/decisions - Dramatic and funny with meaningful outcomes.

Neutral:
- Books feel great thematically but also very slim. DLCs need to extend on these
- Pantheon is a good idea and great to get you going but i feels unfinished. DLCs need to improve this.
- Imperium progression. Nice system but it felt more like a trash bin for the Imperium points. You take what you take and leave what you can, not very meaningful descisions.
- Race transformations - nice to have but feels strange to transform so many times.
- Terraforming is more handy than in AoW3 but I still enjoy the realm spells from AoW2 more.
- Diplomacy - much thought put into it but still annoying somehow (/edit: when you get used to it, it can hold up with everything we had)
- Hero progression - Very much generic standard.
- Victory conditions - Sometimes I'm half though a map and don't know what victory I aim for. Then magic was the most handy but that changed now. I would love to see who has how many points (total/military+economic)
- I never glanced a single time at the strategic casting points. Does that mean it's designed bad or well?

Negative:
- No local hot-seat, so less chance getting a friend into this.
- Automatic building for cities are there but somehow they don't work for me.

I have big trust into these guys that they will have everything fixed as they did with AoW3.",1683072211,1692260001,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The decisions made in production for this one will definitely put series veterans off, as other reviews have mentioned that with enhanced customization comes trimmed features, especially of racially-specific abilities and units which are now relegated to Tome summon spells or Tome research. Maybe Triumph will add some more spice to races later besides two traits (which you can change in the customization tab) later once the expansions start dropping, but until then I will echo a tad bit of disappointment that races are basically skin swaps and nothing more, having even less distinct identity than in Planetfall which was already heading a little more in that direction with mods being more substantive than races, but races still having unique mods. However, the quality of life enhancements in my opinion make up for this deficiency nicely, especially for sieges and city management. I know some people will really miss the days of having to escort a civilian builder to a desired province to construct an outpost, and some will undoubtedly miss the days of doing a siege full up with just your armies, maybe some siegecraft you built, and an abundance of W A L L S without any breaches to start. To rebut, I'll drop a hot take: I never enjoyed having to manage civilian and siegecraft as part of my standing army complete with resource drain, AND I never liked how padded out the rounds became with them in it. At some point it just felt like a slog to have to build all of those ON TOP of my building production queue since they were not separate queues (which is the GREATEST quality of life improvement this game in particular makes bar none.) Planetfall's native militia mechanic was a great replacement to the siege system but felt lacking in particular areas, but THIS new siege mechanic strikes that perfect balance of having to leave a garrison at the city while having emplacements to shell enemies at your gates, PLUS these emplacements can be used offensively as well as defensively which is a nice touch. 

Now, I'd like to take a moment to rebut some common misconceptions some of the ""old blood"" have against this game which are patently false, the most obvious one being ""No CaMpAiNg?!"" There IS a campaign, it's just not a SPECIFIC racial one, nor is it labeled very neatly. What the campaign in this game is are the series of maps labeled ""Age of the Godir,"" and more maps and scenarios are unlocked upon completing the prior maps in the series. The story is pretty standard fantasy fare involving a cabal of Wizard Kings and an alliance of Champions and those who work against them, but it is serviceable and does a great job of making it feel like I am the one making the campaign unfold myself. Whether you qualify that as a ""real campaign"" or not I guess is up to you. Another misconception is that Dire Penguins cannot be summoned: they can, just invest in Nature tomes and you will find them eventually, or you can mod them in with Triumph's Tome of Penguins mod. Another misconception is terraforming: it actually has not been downgraded at all, it's just more progression-locked in the Tomes and less readily reachable than in 3. You can still collapse mountains, freeze entire sections of the map, engulf provinces in lava, you just need the right Tome for it. It also still does make a difference in combat, especially with some of the in-game racial transformations you can do (like frostlings benefit from icy terrain, earthkin benefit from rocky terrain, etc.) and is another layer of unit enhancement. The final misconception I will discuss is the argument that the Tomes all play the same: that is SO not true. Some tomes are summon-focused, some are buff-focused, some are spell-focused. These play styles can overlap but by no means are they the same, I find myself changing my approach to certain engagements quite often depending on what Tome I am using. So, there you go oldheads, eat your heart out. 

Despite this lavish praise, all that glitters is not in fact golden, and there are definite areas this game could be improved in. I will start with the most obvious elephant in the room: W A T E R !  C O M B A T ! While not A SINGLE GAME in the series has ever mastered water combat to the point where I actually look forward to it, some of them (AoW 3) were able to make it a little more engaging. Now, it has been reduced to a single map tileset, and is more reductive and less engaging than ever before. By the time you are building boats late because you did not start as a frogman, you are basically at the end of the game. And when you DO build boats, the combat loop becomes the same two or three unit skins hitting each other ad nauseum. It is neither interesting nor fun, and I typically avoid water maps like the plague because of it. My suggestions: add more seafaring play style option, add more unique water-only or water-dominant units, or just make maps that are all water, or at least HEAVILY incentivize building boats (besides the Archipelago, and no I still have not been pressured enough to build a single boat unit even on an Archipelago map.) Another complaint, this one being extremely personal: (EDIT, THIS HAS BEEN ADDRESSED!!) NO LIZARDMEN!! :,( My children are gone, hopefully the draconians or some lizardfolk derivative returns in one of the DLCs, I miss having my Gojira children raze my enemies into ash and dust, both the Draconians and Shakarn were easily my most played race in both AoW 3 and Planetfall respectively. The final issue that I would like to see fixed involves the AI: there's passive, and then there's TOO passive. This AI steers more into the latter, although I have not played on the highest difficulty yet so maybe that changes it. Having the AI run to the hills the moment it sees a relatively matched army is kinda sad, especially when the description of said AI faction is ""Barbarian Warmonger"" or ""Feudal Tyrant"" or something to that effect. 

And that's the end of my way-too-long review. If you made it this far, congrats, hopefully I changed your mind about playing this game. It is fantastic in so many ways, and as someone who has played my fair share of strategy games it is well worth the pricetag.

A more ""civ"" style map that somewhat focuses on land resources, hardly any focus on racial uniqueness, the feeling that my heroes never really have the time needed to be heroes, the lack of ability to ""spam"" cities across the map (you only focus on a few now) being replaced with the absolute need to spam outposts, and a less than stellar AI are a just few of my gripes. The exploration factor seems to be gone as it's now commonplace and almost necessary to just automate scouts to explore in lieu of your hero. You're lucky if you get to explore a few wonders (in the title of the game) before the game is over, assuming they haven't been ""claimed"" by the AI already. All of this combined adds annoyance and ruins the immersion and hero meta RP that I've been so fond of all these years.

I prefer long games, huge maps, and multiplayer with my friends and family. This version is unaccommodating in that regard on all three fronts. It seems to be made to play much shorter games, maps weren't originally designed to be very big (without a mod and a PC to accommodate them), and multi-player has been plagued with issues since release which defeated the whole purpose of me buying the game. I kept playing in the hope that multi-player would be fixed, but sadly, as of writing this, it is still mostly unplayable within my circle.

- The game crashes every few turns - it feels really rushed to put out there for sale when unfinished
- The music is far from AOW1 - very personal taste I guess but I miss the feeling of playing a game lost in time with a very unique sense of fantasy and potential
- The territory slots: while I kinda like it as well (I'm a civ player), it feels borrowed from other games and the game becomes much more of a Civilization of city management rather than a fantasy conquest adventure
+ I love the split between army recruiting and structure building
+ the hero-item management is great, not having to send stuff across the map

Don't expect this game to be like Age of Wonders 3.

- There is no slow empire building with a large map en just a few opponents, the map scales with the number of players, so if you want a large map, you will have 12 opponents.

- Hero's can build an outpost for 50 gold, so you will have neighbors very early in the game. If you play a good alignment, you will have very little space to expand.

- This is also do to the fact that it uses the province system of planetfall. Your cities will be growing very large compared to the map size, so all land can and will be taken very fast.

- Don't let the race customization fool you, they're largely cosmetic. There are no race specific units and you won't be able to start as an undead race for example. You're even able to choose the race specific bonuses, so it's really just skins.

- Every hero will always be able to choose all the spell books. You can RP and only choose the ones you took in the character creator, but if you play a long game session, you will HAVE to choose ones that don't fit the hero you made.

- There will be no cool city sieges. During a wait time you and your enemies will be able to take ""break the battlements"" option, so you always start a siege battle with broken walls. No more heroic holding off an invading army with a couple of archers like in 3.

- Each combat there is a lot of flashing text telling you all the bonuses everything is getting. Combat becomes more about grouping certain units together and synergy. So be ready to choose the same upgrades and bonuses on every play through to remain ""optimized"" and able to beat your opponents. 

All this just isn't fun for me. Age of Wonders has always been a relaxing escapist long fantasy empire builder for me. 
This is feels like a game with stressful competitive short round game play .

It's not Age of Wonders and it will never be, the game just isn't build for that kind of gameplay.

Game feels rather hollow to me after the story mode, mainly due to very poor AI. Several different win condition doesn't feel different enough, it's either turtle or be on the offence. 

My biggest gripe - combat is fun but the moment it scaled to 18v18 it is a slog. So, it end up being auto-resolve 90% of the combat, which imo is a big downer. I really think developers should reconsider the battalion size and whats the maximum participants in a battlefield. Also, marching 3 band of units each turn as a death stack is very cumbersome, gets really tiring after a while. A simple fix, imo, is to limit band size to 10, and combat size to 10. Players can choose to split into multiple smaller stack as they wish, but deathstack=10 and combat limit is up to 10 units. It doesnt have to be 10, can be 12 or w/e smaller than 18.

1. AI cheats. This game has the craziest amount of cheats I've ever seen. Literally spawning 4-6 full stack armies every turn while I'm sieging their capital. Had to manually fight battles 5 times in a row as their armies spawn from no where just to conquer one city.

2. City sieging. Having to wait 7-10 turns to conquer a city because the AI is scripted to build every defensive building in the game is incredibly boring. Forget trying to fight multiple AI nations at a time because you have to dedicate every single hero to capture one of their cities while another nation just rolls through the back of your country

3. Upkeep in general. I'm glad to see AI can maintain 5 full armies of tier 3+ units with their singular city while I'm can barely manage the same with 4 cities.

4. Massive lack of useful tooltips. Oh there is something blocking me from casting spells during a battle? I wish it would tell me what so I can take steps to avoid it. Is it a specific unit? Is it something the enemy did? Do they have a spell jammer in the province? Who knows. Another instance of this is fighting any unit that gets the Stalwart trait. This trait means that enemy can't go below 1 hp while it is active. The game does an exceptionally poor job of explaining this as it will only display like... 4 of the active buffs/debuffs on a unit. So you'll have to first notice that it got that buff, then right click the unit to open up its full details page, then one by one hover over each buff or debuff until you find it. I can't tell you the number of times I've wasted attacks and spells on a unit I literally couldn't kill because I didn't notice Stalwart got activated.

5. AI turn length. AI turns take a very long time. Longer than Turn 1 Warhammer 3 Eternal Kingdoms. I watch AI stacks move one unit out of each army at a time and then reform back into an army at its destination.

There is a lot of fun things about this game. I love the researching tome system and I like how you can modify your race to fit your chosen play style. Combat in general feels good and you can definitely win vs much stronger forces by playing smart. But there is so much time wasting and frustration fighting vs the AI that whenever I think about continuing to play through the story missions, I dread the prospect of wasting a whole hour just to siege down one city while being forced to fight 5+ AI armies every, single, turn.

The game is definitely shortchanged by whoever wrote the AI scripting and decided that AI cheats is better than actually spending the time to design a competent AI.",1691432971,1691511537,False,8,0,0.538908898830413818,0,True,False,False

The game is literally Civilization with a swords and sorcery fantasy focus. At first it appears to have good amounts of customization since you can create your own faction, but due to how the spellbook system works, by the late midgame to endgame all factions end up feeling the same no matter how you make them. All factions in the game given enough time can unlock every spellbook in the game, so there are no hard choices you have to make that depend on your strategy and playstyle.

The next problem will probably be solved once more dlc comes out. Mainly, there isn't a huge amount of variety in strategies/playstyles available in the game right now. There are still enough to keep one entertained for multiple playthroughs/skirmishes, but eventually it all starts to feel the same.

The game is nowhere near as buggy as it was on launch (was nearly unplayable then) but crashes still happen more than they should. In the past 6 or so skirmish games I have played, 3 of them I haven't been able to finish due to serious crashes that I have been unable to fix. I have sent in support forms to the devs but there has been no communication over whether or not the issues have been fixed. However, I will say again that they fixed a metric boatload of bugs since release day. If I remember correctly, that first week of release the game was literally unplayable due to bugs.

I haven't bought the dlc yet but the dragon one (which is the only one released as of this review) doesn't look all that interesting. Adds a dragon race and another spellbook. Eh. I'd totally be down for a steampunk dwarf dlc though. With zeppelins and stuff like that. 

Singleplayer playability is decent. Has a short campaign that is loosely connected, better as a way to learn the game instead of a fun mode to play. Skirmishes against AI are pretty decent when the game doesn't crash 200+ turns in. AI does have an issue of moving troops one by one instead of stack by stack which makes their turns be stupid long during mid to late game. The AI also doesn't know how to deal with morale builds which is funny as hell.

Buy the game if you want Civ 5/6 but with swords and sorcery instead of technology. The bugs are an issue but the devs seem to be working on them in the background. DLC doesn't seem worth in now but could be good in the future. If all this seems meh to you, wait for a sale.",1690636664,1690636664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can understand some reviewers' misgivings about the game, and they are mostly valid, but in my opinion, all of that is completely overshadowed by the things that this game does well. The amount of detail, variety, transparency, depth, and customization this game offers is pretty revolutionary for the genre, in my opinion. If you have even a shred of imagination, this game is quite limitless. As far as a pure strategy game, it may be lacking in direction or competitive integrity, but it more than makes up for it in the ability to play as (and against) an immense variety of factions, personalities, and playstyles. 

The pantheon is one of my favorite features because it allows players to make a large number of factions and pit them against each other in many different scenarios. I have a whole civil war of Orcs that has been playing out over the course of five or six playthroughs/realms. And now the reptilians have just made their first appearance to shake things up.

Total fanboy of this game. Completely obsessed. Easily my Game of the Year, and a serious contender for my absolute favorite turn-based-strategy game.

Its dynamic, its new, but its also familiar in all the right ways that make it a good entry.

We're getting more in depth personalization of not just your customizable leaders, but the people they lead as well. With narrative events that make every randomly generated map feel like its own contained episodic story and a metagame between playthroughs that ties it all together well (which personally I'd like to see expanded on). There is no campaign because we make our own here, every win, loss, battle, and victory writes the story of our Champions, Wizard-kings, and Dragon Lords. With enough tactical and strategic depth to keep your brain occupied and a universe oozing personality, you gotta roll with it and it'll roll with you and I think that flexibility makes some people hit a wall because they don't even know what they want when provided a narrative and gameplay toolbox as expansive as this.

I've played that long because it's slow everything is slow, research is slow (you can speed it up but it's still slow), building is slow .
And while those would be tolerable on a huge map and you can play nice and slow but the movement speed on the map and the fact that you can only do the most important things ONLY with heroes it's making a glacial game pace. 
In AOW3 If you had a flying mount it was actually flying over water, lava, mountains etc. NOW it's more or less cosmetic you can never go over lava pools even with flying units.
Heroes are generally boring compared to AOW3 but  since you need them for everyhing you are kinda forced to have as many as possible because otherwise you just move around the map and you can't do anything important, so no heroes the game is even slower.

The direction the game is going is even worse, instead of making multiple interesting strong build option, they keep nerfing things and that makes the game even more flat and boring. 

The look of the game is washed out too much bloom and blueish tint everywhere.

-The customization options are a lot of fun to use to create your own little culture, but many of the choices feel meaningless once you get to the actual game.
-Your starting choice of Tome will soon be joined by almost every other tome, since you'll unavoidably build up enough research strength that you're unlocking new ones regularly.
-Playthroughs are largely homogenised; you're not going to alter your approach or strategy based on your starting choices, because they don't actually matter much. So one session feels pretty much like any other session.
-Combat maps can be fun (sometimes), but they're also time consuming so you'll usually find yourself auto-resolving everything.
-The mid-game is essentially non-existent.
-Every game ends with a magic victory, which your AI opponents will be powerless to stop.
-Speaking of which, the AI suuuuuucks!
-Mid-way through the third story scenario, I realized I was downright bored with the game already.
-Overpriced micro-sized DLC... Which is unsurprising given the publisher.

Diplomacy is good, but the allies suck, so making alliances doesn't really help much. When I say sucks, I mean they do nothing, absolutely nothing. We can't even coordinate attacks.

The balance is horrendous. The AI cheat, by itself, it's not a problem, but couple with the fact that the game is absolutely not balanced.

I probably wouldn't have liked this game 20 years ago. Back then I wanted slightly dark, down-to-earth fantasy, with a lot of mud and peasants being afraid of magic and elves. Warhammer, Witcher, Games of Thrones, that kind of stuff. It had to be believable.

Age of Wonders 4 isn't that at all. You're star-gating to a bazillion different worlds, where toad crusaders are fighting halfling warlocks and where dwarf necromancers have an age-old alliance with angelic ratkin. It all sounds incredibly silly, and I picked this game up expecting not to care about the lore at all.

But I did. I begin reading the background tooltips and decided to play through the (very brief!) campaign. And the idea of hopping to these endless worlds, each with its own story, was sold to me. And with that, all the race, faction, and world customization started to fall into place as well. Each world you travel to is a new experience. Maybe the humans here are the druids, and the elves the industrialists. Maybe the world is a desolate wasteland, swarmed by undead, or maybe it's a primordial jungle teeming with wildlife. With so many worlds, anything could happen!

[h3]""There's no empire building in Age of Wonders games!""[/h3]
Gameplay-wise, the game has taken another step towards the 'grand strategy' for which the parent company Paradox is known. And I welcome that as well. It's the first Age of Wonders game where I feel I'm not missing out on most of the game by my judicious use of auto-combat (though I'm starting to get hooked on the manual combat as well). Selecting which provinces to annex and how to improve them has some hints of Civ 6 optimization now, where some improvements have bonuses based on the adjacency of other improvements, etc. Enough to make me stop and think every now and then, but not to the degree of Civ where I felt the need to plan everything out at the start with pen and paper. 

The victory conditions still feel a bit underwhelming though. They're changing one to be more interesting in the coming patch, so hopefully that will get better.

[h3]""I found the unit customization in AoW: Planetfall very tiresome, with all those mods!""[/h3]
Me too. I guess it's a fun system if you're really going all-in on the unit/combat optimization, but that wasn't for me. In AoW4 unit enchantments are applied globally, and everything stacks. This makes every enchantment you unlock useful and fun, because it's always an upgrade.

However, there's also downsides, such as lack of a coherent campaign - all we have are 5 missions where you alternate taking either the ""chaos"" or ""order"" side while playing them with any race you want/create there is no actual protagonists, or a real plot. This is a shame as I really liked the campaigns in every previous AoW game.

The last mission in said campaign is the actual reason why I'm even writing this review and also why it's a thumbs down, because it showcases my biggest gripe with the game, which I frankly find to be game-ruining. That is how long the AI turns take. That last mission has no less than 8 AI leaders and towards the end AI turns can take up to two minutes. That's despite the AI never actually accomplishing anything - I have not seen an AI take over a city of another AI, they are just shuffling giant armies around until I fight them. There is no excuse for that to be the result of eating up 80% of a modern CPU for 2 minutes.

I'm literally writing this review while waiting for the AI to go during the last phase of the mission - where my OP armies are moving across the map 1 painful turn at a time to finish off the last opponents.

EDIT: A couple hours have passed. I am now at the last city, sieging it. The enemy leader is inside it. I am 4 turns from victory. And the AI turns are now taking forever. I even reloaded thinking it had frozen, but after a while it did move to the next AI leader. We have moved from 2 minutes per turn to 12 minutes. I'm not joking, I timed it. Something is fundamentally broken in how the AI handles large amounts of units. And this on top of the AI allies being utterly useless.

[b]If you play with friends, this game is probably phenomenal.[/b] This is because the AI is lacking and feels unfinished, and the story elements from other Paradox 4k games are missing here. Playing with friends fills these gaps.

Here's why I think the game isn't worth purchasing at the moment.

[b]AI in Battles:[/b]
It simply seems half-finished. Example, in a fight you will very often see all the AI's units collect in tight balls so that they can all get AoE buffs. Smart, except the buffs last 2 turns and the AI is far from eager to close the gap and take advantage of the buffs while they last. So, smart of them to get buffed up, stupid of them to throw their first 2-3 turns away just to get a buff they won't end up leveraging.
They also seem to have weird priorities when it comes to positioning. Example, hero with a teleport ability or flying will use it to dive behind enemy lines and go for your caster. Well, now their best unit is alone and stuck behind a wall of melee, surrounded by casters with CC and possibly a back-line hero. When it dies, its team will suffer a massive hit to morale, and then it's snowball time. It's like using your queen in chess to kill a pawn only to be killed by a neighboring pawn next turn.

[b]AI on the World Map:[/b]
Map AI is worse. In a couple campaigns I've been rushed hard while attempting a magic victory. I don't know what it was about those campaigns that made the AI want to come at me so hard, but it was challenging and fun. My allies betrayed me, the surrounding free nations got pissed, etc. Everyone was after me. But In 99% of my campaigns, this hasn't happened. The AI will denounce and insult you and then simply lose without trying.
Additionally, your allies mean nothing. They will call you to war and if you don't go, you risk your reputation (and their invitation is offered to you as just one more notification of the many you'll encounter 150 turns in). Them, on the other hand, will join wars with you but do absolutely nothing unless they are basically bordering the enemy. At which point they will just feed the enemy their units in a slow drip fashion. No Stellaris-esque ""rally on me"" option (probably do to how crowded and blocked the world map would be).
All this means that AI factions are essentially just a mechanic that you can tap into occasionally for some extra resources or items, aside from the rare event one goes to war with you and actually attempts to attack you with more than their local LARPing squad. Combine all this with boring (IMO) mechanics like spell jammers and you'll find yourself sighing more and more with each turn.

[b]Severely Lacking in Storytelling:[/b]
A staple of Paradox games is good storytelling. Stellaris had so many storytelling elements (even at launch) that even after 5 months playing, you still might run into a story line you hadn't seen yet. Crusader Kings, while having less built-in events, offered you so many different options to solve problems that the story would make itself as you played. But in AoW4, 90% of your story is in the faction/hero creation screen as you tailor something you have in mind. After that you'll get some events specific to your faction type, and there are some small events sprinkled around the map that you might encounter, but none of them have much impact. In Stellaris you might find an ancient relic 4 months into the game that grants you unspeakable power and changes how the entire campaign and ALL players proceed. In AoW you will do the same 5 quests at the beginning in every campaign, and the one or two additional randomized ones you get will be uninteresting and grant you a very small amount of gold/mana/prestige.

Lastly, two of the infamous Paradox 4k flaws that many of us know and have nightmares about are present in this game as well. 
- Late-game is laggy and turns get exceptionally long, killing the momentum and making the game feel more like a chore. ""Well, I've come this far...""
- AI doesn't care about resources. They will go into debt to raise armies they can't afford. They will build 2-tile cities for no reason other than to expand, and then be protected from you in wars due to their neighbors' closed borders, even if the neighbors are unfriendly with them.",1689532459,1689532459,False,4,0,0.482352942228317261,0,True,False,False

Wherein each faction used to have a strong Theme to it in previous AoW games, you're now left with nothing but a bunch of tomes of magic you can freely research anytime. I had my hopes that they'd stop at this, but they keep making even tomes themselves more sandboxy with each update, which alongside utter lack of any racial flavor renders the flavor of factions very weak. 
It's a game of out-of-character optimization first and foremost, and despite their clear effort to introduce more immersive role playing elements to it they end up ultimately insignificant. Don't get me wrong, you still *could* stack tomes of the same affinity and attempt to play a thematically coherent faction if you wanted, but there are zero restrictions in place that would contribute to theming besides the good will of other players trying to maintain it. If anything sticking to a theme might even be suboptimal now given that some tomes are clearly more powerful than other ones and mixing and matching is more beneficial if you're actually trying to win. 
Also its optimization is atrocious and multiplayer experience tends to be very bad, albeit still a slight improvement from Planetfall. Only a slight improvement after the previous fiasco falls closer to negative experience in my opinion though. 
I still hope they fix it later so that I can remove my dislike, but for now it is what it is.",1689332677,1689332720,False,4,0,0.527923405170440674,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
- No two games are identical                          
- Awesome customization options                  
- Great for Role playing head-cannons
- Massive potential for mods that can easily expand the game
- Already has several expansions lined up and announced
- You can play as a Dragon with the Dawn of the Dragons expansion.
- YOU CAN PLAY AS A DRAGON. Baller.
- Game is beautiful and immersive.
- Fairly well balanced combat system, with many units that have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. No one unit is overpowered or Broken (That I've found at least)
- Your heroes are quite customizable   (both in cosmetics and skills)

Cons:
- Currently limited avenues of victory, and much like some other Paradox games if you dive down the magic (Read:Research) you are almost guaranteed a win.
- Some of the scenarios are just outright unfair 
- AI overall could use some tuning, but they have said they're working on it already.
- Addicting af (just... one.. more... turn...)             
Edit add to the cons:
-The later game lags A TON, as in I have to wait 3-5 mins for the AI to take their turns. Perhaps make it to where the it doesn't try to animate all the movements when they're not even being seen by the player...
-Particularly in turn 100+ the game will sometimes crash during the AI turns, usually when they attack one of your units.",1688827258,1689272416,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

What I'm going to try to do is first review AOW4 on its own merit, with positive and negative aspects, then I'll contextualize that with my experience with other games in the series and genre.

On a positive note, AOW4 is graphically very polished and came with a good bit of content. You can tell that the developer really loves this IP and is putting their heart and soul into a beautiful product that carries forth its melange of tactical combat and 4x empire building. The UIs look elegant and all the models look fantastic. The work that has gone into the race and character models is quite superb. The Tome research system is a good idea and based on the DLC that came out, I can tell that the Devs see it as a way to add new content in a modular way. I enjoy seeing my fantasy race evolve before my eyes as they grow in power. 

On the negative side, my main complaint is that it feels like the AoW4 goes to some lengths to hide its depth. When you look at a unit, many of its abilities are simple badges and you need to tooltip them in order to know what they mean, and there are too many to memorize. Thematic labels take precedence over actual information, and it hurts my ability to make good decisions. Battles can feel quite samey and I don't feel I am able to make use of the terrain as well as I would like. As far as the Tome system, I feel its negative aspects are almost enough to overrule the positive. With the Tomes hidden most of the time, there's no apparent way to plan your research ahead of time. Couple that with random research draws and progression is a rather disjointed experience.  On top of all this, the game crashes my computer quite frequently. It's to the point where I've stopped sending crash reports because it happens so often.

Since I loved Age of Wonders: Planetfall so much, I feel a bit let down by AOW4. Lacking something as simple as the overlay that allows you to see how far your unit can move without using up all its actions points makes the tactical combat in AOW4 much clunkier and more full of quesswork than its predecessor. Making race/theme synergies was my favorite thing in Planetfall, but it feels that now in 4 they have sacrificed the identity and uniqueness of each theme in order to make them all hyper-compatible with one another. In order to accommodate the huge degree of mixing and matching that is now possible, the changes that you put your fantasy race through seem almost superficial. It often feels like all my choices across the game have been thrown into a blender and come out as a paste, slightly different color than last time but always the same taste. 

I'm happy to see AOW keeping pace with new content, the Dragon update has been quite a welcome addition to my experience. However besides a summonable creature that changes as you level it up, there are really no new mechanics to playing as a dragon. I hope that the developers will push the boundary a bit more in terms of divergent playstyles. Spicing up the maps to make them feel more varied and tactically useful would go a long way as well, plus some of the quality of life features that are missing from AoW:P

Since most people are not going to try to sink 500 hours into the game, I think that it's good enough for a thumbs up. That being said, I highly reccommend you make sure you get this game along with its season pass/expansions. Although the game is totally passable for a few plays out of the box, you will definitely need the new content to keep the game interesting.",1689085245,1689085695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every game I tried to play with my friend would eventually just freeze and neither of us can continue.  There were similar desync problems in AoW:PF that would get gradually worse the longer the game went, but the games would usually be fixed by reloading and never became totally unplayable.  Now the next game in the series has the exact same issues but they are so much worse.  In the most recent 4 player (2 human 2 AI) game by turn 21 we were totally unable to take any action no matter how many times we tried to reload.

update: there hasn't been a single patch yet to address the broken multiplayer, and the devs are already pushing out the first dlc, i doubt they will ever fix the problems in this game just like they never fixed them in planetfall

update 2: the patch notes for 6/20 had a whole list of fixes for online multiplayer, and yet nothing has improved, the game still locks up very early into a session and becomes unplayable, but now i also have several crashes that i didn't have before the patch

update 3: probably the last update for this review, the devs are prioritizing ""balance"" patches over fixing the broken multiplayer and ai, and their idea of balance is to nerf everything that's still fun into the ground, these devs clearly have no idea what made Age of Wonders so great and i don't think any amount of updates will save the game",1683489880,1688840582,False,4,0,0.502299368381500244,0,True,False,False

Played for a while, campaigns, single player custom, various worlds and multiplayer attempts.

This game is a great idea but a HOT MESS. The crashes, load failures, turn locks, bad saves, battle reloads, session disconnects, save problems and lost progress are completely aggravating. It's insulting for a FIFTY DOLLAR PRICE! and would really not be a finished professional effort at $20 price point.

Furthermore: the A.I. tuning for tactics and performance doesn't play by the rules at all:

IN AUTO BATTLES:
2:1 (or even BETTER) odds ""safe"" battle
(Destroys the best unit in your army on auto resolve somehow)

IN MANUAL BATTLES:
Your archers: blocked LOS - A.I. Archers: shoot right through

Your Spell Damage: 12 - A.I. spell damage 30-50

Your Battle Mage Spell Damage: 8-12 - A.I. Battle Mage Spell Damage: 20-40

Your engaged ranged unit, can't shoot, and can't move away and shoot - 
A.I.ranged units, walk away consequence free and or fire at point blank range

Your units: get retaliated attacked if they move away from or past an enemy - 
A.I. units: ignore your zones of control and pass your units at will consequence free.

STUPID STUFF:
AUTO SCOUT IS WORTHLESS - Auto scouts will not explore underground, even when put there manually they immediately go up. Auto scouts do not explore the continent your on, and sometimes just wander around at sea for turns on end finding nothing.

EMPOWERED BEAST - fight 2 or even 3 levels over their ranking class, seen PENGUINS and CROWS slaughter tier 2 veteran pikemen! Yes really.

You can auto battle as a manual retry if you get a bunk RNG failure, UNLESS your doing a multiplayer battle, and then it's permanent for some reason?

The underground cave entrances can be 'BLOCKED' by a single unit on either side, permanently, making underground start play completely mitigated.

Non standard turn (everyone moves at once) A.I. is un catchable on the board, they immediately take out your isolated armies as they move, and they ALWAYS move multiple armies in a single queue, leaving you no response opportunity. You MUST play standard turns vs. the AI or you will never get a fair multi army battle.

Treemen Ent Gods are unbeatable on manual play. They root the board, summon entire armies, heal and regenerate and cast one shot kill spells, NEVER manual battle them, they are unbeatable. A rating of maybe 800, can destroy 3000 points of attackers.  I have seen just 2, annihilate 3000 points of 6x triple stack armies!

A.I. ALLIED DIPLOMACY IS A JOKE - Ally calls you to war, lasts all of 2 turns, 3 turns later your arrive in ""enemy lands"" and attack, and A.I. alliance degrades because - YOU are starting wars? and it gives you evil alignment, further degrading your alliance. - Dumb.

MAP OPTIONS RUIN THE GAME - Playing in the undead lands is immpossible, the undead creap armies are so powerful they might as well triple their army ratings, easily slaughtering all the starting armies. Frozen worlds constantly damage mortal armies in manual battles making them unplayable. Neat ideas need some serious tuning...

Watching the AI move their troops around but never actually do anything is painful. Triggering victory conditions you would think they would come from all over the map to get you but they don't even bother.

The customization really adds into the personal experience to creating your own faction and really calling it yours. That goes with the cultures and tomes too. It really feels like they thought a lot about how to balance everybody's play-style and added ways to counter everything but even on top of that, out thinking your opponent with good positioning and spell usage can turn most PvP fights. The victories are fun to achieve since you are forced to fight no matter what, no more straight science wins! 
Now....
Obviously, desyncing is annoying. But, the way the game handles it is pretty good compared to other paradox games. Other minor things like waiting for player decisions or waiting for combat can be pretty boring and tedious as well, but if you can play with a good group and come to agreements about when to auto combat and when not to, it will definitely make the game flow a lot better.
Now the ai for the most part is pretty bad and can be easy to deal with. However, I have definitely seen the ai also dominate here or there by using another ai ally. Maybe with some dev tweaking here or there or hopefully a mod that can make the ai a bit smarter can fix this issue. To be fair though, the ai in most 4X games is left at something to be desired. 

All in all, it's a good game. It's got a lot of heart into it and the developers really care about what they are trying to accomplish. AI is hard, man. as said before and with pretty much every game, its just plainly better with friends.

It takes everything I enjoy about the genre, expansion: different playstyles, and shifting diplomacy, and expands on it in ways that keep games fresh and interesting throughout the entire game.

While many other games in the genre struggle to maintain interest during certain areas of the game, Age of Wonders 4 manages to keep me busy regardless of my playstyle.  The main way the game does this is by always keeping combat relevant.  Aggressive factions are always fighting like you would think they would, but even more peaceful and diplomatic factions need to clear their territory of neutral mobs.  This keeps the game from reaching dull points that many other games in the genre suffer from.

For the two people that will read this, as you can see I didn't refund the game. I actually did but bought it back because I love the franchise and I'm also probably stupid.

So all the hours you'll se logged into this game are just me trying to get the thing to work at a stable 30 FPS on steam deck, without letting the device burst into flames.

I couldn't find a way. Yes, that's a lot of hours tinkering. I'm stupid AND stubborn. 

I'm playing Elden Ring now, which runs at a stable 30 or wonky 40 fps, CPU temp below 70 degrees. There's no excuse for aow4 going to 90 degrees while being sub 30 on a damn battle map with three units on each side. Go figure.

I'm pretty glad reviews begin to go downhill. This game is a waste of money. Performances are awful. An army of white knights would usually go at your throat on the steam boards if you had anything remotely bad to say about it, which is always very suspicious to me. Maybe it settled down, I haven't been there in a while.

I uninstalled this piece of trash. Apart from performance and multiplayer not working, mods are not functional on the steam deck because the devs made the machine bypass the launcher, which in turn is needed to play with mods.

And you'll need mods. There are several gameplay decisions that are really bad. The one game I pushed to like turn 100+ I ended up with every school of magic. So all games end up the same unless you ""use your creativity"" and restrain yourself from doing so. Oh and apparently 120 or so turns is too long for the game, that's why it ended all samey, said the pious believers on the forums.

It's a mess. When technical and gameplay are bad you know this should have been early access. Also the Devs are carefully choosing to ignore posts about all those problems. Except for gameplay though, they said they'd rebalance the whole tome debacle. When all their defenders said it was behaving as planned. Go figure.

_________________________________________________________

So, I spent days in various boards asking for details about accessibility options on the Steam Deck. All the answers I got were at best evasive ones.

Turns out the problem isn't the text size. It's fine, actually. But damn that game runs like Skyrim on a pregnancy test. All over the internet you'll find Deck users boasting 60 FPS stable on games you definitely know won't and cannot run that good.

I'm just here to warn people that this game, which otherwise looks pretty fun, runs like shit.

I couldn't maintain a stable 40 fps in any graphics setting or tinkering  on the world map, except maybe with disabling all the options that I could, like shadows. Any clicking / interaction with troops/ cities would cause a massive dip, à la Total War. Panning the world map is miserable.

Then I fought a siege, just for the fun. 6 units Vs 12? A bit more iirc. The game turned into a slideshow. 

""But I gOt a sTaBle 40 fPszs oN mE DecK !"" Yeah right.

Let me tell you what I got : a refund.

Fix your damn game. The menus threaten to melt CPUs (which is not a Deck only problem, it seems), and battles are insufferable.

One of the Devs said that they applied for the verified status. What a joke, really. No wonder none of the streamers played it on the deck, or no keys were given, I don't know, I don't care. 

I don't need 120 FPS on a 4x game. I need a STABLE 30 at least, 40 being ideal. Got half of that, half of the time.

I wish I could spend more time to try, but hey, two hours are two hours.

I'll get conquest of EO instead, what it lacks in depth it will surely make up in actual fluidity and thus, fun.

Or Grounded, that I actually got to run STABLE during the free weekend. How the fuckitty fuck is aow4 more demanding than a game like Grounded, that's a mystery.

- Confusing UI and poorly-explained game mechanics.

- Constantly being interrupted with events that you can't simply ignore without getting a penalty. Literally every turn. Leave me alone I want to play the game!

- Why can't I set a custom map size!? Why!?! If you want to play on a big map, you HAVE to have 8 players, so you're never able to play a game without an AI player bothering you in the first 10 turns.

- Pointless and irritating restrictions on the player (city cap, hero cap, annex cap, everything cap) that you can't turn off.

- Pointless and irritating restrictions on the game speed/style, far less control than in AoW3.

- Unfinished or broken issues with sound effects (e.g: in any battle with a flying unit, the flapping noise is constant and you can't turn it off without turning off all sound, there is no volume scaling with distance. If you fight a 6 flying unit stack you're going to want to kill yourself).

- Set the maximum battle speed and the camera jumps around so much, it'll make you sick. Of course you can't turn it off. Epileptics beware.

- Cheap-looking mobile style graphics, these look like reused assets from some gacha mobile game.

- The classic Paradox Interactive dripfeeding of grossly overpriced DLC.

The only saving grace of this game is ultimately the community, who have already created mods to fix a few of these unnecessary irritations. I'm going to uninstall it and come back in 6 months or so when I can mod this into a game I actually want to play.

I copied the main complaints from the forum and paste it below:

If your into age of wonders you will hate what they done to the serries.
7 hex system: Gone.
Powerfull spells: Gone.
Races being unique and interesting: Gone.
Units having unique racial traits: Gone.
Lore: 1 mission about how we shoud forget about the past lore as we are going multiversial.
4 missions about:
Each faction gets 2 and they are just skirmish missions with a few story bits added in.
The entire games reeks of a cashgrab.
Sieges: Turned into a wait x amount of turns before doing a normal battle map.
Undermine walls removes all the towers.
Only heroes can siege.
To build a new city you need a hero to build an outpost then upgrade the outpost using imperium into a city.
An other limited added is that you get punished for unjust wars(aka any war that isnt defendsive. Ok not entirely true but grievanes seem to be silly like: Building a outpost in a distant claimed proviance.
Why anyone would have any claim on said province is beyond me.)
A city limit you need to pay imperium for too increase.
Ai is braindead making vassals that the game encourage useless.
There not even good money cities.
Map size being attached to player numbers.
So no more large maps for 1vs1.
No ability to start with an army and conquer your first city.

The game is full of bad design decisions and is very buggy.
Wait until the last dlc has been released.
Give them time to fix their mistakes(and meaby hire some decent beta testers as all of these flaws are visible in 30 min of playing)

Dont lissen to your heart.
This is not and will never be an age of wonders games.
They changed everything and put an age of wonders painjob on it.
They didnt even kept the 7 hex combat system the age of wonders serries is known for.
That along shoud tell you just how little they cared about making an age of wonders game.

And on its own.
Its biggest selling point is race costumization.
It did a bad job of that.
Race are:
2 traits which are just +3 to defendse or +25% flanking damage.
Mounts or terrian(both which are so irelevant that it is a wasted trait slot. Tho a recent patches did add more mounted units if you picked a mount as racial trait so they did at least try to fix it)
A culture which are 90% the same.
With only a few unique abilities that stop mattering 10 turns in.
Tomes is what it is all about.
All unique racial units of the past games are now just units locked behind tomes.
Which lead the the much complained of problem that every race ends up the same as you will eventualy just mix every single tome in the game.

Not the racial changes caused by tomes are very hit and miss.
Some are nice.
Demons, angel, undead.
But some are just plain wierd.
Like gaia makes everyone looks like hags(d&d) or lepers.

Age of wonders 3 Elves had:
Unicorn mounts, griffer ridders, the best bowman in the game and stormsisters who where good at stunning enemies.
Age of wonders 4 as skinsuits that looks like Elves with a skin disease, A limit of 2 racial traits, No foresting recial trait(It is a tome trait) and you need to pick between mounts or being expert range fighters.
Terrian has been reduce to sectors and stop mattering.
Compair to age of wonders 3 where Elves got massive happiness bonuses fighting in the forest.
Here the area you fight on means nothing.

The list goes on and on.

The one line summary is: meh, go play any other AoW game, they're all more interesting. Highly recommend 1, 2, or Shadow Magic. They probably still work if you get the GOG versions.

This is the 6th(?) game in the franchise now. I'll assume if you're reading this you know what Age of Wonders plays like, but the super short not very accurate summary is that it's a 4x like Heroes of Might and Magic, Humankind, Fallen Enchantress, etc. Not so much like Civ.

I think the game has three major problems which lead me to give up on it, many of which might seem like positives at first: customisation, 'balance', and meta progression/continuity. 

First, the customisation. Like Civ: Beyond Earth and Humankind, AoW4 seems to have fallen for the trap that more customisation and more choice is always better. At the start of each scenario you get to create a new faction. You pick a race (which seems entirely aesthetic), then you pick a couple of traits, then a couple more traits, then a unit/mechanics template, and then finally your starting spell book. As the game progresses you unlock new spell books, which give you some different unit unlocks, passive abilities, spells, buildings, and campaign abilities to use. This all sounds great on paper! The problem: it's insanely homogeneous. Leaders don't stand out, unique factions don't emerge, unique playstyles aren't engendered from the starting choices, strengths/weaknesses don't tend to emerge, etc.

I'm not getting the joy of seeing the Highmen, or the Orcs, or the Goblins, or the [REDACTED] races from Shadow Magic. I'm not seeing the iconic leaders from Civ or Alpha Centauri. I'm not seeing the unique spells or unit models of Total War. I'm not seeing the diverse unique playstyles of races in Starcraft or Warcraft. My strategy doesn't change based on the faction I'm playing, nor does it change based on the factions the enemy are playing. Nor could it - as the game progresses they're gaining a bunch of new modifiers which are completely overriding their core identity. I've played almost all of the core templates (Dark, Barbarian, Feudal, etc), and I could not tell you what makes them different. They all seem to get the same unit types, and they all seem to have good (cheap) units for melee defence, flanking, archery, magic, magic support, and scouting. I have absolutely no idea if they get stronger high tier units, because there's no reason to build them - spamming the cheaper tier 1-3 units into deathball armies seems to clear all scenarios. Sure they have some minor mechanical differences (e.g. condemnation with Zeal), but in practice it's not noticeable when all you need to do to kill a faction is walk over to their capital, siege it, fight one battle, and that's it. The faction is now deleted, no matter how big they were before.

For the 'balance', the game seems to offer an absurd amount of choices but none of them are weighty. You just get an increasingly larger pool of spells and modifiers which ultimately do 1 of 3 things: 1) improve your economy, 2) let you deal more damage, or 3) let you mitigate damage taken. That's pretty much it - every choice in the game is leading you to modify one of those three things. It's obviously a little more nuanced than that, but in practice there's barely any noticeable difference from decreasing enemy armour by x% vs just having x% more damage. Most modifiers in the game feel like placeholders, which add +2 to the same basic attack/defence stats. There's no doomsday spells, or spells that turn the entire campaign map to ocean, or trap enemy armies with 6 hexes of mountains, or cause the populations of all the cities to die and rise up as undead, etc. It's just.. deal some damage, do some debuffs, get some damage buffs, get some damage mitigation buffs, heal some damage, etc. Frankly, it's boring. Age of Wonders 1 and 2 did it way, way better. I should be excited about casting a spell that turns the skin of all of my units into metal, permanently. But I'm not, because like all spells, it's just adding 5-10% damage mitigation. On top of this boring modifier design, they've also made the numbers for hp and damage really high. In the 1st game, a unit with SIX damage was pretty dang powerful. In 2/SM, those numbers were doubled. Now it's like.. my units have 120 hp and deal 90 damage a turn. It's very hard to tell what effect any modifier will have because all the numbers are so high, but it explains why everything else is so boring - adding +/-2 to 30x3 damage is barely noticeable - especially when the % based damage reduction system means that added bonus might equal 0 extra damage.

For the meta progression - it's dull. After completing a map, you throw away your old faction and unlock some customisation for heroes, and every 4-5 unlocks get a new trait, or a new map. In all the past games you'd keep a faction through multiple scenarios of a campaign, and the choices you made carried over maps. In AoW1, it was the races you aligned with, the heroes you recruited, the items you found, and the spell lores you unlocked. In AoW2, the game was split into 6 3-map mini campaigns, where all progress carried over within each campaign. In Shadow Magic, you followed a few heroes and everything they had persisted through their campaigns. In AoW3 you picked a faction and followed that character and their faction through the campaign, and so on.

In AoW4? Nothing. You reset back to square one after every map. Start again, with nothing. As long as you win the map, none of your choices mattered. As long as you win the map, it doesn't matter what spell tomes you unlocked. As long as you win the map, it doesn't matter  what heroes you recruited, what skills you unlocked, or what heroes didn't survive the final battle. As long as you win the map, it doesn't matter that your rat-people are now ethereal undead flying beings. All those choices are deleted, and the only thing that carries over is unlocking a new semi-randomised map or a hat for your next toad wizard.

There's a saying among many RTS/strategy game veterans about how to build and keep a dedicated community for a game like AoW4. It's along the lines of: ""Players will come for the campaign, and after the campaign hooks them they'll stay for the skirmish/multiplayer."" AoW4 has no campaign, just a string of disconnected skirmish maps, and I'm not hooked.",1688166997,1688180093,False,186,2,0.815059244632720947,0,True,False,False

It went from diverse factions with different strengths and weaknesses to.... I don't know. The society you choose is purely aesthetic. The culture causes you to develop cities *slightly* differently regarding city stability and how that works--no difference in army, purely in the structures you can build and buffs/debuffs in the amount of resources you gather. Every race has access to the same tech, the same units, from the jump. This means that while you have more customizability in factions, you have less variety in gameplay. The armies also feel less thought out. In Plantefall, tier 1 units had a purpose throughout the entire game. Your tier 5 was like a support unit usually, something that boosted everything but still needed infantry. Everything seemed to have an ability that could change the tide of battle. In AoW 4, that's gone. Your basic fighters are obsolete by turn 20. And so on. Until you end up with stacks of tier 5 units, all on the offensive. The only exception here is the Order tier 5, which gains power based on other Faith units in play. 

It's still fun. But there is less replay value here.

I also think it's a step back in terms of.. Wonder. For lack of a better word.

AoW: Shadowfall, the game everyone loves, had significant variety in the world map. In terms of art, you had great forests, deserts, mountains that looked painted. the underworld also quite varied in terms of art. In AoW 4, you have snow, grass, forest, or lava. The underworld is uniformly mud, except for a few tiles with some mushrooms on them. It's less fun to explore. The sense of wonderment is gone. This has been overlooked in a lot of reviews, but I suspect it is a factor in how everyone feels, in why nostalgia for shadowfall remains so strong.

edit: I think coming into this from previous age of wonders titles, and more recent 4x titles (the  spectacular ""endless"" series) I was expecting something asymmetric.  Age of wonders 4 has a more old-school sensibility. Which is a little odd, because it started out as an asymmetric strategy title.

What's interesting is that the magic 'affinity' tree feels like it was meant to make you choose between specific paths. It doesn't make sense to have a character that's maxed out Order and Chaos, Industrialist and Naturalist, as they're all direct opposite sensibilities. Shadow beings were opposed to Astral beings in the shadow magic game, so that's an opposite, too. It feels as if the intention was that if you pick one of these trees, you would be cut off from its opposite. There is one remnant of this in the current state of the game: if you choose gigantism in the 'nature' tree, you cannot choose the goblin horde (I forget it's name) race modification in the material (industrialist) tree. So I wonder if the original intention was to have these binary choices, but that this was too hard to balance, so everything is open to everyone all the time now?

 Anyway, it's still a good experience despite the shortcomings and I applaud the way they have made different AoW distinct from each other--no game feels like a total rehash, and as such, they all feel essential. I tend to focus on flaws and shortcomings in reviews because those are the issues that affect whether someone wants to buy a game or not, but the game is generally fun if you can look past all of that.

One minor thing that bothers me: I'd say terraforming/world spells don't seem to matter nearly as much as it did in previous games. But again, I guess I'm comparing this to previous titles.

The AI when I played last was pretty bad. Difficulty just gives computer's resource buffs. On higher difficulties, they can spit out doomstacks rapidly and rush you with them within the first dozen turns. On lower/normal difficulties, they... wiffle-waffle. They will declare war on you and surround your capital city, if you let them, but they will never attack. Even when they could steamroll you. Your allies don't do much. I've read that AI adjustments are in the works, though, so this note may be obsolete soon. The Roadmap says that they'll have extensive changes to this sometime in the summer, so probably best to hold off on purchase until that comes about if it's a major concern.",1683506009,1688170792,True,1,0,0.517045438289642334,0,True,False,False

Why?

Well first and foremost this game encourages you to finish your matches so your Faction leader can enter the Pathlion and be used in other games a small but really cool mechanic especially if your like me in any 4x strat game, lets say like Civ5, where after a certain point in time you would just stop playing. Here I neeeed to finish the game so i can see my little cannibal tree loving poison dwarf enter his rightful place.

Speaking of cannibalistic dwarves I spent a good amount of time making my own factions, now i am sure some youtuber has a guide for the ""meta"" but i dont really care and i think that ruins the funnest part of this game. you can create your own factions to have whatever flavor you want. I made a order aligned zealot crusading themed orcs, magic addicted spider riding golbins, and on my most recent playthrough dwarves who focused on poison and nature spells, summoning animals and such, with a cannibal trait so they could eat their enemies in battle. To top it off I focused on flanks and crit chance to really make it interesting. the sheer number of race / spell / theme combinations really makes we jsut want to get some friends together to see what madness we can do in multiplayer.

I do see some reviews about the AI and the biggest thing I noticed is your allies and vassals really dont invade your shared enemies at all. maybe it changes at higher difficulties but I am unsure. that to me is minor and a mod or the devs hopefully will fix it.

Ai enemy however is a bit more aggressive and will attack with large armies if you let them build up but other than that campaign Ai is just okay fun enough but just okay.

the Battle AI however is much better! I really have to plan strategies to me its got DoS2 vibes which i like. I find myself having to retry battles to either win or minimize losses. they do take some time but there is a fast forward option for the AI. Fun part is even if i have to redo a battle or manually fight it I DO NOT CARE b/c i love the atheistic of the faction i made so much i enjoy playing them even if its a loss.

Custom maps are cool and provide plenty of options so far i have only done a few as I am making my way down the campaign maps currently. 

I give this game a solid 8.5/10 fix the allied / vassal campaign AI and id give it a 9/10. 

-1 for already introducing DLC but I will probably pick it up just b/c I have been enjoying the game.

As a dedicated gamer and enthusiast of strategy games, I recently had the privilege of delving into the captivating world of Age of Wonder 4. I can confidently say that my experience with this game tapped into my tactical instincts in ways I've rarely encountered before.

From the very beginning, Age of Wonder 4 plunges players into a mesmerizing universe of fantastical realms, where the clash of civilizations is an ever-present reality. As an avid explorer and gamer, I found myself leading armies through treacherous terrains, navigating uncharted waters, and uncovering hidden relics—all while maintaining the utmost secrecy.

The game's attention to detail is truly remarkable. The developers have meticulously recreated the tactical intricacies that define modern warfare. The battlefield dynamics are incredibly immersive, enabling players to plan, strategize, and execute maneuvers. Every decision carries weight, be it choosing the right units for the armies, adapting to unpredictable enemy movements, or utilizing terrain advantages to gain the upper hand.

Age of Wonder 4's combat system is an absolute masterpiece. It blends real-time elements with strategic turn-based mechanics, allowing for precise control over each unit's actions. The ability to customize and upgrade troops, weapons, and vehicles adds a layer of depth that caters to those seeking a truly tactical experience. Personally, it reminded me of the importance of always being one step ahead, anticipating enemy movements and devising counter-strategies on the fly.

In addition to the gripping gameplay, the game's graphics and sound design are top-notch. The meticulously rendered environments are stunning, creating a vibrant backdrop for battles and exploration. The attention to detail extends to the sound effects, which breathe life into the chaos of warfare. I found myself completely absorbed in the game, my senses attuned to every nuance, just as I am in high-stakes missions.

One of the game's standout features is its robust multiplayer mode. Engaging in strategic battles with friends or fellow enthusiasts truly tests one's mettle and sharpens strategic thinking. Coordinating attacks, devising tactics, and outsmarting opponents in the multiplayer arena is an exhilarating experience that showcases the game's immense replayability.

However, as with any game, there are a few minor areas that could be improved. The interface, while generally intuitive, could benefit from additional customization options, particularly for key bindings and user preferences. Additionally, an expanded tutorial section would greatly benefit new players who may find the learning curve slightly steep.

In conclusion, Age of Wonder 4 is an absolute gem for those seeking a tactical gaming experience. Its attention to detail, immersive gameplay, and strategic depth make it a must-play for strategy enthusiasts and fans of Lord of the Rings alike. The sense of accomplishment when orchestrating a flawless victory is unparalleled, leaving players eager to embark on their next conquest.

So, if you're ready to unleash your inner commander, wizard-king or Dragon and embark on an unforgettable journey through a realm of wonder, be prepared to immerse yourself in the tactical brilliance of Age of Wonder 4. You won't be disappointed.

I like the customization not only of your civ's appearance but playstyle -- customization that continues throughout a session according to ongoing choices offered by the game, especially in the magic tome system. I can see how each game might seem like the telling of a story of the evolution of a civ.

There are a few things that strike me as a little less than great. The game has an Early Access feel to it; a whiff of the undercooked. Play in general is a little on the bland side. I think a part of this is in the game's graphics, which strike me as being rather last-gen. The available camera angles are also somehow always slightly displeasing, making it awkward to select, say, one of your armies. Those two elements add up to a presentation, and a world map in particular, that feels cluttered, and somewhat less than elegant and clean.

Am I enjoying it so far? I'm enjoying exploring the options available. I'm not particularly enjoying the graphics. Neither am I enjoying the overall impression that the game is still in some sort of early development state. I can't quite put my finger on any precise reason why it feels like that.

Map modes, limited clutter, easy-to-understand tool tips, etc. Other games I've played, like recently Diablo 4, have shockingly little QoL features.

There might be some balancing issues with some tomes being stronger than other, but honestly, I don't really notice it.

Because of bugs.

Only one bug in fact : the ""Opponents are moving stuck"" one

It's simple, you pass your turn, the AI move and... your game is finish. For real. You can't do anything because you pass your turn and the AI never finsh it's turn. of course you can reload a save, thanks to the auto-save every turn. But it work only in solo offline.

When you are online with friends... it's frustrating because, if you aren't lucky you will never finish your game. I was with a friend online, trying the new DLC with dragons, when... we get the bug... too bad. Game over. Yes, there is only one auto-save, not 5 in offline. Reloading ? no effect. Surrending ? impossible because the AI is moving. Try to interact with something ? you can't because you pass your turn.

After looking for a solution in the forum of Paradox, I read this from a Paradox Staff called ""Triumph Jordi"" of the QA team : 
- Let me explain the ""Opponents are Moving"" Bug a bit. This is not a single bug with a singular solution. When the AI runs into behavior that it can't resolve it tends to loop or hang, as a player you only see ""Opponents are Moving"" which is where the name comes from. There's tons of reasons why the AI might enter such a state which need to be resolved on their own.

We can fix what gets reported but these will keep appearing throughout development.

source : https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/stuck-on-opponents-are-moving.1585204/

What does the last sentence mean ? They know there is a game breaking bug with their AI and... well that's normal ? I never encounter such an issue in all 4X I've played.

Don't buy the game if you plan to play it online. I talk about this bug but you will have to reload the game every 20-30 minutes because of desync, sometimes you're just kicked out of the game, crashes can appear too...

Extensive and enjoyable Race and Hero customization.

Play one of the preset ""Campaign Modules"", or customize a preset module, or create your own.

Display your victorious Heros in your Pantheon, and be able to recruit them in later campaigns.

If you enjoy the gameplay loop, this game has near endless replayability.

Control your armies and fight enemies in turn based combat rather than watching AI and stats roll stat dice to decide victory outcome. Now I can lose my armies and Hero, at my own hand rather than blaming the AI and dice roll outcome for my below bar skill.

Like many Paradox games, Modding Community deserves only the best and finest sloppy toppy for stellar and insane mods.

Things I dislike:
Early game and even mid game can sometimes feel slow. Probably because I usually like to RP my faction, rather than Min-Max. Also I think that the game purposely takes a slower approach to the City Management/Expansion due to having to psychically fight battles with your armies.

Speaking of RP and min maxing. This game is super fun for RP and creating storylines for your factions/ hero. However, if you are someone who likes to play on higher difficulties, expect extreme hardship if you are purposely avoiding Min-Max. That being said, you can give your faction a Handicap to make things easier, or even give AI factions a negative handicap. Or just turn down the difficulty of the AI overall. I have successfully gotten victories on Hard Difficulty without having to fully min-max. But typically play on Normal.

My PC performance is fine except in a few instances, including choosing technology which in the later game causes the game to hang for without exaggeration minutes.

Some really poor coding going on there, if you cannot make a decision/conditional work efficiently.

No idea why you are forced to make all your characters look ugly without mods (using major and minor race spells).  Whose bright idea was it that all your army ends up looking like Frankenstein reproduced with golems?

Further, the game hides alerts you do need to react to among those you don't, meaning if you skip the stack, you may miss an opportunity that's important. But if you don't skip a stack, you may go through the same alert five times.

A good example is city production. Each city gets a production queue, and when the city completes a structure, an alert appears even if the city has more things in the queue. But when a city requires player attention, such as annexing a new territory, the alert is interleaved with the production alerts. Some are useless, some aren't, and they're jumbled together. Further, cities can be set to build automatically, yet still cause alerts when things are finished. 

NPC turns take way too long. NPC programming doesn't make any sense. NPCs want to talk to you about their feelings, and it's deeply boring. Plus, sometimes the NPCs launch full-screen events where the player doesn't get to do anything! This is bad game design.

This game desperately needs an automatic research function, because the 'science' is magic, and most of the spells are irrelevant. Since you can only research one of a randomly chosen three at a time, you might be shifting through useless spells that don't affect your game play for a while.

Unit AI is not good, but manual unit battles take way too long. Unit autobattle is fine, but you're going to lose most even fights because your units won't use the magic you had to manually research. If I have to waste my time picking something, at least make it work!

Clicking on small units over cities is very difficult, requiring the player to go through army menus to select a troop.

It does have some useful aspects, like neighboring armies helping in battle. Likewise, the thematic elements are fun, and your old heroes coming back a NPCs is a nice touch. You can cross over mountains; it just takes a while. Most units can embark for sea travel.

It sucks ass.  What is even the point of it?  Advanced settings (including AI selection and stuff like turn limit for score victories and whatnot) do not save.  I'm currently messing around with it and can't even get a realm to save in the list, AT ALL.

I ragequit earlier cause I was 5 hours into a campaign I THOUGHT had the AI factions/difficulties I had set up, but instead they were all random normal difficulties.  I later read that if you click around to the other tabs after selecting the AI the whole thing can freak out and just ignore your selections, leading to random generation on normal difficulty.

I don't care about this meta progression crap, I just wanna play dwarves in an oppressive world with lots of evil and few goods.  I have no problem taking the time to set this up every time for a 30-60 hour game, but I did that earlier and wound up with random crap.  I'm not sure if I checked a wrong box or if this was an actual bug, but I don't care.  The faction creator is amazing, how is the realm creator so bad?

Thumbs up cause the game iteslf is awesome so far.  The realm creator is so bad I feel its a bug/oversight.

I played all AoW games and loved the series since game 1 came out. It sad to see game becoming more streamlined and simplified, probably in appeal to wider audiences.

Heroes:
Huge changes for worse here - no more classes, everyone can learn every skill. No more heroes having their own spell books, cant raise specific stats e.g +melee damage. Soft cap on 1 hero per city.  Heroes on flying mounts still use ships in naval battles. Cant fire heroes for some reason, have to kill them off to free a spot. Hero have to be present for almost everything - exploring ruins, sieges, etc. Cant get stuff from defeated enemy heroes unless you sell off their remains or recruit\reanimate them, they dont drop loot on the ground like before.
Combat:
New healing system sucks, it just gives temporary HP that will disappear after combat. Only certain units can retaliate now and some abilities like charge can disable it. Charm\dominate grants only temporary control, wont get unit when battle ends, cant grow armies with it anymore.
Magic:
Cant no longer cast buffs on specific units on strategic map, buff spells buff ALL unit of certain category e.g Archers and you pay upkeep for every unit buffed.
Races: 
Race relationships are completely gone and replaced with civ like city-states system.
Alignment:
Much less important now, cities dont care, units dont care - its only important for diplomacy and some culture specific mechanics.
Diplomacy:
Its somehow worse than in Planetfall. Just buyout your grievances with gold, they will always agree - ""sorry, AI bro, that i cleared your artifact site, here is 200g"".
Sieges:
Have to spend 2-4+ turns to siege cities with walls, doesn't matter if you have army consisting off only wall passing units, have to sit there and wait. Probably one of those ""balancing"" changes that Single-players have to suffer because of some tactics in Multi-player. 
Map:
Maps consists of provinces like in Planetfall or Humankind, why every strategy games tries to implement it now - i dunno, it takes freedom away from player and map looks weird with sectors (provinces) borders everywhere. Also if AI build a city near your border and you raze it - province will be permanently ruined (no way to remove it) and you wont be able to access to resources on it.
Governors:
They have very minor effect on gameplay, and you basically have no control over it. Just hope to get one of those +affinity random trait character and make them governors.
Music:
AoW games always had great OST but in this one it feels... mediocre, its not bad it is just generic and not amazing as in older games, even Planetfall had some banger tracks.
And here is the worst change of them all:
Lore text on units is gone, it was one of those things that not many people payed attention to but i did, and its sad to see them gone.

--- And some good things---
New tome system - I wont comment much on it, system itself is not bad and got some depth to it. Affinity tree upgrades is a pretty cool new feature too. 
City managing with various tile improvement and synergies got more in-depth, if you are into city building stuff you will probably like new system.
New random events/dilemmas, some affinities unlocks new options there with % change for it to succeed depending of how high your affinity is.
Game looks gorgeous and race\leader customization is pretty in-depth for a strategy game, sadly no boob slider tho. And you can pick race traits that affect gameplay too.

Edit.
Final thoughts:
Game itself is not bad and im sure it will become better with DLCs & patches. Its just that i feel that AoW 4 strays of course too much. It tries to emulate other popular or trendy games instead of developing on things that got series popular in the first place. Also i feel devs tried to balance it too much (and still kinda failed), singleplayer games should prioritize ""fun"" first imo. Overbuffed units or overpowered heroes in mythic gear, charm mechanics - things like that were clearly broken but there were fun and players still had to put effort in order to do them.

Edit 2.
Instead of making game more fun like addressing stupid AI settling near your borders or it moving armies on the same spot back and forth they decided to nerf battle summons and heroes in latest patch, whats up with those devs that want to micromanage the way we play SP games?

It's quite refreshing that you can train troops and do construction at the same time.

I love the fact that you can get different types of upgrades to make low tier units viable in late game, so cheap but still reliable armies can still pack a punch.

I like the idea that your ascended character can appear as rulers on you next campaign or as heroes that can assist you on your quest while playing a different character.

Faction creation is quite interesting, as you can choose what race, culture/theme your faction is going to follow and what sort of traits your units are going to have. So you can have feudal nature worshiping humans, cannibalistic barbaric elves or divine order rats...

One thing that I can point out about this game is that I don't really like is that defending is far easier than attacking (at least from my 2 games I've played thus far),  most of the time when fighting low to mid tier armies you can just position you forces in a defensive formation and wait for the enemy to come to you and around 90% of the time it works out in you favor.

Update: Now that I've played Barbarian culture, it would seem that certain culture units are better at a more offensive tactics rather than defensive.",1687096809,1687349044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Best feature[/b] of this 4X strategy are custom races/factions. Beside standard fantasy tropes, you can go really wild and create race of flying cats that are eating corpses or frogs riding wolfs, that are also great architects. Combinations aren't endless but you will feel like they are.

[b]Strategy layer[/b] in form of a world map is great. Building your empire is satisfying and not overcomplicated. You will feel really good when your cities and borders grow. Diplomacy system looks better then in Civilization series (unfortunately suffers from bad AI). Gameplay overall is addictive and there is strong one more turn syndrome.

[b]Tactical layer[/b] in form of battles at first looks deep and interesting. Units have a lot of stats and skills and there is flanking mechanic, there are also special tiles on the battlefield that grants various effects. That all seems cool but after couple of hours into the game, I find myself skipping the combat and always trying to auto resolve it (using manual combat only if dice roll wasn't satisfying). There are couple of reasons why:
1. Battles will take a lot of time (the longer the game goes, the longer the battles are) and you don't feel like they progress game so much.
2. Over course of one game you will always execute one best tactic that your race is built to do, which becomes tedious very fast. New spells in your arsenal should change that, but in the end they just improve that one good tactic.
3. Presentation of information. Units can have a lot of effects applied to them, and to make good decision, you need to know about them. So to view this information, you have to open seperate screen with unit overview and scroll through all effects and open thier tooltips. Then repeat this process for each other unit. This can be rejecting for new players and in the late game it can look absurdly. Also there aren't any options to improve how battlefield looks (special tiles for example are something that I discovered by accident).

Luckily auto resolve isn't bad in this game, so you can enjoy the game without this hussle.

[b]Sound and music[/b] is top-notch. I have to mention it in separate paragraph because it perfectly captures the atmosphere and melds into the world.

[b]Customizing the look of your heroes[/b] in RPG style is cool. You have many options to choose from and you can make characters that feels original and unique. 

Some bad aspects of the game:
- AI is bad (unfortunately nowadays it is a market standard in the genre),
- underground level looks boring and should be reworked or could be erased and I wouldn't mind,
- as 4X strategy, there is very little settings you can tweak to improve your experience,
- there are some core gameplay mechanics that are hidden in menus and aren't explained in the tutorial or mentioned anywhere (e.g. special tile improvements, whispering stones - you can give them to your cities, you can have more heroes than your limit shows, some Imperium improvements are repeatable),
- some missing descriptions or weird text issues in tooltips,
- polish translation is bad (many spelling issues).

Plus, its a beautiful game, intuitive UI and very responsive. I get a little lag in really big battles if you try to auto resolve but your talking only single-seconds of wait time. You can still navigate the map while AI is taking its turn, which is great.

There is one major downside with this game though... The AI in this game is as dumb as dog sh*t. You'll be entertained only as long as your friends will play with you and/or until you lose interest in developing new combos/builds/races.

I have no idea whether the developers simply don't care that they lied about the viability of MP or if their hands are tied by their publisher but I am quite disappointed and will not support them moving forward after my DLC pass (which I regret purchasing) is complete. 

TL:DR: Great single player experience, interesting take on 4X. However, MP is a total letdown (desyncs, corrupted files, stupid save file design) coupled with an astounds lack of communication and transparency re: the issue by a company that used to set the standard in that area.

Battle AI is reckless and doesn't seem to know how to handle buffs and spells effectively. Still, it can be described as somewhat decent in comparison to the woefully inadequate and horribly passive campaign AI.

Despite all the problems, the game plays really well and shows great promise and I believe most of the problems will be fixed and customization options will further increase with patches and expansions.

Currently, you can select two traits for your race, then society type for your race which determines your base units and two society traits which shape your playstyle. Finally you select a magic tome which determines your playstyle at the early game. You're going to acquire more magic tomes throughout the game, so if you picked picked a tome that you thought would be great, but didn't work out it is not the end.

On the other hand, I still feel like the race customization needs more improvement. Selecting just 2 traits feels too restrictive. While those two traits are really powerful It would have been nice if we could have added flaws (less MP if we wanted to create more thematic dwarves, weakness to element, etc.) in exchange for some good stuff (resistances to elements or immunities to certain status effects such as disease,bleed and similar stuff).

Also I feel like terrain/environment adaptations (e.g like underground adaptation) should be their own category rather than occupying a slot in Mind Category. I kind of feel the same for mounts, they don't seem to be as good as the other body traits though I need to experiment more to be sure.

EDIT: I also compared AoW 4 with its past iterations including planetfall, dunno if you'll find this helpful:

Leaders feel pretty similar to AoW 3 & Planetfall leaders, but there is more magic stuff in the game compared to 3. However, I feel like hero system of the AoW 4 is the worst among all of the series. Heroes are seriously lacking uniqueness to distinguish them from other heroes. In AoW1, heroes often started with some unpickable abilities and had their racial traits, while AoW 2 had hero class/race combinations that had access to different combinations of abilities. In AoW 3 heroes system got worse, and in Planetfall it was a little bit improved with addition of racial ability lists.

City building aspects and domain management in AoW 4 are definitely better than AoW2, AoW3 and Planetfall. However, I feel that types of wonders are a little bit lacking. I also miss Anomaly mechanics from Planetfall, where you sometimes unearthed ancient wonders. Furthermore, I also miss some off the mechanics from wonders that gave +1 def or something else to units produced from the city its connected to.

Damage types are same as AoW 3, but I feel like using the same formula for damage types from AoW3 is causing problems for AoW4. In AoW1 & AoW2 we had Holy for Life sphere, Death for Death Sphere, Physical & Poison for Earth, Frost & Poison for Water, Lightning & frost for Air and Fire for Fire sphere and Magic damage for cosmos. However, in AoW 4, because of lack of damage types design choices forced both Undead stuff (Shadow) and Nature to deal Blight damage (which is combination of death and poison) and they both have to resist the same damage type...

I also somewhat miss combat flying from Planetfall, which also existed in AoW1 & 2. While the way flying units worked was problematic in AoW1 and AoW2, I think it worked pretty well in Planetfall. I don't think it would've been too problematic in AoW4 as siege mechanics were revamped. Though it would've required flying units to have limited uses of ranged attacks to not auto-kill all melee units, since melee units are more prominent in this game.

Research concept of AoW 4 is definitely superior than AoW1, AoW2 and AoW3. However, lack of Endless Tech from planetfall is being felt in the game. Also, planetfall had whole a lot of research for each of the different stuff: Race, Weapons tech (which is technically part of race but could be shared by other races), Secret Tech. On the other hand, in AoW 4 there is no research associated with racial traits or society traits and only 1 book for cultures, which feels pretty underwhelming compared to Planetfall. Also, because of the way tome system works, Magic Victory has issue of having no opportunity cost, while Doomsday victory worked totally because there was opportunity cost of not researching other useful stuff. Also, there is the issue research speed skyrocketing after the early game and problem of researching too many books in the late game, which is harming the uniqueness of factions and strategies in the game. Research system definitely needs some sort of tuning.",1683144975,1686952429,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a fan of all the AOW games this is the 2nd worst I have played after Planetfall for these reasons: 

AI is far to slow to finish its turns not just on my dated pc but my friends new shiny 2k  rig this sucks the life out of a very promising game.
My preference is having different races with different abilities instead of being able to homogenise any race with the same spells books etc Some of the fun was playing distinct races using their strengths and being aware of their drawbacks. 

The sense of exploration that you had in Shadow magic AOW 3 is missing.

The bibliography is lacking on units 
 
Good points: good creation setup great visuals and I like the addition of the empire trees although they should be restricted on race .

I like the addition of Imperium to stop a spam of level V units

Finally if the could sort of the AI times I will change it to highly recommended",1686933845,1686933845,False,1,2,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

The vanilla game is a decent foundation that is somewhat lacking in content and has some odd core design oversights. There appears to be a strong framework for dropping more content in over time between DLC and mods. It has a lot of potential to grow from a decent release into an exceptional classic, but how well the game sustains itself will heavily depend on both the depth of new official content and how mod-able it really is.

Desperately needs addition of city ruin razing/deleting, auto-prospecting, and ongoing improvements to an inconsistent and spotty AI. Only 5 scripted semi-generated story missions from a series originally known for its strong story campaigns that oddly switches between the 'good' and 'evil' factions in a manner that doesn't make sense for playing the same leader through all 5 missions. Relies on custom skirmish maps beyond that. The 6 cultural faction templates, limited initial traits, and shared tome units run the risk of most faction designs devolving into a handful of samey meta designs and expanding on all of those options into the future is very necessary.

From a continuity perspective, it is possible to remake more AOW1/2/SM factions than in AOW3 using the provided options, but still missing several notable elements:
-inexplicably missing most of the hydromancy / water magic theme from prior games
-missing several 'alive' leader characters from prior games
-missing Lizardmen/Draconians (addressed in DLC1)
-missing 'da Vinci punk' Human / Dreadnought culture (addressed in DLC2)
-no Shadow World / Astral Plane layer (implied to be addressed in DLC4)
-no Shadow Demons (implied to be addressed in DLC4)
-no Nomad style city relocation mechanic

This is how a game should iterate on its forebears without holding itself back in doing so - growing from what worked in older Age of Wonders games while still introducing plenty of new aspects and gameplay. It's a good game at its core and it has a pretty clearly modular design that leaves many aspects open for mods and DLC to add swaths of content. If you're not looking for specific thoughts but just an overview: the game has hundreds of hours of content at its base, and the modding potential is nearly limitless within its framework.

AoW4 does a great job distinguishing itself from some other 4x's - we see armies with multiple units making a return as all other AoW games, and it's got a good fantasy bend to it. There's solid customization of your faction and your leader, where your culture, abilities, and traits all make an impact but don't go so far as to lock you into an end condition. It's got the tools to let your playstyle and faction evolve over the course of the game by way of the tomes you pick - which give you spells, units, and evolutions to research, provide affinity which is used to unlock different skills for the empire, and so on. The racial modifications are really cool - research and cast one to change your faction's people in permanent ways, and you can have a bunch of them. The different end-game conditions feel pretty reasonably well balanced against each other, and playstyles suiting each have pretty solid support throughout. Combat is interesting and evocative, with the different cultures having an interesting way to play such fights - industrial cultures have abilities that strengthen their physical defense and a support unit which can convert that extra defense into raw damage, while a mystic culture gains extra damage whenever you cast a spell in combat. The city-building and expansion is pretty solid, annexing provinces (and what building to do so with) feels like a solid, evolving choice, and you're given tools to alter the way it pans out for you as well - a city surrounded by water with a seafarer's guild can start raking in massive benefits from each water province, while they were mediocre before that structure.

Overall great game; solid design at a base level, great paths to evolve your play through each game, and a frame that looks like it's optimized for expansion by both Triumph and modders.",1686795779,1686795779,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

[b]The Good[/b]

* - I like the graphics style. The word looks good, the models are very nice.
* - Tactical battles are fun if the armies involved are closely matched.
* - City expansion based on province acquisition is great and can force some interesting decisions especially when cities are very close together.

[b]The Bad[b]


* - The AI is brain dead. Nuff said.
* - No story based campaign. 
* - Faction customization, which is supposed to be a huge part of the meta game is broken. Species (not races unless you consider rats to just another human race) are just skins, There are NO fixed characteristic(s) for each species so in fact you can build humans to be just like rats or goblins or elves. Yes you can make your faction any way you like but the species SKIN makes no difference at all. How did Triumph miss on this?
* - Economy and Research both broken. No, not broken, just not well designed and implemented. The worst example of this is the Knowledge based research of spells and tomes. Early on things are bit slow but before mid game you can be tearing through the tomes, and by mid game you are just clicking something to move along. The decisions you make mean less and less to your game as the game progresses. 
* - Victory Conditions are a joke, with the Magic victory being the most giggle inducing. The brain dead AI hasn't a clue and one can (no matter your faction design) simply cruise to a Magic victory without breaking a sweat. Yes you can customize victory conditions and if one does then taking down the AI militarily may take a bit longer but it's inevitable. It's true that you can design a realm with AI players that start with enough advantage that winning can be difficult or impossible but it's not because the AI players get smart, they can just be too big to deal with.

I am hopeful that patches and DLC will address some or all of these issues. The Developer Notes for the first major patch and DLC make that clear. Still, waiting for year to MAYBE see the sort of improvements that this game needs is simply ridiculous.

The downsides are prominent and should be mentioned:
AI does not follow the rules of the game at higher difficulties and does not actively try to win the game. It also does not react to your strategy sufficiently as an enemy. As an ally, You can't coordinate with AI - free cities just sit in their town and AI allies do not come to your aid. 

Pacing of research is off - the transition from early to mid game is OK. However, from mid-game onwards it seems like a rush - there is virtually no mid game. This could be solved by adjusting research costs.

Combat can be abused - if your enemy has 4 stacks and one of them is a scout, if you attack the scout with your main stacks the battle is 18 vs 13

Economy is mildly over-reliant on free cities.

Summoning is overpowered compared to production and close to the only reliable way to reinforce.

AI can be abused by selling them items for HUGE amounts of resources. They are also given free epic items that you can buy off off them - the best and most reliable source of those items.

Heroes are overpowered <PERIOD>

Some tomes need balancing- you get tomes with 4 useful things, you get tomes with 2 useful things.

Special province improvements need balancing - their impact on economy is miniscule and their cost is too high.

Wizard Kings provide a scaling bonus(casting points), Champions lack that going into the late game.

The siege system is skewed towards the attacker - with the defender having to invest heavily into defensive structures for little to no benefit as it relies on the opponent to siege you. Even then, it's not like you get that much of an advantage with battlements etc. 

Town economy could be more impactful - as of right now food does not provide enough benefit.



... despite all that... here I go again for another playthrough.

Cons - It gets monotonous pretty quick.  It has a HoMM 3 feel to it, but comes up short.  Beyond the first couple of rounds, exploration is limited.  You essentially get hemmed in by other teams.  Then you build armies and sit on your property forever trying to advance your magic to cast a spell that takes 15 turns to complete (a game is 150 turns).  Alternatively, if you attack ""without justification"", especially early in the game, you have a huge resource disadvantage.  A siege of a city can take 10 turns with one to three of your armies sitting idly at the gates.  You can't build too many cities or you have a resource disadvantage.  A single city over your cap severely punishes you, so much, that the city isn't worth getting.

I am a fan of RTS in general, but many are plagued with critical fun-sucking issues, and in that regard this game does almost everything right.  There is a huge variety of choice, both before the game starts in terms of the ability to customize your race and faction, and during the game in choosing your Tome research or Cultural Research, what units to build, how and when to expand, whether to expand through might or diplomacy, and in so many other ways.

Having played several single-player and 3 full multiplayer matches, I can say I haven't run into any game-breaking bugs, though I have run into a couple odd features such as when pillaging a golem mine give me the free golems as a defender instead of the owners of the mine getting the golems or just shutting it down during pillaging. But other than a few oddities such as that, everything seems to be working well, and on my system the game runs pretty well. 

This brings me to combat. It is just a lot of fun.  There are so many different spell and unit combinations that you can just experiment in the extremely well done combat.  You can also have up to 3 squads of 6 units each in a combat, not including Siege Weapons, siege towers, and in battle summons, which means battle can be absolutely insane in scope.  Further still, the battles are nicely laid out, both for sieges and for regular encounters so that you can do a little bit of dodging and skirting your opponents, but you can only delay for so long before you have to engage or withdraw. Withdrawing also makes sense because doing so reduces other units morale in the combat and there is a small chance of losing the unit, so the withdrawal system can't be abused.

Naval Combat also works well. There are ships, but with seafaring researched you units can take to the sea and fight on transport ships. But ships can't attack on land, which makes sense, and the ranged units can use their regular attacks, which also makes sense.

Using a variety of units also has benefits. Buffs from priests compliment your ranged and melee troops. There are soft unit counters, and spells of every variety.  

I guess what I am saying is that the game is just plain old fun to play.  It isn't in a 100% perfect state at launch, but there is plenty of content and I don't regret buying it at full price, not one bit.",1685727867,1686387415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I want to focus on are some cons and issues that I have with this game which sometimes make this game a bit boring and frustrating and it is mostly about late game.

(this all is brutal difficulty)
- AI in late game:
 -- they don't attack especially if you get strong and they rarely attack other AI, they just stuck armies on borders or on outposts and cities.
 -- if they are allied to each other they don't cooperate in attacks every one is for itself
 -- I believe they are limited in their or closed on their tomes or number of enchantments and minor transformation they have because I played a game with unlimited turns where I had all possible enchantments active and was able to delete stuck of 18 units different tiers (high and low) with just 3 shield and 3 range units (even on auto-battle, not even playing myself there I could delete army of 7 with heroes with just 1 horse unit and using spells)

- spell book:
 -- really need some filters and disabling option, so hard in late game to find your spells, takes so much time and this is not a big fix, quite small and easy one. There are spells that are redundant in late game, you pick stronger ones or there are just those which are better to use and to go through all the spells it is just so much time wasted. I mean spell book in combat and even out of combat, but there you can at least sort by type of spell. Would be so beneficial if you had some listing, like for attacking spells, for buffs, debuffs, healing etc. As it is normal in most of the games, like Heroes Might and Magic

- late game research:
 -- not sure if this is just my computer but in late game if you have high research and you research multiple magics in one turn when you are picking up the magic there is a like 10 - 30 secs lag. I sometimes gave up on picking up some spells and if I am high on mana I shuffle through them.

For now those are ones that bother me most anything else is amazing, I love playing the game and looking forward to the DLCs

Allies can't be relied upon in the slightest, and vassals don't act like vassals. They can have massive armies and just sit there while I fight the strongest AI enemy by myself. Zero support! 

Which leads to massive problem 2: What is the point of diplomacy? If an AI doesn't like you, you can't really do anything to make them like you. If they do like you, they say something nice and then ignore you. Struggling in a massive way they called you into? Don't worry you can depend on them to actually do nothing.

The diplomacy felt really cool until I realized how meaningless it is when the AI won't act on agreements in any meaningful way.
Gonna have to change my recommendation to negative, these issues are a huge oversight.

Update 2: Honestly the AI is really disappointing. Battles always boil down to direct pitched battles, smaller battles basically don't happen except in the very early game. This makes tactical combat pointless because it just takes too long. And you can't really ambush parts of armies anymore like you could in AOW3. Armies from 3-4 tiles away will automatically teleport to reinforce. This is nice from a defense standpoint, but it would make far more sense if stacks took 'X' number of tactical combat turns to actually arrive so that guerilla tactics would at all be possible.

Update: And just like that within like 2 days, there's a patch that addressed crashing and my game is 100% stable now.

Has significant launch issues, but otherwise is very enjoyable.

Bought on launch day expecting issues, so far I crash every few hours. This isn't great, but these devs are solid and will get it sorted out soon I'm sure. The game's fantastic autosave functionality makes the crashing almost a non-issue.

What to like:
-Lots of new ideas (free cities)
-Lots of superb iteration on elements from AOW3 (cities are a lot less linear and more pivotal)
-Much better diplomacy and casus belli functionality than AOW3
-Tons of customization
-Pretty solid stylized visuals paired with good performance
-Excellent UI (for the most part)
-Mod Support (nothing yet obviously, but the studio's support of the community is solid)

Issues:
-Crashing
-Can't control map size effectively
-Combat unit UI elements are intrusive
-Combat has some janky delays and some attacks don't connect nicely

I would recommend getting it now if you're ok with a rocky initial experience. If you'd rather wait for stability then I recommend grabbing it in a couple months, I'm sure they'll have the major issues ironed out.
To be clear, this game is NOT some half-baked cash grab. It's a solid game with a few, yet serious launch issues.",1683150423,1686360356,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI has vastly improved, a number of technically optimal but soul crushing gameplay patterns have been removed, faction customization is deeper, and the game ends faster. I'm not sure that this game will make you like fantasy strategy games if you were not already inclined to, but it is a very good example of the genre.

AoW4 has done a very good job with the power curve, end game spells are explosive and powerful so when you start getting tier 4 and 5 magic you really feel empowered to end the game; this should happen around turn 80 (give or take a bit) so games tend not to drag on into a morass of ending unimportant turns while you wait for something to happen. All of the campaign missions I've played can be finished within a single play session even without engaging with the specific mechanics that make them faster.

Some specific positive changes:
1) Taking military production and making it a second queue so that soldiers don't interfere with building up your cities and vice versa. This encourages aggression and also lets players inclined to building tall do so without foregoing defense.

2) Making in combat healing a temporary addition to your units hp pools means that you are not longer rewarded for dragging out easy fights.

3) The empire wide city limit means that making tons of cities that you then have to control and worry about is no longer the best way to grab territory.

I do have a few minor critiques: necromancy didn't feel that compelling to me, so I haven't really engaged with 50+% of that school; It really does behoove you to plan your tomes and affinities out in advance, which is kinda frustrating if you don't know what they do; and finally, while the game doesn't say it outright you [i]really[/i] need some researched siege projects in order to make the timers reasonable (now if you don't go to war with everyone you probably won't feel this too badly, but it is worth keeping in mind).

[b]Performance: [strike]4/10[/strike] E: 8/10[/b]
Since the patches and hotfixes I have experience no chug, lag, or crashes, and the game is MUCH faster and more responsive. I don't know how it's been for other players, but as far as I can tell, whatever was strangling it has been tazed.

[b]Gameplay: 6/10[/b]
I've always been pretty fond of these games, and on a purely technical level the game delivers exactly what prior entries in the series did. Reasonable challenge and annoying, borderline cheaty AI opponents.
My issues with gameplay come in the ways that combat and interaction with your empire all feel ""streamlined"" in the modern, corporate sense of the term. That is to say: dumbed down. Thankfully not by much, but there are fewer ways to use elements in both attack and defense. The magic system has been simplified and feels downright restrictive. Overall there are just far, FAR fewer options in almost every way.
Where the game shines so far is in the ability to customize your empire itself. The ability to craft a people who feel like they have a BACKSTORY is impressive. My only issue with the feature is, as with almost everything else in the game, the downright narrow range of options inherent to the base game.

[b]Story: p/10[/b]
The story built into the game... is... eh... Well, let's just call it BLAND, but if you can set it aside and enjoy your own story it can be pretty fun and interesting. The only thing that seems to really try to force the base narrative of the game down your throat are a few of the periodic random events which are, unfortunately, so few in number and variability that they don't feel the faintest bit random at all.

[b]Completion: 5/10[/b]
(EDIT: The ""Work In Progress"" notations are still in game in several main line buildings and creatures, even though the Devs have now moved on to making DLC)
This game does NOT feel like a finished game.
No, I don't mean that it feels like one big opening for DLC ([i]It's Paradox. There will be tiny, overpriced DLC coming out its long, pointy ears before long[/i]), I mean there is literally UNFINISHED CONTENT in the game. The UI feels about right, but tooltip placement is awkward, the camera is tethered to angles that make things hard to see and control at times in combat, and there are main-line city buildings that are quite literally labeled with ""WIP"" attached to the name of the building, no flavor text, and unfinished listings of the effects of the buildings. Some things say they'll do one thing but have tthe opposite effect, and even a few of the ([i]small number of[/i]) monsters appear to have placeholder data.
This is an Early Access game that isn't Early Access, but in it's official release form.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
I actually DO like this game. I think with about twice as much content and a whole Dev Phase more polish it could thoroughly outshine some of the previous titles. Unfortunately, my suspicions are looking to be being proven right, as there is still Unfinished Content in the base game, limited content overall, and they are already announcing DLC in a typical Paradox cash gobble. I'll probably be relying on the modding community for content now more than anything.

[h1]6/8/23: I'm giving this a recommendation, despite having some v ery serious issues with the game. It has some problems, though most of the technical ones have been seen to in recent patches.

I had bounced off their sci-fi entry and continually returned to the 9 year old AoW3 for my fantasy fix of this tried and true formula. AoW4 does not disappoint as a sequel, although it is more a logical iteration of the formula than anything groundbreaking.

The most advertised feature, the custom faction creation system, is a great addition and generally well executed. It's almost a fantasy Stellaris. You aren't limited to standard fantasy tropes like strong orcs and accurate elves (although you can still make those), but can create all sorts of combos, sometimes even wild or unbalanced ones. Leaning into magic, you can have a faction that smites everything until it meets something lightning resistant. The downside is that custom factions are a bit lacking in distinct play styles at the moment, compared to AoW3 where your choices were more limited pre-designed races and classes, but they had much more differentiation. More content for the faction creator will probably alleviate most of this, although the system could probably be tweaked a bit, like being able to pick more traits at start.

AoW4 also applies this customization philosophy to the game world, so campaigns no longer have fixed maps and factions, but are more randomly generated. There are story realms which have some degree of pre-selected factors, but in random maps you can choose from a wide variety of suggested settings, or just go totally wild. Lore-wise this is explained as a cosmos made up of infinite realms that are connected, and from that there is a pantheon system to tie each game session together into a whole. Completing a realm, win or lose (tho winning has better rewards) gives you pantheon xp to level up and access more boons for faction creation and realm types. It;s a good idea and connects each game session together in a way AoW3 didn't but it's a little lacklustre at the moment, and perhaps excessively grindy. Again I imagine this will be improved by future content.

AoW4 has really improved the empire-building part of the game, and is much deeper than its predecessors. Unit and building construction have been split, the map is now a bunch of small provinces that your cities annex as they grow, and which ones you choose matter. The tactical battles remain very good, with some small alterations from that improve flow like allowing your leader to cast and do another action on the same turn. The removal of non-leader heroes to cast tactical spells from their own spell books is a step back however, and you are limited to whatever tomes you chose and start and throughout the game. That said, the battles allow for alot of combos between units, abilities, and magic, which evolve through the game. AI is competent here, but more passive on the strategic side.

Graphically the game looks better than ever, although sometimes this makes the tactical maps a little cluttered and hard to read when playing a battle. Sound and music are good as usual. In summation, AoW4 is a very good game, and its minor issues will be patched out, and new content will only improve the experience. Highly recommended as the reign king of the fantasy 4x genre.",1686258803,1686258803,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The ""tech tree"" isn't super deep, but it allows you to really make a unique theme for your people, though after you've gotten the tomes you most want, it can get a little muddled. It feels great stacking a dozen species enhancements on your people, but they look like patchwork monstrosities after too long. If there were a mod that let you toggle looks for applied enhancements, I'd install it in a heartbeat to keep my aesthetic.

It is *extremely* cool that finishing a game allows you to add your ruler from that game to your pantheon, who not only show up hanging out at the start screen, but also have a chance to show up and offer to help out as heroes during future games. Also you have a little talent tree that unlocks a bunch of neat cosmetics for your heroes and starting weapons/abilities/origins, so once you finish a game and unlock some stuff, you're immediately like ""ooh, I wanna try this out!"" I do wish you could pick who shows up on the title screen though, or make it random. As-is, it's just the first 5 heroes, and I wanted mine instead of the ones from the campaign, so I uhhhh kicked them out of my pantheon.

A major downside is the AI and diplomacy - which is usually the case in 4X games, but it seems especially bad here. It's simplified a bit because the game is more focused on the (very fun!) tactical combat, but just needs some polish. You can only trade things for gold (or sometimes mana), and only one thing at a time. So you can't grab like, a magic sword, a mount, and 50 gold to trade for their extra fancy hat, you have to individually sell them the sword and mount and then buy the hat from them. There's no haggling or making a deal, there's only the price they will pay for it. BUT, it is at least a little more transparent and less arbitrary than some 4X games, even if it's absolutely maddening that when you're in a defensive pact, they get mad at you for ""breaking your oath"" and not responding to their call to war when THEY declare war on someone else! That's not how defensive pacts work, Yaka, you putz!

Finally, my gay little heart loves so much that you can completely change the appearance of any hero at any time, at no cost. I can recruit a big strong man and add him to my cadre of lesbians with swords within a matter of minutes, and I think that's great.

TLDR; a really fun game that I will for sure be playing more of (after already spending far too long on), with fantastic customization and fantasy options, held back from greatness by a few minor annoyances and some subpar diplomacy AI.

But that AI is so bad, and because it is so bad they have to stack the AI players with so many discounts and special costs, that it is a truly joyless affair beyond the first difficultly level. I'm fighting an AI empire with my army of like 5 stacks of 6 units, the most I can afford to pay upkeep on and keep developing. I defeat one full slightly bigger army of the AI, because it is awful tactically. Within two turns it has completely replenished that army, which I also defeat, but now my army is showing some wear. Two turns later...here comes another army of the same size. This just keeps happening. Tactically, the AI is dumb as a post, but I HAVE to play each of these battles tactically because if I use the ""auto-battle"" feature my general is just as dumb. So I end up playing multiple fairly dull tactical battles watching my army (which takes me a long time to replace) be eroded by the AI's stupid but countless forces.

It ruins a sense that you are playing against an opponent that is vaguely similar to you. You are clearly playing as a human, and they are all weird and stupid computers who just can spam out armies 10 times faster than you can. I'm sure there are ways around this, I'm sure there are strategies I could be using to account for this, but I'm equally sure I would not find any of those strategies fun.

It's a disappointment, I really was looking forward to this game and spent far more than I should have on getting it. I wish I had waited months for a sale. I'm 104 hours in (not much by 4X game standards) and I feel like I am done, it's just no fun to play against these dumb AI players.",1685998558,1685998558,False,251,6,0.896608054637908936,13,True,False,False

It's a bit like being the head of your own magical council estate, but without the pesky council tax. You've got everything from cannibal halflings to moon elves, which is an improvement on the usual bloke at the end of the street who thinks he's a vampire. It's better than Civilization 6, probably because, in this game, you get to play with a fancy magic themed ""tech tree"" instead of building a library in ancient Egypt or something. Now, I don't exactly know what a tech tree is, but apparently, this one is the most innovative thing since sliced bread. Or at least, since the last 4X game.

Quality of life features in this game are brilliant. For instance, no one bothers you about real-world stuff, like taking out the bins or paying the bills, because you're too busy deciding if you want your people to grow wings or horns, which is more important if you ask me. The graphics, I must say, are quite splendid. It's like stepping into an episode of Game of Thrones, only without the nudity and dragons. Well, there are dragons, but they're roaming in ruins and not burning down entire cities (usually). Some folks have been moaning that all the fantasy races feel the same, but if you ask me, that's just because they've spent too much time at the pub and not enough time exploring the magical realms.

The meta-progression bit of Age of Wonders 4, this thing they call the pantheon, is, well, alright. It's a bit like having your own club of wizard kings, except everyone's not as drunk and it's less noisy. Apparently, your rulers can ascend to this pantheon and you get to meet them in future games. Now, that's the kind of reunion I can get behind - no awkward small talk, no reminiscing about the old times, just you and your wizard kings, trying to conquer new realms and create your own fantasy story. So, if you fancy yourself as a bit of a Tolkien, but can't be bothered to write a book, get yourself Age of Wonders 4. It's a hoot and a half.",1685980799,1685980799,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

pros - 
faction customization is incredibly good, I love almost everything about it.

Realm Customization is also very good as you can customize the map type and what is apart of the map allowing you to change how the game is able to be played. 

Single Player is really smooth for me however don't play on normal if it is your first time playing as it can get fairly difficult pretty quickly for a new player but after playing a couple campaigns normal can become the easy mode game mode. 

Art style is very very nice, I actually love this art style more than most games in this genre. 

UI is also very nice and simplistic allowing you to easily configure realms to how you'd like as well as in game allowing you to easily learn how to play with certain functions in town UI or Unit UI. 

Comes with modding tools and is accepting towards mods

Cons - 
Faction restrictions will often times prevent you from playing other faction cultures based on how you enjoy setting your ruler up. 

Multiplayer is very buggy as you can play a mid game before encountering tedious bugs like desync or a game breaking bug that will not allow you to finish the game. 

Capital Spawns can sometimes be awful but this can either be declared as a feature or nuisance. 

AI either progresses very quickly or very slowly so games can be either very hard or very easy without modifing difficulty sometimes
AI can also team up against you and restrict you from even completing the game. 

Minimal weapon designs as most weapons only come looking in one specific design choice

 Final Verdict: As a person in the game development world, I feel like as a single player game in its current status is still very outstanding and has a ton of replayability. The Devs are aware of the bugs and are trying to fix them as quickly as they can. Keep in mind though as games have evolved to the modern day these extra mechanics can take a significant amount of time to fix, if they can be fixed. If multiplayer is a must for you I'd suggest putting it on your wishlist and waiting for their input on if they can or cant fix these bugs. If you wish for multiple weapon design choices I'm afraid you'll need to wait for a 3D artist to create a mod adding in more assets. The game mechanics are very fun but if you are an action player looking to get into strategy games I would NOT recommend these type of strategy games and redirect you towards RTS style Strategy games as they are action based. A single Campaign can last over 2 hours so make sure before you buy this game that this game is exactly the type of game you want to play. Lastly, keep in mind this game is just over a month old so it is not perfect by any means and it wont be perfect for a while expect to encounter bugs.

The good:  
Lots of options and things to do in the game.
Customization galore if you like that.
Differently play styles that you can do (although only some are usable on harder difficulties)
Fantasy story is fun
In game random events can be interesting while also don't break the game like they do in other 4x games.


The bad:

The biggest problem is how fog of war works and how little your units vision is. Even with vision buffs you will constantly be jumped by entire mega armies of things that live and move outside your field of vision.  

CPU on harder difficulties is just boring. You have no choice but to cheese strat, anything less than that and you only win on pure luck since the AI gets free everything including armies, xp, and gold.  

Wish there was more strategy to the game then just build big army and run over enemies, or build defensive army and win passive victory.  

Only 1 resource really matters, gold.  No gold you and you insta lose.  Get more gold, insta win.  Without gold you can't even build buildings which I think is absolutely stupid.  Just dumb as bricks game design to make gold needed for litterally EVERY possible expansion or growth.  More units, needs gold + probably gold upkeep, want more land through outposts, that costs gold,  want to build buildings to get better cities, thats gold too. 

Oh, your city got sad because you had too much food, well now you won't be able to afford the one building that gets you happiness, if it was even available to your chosen race.  If you don't have it, you insta lose since sad cities make less money, which means you no longer grow or build an army.",1685899229,1685899229,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ocean and the underground are currently super lack-luster (because all of their content was left for the inevitable DLC onslaught). Land feels fine but after a couple games you'll have seen everything. There's a lot of customization options but ultimately they mean very little; people compare this to Stellaris but the (non-cosmetic) customization is nowhere near that in-depth. There are 5 ""cultures"" (pre-DLCs) with fairly distinct playstyles, everything else is just minor tweaks and number changes. You can get pretty different tactical combat strategies from race to race though (including within the same culture) thanks to tomes, so it doesn't get as stale as you might think as long as you don't abuse auto resolve. For some strange reason, there is a roguelike progression system in this 4X game. Each win you get gives you 3-6 points you can spend on unlocking ""pantheon rewards"", some of which are important racial traits or hero items. Most of the rewards are cosmetic though, so if there's a trait you really want to try you can just bee-line it in a couple games without missing anything cool. Ultimately a weird addition and somewhat annoying, but not overly offensive after the first few games.

As of now I have completed the game, 100% achievements, tried every race, used each tome at least once, etc. I think I got pretty good value out of it, and I'll definitely be coming back whenever the DLCs release. So you can reasonably expect 70-100 hours before you're ""out of content"" in the base release.

Great streamlining from planetfall concepts in the setting of classic aow with better immersion and more flexible gameplay. Less balancing issues, since starting flavor generates less restrictions in game. The starting flavor can be completely ignored in the late game or become the foundation of your chosen synergy. It works surprisingly well but does not lend itself to marathon games. You are encourage to pursue a victory in order to avoid the everybody does everything phase(Think of it like an end game crisis).

[h1]Bad[/h1] 

Utterly incompetent and lazy implementation.

Frequent crashing! ""Shadows"" must be turned off or random crashes occur during battles. The game still crashes randomly for a mulitude of reasons, so never touch anything while someone else is taking their turn and cross your fingers.

[h1]Framerate observations[/h1]

planetfall(medium no shadows or optionals) / aow 4(everything off or low)
tactical map 50 / 20(extremely dependant on terrain)
strategic map 50 -> 27(zoomed out) / 15 -> 46(zoomed out)
character generation 60(capped) / 6

I did not forget to type a zero in aow 4 character generation. Just for an animated gateway in the background the game ruins it's performance, this gateway appears on multiple menu screens and has the same effect on all of them. They put in graphic options that might save a frame here or there but the worst offender can't be blocked.

There are battle maps(wonders) with art assets like the floating spiral staircase that just obliterate the framerate to 1 or 2 fps. Desolate terrain with it's lava features is nearly as bad(6 fps).

[h1]Assorted issues[/h1]

The ""tome of knowledge"" where you can search and filter the various techtrees, units and spells. In aow 4 they simply shat out a collection of all tooltip and tutorial messages. No spells, no units, no nothing is listed there. Search for regeneration and nothing is found - even though it is a concept for the strategic map, a buff for the tactical map and a trait for race building. And due to the fact that the game likes to display information about units and spells in a limited tooltip you often find yourself in a situation where it is impossible to make an informed decision. E.g. wan't to research a spell? The tooltip will give you the flavor text and mostly the correct effects(but not always). Things like the spell cost are omitted and there is no interaction to bring up the full tooltip - with units its even worse. AOW 4 plays like a roguelike where you keep a fan wiki open on the second screen.

Meta progression. In aow 4 you have 7 world features(nothing that planetfall didn't provide), 49(37 are cosmetic) unlocks. 6 are starting gear which is meaningless due to respec option. The 6 traits are mixed in power but welcome. Difficulty does not factor into progression rewards.

Reintroduced the imbalance between multi and single strike attacks by adding static damage bonuses instead of percentage based ones. Same for any afflictions, their chance to trigger is the same but you can get up to 3 trigger in a multi strike attack. Planetfall solved that problem already.

The morale system is broken. If the enemy sends 3 stacks with tier 2 units only half the army needs to be defeated in the first salvo to trigger everything to rout. There is no difference between a low tier unit dying and a high tier unit - the morale penalty is the same. Here it does not matter how strong or weak the remaining forces are - they simply run.

In planetfall the problem was that the AI didn't estimate the player skill correctly when attacking and would use too few units. In aow 4 the AI will attack with 3 full stacks. However the economy is designed around both AI and player having 3+ stacks in an army. That means the AI can not attack with numeric advantage if the player brings 3 stacks to begin with. The AI can spam high tier units but the player wipes them without suffering relevant attrition and so killing 3 stacks back to back is not that difficult. This leaves the AI with no route to success.

The AI can be undecided in it's world map movement.

Instead of walking into an undefended city and razing it the AI will circle around and raze the cities provinces.

Phishing attacks. The AI will ask for your vassalization while they are loosing(repeatadly!).

The AI forms treaties and breaks them in the same turn.

The AI spawns heroes with a suite of scripted items. All of them use the same items. Once killed they spawn new ones with the same item sets. The killer gains all those items and this is the main way that players are gaining items. This has the downside that the item variety is severly lacking. Other ways to gain items is through diplomacy. It seems empires offer just randomly generated items for trading, late game it is common to be able to buy max tier items. Warlords do not have access to those. Even when they defeat an empire they will not gain the ruler items or anything from their arsenal(scripted or not).

The AI is not capable to play the game if the world threat is set to maximum. They get overrun by neutral forces that occupy all their provinces.

Broken quest lines that fail to complete. The whole defeat x AI opponents(allied or at war with each other) to trigger a victory has been in planetfall and worked fine but here it glitches and fails to recognize the defeat of a player.

Unfinished UI. Many dialogs feature incomplete texts. Rebuilding a city with multiple races available shows a button for each, but they all say ""rebuild"" with a tooltip that does not include the race. Ongoing projects display an abort button but no information on what you are aborting.

After conquering a city some buildings might need repairs. They show up in the build menu and can be added to the queue...except the tasks cost nothing and complete on the next turn without delaying following projects.

The underground has only disadvantages in terrain features. The map generation spawns disconnected pockets which generates massive problems. In some games an AI is sitting in their underground cave without ever moving, because another empire is blocking the path up and they don't wan't to trespass. Likewise moving down is a bit problematic if the player below has a ""Spell Jammer"", domain bonuses and you can only traverse with one stack at a time.

Poor visibility. Timid color choices and thin lines for highlights. Foliage obstructs units. The art style for the units is too busy. Most enchantments use conflicting model parts to visualize their presence. AOE attacks do not list damage numbers. Attacks do not list resistances as numeric values. Only if an enemy is resistant at all. Damage numbers show up as combined value so you don't see if you are hit with primarily elemental or physical damage.

Inconsistent handling for skills during combat. When using the rotation skill it keeps the targeting mode instead of exiting like every other skill(because the other skills can not be spammed), so unlike with everything else you have to double click in order to go to the next unit. Some skills that trigger around the selected unit bring up a targeting cursor - others fire immediately without confirmation.

Position for units on mountain tiles is misaligned. They are rendered far above the cell that they actually stand in.

Buildings that can be built if requirements are fulfilled do not show up in a cities building list and mutually exclusive buildings that can never be built do show up.

Alignment options in dialogs do not show current alignment and there is no element on screen to get that information from.

Transferring/capturing provinces does not prevent creating multiple, otherwise unique, improvements.

UI elements do not update correctly. Wrong labels(message stack) or disabled when they should be active(skills during battle).

Cosmetics appear dislodged and clip within their own set.",1685813871,1685813871,False,10,0,0.540399551391601563,1,True,False,False

Still, this is only a weak recommendation from me. My reason for this is that the game seems to have lost some of the Age of Wonders magic. Age of Wonders (even in Planetfall) always had interesting world building and a campaign with at least somewhat memorable characters. I see little of that here, in spite of the (few) story scenarios and a return of characters from as far back as Age of Wonders 2 (for example Yaka).

So you could say I have a soft spot in my heart for this series.

With that in mind I can honestly say with over a hundred hours in to then game, the main story under my belt and a big grin on my face that the TLDR is they have nailed it.

Personally speaking I think this is hands down the best implementation of AOW so far and here are some of the reasons why:

- Graphics: In the same vein of AOW Planetfall, this stuff is pretty. Everything from the living world to the battle scenes, you can see there has been some real attention to detail put into the smallest of things. I run this on a 34"" ultrawide with an ips panel and it genuinely looks beaut.

- Sound: There are certain tunes in games that to this day that although changed over the generations of a game still make the hairs on my arm stand on end e.g. The Morrowind theme, the AOE theme and ofcourse the AOW theme. Once again we see a strong offering with the music, it's never too repetitive or annoying with a strong variety to keep you happy. However if you fancy something different, never fear!  there is also full support for your own music within game! 

- UI: Clean AF. Nuff said. 

Other goodies:
- There's a full race creation! (hell yes!)

- There are many quality of life improvements such as simple UI changes to every important piece of info being hover-overable (if this isn't a word it should  be!) meaning you can follow the law even if its a little deep at times.

- Whats that I hear, wanna play every mission as an evil necro or as a pure good high elf? Well don't worry, they got you! You can literally progress the story as you wish with the races you love or simply custom make your own!

- A change of heart you say? well that's fine too, if your pure evil necro keeps doing good deeds by the end of the game they could be a pure good guy with friendly zombies that just want a hug instead of eat  brains! The game has a evil / good action system allowing your race to change based on your choices as a leader.

- Did I mention you can modify your race on the fly in game.... I mean.... come on baby!

So yeah, I rate it, if you haven't played the series before then I'd still say its a perfect time to join. This is by far the cleanest implementation yet.

AI is broken and will openly cheat, and when i say openly i mean unlike other games they will spawn 5 armies on top of themselves while your staring and having tested it, difficulty for them is a suggestion it seems like the AI is coded for the hardest difficulty.

if you wanted to play the game modded some with friends think again because adding one mod despite them being coded for multiplayer unless stated turns off crossplay which is evidently important to play with ANY PLATFORM INCLUDING YOUR OWN. i am not sure why that is but its just, flatly enraging as you do everything right to set this up and your rewarded with something broken not to mention the problems with multiplayer if you do it vanilla like how going against an AI your seeing those same issues mentioned with them but worse, and the damn thing can just lock up.

And bugs feel like they are put on the back burner as developers are more intently focused on streaming then development, patches are few and far between while they barely patch anything and they are already speaking on adding DLC. and while i pre-ordered the premium addition something that was clearly a mistake to have done now that i am here, you bet the dlc are gonna be 30-40$ per, after all it was that way with 3 and planetfall.

if things don't change i don't suggest purchasing this game, i in fact say for you to go try 3 and planetfall they are fantastic even with some flaws. but unless 4 changes what they are doing development wise i see that potential it held wasted and that disappoints me to no end.

+ customization of heroes
+ combat system

- confusing graphics
- The opponents' AI is not the best

The next part of the quality 4X strategy is here, and once again the creators managed to deliver a quality game. The basis of the game remained unchanged, the player builds cities, hires heroes and armies, discovers magic and explores and fights. It is not a revolution in the genre or a big evolution, the game offers great possibilities of combination and adaptation of the race, style of playing. Lean into different types of magic and thus create a variety of combinations of properties and units.
Heroes have their own inventory and raid options, regular units gain experience and upgrades and then massacre each other in successful turn-based battles, which can of course also be evaluated automatically.
But I can't get rid of such an embarrassing impression from the graphics, which seem terribly unclear to me, whether on the world map or during battles. Even the AI ​​does not dazzle with its performance. A couple of scenarios and maps are pre-prepared, but the generation of the world according to your own settings is a matter of course. After defeating the scenario, certain items can be unlocked and the warrior rulers can appear as heroes or rival rulers in other scenarios.
AoW4 is a high-quality game, but one always has the impression that he has seen everything before.

I think the main drawback for be is the tome system as it manages to offer too many and too little choices and variety. 
On larger maps you are likely to research most if not all of them so you can easily get into situation where everyone can cast and build almost anything.
The race creation suffer from similar problem as it makes some more or less significant changes to your starting race and with different culture, it WILL make your gameplay different, but again tomes can give you access to units the culture doesn't give you and enchantments translate cultural bonuses to other units again making late game potentially same-y. Sure, no one is forcing you build glade runner as industrious dwarf the fact it might be the only option toget decent ranged unit is not a great starting position.
Ultimately the game got rid of some good ideas from PlanetFall and failed to reimplement some Shadow Magic features like item creation or honestly much more impactful magic. The game calls you a Godir (which is not the best name to begin with) but the magic just feels more standardized and less impactful. Also fact that your godlike wizard king can be compeltely shut by something called ""spell jamer"" doesn't help their case.

This seems overly negative but despite that it IS a good game. Free city and rally system is still good and there is (for msot of the game) largely different play style based on your initial choices. I would just recommend you to give first two AoW games a shot before as this one suffers a bit from modern simplification. But if you've played those  or you're god damn zoomer that can't put up with older graphic (or whole screen turning into rainbow glitch in the case of AoW1) it's stlill worth the money.

Age of Wonders is one of my favorite gaming franchises of all time. No. 4 improves on almost all aspects the well-tested formula:

[strike]- Game flow is faster (and AI doesn't slow down after turn 100 making the game a drag)[/strike] [The problems are not as bad as in AoW 3, but especially nearing the turn 200, the AIs' turns are extremely long]

- Many ways to win a scenario [Yes, but also could be more. Magic and expansion wins are extremely similar]

- Tactical combat is deeper
- Auto Combat is reliable [but maybe 5 % of the time it fails]

- So much customization [and I love how races are now at the beginning of the game similar, but you may take them into many different directions]

- Items are available to all heroes at all times (no more teleportation needed)
- You can produce both buildings and units simultaneously at a city
- Events have taken influence from Crusader Kings, which make them more varied and interesting
- City development is much deeper than before
- Free cities are interesting to interact with, and have more depth to them than AoW 3
- You can adjust the length of arms and legs of your race: I had for example my first race toads with maximum length arms and minimum length legs

All in all it's just so good. And remember, this is still day 1. Way more content to come!

This game fucking rules. It may end up as the best 4X game I've ever played, and I've played many hours of them.

The customization is deep and impactful, subtle changes to your faction, the world map, your enemy factions, etc. really create divergent lines of strategy to keep every new run fresh and exciting.

The artwork, setting, sound are all top-notch.

New content has just been announced in the form of a DLC and a free major update to be released simultaneously sometime in the next couple months. It's clear from their communication just how much the devs care about this game.

All in all, a refreshing new release in gaming in an age not of wonders here Earthside, but of unfinished messes being released instead of fully-realized and lovely games (like this one).

I like games like hero of might and magic and other similar titles but the AoW series never catched me until now. 

It feels like a well rounded evolution to a genre that needed a bit of refreshment. Similar to Humankind in the Civilisation world this game manged to improve the game feel, adapt to the fast paced times we live in and give enough freedom to explore so that you can find ""your"" fun in it. 

All in all very rounded game with a successful easy to learn hard to master curve and I can say I'm looking forward to more content",1685610027,1685610027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The magical and fantastical themes of the game are done wonderfully, and to the credit of the designers, they lean into this angle knowing that it's their style. The ability to mix and match a big roster of fantasy races with a number of fantasy cultures gives the player an enormous amount of agency over what kind of faction they want to create. I've made two dozen and counting, from barbarian bodybuilder, to mystical transhumanists, to underground goblin butter thieves. At one point I made a faction of light-worshipping underground elves, that believed everything the sun shined on was holy and sought to unite the world in peace and harmony, summoning forests and trees for people all over the place to make the people happy. The faction after that game, I took out my frustrations on the AI by doing the level over again as a chaos-worshipping faction of dwarven anarchists, led by a human oracle that demanded blood for the blood god. 

The moment-to-moment gameplay is tactical and methodical, with battles putting you in control of the units in a turn-based battle map. Even standard units have some special abilities, and heroes can get really wacky, eventually having so many that my leader's abilities had their own scroll bar. Enchantments let you grant passives and abilities to your units, turning them into lightning powerhouses, fire-slinging arsonists, or curse-granting death prophets that bestow a curse of impending death with each shot. And - the best part - [i]all of them stack.[/i] The lategame can absolutely have archers slinging exploding rainbow meteor arrows that give people magical leprosy, and I love it. Upkeep gets more expensive with each enchantment, but it's completely worth it to see the chunky damage numbers fly in the lategame. Tactical spells can also be cast, blowing up the battlefield and tossing units around, with my favorite definitely being ""infectious insanity"", which is exactly what it sounds like. Spells can even be used to terraform the map, and transform your fantasy race into all kinds of things. One match I had half-demon orcs, another I had tree people goblins, and I just can't get enough of my gold-skinned giant halfling satyrs.

Even the macro gameplay feels unique, with the fantasy adventure being a huge focus of the early and mid game. Wonders are structures that have powerful bonuses when annexed to the empire, but must be ""cleared"" in what is essentially a boss battle with wacky modifiers to the combat. One wonder had a nymph in it, and I had the option to tell my dudes to avert their eyes so she couldn't seduce them. However, if I did, they would all be blind, and my archers have a habit of freindly firing at low accuracy values. There's a heavy focus on levelling up your heroes, ranking up (similar to levelling) your basic units, and clearing off resources to claim them, with bandit camps dropping fat stacks of loot as a reward. Heroes have items they can equip, including crazy mounts and awesome weapons. I hope they'll expand on it in the future, as currently there's somewhat limited variety, but what's there feels cool and impactful.

The asynchronous multiplayer plays like a dream. I rarely see it mentioned, but I tested it out with a friend, and while synchronous multiplayer seems to have some desync issues at present, asynchronous has been extremely easy to set up, and had zero issues. It's also just fun to tell people ""Yeah I'm in the middle of a match right now"", and then have to explain that matches often span days, as players just play when they're able. You can even play multiple of these kinds of games at once, and I am loving it.

 Building up a rich merchant empire is satisfying and rewarding, becoming a magical spellslinging megalomaniac is exhilarating, being a rat that squirrels away in the underground and taunts people for their lack of cheese is a form of fulfillment I've craved all my life, and the list just keeps going.",1685609579,1685609677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Changed my recommendation after spending some long days and nights grinding this game. I think the core game play loop is good. The AI is by far the worst aspect of the game. It isn't made smarter, or given advantages, it straight up cheats to win. Certain stories are completely unplayable late game, with the AI being given top tier units from the start and friendly AI walking around lost.

Game developers need to hire and pay software engineers to implement some actual strategy AI algorithms. I want to like and continue playing the game but after several weeks of playing nonstop, it's become apparent it's a waste of time from a strategy game point of view.

One huge, massive and major downside to the game remains: The AI is bad, absolutely insanely terrible and it cheats to hell and back. I truly wish & hope that Triumph Studios spends a part of the profits they've made thusfar into developing a proper AI that's actually interesting to play against.


Background:
Age of Wonders 4 makes me nostalgic for 1997, when I bought my first game with my own money. 99,99 Dutch guldens for an amazing looking boxed copy of Age of Wonders 1. I mean, it features a hooded dude blasting lightning from his hands that envelops an entire city!

I remember starting the tutorial upon first launching the game and being blown away by the massive red dragon that envelops the pop-up game menu. Pure high fantasy goodness

Age of Wonders kept me hooked ever since, to the point where every new PC I get, every upgrade I do; Age of Wonders 1 is the first game I install. Over the years new AoW games came out and I've tried them all.. but none of them got close to the fantasy immersion I felt in Age of Wonders 1.

If any of the devs read this;
1: Amazing game, hats off to you guys! <3
2: Thanks for adding in the Karagh.. I miss his big sword and his association through lore with the Goblins. Hope he gets a place around their hearth in the future!

This game tries to be a 4x fantasy game crossed with a turn-based RPG. Sounds great, right? Well, the themes are only skin-deep. 

Mechanically, the game feels very shallow. It's trying to combine two genres (which should be a GREAT idea) but it ends up half-assing both. 

But mechanics aren't the main reason I play these games. 

I play these kinds of games to tell my own stories in my own customized worlds, and to interact with interesting factions. Plenty of games, from Stellaris to Civ, do this quite well. In those games, rival factions have personalities, a sense of culture. As the game goes on, the factions develop their own complicated history with their rivals and allies, and each game feels unique and part of a living world.

Age of Wonders 4 fails miserably at all of this.

Every faction feels the same. They have identical dialogue that repeats over and over. They have absolutely no personality to speak of. You can't even customize them well enough to truly influence their behavior in a logical way.

I created a bunch of dark and chaotic orcs, did my best to give them society traits that would make them vicious and violent, and when I faced this faction in the game itself....they were diplomatic pacifists. 

The animations and magic visuals are incredibly very disappointing. Again, they feel unfinished. Plenty of spells use the exact same visuals, but with a color swap. Want to shoot a fireball? Well, for some reason it just looks liks orange lightning. Want to fire off an ice spell? It's just blue lightning. The combat animations are so mechanical and bland. Everything in this game is mechanical and bland. I feel like I'm eating cardboard and being told its a meal. 

The origins are just as shallow as everything else in this game. It gives you a few starting buffs, changes your clothing, and your city architecture. That's it. Did you pick something other than a Feudal origin? Well, get screwed. Nearly every asset in this game was made with the Feudal origin in mind. Your farms, huts, logging camps, outposts, towers. Everything is bland and looks the same! Even when I went underground and started a mushroom harvesting camp, it just looked identical to the logging camp. They're not even TRYING.

I am constantly trying to immerse myself within the awesome theme the game is TRYING to present, but everywhere I turn there's something bland and robotic pulling me out of the experience. 

What are you doing, Age of Wonders 4? What are you? Why do you put so little effort into the base theme of your game? None of this makes any sense.

Really, the atmosphere and the lore are the only positive things I can say about this game. It feels like a love-letter to fantasy games, from Warcraft, to Elder Scrolls, to Warhammer, even a bit of Dark Sun. The worlds feel charming, colorful, and lush.

But even then...it's all...so....BORING. The worlds end up blurring together. The game shows you all these cool portals that lead to such interesting realms. We see floating islands, alien landscapes, some true high-fantasy environments.

But you can't go to any of those worlds. The ones we see in-game are just generic green fields, deserts, mountains etc. They look nice, but it conflicts with the cosmic fantasy theme the game is going for and advertising. Sure, I'd like to go to Elwynn Forest sometimes, but surely we can get more creative than generic fields pock-marked by fantasy creatures. 

I mentioned this before, but I really need to emphasize: the dialogue is so bad it feels literally unfinished. I am convinced it is placeholder dialogue, because no one can write anything this robotic and bland. It's almost fascinating how much this game fails to deliver on basic strategy game features that should be very basic at this point. 

Not to mention, the game is buggy as hell. I've had several crashes, my people are often missing their heads or necks in cutscenes, the combat replay function often breaks and switches to manual control, leaving you stuck in combat you've already won. 

This game is not good. I do not understand why its getting such great reviews. It's the perfect IDEA of a game, and maybe that's enough for some people. But after a few turns you realize there's just nothing going on!

This game is DOA. I still want to play more of it, but every time I try I get sucked out of the experience and remember how bland it really is. The expansions they've announced seem fun, but I see nothing that will address the core issues this game has. Whats the point of new races and empire types when they all feel the same??

However there is an issue with FPS that is related to Vsync, I have a good setup going. 6600, and a monitor refresh rate of 60hz, and there is something is up with the Vsync. I was getting 20, and lower and it was eating my CPU. I couldn't figure out what was going on. I mucked around with lower settings and still a cap of about 23 FPS. Turning off Vsycn improved overrall performance. Something weird is going on there, considering this rig runs Bannerlord for 190 FPS, max settings, with Vsync on. 

There are a few bugs, and I have had a few crashes when ending my turns. 

Don't let the bugs scare you away this game is amazing even running at 20 FPS, or if you prefer wait for them to fix the bugs and have a blast.

My main gripe comes with the Diplomacy.  Most of the time it informs you why an AI faction declared war on you or why your relations are withering away but even if you notice this happening early enough, there are few ways to turn it around.  It seems to me that it snowballs quickly once the AI makes up it's mind.  There are, however, a lot of options for diplomacy from trading or selling items, settling grievances, and the obvious pacts.  This part seems pretty flushed out and engaging.  I wish they would alter the penalty for certain things, which might balance the relations between certain rulers.  In the game's defense though, I can see why they made Good characters despise Evil and vice versa but the penalties are a little too high imo and difficult to sway.

The gameplay and battles really shine here.  Unfortunately the battle maps often times feel like a cut and paste with different terrain types but the layouts are similar as I've only noticed about 5 or so different battle maps that aren't in landmarks or sieges.  They all look great and are functional though.  I'd just like to see a little more variety along with some additional elevation type settings.  There are quite a few choke points along with obstacles that do help with developing a strategy though.

I also wish they'd add ""Mission"" type locations on the world map like they did with Planetfall.  Those added some variety and I'm hoping to see some with the future DLC's.

I've noted some points I'd like to see improved upon but please don't take this as even a somewhat negative review.  Despite these gripes, this is by far still one of my favorite games to date.  The addition of the Pantheon system, which encourages you to complete games to unlock new attire, weapons and other items for future playthroughs truly does keep me coming back for more.  Also, on normal speed, I'm noticing most games end around turn 130 for me.  In other games I feel like it wouldn't be enough but here it feels just right.

The character/faction creation system is also great.  There are so many options that I've spent a ton of time just creating new factions and leaders.  The workshop is great too as there are quite a few people making some great content.

Overall I'd honestly give this game a solid 9.  It always gives me that ""One more turn"" vibe and it's so satisfying to stomp on a ruler who ticked me off 10 turns ago. In short,  I'm very excited for all the DLC to drop so I can see what else is in store.  Hopefully some of my small issues are addressed but in all seriousness, even if they aren't, this is still hands down a top 3 favorite of all time.",1683075581,1685488624,True,0,0,0.499215066432952881,0,True,False,False

It's a perfect combination of the open map Total War series, and games with 4X combat like divinity and many others. To be honest, I have never played an age of wonders game prior to this one, so I cannot comment on the quality or improvements of this title versus others, but i will say that me and a number of my friends are thoroughly enjoying this game.

Whether for single player or multiplayer, this game is highly immersive, highly customizable like no other game I've seen, and a beautiful balance between strategy and RPG elements. The world crafting is absolutely beautiful, the ability to terraform and prospect areas for more loot and money is absolutely amazing-  You can outfit your cities to produce whatever you want, you can outfit your hero to be whatever type of character you want them to be, And you can change that a moments notice for a small fee, provided you have the gear for it. You can legitimately forge whatever type of empire that you want, in whatever fashion you desire!

NOW- The one place I would say that this game really gets hit with bad reviews, is the freedom of choice and players themselves. I know- that's a strange thing to say, especially given that I just gave them praise for it. There are a number of gamers out there who fear turning the safeties off and losing, who then turn around and claim that the game is too boring or easy but wont up the difficulty. These are the same players who play ghost Recon wildlands and far cry, claiming it is too bloody easy, yet refuse to turn the user interface and automatic enemy markers off so you can't see them through the walls... Again, fear of challenge because they may die. 

Beyond that, this game creates a wonderful world of potential.

Other people already wrote pages about pros and cons and how the new mechanics are nice, and they indeed are, unfortunately, the game seems to fail in one key aspect. Making the battles actually fun.

In AoW3, playing the Tigrans, i would play out every battle, no matter how trivial, because their units with various abilities made battles incredibly enjoyable, and most importantly, they had some outright bonkers combos and tricks from the start that made it entertaining.

In AoW4, all races are 100% interchangeable, and the early game units are the same, infantry with stabby sticks, infantry with shields and something to swing, bows, scouts that are useless in a fight. Want to do anything else as just overwhelm with numbers? Too bad, those scouts cannot kite the enemy, got no special units that are good at flanking or getting behind them (Edit: Unless you play barbarian or pick the book that has the inquisitior. Yay, you just exhausted the near totality of what tactical variation the game offers, and it was not worth it.), no berserking dwarves with their cleave attack to teach a lesson about standing close to eachother either, and nothing fun gets unlocked later, enjoy doing the same swarming with numbers forever.

Story to drag you in at least until it comes to the good part? Story, what story? Good part?

I will give it a thumbs up because the core mechanics are in place and its a fully playable game, the bar is low these days.

Some things that could use improvement..

The item pool seems pretty limited, I regularly find the same common items over and over again. Gear can be scarce some games, I have gone whole games without getting a new weapon. This made the character customisation feel a bit hollow as it removed a layer of depth, making it nearly impossible to gear your hero the way you hoped. 

Morale is a pretty lame mechanic. Your hero can be a literal god, but if he gets ganged up on by trash enemies he will retreat even in a winning situation. My hero was healing more damage then he could possibly take but 3 half dead enemy units made him route.

I need to preface by saying, If you're just playing single player you might not have any issues besides some bad performance endgame. Which itself is an issue, but it's not unplayable.

What is unplayable is any form of multiplayer. It starts fine, then even playing with a single friend who doesn't live far away, the game starts CHUNKING around turn 30. Be ready for 1 fps and three minute long AI turns, and even longer endgame. it really does kill the fun, since well... it just halts it. Co-op is rough. I haven't played a full multiplayer game, though I can imagine the FPS does get wild low there too. So yeah, constant Desyncs that force a reload, and terrible performance are the real issues in the game. The rest is fine. Also fix the crash report feature please. It just doesn't work. I've sat for multiple minutes waiting for it to send a report and it didn't happen so I just closed it.

My issues with the gameplay stem from a few odd design choices and the AI being... scummy. 

By scummy, I mean they'll set up an outpost on the edge of your land, then build into it without fail every game. Which leads to them having grievances on you for expanding into ""their"" land, and giving them a justified war on you. So basically baiting you into war. The second part of that, is the AI will declare war and send units to burn down your kingdom. When you go overpower them, other AI or free cities will suddenly send parties to raid your land. Every. Time. So all in all, the AI (not just the other AI leaders, the AI free cities)  are really all working against you as one giant unit. It feels like this every game. Unless you secure an alliance early. Which leads into problem #2:

If an AI leader declares a rivalry with you, you CANNOT remedy that. I spent tons of gold just gifting it hoping the AI would stop the rivalry. Doesn't look like it's possible. Not really sure if that's a bug. So as of now, if an AI decides it doesn't like you and declares a rivalry, be prepared for war. There's no fixing that.

The last issue I really have is more of an odd design choice. The Tomes in the game are great. What's not great is there's not enough for specific themes. Say you want to run a Frozen/cold build. Some tiers of tomes just don't exist for cold, basically forcing you to branch out. I just really wish there were tomes of each theme at every tier so you could follow the fantasy and not have to make some weird hybrid. Minor gripe, but still. 

The base of this game is great. I didn't really mention it in this review but it is. The potential here is wild, and honestly I can't wait to see what they release. I'm really hoping a dev sees this and takes some of it into consideration. (Probably won't happen, but eh.)

Edit: yeah performance is terrible. The first co-op match after posting this, constant desyncs which bricked the game. Infinite AI taking their turn. Bugs man. bugs.

Edit#2: They released hotfixes for the game. Literally made the game worse. Did 1 game with a friend in co-op only to crash 20+ times. Actually unplayable. If they manage to fix these performance issues I'll change it back to yes, but as of now it's not playable.",1684908768,1685356055,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So basically this is Planetfall, but in a fantasy setting. However, there are some changes. A key one, which I do not like, is that now you are limited to only have 3 armies join you in combat. On its own, that's not really an issue, but it is an issue when you meet an AI with 7-9 stacks of armies. You wipe out a few, then need to reposition or else the wrong armies will enter combat. It can be a bit annoying and especially if you need to fight multiple manual battles.

Also it is less customizable than Planetfall. There you had mods to upgrade your troops. In Age of Wonders 4 you just cast spells and they will affect all units of a certain type. I would like to have seen a similar system as the modding system in Age of Wonders IV. Maybe with magical artifacts instead of mods.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I have to say I am very impressed by Age of Wonders 4.  Lets start with the basics - the graphics fit the universe so perfectly.  Seeing my how my race evolves and improves throughout a game is great and really makes me feel like I am guiding my race.  Sound effects get the job done.

The city building and management aspect isn't too bad.  As with most others, I would love to build a ton of cities, but I am fine with the amount the game gives.  I always try to plan out what I build in cities, but as with most games like this, I just start to spam whatever buildings just to get something built.  Or, have a governor do it.  But that never seemed to work very well.

I honestly can't speak much to the battles.  I was interested in the city building and territory control, so I let battles auto-resolve.  I feel half of the time I would be stuck in battles and I just didn't want to deal with it.  Though I ensured I built a proper army before doing so.  In my opinion, this game can be played without managing any of the battles, which I really like.

I love how short the games can be.  With clear, precise objectives, it ensures games do not drag on too long.  Most games like this I play one game for dozens of hours and never finish it.  With Age of Wonders 4 I have finished multiple games.  Even the games I lost I enjoyed!

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Problem with the game is that pacifism can't win a game.  There are non-war winning conditions, but they are hard to achieve.  I once tried to get some sort of magic victory and the moment the countdown started on it multiple leaders declared war on me.  I save-scummed, didn't do that, and just went for a point victory instead.  In turn, I was going for a point victory while an AI was going for a magic victory.  I had to start a war and stop them from winning so I could try to win.  So in the end, war is almost always needed.

Content is lacking in my opinion.  While there are multiple choices when it comes to races, talents, gear, etc., there really are only five or so types of backgrounds to pick form.  Do I want to be dark or light?  Horde or magic users?  It's all good, but there needs to be more variety in the background for the races.  I am willing to bet that'll come in DLC.

The spell system isn't too bad, but it isn't great either.  I wish when selecting certain research that it locks other research out or limits what else you can research.  Eventually I was just clicking whatever research once I was hitting end-game.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I'm keeping it installed to jump back into when I want to play a city management/expansion type of game.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

I can sit and play this game for a few hours until I get to a certain point where everybody is denouncing everybody else, seeds are being build by half the other Godir, and your race transformations make almost every battle an auto-resolve. Once it gets to that point it becomes a lot less satisfying. There are really only a couple ways to achieve victory with multiple different play-styles. The Affinities idea is a really good one, but it doesn't really make a difference if you go for a Growth/Chaos/Order kind of win because in the end all you end up having to do is build a few districts and defend them with your (probably) overpowered armies. 

Once again, I really enjoy this game up to a certain point. I really hope they are able to implement new more interesting win conditions which are more geared toward specific affinity paths, or at least figure out a way to make the victory conditions more enjoyable to pursue. 

Also this is just my own personal experience with the game.........I just don't really find myself ever utilizing the underground at all. I don't know if that's just me, but it seems to be a large part of the game which is just optional and doesn't have a huge impact on any of the gameplay besides splitting the map. I just don't get the underground part so every custom map i make i waste a space on Small Underground.

Down below ive listed several reasons i believe the devs need to fix in order to make every aspect of this game enjoyable for everyone. 

-Contras: 

-The Multiplayer mode is plagued by constant crashes and desyncs.
-If you or another human player enters a battle and you have the setting ""always watch manual battles"" enabled there is a chance your game crashes and desyncs
    - if a desync in this stage occurs it renders the entire match for everyone unplayable since no other actions can be 
       quede even after relogging and loading
-simultaneous turns in multiplayer is a crash and desync waiting to happen
      - if a player enters a battle in simultaneous turns while another player has a pop up action it renders the match 
        unplayable for everyone
-The Ai is heavily unbalanced in all directions
-The Ai is always Bias`ed against the player
-The Ai is able to capture your Outposts without having to declare war, however if you so choose to re-take said outpost you have to declare war.
- on some difficulty settings the Ai will simply steam roll you on turn 15 to 20 leaving you with no chance to defend yourself since the AI has a massive economy and production buff 
-The Maps and start locations need to be adjusted, in some games youll have no rare recources and in another game your Capital will be plastered full of em.
-Your first ""Free City"" is way to close to your Capital, often times leaving you with no recources and the issue that you cant build certain buildings in your city since your missing mentioned recources.
-Between round 45 to 55 the game will adjust the Hostile Ai on the map immeadeatly converting their units to higher tier ones or simply adding t5 and higher units leaving you no chance of defeating them since most players at that time are stuck on t3 or t4 units
-Some Tomes of magic are entirely obsolete while others are way to overpowered.
   -F.E Necromancy and other Dark Spell Books are way to weak or Useless 
   -Necromancy spells can be strong if you can spam them, that wont be possible tho since you need a special resouce for 
    them that you can only slowly get
   -On the other hand Astral magic (Conjuring and lightning) and Holy magic are way to strong, having mass damaging 
     spells, Buffs, Heals and revives
-Playing your Race with a Wizard King instead of a Champion gives you a major disadvantage 
-Some early game quests that the AI gives you are unbeatable since they can spawn t4 units or an army of t3/t2 units

It is unfortunate that the crashing was caused by default 3D settings in the Nvidia Control Panel.  It is unfortunate that the game cannot handle default NVIDIA settings which causes crashing on the current build of the game.  Hopefully the developers look at these reviews to know this is something they should look at because I am sure there are alot of gamers out there that use default graphics card settings and do not research optimzed settings.  For reference, I am using an NVIDIA Geforce 3090 FE. I know mine were currently default because I had rebuilt my computer recently and had not gotten around to reinstating my optimized settings.  

So, I changed my review to positive since I can play the game now with no crashes.  Since I saw others had issues with crashing and none of the web pages or YouTube videos I found online helped at all (unfortunate click bait it seems), in fact they were not helpful at all such as ""ensure your video card drivers are up to date"".

So, I hope this helps others by providing the Nvidia 3D settings I changed.  Please see below.

-----------------------------------

Like others have said in their reviews. This game crashes too often. There is alot to learn in this game where the tooltips are welcome, but I am still on the first map where it is an annoyance that it keeps crashing and putting up a popup to send a crash log to the developers. Of course they have a disclaimer that the report could contain personal information and you have to agree to send it. No thanks, I will not be sending any reports. This is ridiculous to pay $40 for a game and you cannot even finish the first map without it crashing every 15 minutes where you repeat the same turn over and over. my friend suggested this game to me and he even got 100% achievements where he said it did not crash for him at all. I dont get it at all and cannot recommend this game to anyone where I cannot even return it now because I am passed the 2 hour window for a refund from steam.

I compared the game to HOMM3. What makes HOMM3 a relevant game even today is the sheer enthusiasm by the community. Granted, it's not a big community, but being able to inspire the birth of such a community alone is a mark of great game. I see the same for this game, on both Paradox forums, Steam forums and the discords made for the game. Just look at the steam workshop and Nexus mods. Insane community support, and the Chinese modders are also firing their digital bows from the top of the great wall into the modding space. If Total War 3 Kingdoms is still alive and kicking because of its community today, even with the lack of updates, AOW4 has a bright future if Paradox decides to invest greatly into this title.

Is the gameplay repetitive? Not really. It's emergent. Each game is its own story and you can customise your ruler as if it's an MMO. Spell tomes are free to choose from and the only limiting factor is their requirements and the fact you can only choose 1 Tier V tome each game. It's a giant fantasy 4X sandbox for you to build and fight semi-decent AI and roleplay to a reasonable degree. 

Is it difficult? Well, Normal is pretty manageable once you learn how to play and balance the game according to its tempo. The main resources - Gold, Mana, Draft and Research need to be prioritized at different stages of the game. Once you figure this balance, it's going to be a lot of fun since you don't have to constantly deal with shortages between things you want to do v.s. things you need to do now to prevent yourself from losing the game. 

If you're troubled by story realms and its mechanics, you should look up some of the excellent strategies on youtube to enhance your gameplay experience. There's so much support and content around the game, similar to the Pathfinder series of games, and it's not hard to find at all. 

Multiplayer needs more polish, granted. Out of Sync issues is still pretty much a thing, but only crops up occasionally at this point of time. I have played through over 40 different campaigns, mostly with custom rulers and I'm currently exploring the mods of Steam Workshop. It's an amazing experience and worth the price tag. Invest in it if you're looking for several hours of fun and exploration, with little time pressure given that it's a turn-based game.",1685263867,1685263867,True,2,1,0.515370726585388184,0,True,False,False

The Good:

Really an AAA title, smooth, colorful, well rounded, well made. If I rate it bad, it is almost a 6/10.

The Bad:

I could not help a feeling of shallowness. If you ever played Hearts Of Iron III and then IV, you know what I mean. It is too polished, too slick, too much for the greater masses. It sure has some depth, but it could not engage me like Total War Warhammer, Europe Universalis or Hearts of Iron III. It feels like a great popsong remade to reach hundreds of millions. And like Mac Donalds hamburgers, if something needs to satify millions it cannot be culinary anymore.

Also the narrative campaign lasts only 5 maps, after which you only can do individual maps or procedurelly genereted ones.

The achievements are very doable though, so if you are into those, you might like this. I didn't bother to get all, but it can really be done.

I just should not have bought this. It is for the more casual strategy fan. I like my strategy games to have more depth, more immersion, and more complexity. But that is just a matter of taste.",1685225327,1685225327,False,5,0,0.512372612953186035,0,True,False,False

Even compared to another paradox game, Stellaris, which I always considered to be hugely complicated, this game is frustratingly complicated and yet way too simplified.

What I mean is that there's a mind boggling amount of complexity in the game but a lot of it doesn't really seem to make any non-cosmetic differences to how you play. I tried 3 different custom races, mixing all kinds of different societies and magic. The races all looked completely different and had different RPG backgrounds but they all seemed to play the same way. I dealt with most fights via auto-battle so the different spell options I was researching really didn't make any impact on me and they mostly felt like standard +1, +2, buffs.
I keep mentally comparing the game to Warcraft 3 where every faction had a unique playstyle. Maybe these new factions do too but you couldn't prove it by me.

I was expecting more of a warcraft-esque tactics game but Age of Wonders feels more like an attempt to create a fantasy based Civilization game. The game feels too shallow to be a good civilization type game but  too deep and unfocused to be a good warcraft-esque game.

The big selling point of the game is the sheer amount of different factions you can create and a lot of these are genuinely interesting. Feel free to create noble orc paladins or brilliant mage dwarves or brutish barbarian hobbits. You can lead your people to embrace undeath or demonic transformation or a number of other kinds of transcendence. Why shouldn't holy orc angels be a thing? You can mix all of this up and that is genuinely cool. But if all the different races you create feel like they play pretty much the same, what's the point?


Edit:
I kept playing and I discovered that even though the game presents using auto-battle as the standard operation, even on easy it delivers substandard results. All of the tactical strategy is done inside individual battles that can be done manually.

Quick story - For a gaff, I attempted to create the Crimson Demons from Konosuba as my faction for a scenario. For those of you who have at one point experienced the life-altering touch of grass, that's an anime. Particularly it's one that a responsible person ought not draw influence from.

Not only did the creation tools allow for this pretty well (Mostly Chaos and Astral tomes. No Devastation though. That's joke magic.), it actually turned out to be a viable faction and now Archmage and Master Sandwhich Shop Greeter Julius graces my Pantheon. For this reason I cannot recommend Age of Wonders 4.

Reviewed primarily from the single player perspective.

[h3]Wonderful:[/h3]
 - Endless expression via tomes, cultures, traits and visual options. Tons of systems to explore.
 - Random events and shuffled techs keep games dynamic.
 - Highly engaging tactical combat (initially . . .)
 - Flexible automation tools that allow you to offload a lot onto the AI so you can focus on the game elements you enjoy.
 - It's got that ""one more turn"" secret sauce.

[h3]Blunderful:[/h3]
 - Unstable multiplayer. Expect desyncs and reloads.
 - Tactical battles get overwhelming at full scale. 
 - In game tutorials aren't enough. Take some time to study how provinces and grievances work.

[h3]Recommend To:[/h3]
 - 4x fans with a sense of humor.
 - Anyone whose favorite part of RPGs is character creation.
 - Anyone who played an Endless 4x game (Endless Space, Endless Legend) and thought to themselves ""I wish this had more mechanics.""
 - Anyone reading this while a youtube tutorial is playing in the background.

[h3]Alternatively Suggest:[/h3]
[b]Songs of Conquest[/b] - A game closer to Heroes of Might and Magic than a classic 4x, but I feel it captures a lot of the spirit of AoW4 in a more condensed and cheaper package. You lose the robust faction creator but gain a magic system that fosters creative and tactical thinking. Check it out if you've always felt that crunch was a barrior of entry for these types of games.

What I like:
- Creating your own race with the option to make the leader a Champion or Wizard King. Some of the options are pretty cool and some are just bland. Right now there are 10 races to choose from and build. Paradox already has expansions on the way that will add more. Dragons being the next I believe. The idea of creating a race with a Dragon Overlord sounds cool.
- Leveling and equipping your hero's. I like being able to choose the path I want a particular hero to take, Whether caster, range, or melee. The mount options you find are pretty cool. Some of the equipment is pretty lame so far, i keep finding the same things over and over. Stupid Sacred Orbs and Demoralizing Masks...
- The Underground area is pretty unique. Kinda makes the world maps seem much larger. Also can give a race a uniqueness like if you want to create an underground race.
- Empire Development seems so far to be pretty good. I do like how they are all different and can certainly see some OP combinations for later in your game play.
- The different Aspect tomes, 6 so far. I like how they are different from each other. I just wish there were more Aspects but I believe I read Paradox will be introducing more.
- The spells that change your race. For example Angelize, SuperGrowth, Gaias Chosen.. really like how they change the look of your race or even the races that end up in your empire if you choose. 

What I find lacking:
- The quests get old fast, I think I have seen every one of them already. Doesn't seem to be that many yet, I am sure they will add more... hopefully
- The Ancient Wonders are kind of lame. They to suffer from the repetitiveness of the quests. Not many different ones out there.
- The Magic Material, I like the idea, just wish there was more out there and different effects.
- Pantheon unlocks are disappointing. I've already unlocked everything and wish there were some different options for SP and MP. Like I would love to have some different cosmetics and race building options made available. They can even make SP and MP separate so that SP can have some OP options.
- Victory conditions... Military, Expansion, Magic, and Score. Pretty basic but the AI seems to get to the Magic victory quite fast. Unless you create your own map and turn that victory off, it seems that your in a race to learn all the Aspect tomes to get to Tome V and cast the victory spell first. Seems to me all the AI does in concentrate on that victory. 

These are just my current opinions. Things will most likely change and  with so much potential for growth. I just cant help to give it my thumbs up. It can get old for some players fast, but I think those who stick with it and tell Paradox what they want added can be done by them or even Modders.",1685201850,1685201850,True,0,0,0.479041904211044312,0,True,False,False

This game is a must-have, no ifs, ands, or buts - If you love 4X, DnD, Fantasy, Strategy, etc - get it, cherish it.
Even if you aren't, you may still find some serious things to love about this one!

This has everything a 4X strategy game lover could want, and as someone coming over from only playing Civ, it is a flawless entry-point to get into a new series. It's beautifully simple to understand, but the complexity is there for those that want to optimize their strategies. The turns are organic and it never feels like you are trapped in a cycle of clicking next turn after next turn, and the AI, while dumb at times like most are, can be fairly reactive to how you do things, despite their wanting to kill you 99.9% of the time.

The fantasy aspect is captured perfectly, and if you like DnD you'll be familiar and will find some enjoyment out of the custom realm designer & faction designers, with the right mods it can seriously take that to the next level (we'll talk about that in a bit). You have every way to customize your people to fit how you want them to be, and every option & knob you could want to flip to make them different. The things you go up against each have their resistances and strengths, and you can completely change the makeup of your people to take advantage of those over the course of the game. 

- It's as fluid as you want it to be, but still solid enough to make a perfect foundation. 

The modding, like all paradox games is on another level, its only been a month and the workshop has exploded with tons of mods. I haven't had the time to check them all out (nor play the game as much as I'd like to) but it has a lot in there for every type of player. And if Victoria 3 was anything to go by, making mods can be done by pretty much anyone with the basic skills.

One of the things this game does so extremely well I need to take note, is the game itself. You can be a complete strategy noob, or a thousand hours deep into a game from 20 years ago, and still have an extremely fun time in the game. Its remarkably easy to pick up (even as someone with accessibility needs) but has an impressive amount of skill waiting for the right player to unlock it. I never felt outclassed by my needs, nor did I feel like I'd be limited in the skills I could learn from this game. And there's so many ways to play it that there is no right way, you adapt to how you play, as much as you adapt to the environment. And in realms where the world evolves (recommend it btw), that adaption becomes striking as you NEED to be ready for the unexpected.

- It has the right amount of tension where it needs it, but you never feel like the limiting factor is your own skill, or your own understanding of the game

This is a very VERY good game, and its very worth getting, its a must have for fantasy lovers, dnd players & strategy game lovers alike. And its quite rare that we get a perfect game anymore so I'm going to cherish this - this might replace Civ V as my go to ""I need to kill a few days"" strategy game.

The only problem I have found with it is some lag & issues when it comes to streaming it, however I'm almost certain this has to do with my system, and is not a general thing you should experience.

..ok a bit of un update. so i skipped mission 3 and moved on to 4. as you can tell by the time played, moment-to-moment 4x gameplay is actually not bad, if not entirely balanced. played mission 4 for quite a while, only to discover that one of its quests bugged out because i captured some free city too early and it's now unwinnable through quests (as it's supposed to). the suggested solution is to ""restart the mission and not do that"". hmm, no. so that's two effed up missions in a row.",1684753524,1685186538,False,7,1,0.556357085704803467,0,True,False,False

I did put roughly 700 hours into AoW3, and are quite familiar with these kinda games.

The devs did a good job with the art, lore and the way the game is buildt. They DID manage to bring back the essence and ""wonder"" of this series. Thank you for that, from the bottom of my heart!
However... There are some elements that they really should fix, or else i think they will experience a massive drop in players.

1: The idea that everything should be customizabe, no matter race, aligment, playstyle and so on IS a good idea. But it is counterproductive and is in fact making the game less replayable. After 3-5 playthrough's you have seen it all and just pick a race for it's looks, as they have no racial traits that defines a playstyle. There is something exciting starting a fresh game with a new race that is very different from the former game one have played.

2: Love the Tomes, but choosing a certain tometype should restrict other types of tomes. Now i end up with holy angelized demontainted shadow plant-Goblins. It is just to much, and in late game it gets boring very quickly. As well as mentioned, every game it is the same. Yes, it is a choise to cast the spells and transform my race, but missing out a bunch of stats, resistances, damage multiplayers and so forth is something very few players would choose.

3: The AI'players is rarely a threat as that usually turtle in. Which makes lategame tedious and repetative. Everyone rush the victory conditions, and no AI does anything to stop a AI\Player in reaching it.

4: Max lvl on units should be higher, and to my opinion, do it like you did it in AoW3. There you could keep on lvling units indefinitely. Thou after reaching max rank, they only got like 2 HP for each additional level. But this makes it worth it to really take good care of your troops, and that you do want to keep on leveling your units to make them slowly stronger over time. When they stop getting exp it feels boring.

When all this is said, keep up the good work. I am looking forward to the expansions, and to follow the game forward as it develops. *Hearts*",1685131553,1685131553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend playing some of the ""Story"" realms first. They provide great situations that help acclimate you to the controls and strategies of the game. I also am thoroughly enjoying the story as well. 

I love that former heroes can come back to aid in other games, and love how different each magical tome is and what it can offer. 

I've had First Elves that were deeply tied to animals, Halflings with a strong connection to earth creatures and healing, and dark Orcs that relied on necromancy and the undead. So many great situations, tomes, abilities, and races which can really make each play-through feel unique.

[b] PRO:[/b]
- The narration is wonderful.
- The character creator and race creator are wonderful and varied features that really let you play in quite a versatile way.
- I love all the little references to Dungeons and Dragons, like Balors turning up, 'Phase Beasts' and their displacement ability. It's full of fun and cute little nods.

[b] CON:[/b]
- The menus, UI elements and tabs were super hard to keep track of. I am somewhat new to this sort of game, but a game's job is to make playing it as intuitive as possible. I had very little idea what the heck anything was or what things did. The icons and symbols meant very little and did nothing for game-play transparency.
- The game-play is eye-wateringly slow. You're either waiting for units to build for several turns, or your'e waiting for the enemy to take half an hour to obliterate your forces. I found myself usually leaving the room during battles waiting for a chance to actually play the game.
- Gathering resources, managing resources, nothing really seemed to stop me from being constantly either broke or in debt in every single resource. It's hard to feel like a hero or wizard king when all of the advantages, upgrades and powers that make you feel like your achieving things require you to wait 15 rounds to gather enough to right click a button.
- All of the fun narrative choices also cost resources which you don't have enough of to expend, so your story is cut in half as you often just have to 'walk away' from potentially interesting story beats.
- The enemy AI is really brutal, but not in a fun Elden Ring sort of way, more in a cheap unavoidable death mechanic kind of way.
- It crashes ALL the time. ALL the time.

[b] TLDR:[/b] I rage quit this game way too many times to let the positives of 'Oh cool I can make an awesome vampire queen' outweigh the fact that I was just not at all having fun playing this game.

It is much quicker than your standard 4X game meaning a game can be completed in as little as two hours.

A couple of examples from my last game. 

AI dog piles on each other to forward settle my new city, this leads to the AI fighting each other over diminished cities while I just watch dumb founded. There is plenty of space for competitive cities in the area but nope just constant war for nothing. 

AI declares war on me, sends it's ruler and some elite units to back cap a newly found city far far from the front. I wipe out it's main forces because no leader and raze two cities before they finally show up to my new city with a pop of three, sieging it down in two turns before I can reinforce, but I manage to kill all but the hero unit. City is released as a vassal, instantly gets full stack of Tier III units at champion rank and a hero, this is the strongest army on the map, I cannot build these units yet and if I tired to re-take it my entire army would be wiped out before I could even kill two. AI Hero proceeds to just sit next to new vassal while sack it's capitol, this is such great gameplay. 

I could go on about the things I like and yada yada but at the end of the day everything I like about the mechanics goes right out the window when the AI just AIs. I've tried playing on easy so I can try to ignore the more egregious AI non-sense and also because my first game of normal led to me getting wiped out by a city state turn six because the devs forgot that starting the player with a level 1 hero than giving a hostile City State four tiles from your start, two level 7 heroes means your full stack can get wiped out when the city state sends two armies of two... separately.",1685045786,1685045786,False,14,1,0.569497764110565186,0,True,False,False

Auto-resolved battles are another example of that, where easily won manual battles are lost when automated because the AI decides that archers should be placed up front, and doesn't know how to utilise spells.

Its biggest selling point was the great customisation, but it literally takes just a few minutes to customise your race and realm, there really isn't that much of a depth to it. 

There are no map size options, you are forced to choose more factions if you want a bigger map, making chill 1v1s on a huge map impossible.

This game retains many of the mechanics that made the first game so fun, while improving on the existing formula with new, creative and fun mechanics!

What I like:
   1. New mechanic: Race Transformations! you can now cast spells which transform your entire race, while altering their appearance and stats! Multiple race transformations even overlap and you can end up with armies that look completely different from how you started! This is amazing and I absolutely love it :D
   2. Old mechanic: The old combat-phase mechanics are back and they are just as good!
   3. Changed mechanics: The spells and research are now divided to Tomes, which are composed of different tiers and affinities. This allows you to make new and interesting fusions between different types of playstyles, which was very limited in the previous AoW. I like this a lot!

Things that I miss:
   1. Only one thing: The Arcane Forge... The arcane forge was removed from the game, and you can no longer forge your own hero-equipment. I really liked that mechanic in the previous game, so I hope it might be added in a future update or DLC.

The goal here is different from previous instalments as rather than play through the world setting, instead you create your ideal map and then your ideal race. Where previous editions were 4x game with a narrative to play through, this is a 4x game with a narrative to create yourself with highly varied customisation of map and empire.

Some elements are a lil static, there is not a huge amount of variation between armies of any particular race, the variation comes from what magic tomes you choose and how you upgrade your army over time but the basic unit breakdown is pretty consistent no matter what you choose. That said what tome you pick can alter how you play which keeps it fresh. 

 There are some pacing issues and for the power gamer the amount of free choice can make it too easy to min max your stats and thus make the game  feel a lil easy. However for the role player this game is a real treat and cooking up you perfect fantasy world, leader and army is a lot of fun that keeps me coming back for more.

The city management is similar in mechanics to civ 6 but implemented in a much better way, while the combat is still the tactical combat window a la kings bounty. 

Like most modern 4x games it does suffer from limited victory conditions, conquer everyone or time out the score, or magic or settlement the last two are basically the same and involve either researching to max in one tome or annexing enough provinces to build 3 structures that then need to be defended for 15 turns. Making many games devolve into turtle up build you structures and hold out for 15 turns.  Civ Beyond earth suffered from the same kind of static victories. 

It has bugs and can be a lil unstable but nothing completely game breaking yet and so far I'm enjoying every minute of it.    

Overall its very enjoyable and like all 4x games I'm waiting to see what expansions bring, typically a 4x game usually isn't fleshed out till DLC #2-3. The road map has been made and there is more coming out this and next year.

Visually solid, seems like there are alot of systems to master with deep strategy. Unfortunately it's all an illusion and it's actually a very bland uninspired generic 4x once the new car smell is gone. For fans of the series this is way bad they just keep taking this IP down the wrong path and they have lost the magic of what garnered the original fan base. IT was a fun empire management lite turn based tactical combat heavy 4x game, that was the magic that separated it from the likes of CIV or any other 4x game that are pretty much just empire management and growth, in AOW series the tactical battles were the part it did differently and did in a fun way. Well that is all gone(its been going with aow3 but its officially dead now), the tactical battles are a nightmare, convoluted clunky and awkward to the point you don;t even want to try it just hit that auto battle button. Add on to the fact as I said above everything has been watered down generic and become the same same with a different skin the game offers little value. 

Finally the optimization is terrible and the game will desync often, toss in a plethora of bugs, utterly incompetent AI and the final straw the game literally just breaks i mean flat out breaks by turn 70ish when even selecting a spell to research will freeze the game for 30 seconds a pop along with many other basic actions if you are playing multiplayer.

Personally I am giving this a positive review because I had a good time when I played, but I don't think its worth the 50$ because I dont see myself getting 50 hours out of playing it anytime soon.

If you like midmaxing strategy games, then maybe you will fine enough content to get 1$ per hour. Trying to midmax cavalry builds, T1 units, or archer builds can fuel entire playthroughs and keep you interested. But if you don't care for chasing a niche game build the game gets stale by campaign three.

This might seem redundant on a strategy game, saying if you dont like strategizing how to play it wont be worth plenty of hours, but for casual players who like strategy but don't want to get in the weeds this game barely has variation in playstyles to merit multiple playthroughs unless you are grinding out a pantheon score.

* Hero and faction customization is really fun, and allows for some very creative combinations
* When fighting similar power or stronger armies, the tactical battles are really fun and engaging
* Creative and rewarding ""PvE"" mechanics with vassels, quests and wonders

The Bad:
* Once you build up an economic advantage, almost all combat can be auto-resolved
* Win conditions suck. Aside from ""kill everything"" there are only 2 ways two win the game and they both involve the same mechanism of turtling, creating a situation where endgame is very boring

Overall:
I feel like in a year, once the 4(!) DLC packs announced will come out,the game will be significantly more fun. Another basic faction, some more map customization options and most importantly another creative win condition or 2 to incentivize playing a game pass the midgame, and this will be one of the best games ive played.

But hiding the complete experience under a bunch of DLC is a crappy practice which has become an industry practice.
So i don't recommand buying this game any time soon.
Buy it next year with all the DLC's once its on discount.

If you like Magic the Gathering TCG deckbuilding
If you like any tactical game
If you are new to strategy games but love the high fantasy tropes:

This game is a [i]must buy and play.[/i]

I am blown away, I haven't played a videogame in sooooooooo long and felt like I was 10 years old playing my first strategy game for the first time.

This game does everything innovative and does it all [i]right[/i]

You expand your cities in a very intuitive way where city placement and growth as choices feel good and important but not huge headaches.

The combat system feels like a mixture between Endless Legends and Heroes of Might and Magic and [i]chef's kiss[/i] they did it beautifully. 

You create your own High Fantasy empire and it is [i]executed brilliantly[/i], I'm mulling over a long time what I want to play, so many things to try and I can't get enough of it --- it all leads into what you 'Research' in this game.

You research Magical Tomes, NOT Science, the different Magics have their own attribute called affinity. This tells you how much of that magic is influencing your faction and because you can mix and match: It feels like you have lots of funny, cool, or terrifying possibilities to sink your teeth into. It does remind me of thematic magic the gathering deck building and it fits this game soooooo well.

Now is this game perfect? No - but damn it is close, honestly I probably won't ever care to download mods as long as the devs put out new content and fix the bugs - which I will maintain. Is very important.

It had a semi-rocky launch on bugs and it seems to be only multiplayer ones left, I'm waiting to see how fast they can get fixed and how much the devs are interested in this game long term (past their season pass).

I'm interested in this being a permanent upkeep game, in my eyes the game is perfect design wise, give me a longer pantheon tree, more civilization options and more unique map settings.

AoW 4 is too similar to AoW 3 (the prequel?), with some 'upgrades'. There are changes that I like, some I do not. I just feel that AoW 4 is just a re-skin of AoW 3 with some tweaks. Not that I hate it though. ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"" right? I personally do not recommend this is simply because of the price tag. For an 'upgraded' game which I feel has LESS content, I don't think the price is justified. Anyway here's some of my personal take on the game (compared to AoW 3):

me like:
- The diplomacy system. The AI will like/dislike you based on their personality and your actions. I also noticed the AI (your ally) will try to help you if you're under siege. That's cool.
- Limited cities (and heroes). I personally like this system. You can have more than the limit, but will suffer penalties.
- Cities now claim provinces instead of growing borders. I feel like 4x games nowadays uses this system. I have a love/hate relationship with this system, but not in a bad way.
- Tomes (the research/tech tree) provides variety of gameplay.
- Realms (the map). You can customize the realms to your liking, or play a pre-defined realm with interesting settings and scenarios. Even the campaign realms is procedurally generated with a fixed scenario/quests.
- The modding support & community <3
- Cities now founded from outposts. No more settlers. I like this.
- Building and unit queue is now separated. With 'production' resource used for building, and 'draft' system for units. This is nice.

Neutral:
- Auto-resolve is okay. Manual combat is still the best.
- The AI still cheats on higher difficulties, but I'm okay with it I guess.
- The free cities could have more potential. They dont do anything apart from giving you resources. They dont even re-build pillaged provinces. They do occasionally send war parties, but I was hoping maybe we can do more with free cities (like giving them commands or request help from them idk)
- The random events

me no like:
- The price
- buggy and crashed a lot
- The races are no longer unique. Just for aesthetics.
- The units are mostly the same from AoW 3. I wish there's more variety of units for the base game.
- The ancient wonders. They just have different names but give the same bonus :(
- I wish we could release captured ancient wonders. This is annoying if I have an ancient wonder in my allies' domain and we both can't do anything about it.
- The map is... too small? Even on normal distance with 7 players, everyone basically still start next to each other and the map feels so limited
- Underground domain almost never have any action. And please for the love of God allow the AI to excavate. I have seen a free city got stuck with just 2 provinces and never got out because they can't excavate for whatever reason.
- I kind feel the water gameplay has no love. Maybe its just me.

TLDR:
love the game would recommend it, but hate the price (because i feel content is lacking & too similar to previous title). thank you.",1684902370,1684902370,False,2,0,0.518750011920928955,0,True,False,False

What do I like? The game is visually pretty, with a clean and simple interface and relatively straight-forward game mechanics. 

What are my gripes?
The game needs better settings customisation. Deeper control over AI advantages (gold, mana, starting cities), map size and distances, aggression. 

In A0W4, every race is basically a “skin” with all traits customizable. This has tended to mean that I play most of my games the same way (min-maxing and choosing among my favorite skills and perks). Of course, if you wish to role play you can force yourself to play according to whatever fantasy tropes exist. I just don’t seem to have that discipline.

Initially, I found myself skipping the tactical combats. These involve many units and for me they can be over-long and tedious. To be fair, I use auto battles in other games that I quite enjoy (Master of Orion remake comes to mind). But I guess the issue is that I am generally underwhelmed with the strategic side of AoW4.  Strategically, A0W4 game seems to devolve to marching 3-6 god stacks toward your opponent or turtling to rush toward a magic victory and while the AI ineptly does nothing to block your countdown to victory. 
On the world map, the AI is not particularly aggressive. The AI does seem to benefit from certain advantages, but it is generally very conservative with its strategic use of armies. It does not seem to recognize when you are close to entering the endgame and does not take efforts to forestall this. As well I could largely leave my cities with minimal garrisons. 

The units are reasonably diverse and if I enjoyed tactical battles more, this would be a bigger plus for me. I do enjoy playing the heroes (one of the best parts of Master of Magic in the past as well) and like customizing their builds. However, unlike good old Master of Magic, you cannot smith magical items. (You can only hope to win them in battles or buy them off other races. As well, there are a relatively limited number of items one can buy.)  Heroes are a dime a dozen and can easily be re-specced or replaced. I guess this is a plus, but I found that I tend towards the same build every time. 

In the end the game is ok, and perhaps with time and further play it will continue to grow on me...

I have played one game or another in this series since the first game came out in 1999.

Unfortunately times have changed. The old school programmers and designers who thoughtfully put together a fantasy game that tried very hard to be true to the acceptable rules and norms of fantasy are gone, and instead we have ones who are inundated with modern woke sensibilities and everything that entails.

Melkor may have captured Elves and used dark magic to breed them with other foul creatures to produce twisted and evil Orcs with a  desire to destroy beauty and good weaved into the fiber of their being, and a drive to plunge the world into darkness woven into their dna, but in AOW they can be good and pure and walk with nature and love unicorns and butterflies!
You know because nothing is ever truly evil, not even cannibal rats who want to eat the flesh off of live creature of every race in the game.

It mirrors what is happening societally: ""He/she isn't evil or bad, they are just a ""minor attracted person"".
Anything goes and nothing it is to be judged. There is no evil, just different choice.

There are many other examples and problems with this game that makes it impossible to immerse yourself in and consistent way with fantasy lore. 

The worst is the gamers who are playing the game. They attack anyone who doesn't fall in line with their opinion on these matter, the same way these types do in real life for the same reason. Bullying is the only tool they have since the have lost logic and reason and cannot justify reasonably their position or opinion.

The game lacks a number of features (e.g. unit customization, map sizes) that I enjoyed in other similar fantasy 4X titles and at least initially feels a lot more streamlined. The story content (in random events, wonders, the story missions themselves) is also very disappointing. Well-written but meaningless. Admittedly it's hard to have meaning with the world parameters they've chosen. The AI is terribad and multiplayer barely functions. 

And yet... And yet... I have been playing for 131 hours.

The tome and affinity and race creation systems allow for a lot of interesting combinations. It's interesting combining the racial, societal, and cultural traits + units, which you can't change after game start, with different paths through the tomes and the affinity tree. In theory you can unlock almost all of the latter, but it's usually not worth doing so and the game does kinda fall apart at the seams if you do (too many spells, too many units, no ability to filter, very limited sorting). So it's more about finding the fastest way to combos that complement your static (race/society/culture) build. Idk. It's fun. It's interesting. It's kept me entertained despite its many shortcomings.

I will say though, be careful of the mods that remove the game's limitations (e.g. on map size, city population). They are there for a reason, and you will lose what little balance is left after near-complete tome selection freedom. Map size in particular, while it comes with lots of headaches--particularly in regard to the AI settling everywhere before you have a chance to--because there's very little ability to speed up armies on the world map (Forced March is too brutal), larger maps are pure pain, at least until you complete the Astral Affinity tree in the late game.

The visual transformations from the various enchantments and transformations are also very neat. Seeing demonic goblins or angelic orcs for the first time is pretty amazing and helps make this game not look like traditional bog-standard fantasy settings.

I do have two big issues with the game right now : 

1) The AI is absolutely terrible both on the world map (even by 4X game standards) and in battles and the devs compensated it with absolutely massive economic bonuses, even on Normal difficulty. The end result isn't really a more threatening AI but one that can endlessly throw weak armies at you. Weak armies that you have to fight manually every time because auto-resolve uses the same terrible battle AI and will suicide your most expensive unit for no reason. This makes the lategame (already a common weakness of the genre) an absolute slog if the AI decides to attack you (sometimes it doesn't and just lets you win instead).

2) For a game billing itself as being all about creation and customization, the heroes are pretty disappointing. All heroes get basically the same skills and stats, including the ""signature skills"" which are badly named because they're actually very generic skills that you choose from a random selection at certain level thresholds. So two heroes using two-handed melee weapons can and most likely will end up with basically the exact same skills. This is very disappointing after having played Planetfall where a Promethean Amazon and a Celestial Assembly heroes can have very different skillsets even if they were using the same types of weapons.

Also the whole diplomacy system basically doesn't work (AI gets a reputation penalty because it ""needs more friends"", yeah right) and the denounce mechanic makes those supposed god-like wizards sound like middle-schoolers (""X insulted my empire ! He is not to be trusted!""), but that was the same in Planetfall so unfortunately not a surprise. This is definitely more oriented towards war and combat than a traditional 4X, not to the same extent as something like Gladius but still more than Civ.

It has several grand ideas that are just poorly executed with relics of poor design of 4x games of the past

There's poorly explained and presented mechanics. Endless helper tutorials pop up throughout the game, but are a slog to get through. Unfortunately, they're required because good luck navigating the bad UI for certain features.

The tech tree using tomes of magic is great thematically, but implementation-wise there's a lot of illusion of choice. There are very obvious poor picks that don't make the gameplay better or more interesting, or improve your Empire any a very tangible way. It's a feature that should increase replayability, but winds up hurting it instead.

The strategic combat is great in theory, but ponderous in practice. You'll find yourself auto-battling more often than not after a few bouts, and grumbling to yourself when your trash AI loses units in battles that should easily be flawless victories.

They also went the old lazy developer route of having cheating AI enemies. They probably would have had more time for good AI that could play competently if they didn't waste time implementing useless stuff in the tech trees.

Plays like a mix between ""Civ 4 Fall From Heaven II mod"" and ""Warlock - Master of the arcane"" with the unit combat system of ""Endless, Legends"". Its shinier than all those, but with a less coherent sense of its own aesthetics, a mess of a UI design, and more poorly optimized (excepting maybe FFH2). Cool in concept, but disappointing in execution.

Changing forms is a cool innovation that's definitely a lot of fun, but nothing else felt notable.  Worth playing if you don't want to spend a day tracing mod genealogies for FFH, or just really like army combat, but honestly, go play one of the aforementioned games and save yourself 50$ bucks.

Edit: 

**Devs are specifically blocking mods that touch their engagement mechanics. This is extremely unethical and disappointing imo.

After further play a lot of the game just appears to be broken. Ai has no idea what to do and sits its armies on the other side of the map as i conquer its capital on the ""hardest"" difficulty. ""incite rebellion"" spell creates a mob camp on an enemies city province, but then the spawned armies just belong to that city and help it fight against me? A unit says it has 12 mana upkeep, but when disbanded my income only goes up by 4. Game is an absolute unbalanced mess even when everything is working. Tried to give it a second chance with another play through but at best it just feels like a way to waste time. Mod blocking reveals this is built under the cynical paradigm of gatcha style engagement traps. Waste of $ in hindsight.

Took a little from Planetfall, with districts instead of just tiles to build on, which I like. Streamlines the process. Not entirely sold on the art style, but, that is a personal preference. Not as clear as the old art. Also, I miss the little story excerpts you see from the older games when you examine units. I get the story setup in this game kind of makes it nonsensical due to all these realms being different. Missing some ease of use too, as you have to do more work to see what upgrades your city and units have.

All in all, it is pretty great. No crashes on my laptop, and the customization is huge. You can start with many different traits and cultures but can easily morph into others as the game goes. Want dark culture but love the production of a materium culture? Just start as an industrial faction and then get the tomes of the dark. Now my industrious humans are great at production and gets undead perks. It really is a daunting endeavour, but the information is given out in a clear, easy to understand way, that doesn't bog you down.

This game was fun. Not among my favorite games of all time even within its genre, but I am glad that I gave it a chance, as it does offer up a flavorful approach to fantasy strategy games by focusing on developing a civilization and dominating the world through your own approach. 
The reason I say “with some limits” is because when I started out, I wanted to create a people based on the wolf-elves from ‘Elf Quest’, but none of the societies really fit that tribal forest dweller feel. My second thought was druidic society, but that didn’t really seem to fit either. But there is still a lot of options and adaptability, even if you might not be able to recreate a favorite.
[h2]The Downs, and they aren't important:[/h2]
First, I dislike the combat, but there is a good auto-combat system, and I had to get used to the fact that for the mid to late game, you are supposed to move around with three armies instead of one due to the way they handle units with just 6 per army and each side calling in two more within a zone from the combat center.
Secondly, I dislike the aesthetic of the godir/mage lords. Especially their headwear have that weird sci-fi fantasy look, that just looks odd to me. But you can see if it is for you based on whether or not you think the character on the cover looks good.
Lastly, didn’t connect with the world, characters or story. The only map, where I did was the one with [spoiler]the godir drowning her experiments[/spoiler], but the game doesn’t really focus on telling a connected story either, as each map is its own thing, where you create your own faction/main hero or pick a premade one. So it doesn’t really focus on telling a bigger story in its single player like games such as Heroes of Might and Magic does. 
[h2]The Ups, the rest:[/h2]
The ability to customize your people any way you want, from making frostborn kitty fighters, arcane toad-wizards, halflings lead by Gandalf, ‘dark goblins’ lead by The Overlord, or so on, is the games selling point, and it is a good one. As it leads to a lot of variety on a thematic/visual level, and the different society all have a few unique buildings, even if the game has a solid core and not as much variety between the factions, due to it needing to be flexible in other areas.
As someone, who enjoys having ‘manageable achievements’, which still respect my level and time, I must say this game nails it. All achievements are doable at any difficulties, making sure you can play at the difficulty that best suits you, and they are focused around making sure you try almost everything at least once, so you get an incentive to try all of the game.

I still wish Triumph Studios would make a new mainline Overlord game. :P But this game was a decent experience. 😊",1684781273,1684781329,True,35,0,0.72735750675201416,0,True,False,False

Brutal difficulty is challenging but absolutely winnable as the AI still plays by the normal game rules (unlike in the story missions which I'll get to below). The game has a ton of replay value and so many different combinations that I've been perfectly happy replaying custom brutal maps with different setups for well over two weeks now. Multiplayer also seems interesting though I've been holding off on it due to reports of it being buggy as of yet. This brings me to the negatives, which, despite the substantial amount of text below are overall far outweighed by the positives. 
There are however, two complaints about the game which I hope they'll iron out in the future. 

One, the UI can feel quite unresponsive at times, often requiring an additional 'click' to issue a command when you're really not expecting one to be needed. This is particularly a chore when you're manually rotating units after movement in combat so they don't get flanked and you have to click each one twice. Also when you select a skill at the end of the hero bar, the bar will scroll right first and the skill won't get selected, often leading to accidental movement of said hero. There's also quite a few bugs and crashes. The game autosaves every turn so progress is rarely lost but it's annoying when it happens. They're already working on fixing the crashes so hopefully they'll address the UI as well.

Two is the bigger one for me. The story missions are absolute garbage. Some of the custom map modifiers you can add are already quite unfun (a lot of them just add uncontrollable RNG to the game or minimize the variety of units you can encounter) and the story encounters always seem to use the least appealing ones of these. The first two missions are easy but very boring with not much happening until you have enough units to traverse the map with. From the third one on, the AI starts cheating beyond all reason, spewing out an absolutely ungodly amount of units, way WAY WAAAAY more than would be even remotely possible in a normal game. I just lost a map where I killed over 100 units of a certain hero in the space of 6 or so turns and still lost because their capital somehow still had 3 full stacks of tier 3/4 units left along with a bunch of level 10+ heroes. There are gimmicks (special quests) you can use to make this easier but none of it is implemented in a remotely original or enjoyable fashion. If story missions were more like the standard maps but with story elements added to them, they would be infinitely more enjoyable.

Again, above points are annoying but I'm still really enjoying the base game despite them. It's already well worth the money as is and will only get better over time as they iron out these issues (which, given how passionate the studio is about the Age of Wonders series, I fully expect them to do). Definite recommend.

This game provides insane variety and a endless amount of builds and counter plays. This game give you complete creative freedom over how your faction LOOKS and PLAYS. This is not like other games where races follow your stereotypical elves are good at archery and orcs are good at melee. This game allows YOU to choose what your faction is good at and provides endless possibilities.

100% recommend this game and I am a long time fan of strategy games and fantasy games. Anyone saying anything like this game has no variety or everything feels the same have only played this game for maybe and hour or 2 and are butt-hurt that the game doesn't force you to play a certain way based on how you look.

If you are a huge fan of Age of Wonders 3 and Planetfall, as I am, with over a thousand hours played between the two, this game will probably be a huge let down for you, as it has been for me.

Pro: The graphics are amazing.  (so amazing I have to turn my older compy to low setting to play it).

Cons:  I don't want to play it.  60 hours in and I only enjoyed about 20 of them until I realized many dissapointing facts.

The big one to start with is that there is only one size of map.  Every game will be played on the exact dimensions as the last, with some changes to topography.  This limits your imagination and options measureably.  

Although there are ten races to play and many 'tomes' of magic to learn, every race can learn every book and has maybe four racial units?  A shield/sword, javelin skirmimsh, range weapon, stronger shield/sword.  Every other unit comes from your tomes, which any player can learn any one of, so you end up playing against the same units over and over.  Having the same units over and over.

You are limited in so many ways.  They basically took a slam dunk, the two previous games, and limited the huge amount of options down to few.  Unit types, magic item types (very limited choices, you will probably play with exact same mounts/weapons/armor every game), map type and size, you cannot disable the underground as previous games, you can only have three cities unless you extend your cap and get (gasp!) four!  After that you recieve large economic punishments.  You are limited in hero number and type.  You can only have one hero per city you have.  (wont get your second till you get a second city).  If you wish to conquer another city, you must now siege it.  which will take 2-10 turns.  The methods for gaining provinces and enhancing them is different and although interesting not better.

All they had to do was polish the last version of this game.  Throw a graphic upgrade and shit, those many of us who played the previous game would have played on happily.  They seem to have either screwed up, or have decided to make this a multiplayer game in the hopes of making money through 'season passes' or some other bs.  Why would they dumb it all down?  A game that had nearly infinite replayability now seems as if it was too much for them to comprehend so they took all that loveable custimization and made it mcdonalds, every game tastes like every other game, oh this one had pickles.

I was so excited for this game, bought it day it came out.  Planned a week off cuz I thought I'd be down the rabbit hole and ready to play nothing else in 2023.  After a couple days playing, I have no interest in playing it again.  Its dull and unoriginal and basically I feel ripped off, not money wise, but hope wise.  This was it?  We have to wait what?  Five more years for a decent AoW upgrade?  There is a void now where an awesome game in the 4x genre could have been.  The developers and especially whoever ran or oversaw the development should not work in this industry again until they have undergone serious reeducation and perhaps repentance.

Second review I ever wrote.  Could have been golden but yall shit on one of our favorite games.

I am a long time civ player, and I think this is better.
It's less management, and more story.
I love the overarching story of building my own pantheon. The interaction of the free cities is way better than civs city states.
Growing your heros is awesome, and I have alot of fun making my race thematically.

My only complaint is you need a hero to do some of the basic things. It doesn't make alot of since, why can't a regular army clear out an old castle?

As 4x games are fairly complex and this game just launched, there's a fair amount of imbalance in the game atm, with some playstyles being vastly superior to others in terms of strength and effectiveness. So, even though the game appears to have a lot of depth, it's actually quite shallow once you dive into it. It's not that unoptimal strategies can't work, but they do take a lot of extra time and effort compared to the stronger, established strategies. 

But, this is a problem with pretty much all 4x games. As more patches, expansions, and other content is added to the game, it should flesh out nicely. The groundwork is all there, it just needs some tweaks to really shine. If you were to compare say, release Civilization 6 to current Civilization 6, you can see how much a game can improve with a few years of support behind it. 

In short, Age of Wonders 4 is a decent game. But it has the potential to be a GREAT game, a potential that it will no doubt reach with a couple years of balancing, added content, and mods.

I find myself very disappointed with almost every aspect of the game. The strategic AI is terrible, it doesn't seem to know or want to do anything with its armies beyond massing them in huge blobs and waiting for you to attack. It also seems to be playing by a completely different set of rules. I can understand a certain amount of AI cheating, it's a necessity to make these kind of games fun, but you need to at least preserve the illusion that the AI is playing the same game as the player.  Without that illusion, the entire strategic game becomes silly, why undermine the AIs economy or cut off its resources if none of that matters? 


The combat devolves into just massing everything you have into a doom blob instead of a doom stack and inching your way through AI territory as it somehow respawns wave after wave of gradually weaker units. 
The actual tactical combat is a bit of a cluster, as there are so many units with so many different stats that it becomes very hard to know what anything really does. Its much easier, and effective, to just pick a few units you like of the highest tier available and spam those. The AI does a good job with auto combat, and I quickly found myself just letting it resolve most battles which feels like a shame as a lot of effort went into that part of the game.

What really kills it for me though is the lack of differentiation between races. Everything is just a giant, generic mess of fantasy cliches stacked on top of each other with no rhyme or reason. Sometimes too much choice is worse then not enough.  And all that choice in the end doesnt really make much difference, as you wind up using generic units anyway.

Im sure the game will get better, but I really dont want to spend $150 on DLCs to get the game I thought I was getting to begin with, not to mention that some of these design choices may be too deeply entrenched to be changed. It's insane to me that a game like Deity Empires made with probably 1% of the budget does a better job of what this game seems to be trying to do.",1684681813,1684681813,False,6,0,0.500379204750061035,0,True,False,False

TL:DR. If like most people, you haven't played AoW before, then AoW4 is a great place to start. If you are already a convert to AoW, then AoW4 is a worthy successor to earlier AoW games. In my opinion, Triumph and Paradox have devoted an enormous amount of thought and effort to make this a successful mass-market (which AoW has always deserved, but never achieved before) 4x game, and it shows.

Comparing AoW4 to other games I've played (with total hours played).

Is it the best AoW game? No. Planetfall with the expansions (480 hours) is better. But it is the second best - and expansions are coming.
Is it better than Civ? Well, it's better than VI (271 hours) for sure, not as good as V with the expansions (1800 hours). 
Is it better than Humankind (71 hours)? Yes, by a country mile.
Is it too easy? I estimate that difficulty is around one notch(!) lower than AoW3 (950 hours) - normal on AoW4 is around easy on AoW3. But the campaign does ramp fairly hard after the 3rd campaign scenario.
Is it too hard? AoW was always challenging on harder difficulties. In particular the Merlin bonus level in Shadow Magic was notoriously difficult. With AoW, it's not a crime to play on easy.
Is it better than Total War Warhammer(590 hours)? I'm not sure they can be directly compared. Warhammer is very much based on race specific characteristics. In AoW4 literally every race stat is player-selected. This has confused and even annoyed some people, but actually - why not? If you want to role-play as a specific race, there is nothing to stop you.

Is the game perfectly balanced, as all thing should be? 
No! At the moment, some tech ('tome') picks are clearly better than others. Again, this is up to the player. If you want to spam spawnkin and vine prison, and never even try the Shadow tomes, that's up to you. But it can be quite rewarding to test the limits a bit and sample all the game has to offer, even if your build is not 'optimal' in some sense. After all, that's exactly what games that offer a choice of different races and DON'T allow you to mix and match (e.g. Warhammer) provide  - you have to play to the strengths and avoid the weaknesses of each faction. I was recently replaying that hoary old classic Master of Magic (35 hours, plus hundreds from disk) and that's not in the least 'balanced' either. You know what? That's part of the fun.

Is the game loyal to the lore? Yes, in all sorts of ways. For example, the 'vine prison' harks back to a famous AoW2 spell, poison plants, that was very useful for holding up enemies on the world map. And Wizard Towers are back (though sadly not the ingenious magic domains of AoW2). And the odd - very Triumph - clucks croaks and cries that creatures make in battle. The more you know about the series, the more stuff you will see.

Is the game buggy? I had 2 crashes in 74 hours, both in the first 20 hours of play. (Nvidia Geforce 2060, Intel i7*8) so no, not particularly.

There's definitely a huge learning curve, but simply jumping in and playing it really starts to make you realize some things that are hard to explain otherwise.

My first attempt that i straight up abandoned was worse, lol. I tried pillaging with a SINGLE army unit. The enemy rolled up with like five army units- maybe all of the troops were tier 1, but with like three units against my one, I got steamrolled.

as for planetfall there is too much too much
the city management system is useless and too much construction possible
diplomacy could have been a good idea if the AI was up to it and of course not
they have provided for joystick controls .. heresy !!! there is already so much to do to revive the series

I'm a big fan of Age Of Wonders 1,2 and also 3 ( but to a lesser extent ) and I was hoping that this new installment will scratch that turn based strategy / rpg itch. Old games in the series had unique races and offered a completely different experience playing each of them, units had detailed descriptions that offered some interesting insight into their lore / background  and also served as an great way to immerse players further into the world they're trying to conquer, battles were exciting and options for generating random maps were amazing. Currently all the races are just a "" cosmetic skin "", you just select a race and then add traits from a fairly extensive pool of traits to them - basically you can customize orcs to play exactly the same as elves or any other race, there's no difference. While I understand that this can be fun for some people and can offer some dose of replayability and freedom, for me it's a big minus. I loved uniqueness of races in older AOW games, that's what made it so interesting and fun ( each race had a specific playstyle, strengths and weaknesses ). Random map generator is very limited and you cannot increase the size of the map unless you add more AI opponents as well ( which sucks if you want to play a very large map with opponents very far from eachother to have a more relaxing game ). Enemy AI cheats to fake difficulty, hero items mostly suck ( example - wielding a two-hander will disable your mount so your hero will be forced to walk on foot ), places of interests are few and far between ( they don't offer anything interesting apart from some unique buildings if they're in your zone of control and you can only take 1 small party of 6 units to explore them ). In previous AOW installements my favorite thing was to rush all the dungeons and places of interest to loot items and basically build my hero as a one-man army, this is sadly no longer possible.

Those flaws are extremely prevalent currently in the game. The early game is extremely enjoyable with the battles against equally or a bit higher power foes is very well done, aside from a few issues here and there with the battle AI and its priority system(using any summon/mind control and they'll almost always 100% focus on that). There are even some really fun late game battles against wonders where you're forced to fight with one army, potentially limiting your options. 
The issues the game has is in its balance, campaign AI, and the late game. There are incredibly blatantly broken things in the game, which is mostly fine for single player, as you can power fantasy your way through the game and still get a reasonable challenge from marauder battles and wonder battles, but the single player AI is horribly broken. They barely interact with the map other than clearing infestations and the occasional wonder, which is extremely noticeable when you attack their lands and see every single resource node uncleared. They're extremely passive to the point of rarely attacking your base. I think I've been sieged three times total, all in close range maps where I started both at war and within 8 provinces of a brutal difficulty AI. Due to this, they pose almost no threat even when on the highest difficulty since they give you all the time in the world to build up. 
The second major issue is balance, primarily in the broken strategies available. These largely pertain to multiplayer, as using broken nonsense doesn't impact the game as much in singleplayer, but there are certain tome combinations that completely eliminate any form of counterplay. By tome tier 2 you can have 3 full stacks of T1 archers with heroes leading them running seeker arrows(+1 range), high culture for awaken(+1 range and +4 spirit damage), Astral blood(+10% crit EVERY spell cast), and amplified arrows(+4 lightning damage, -2 physical damage, damage bounces to another target in 3 hexes for 30% damage). Throw on another archer enchant tome of roots for an extra 4 blight damage and -2 physical, as well as getting you vine prison to break the AI when you're not fighting the other players, and you've won the game by t2 tomes. 
If you somehow manage to get past that phase of the game, maybe the other player is playing the same thing, and you get to T5 you can run, with good planning, the T4 tome of the golden realm and the T5 tome of the arch mage to have 100% magic crits as well as have your magic crits gild the enemy(basically a stun) with no chance of resisting it. If you get the T3 lightning orb which bounces damage to other enemies as well, and use summon astral reflections, one hero can lock down 9 enemies permanently with no real counterplay. Even without the lightning orb, lightning evoker allows the same thing every 3 turns, as well as your normal attacks still allowing you to stun one enemy each.
My issues with the late game stem from the fact that turns go from extremely quick, to taking ages to rollover as well as calculate combats. Even if you have 18v18 combats in the early game, they're rather quick to auto resolve through, but in the late game, the time for those to complete is incredibly long, and turn times also quickly extend to absurd degrees. Taking 15 turns for a magic or expansion victory feels like it takes as long as all the turns it took to get to that point, despite the AI never making an effort to move their troops your way to stop it. 
Overall the game needs some large balance overhauls for multiplayer or some serious improvements to the singleplayer AI for this to be a recommendation from me.",1684613482,1684613482,False,3,0,0.513067364692687988,0,True,False,False

If you buy this game, you won't be playing anything else for a while! After 200+ hours and 100% in achievements, here are some of my thoughts:

Pros:
Maps:
There's so much detail and it's vibrant without being cartoony. Probably the best looking maps in any 4x strategy game at the moment. You can customise your map and it's features before you start the game and there's enough options to make each map have a completely different vibe. What's better is the map can be customised during a playthrough in a non immersion-breaking way with various terraforming spells.

Role-Playing:
Even as a 4x strategy game, this game has far better role-playing mechanics than many so-called AAA RPGs. It goes beyond character and faction creation and extends to how you interact with the map and the random - and not so random - events that occur throughout your playthrough. There's a ton of actual meaningful decisions to be made.

Combat:
The optional combat can be so rewarding given the amount of customisation there is for your armies. From the combat spells to the race transformations and unit enchantments, each playthrough will truly feel different, even if you picked the same race and culture.

Customisation:
Creating races and planning your builds is so fun and offers you something some other 4x titles don't. There's a great selection of outfits suitable for each culture and you can always come up with something unique. Even the heroes you recruit can be customised and dressed how you want and you can change their name and gender which is a plus!

Cons:
Crashing:
After 2 weeks the game still has a fair number of crashes. Nothing gamebreaking although I did have to decline an important quest in a story scenario as it would crash every time I accepted. Luckily the game loads very quickly and you can jump right into your last save straight from the launcher.

Underground Maps - Even if you do Massive Underground Maps with Far Player Distance and Underground Starts, the AI does not seem to care about the underground at all and will leave their throne cities undefended. No matter how uninhabitable you make the overground, they will always build their empires up top. Magic and Expansion victories seem impossible to achieve underground so you're punished if you choose to focus an underground society.

Magic Victories
They happen way too early in the game and other AI players will never try to stop them. I recommend turning this off if you don't want your games to end prematurely, especially on larger maps where it may be impossible to stop yourself!

Naval Combat
It's just ships bashing into eachother. I would've liked to see units boarding eachother's ships and actually fighting. I recommend auto-resolving these wherever possible.

Conclusion:
Age of Wonders 4 has reignited my love for strategy games. It combines the civ building of Civilization and the combat of Xcom, while incorporating great role-playing elements in a fantasy setting so flawlessly it's hard not to get lost in this game. I would like to see better AI in some circumstances, better Naval combat and expanded Diplomacy in future updates. As for DLC, I can't wait to see how the developers expand on this already fantastic vanilla version of the game. I'll surely be playing this for years to come.",1684611055,1684611055,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Normally lack of hotkeys is a complete dealbreaker for me, somehow, I barely mind... things are just set up so your clicks feel meaningful.

You are only locked to 1 T5 skill book(out of like 6) which is about 4-6 research that doesnt rly matter considering you share like 200 shared research which makes it impossible to have a unique faction as in the end you will all have the same enchancements and buffs as anybody else -  The campaign is very dissapointing as it feels like fast and badly designed skirmish maps where the player is on weird disadvantage while the victory conditions for each map are lack luster and are literally skirmish style where you can just camp your way to victory - btw 5th map in campaign AI can start magic victory in turn 50 which makes me believe the devs didn't even try to play their own game... 
The actual skirmish is fun, but as i said super repetative in comparison to previous game 
It also has weird performace issuess -where the more research you have made the more laggy the game gets to the point where the couple last research(about 50 last research) take about 1min of freezing time for the game to realize what new research you have done...
Not to mention the fact AI always sees player position and will invade you mostly when its sure you cannot go back in time as it doesn't seem to have fog of war...

I hope the upcomming patches and dlcs will fix at least some of the issues as i do love the series but i'd wait for a sale in its current state.

Positives:
Race creation makes for a more a unpredictable game, keeping you from being able to make easy assumptions about what you're up against.
Lots of little story pop ups, although they don't really change your playthrough all that much.
AI seems to be pretty bright.
Negatives:
The tactical combat camera flits about much like AoW3's  did, although maybe not quite as bad. It's really aggravating, regardless.
I'm not sure I like tactical combat as much in general, the buff/debuff spam is tedious enough when it's just Support units doing it, but it seems like almost every unit is constantly buffing or debuffing someone.
Relations with independents seems a little too.... predictable? Seems like you can always vassal them unless you're really trying not to.

Overall, the game lacks the polish that Planetfall had, which is kind of disappointing, but I can still recommend.",1684599757,1684599865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts out well, like a mix between Heroes of Might & Magic, Civilization and Total War. The first few games are really fun. But you'll very soon hit a point where you've seen most of the content. You'll see the same story events pop up, the same forgotten wonders, the same type of fights. Now this would all be fine and dandy if the magic system was interesting enough.

But it isn't. You wanna feel like a total magic badass out there, ripping apart armies with powerful spells, rending the earth and making your enemies tremble in fear? Nah, can maybe hurt their armies for like 10-20 points of dmg on the world map, and possibly transform their territory into another biome (one piece at a time, except for one spell). Does the terrain radically change the possibilities of the army there? Usually not. If you're expecting tactical combat magic on the level of Divinity 2, you're in for a disappointment. If you're expecting to be able to actually build your heroes to unique killing machines with a diverse set of artifacts and skills, forget about it. It's usually something dull like +10% damage in melee. Truly gameplay altering magic and artifacts respectively aren't really there.

I get it. They wanted to make something balanced that also would works in multiplayer (which I've heard is pretty awful). Thing is, it takes away from the fun of a magic based game. It lacks the charm of Heroes-style games because it refuses to have artifacts that can totally alter the way that you play. By having skills that provide small stat bonuses, instead of transforming the way you engage your enemies. It lacks the diversity of Civilization, where there is joy in planning your expansions, fighting over special resources, and seeing your empire grow through the story it takes through the centuries.

Second gripe I have with the game is that at least the story maps turn into slogs. It seems like, whatever playing style I choose, winning is always quickest with a magic victory. Which is also without question the most boring way to win. Which takes away part of reason to play a story map. If I don't engage with the story, then what's the point in winning?

[h1]Introduction: [/h1] 
Age of Wonders 4, the latest installment in the beloved strategy game series, promises an immersive and strategic experience that takes players on a journey through a fantastical world. While the game shines in many aspects, it unfortunately suffers from noticeable performance issues that detract from the overall enjoyment. In this review, we will explore the game's strengths as well as the areas where it falls short, particularly in terms of performance.

[h1]Engaging Gameplay and Strategic Depth: [/h1] 
Age of Wonders 4 excels in delivering a captivating gameplay experience, with its deep strategic mechanics and engaging world-building. The turn-based battles and the ability to customize and lead armies are where the game truly shines. The diversity of factions, each with their unique units and playstyles, adds depth and replayability, providing ample opportunity for tactical decision-making. The exploration of the game's vast maps and the quest system also contribute to the immersive experience.

[h1]Visual and Auditory Delights: [/h1] 
From the stunning landscapes to the intricately designed units, Age of Wonders 4 boasts impressive visual aesthetics. The art style successfully captures the essence of a fantasy realm, immersing players in a vibrant and magical world. The sound design further enhances the experience, with a captivating soundtrack and well-crafted audio effects that add depth and atmosphere to the game.

[h1]Performance Issues Mar the Experience: [/h1] 
Despite its strong gameplay and visual appeal, Age of Wonders 4 suffers from performance issues that hinder the overall experience. The game frequently stutters and experiences noticeable frame rate drops during larger battles or when the player explores crowded areas of the map. This issue becomes increasingly frustrating as it disrupts the flow of the game and can impede strategic decision-making during critical moments.

Additionally, some players have reported long loading times, which can dampen the excitement and immersion of the game. These performance issues not only detract from the enjoyment but also create a barrier between the player and the rich world of Age of Wonders 4.

[h1]Developer Support and Future Optimizations: [/h1] 
It is worth noting that the development team has shown dedication to addressing these performance issues. Regular updates and patches have been released since the game's launch, aiming to optimize performance and enhance the overall gameplay experience. While these efforts are commendable, it is important to acknowledge that the performance issues should have been more thoroughly addressed prior to the game's release.

[h1]Conclusion: [/h1] 
Age of Wonders 4 is a game that offers an exciting and immersive journey through a fantastical world, featuring engaging gameplay and visually stunning landscapes. However, the notable performance issues, including frequent stuttering and frame rate drops, detract from the overall experience and can hinder strategic decision-making. Despite these setbacks, the developer's commitment to resolving these issues through regular updates provides hope for a better experience in the future. If the performance issues are successfully addressed, Age of Wonders 4 has the potential to become a standout title in the strategy genre.",1684573641,1684576423,False,6,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

There is nothing really all that interesting here.  There's no story, no campaign, no atmosphere, no immersion.
What you do have is a average world domination simulator with okay graphics.  Any success this game may have is in name only.
If you own AOW3 and or planetfall then you have this game already but more of it and for a cheaper price.
The diplomacy is a joke, the AI disgusting as there is no AI.  Tactical combat is basic and most people automate them, the races all feel the same.  There is nothing that stands out in this game that I would say justifies the price, this at best is a £15 budget game.  All hype and zero content.

If your looking for a good game of this type then go with Spellforce conquest of EO.  It 100 x better than this tripe at less than half the price.

I usually prefer to just play the story and enjoy the game on a decent and relaxing pace but this new mode of faction creation and setting up your own race and ideologies is pretty damn good, so much to choose and customize from. The tomes, units and their power distribution are so very well designed that you can just get lost in it as all have strengths of their own and you can clearly appreciate them at the right time and combination. Every units regardless of their tiers are so well balanced and enjoyable to experiment with, quite frankly impressive!

This game mechanics with a campaign like the first classic AoW story mode would just be a home run for me. Nevertheless, hinting at next part of the story/realm was very promising for me as well, so looking forward to it.

Pros:
-Beautiful artstyle and very interesting realms.
-Race customization is nice, without much depth though.
-Combat is standard AOE.
-Empire management and the tomes are very good and provide you flexibility to shape your race till late game.

Cons:
-Ally/Enemy/Independent AI: It is horrible, it feels like a step back from the big fish in the genre.. it is boring, it doesn't attack you, unless it has an army big enough to steamroll you. Also it cheats in unit creation and hero penalty (at least).
-Race balance: As of today, full order build is disgustingly overpowered once it reaches the 5th tome. It can steamroll and overcome even the auto-battle's odds.
-Magical Victory: It's cheap, quick and disgusting because of it.. turns a multiplayer game into a race to whoever gets the 3 buildings first, wait 15 turns in a corner, and win. AI does it too and it invalidates other Victory Conditions. It really needs to be a more late game victory.
-It becomes boring really quick: All races have the same type of battles, some different buffs/mutations but doesn't stray much from the rest in the later game.. 
-Tomes aren't race/perk restricted: Which invalidates some of the customization.. basically you can be anything, and be the same as everyone else at the same time!
-Performance issues: Once 50% of the map is discovered and/or have allies moving every turn, the performance dips greatly. In battle, if you use 3 stacks of short sprites, get ready to feel your frames suffer!
-Content: Is lacking.. the story is 5 levels long and like i said above, the game gets stale quick.
I would understand if this was an early access, but i bet this was premeditated and paradox has in mind adding the content and the much missed fix for these issues on the coming expansions.. not cool.

Pros: 73 hours in, I've played through 2 story missions and 3 custom maps, and still feel like there's tonnes to learn and explore. The game feels more streamlined but not in the way where you lose game depth. Best example I can think of is you don't need to micro manage population in each city any more, but you're incentivised to add particular province improvements to gain building bonuses. This is a much better and far more interesting mechanic. In AOW3 late game investing in high tier units was the only real strat, but in AOW4 a tier 2 unit used in the right circumstance can decimate a much more valuable target making different strategies far more viable.

Cons: The AI isn't bad, but if you're fighting an even army strength battle against the AI it should be an easy victory with no to one or two units lost. Unsure all paths to victory are balanced. Seems a lot easier to achieve a magic victory for instance than it does an expansion one. 

Overall: It's really dope. You can do some really cool stuff, I've had industrious defensive dwarves, necromantic whilst also devout rats, magical toads, and chaotic raiding orcs who love ancient wonders.

The multi-army battles are all set up like city sieges from Age III where the forces are all on one side of the map. This probably is better but it is also significantly different. Items no longer have transportation delays. They show up in a general inventory to which all the Hero's have shared access. Interesting design choice but it means each battle can have the best equipment and ownership of items seems less personal. A central stash per connected regions would probably have been better. Some exploits have been removed such as being able to back off an attack where the enemy was offering to surrender and changing army configuration to try again so as to not have the surrender option. Now the player must make an immediate choice. Spell casting is dramatically different because individual heros do not cast spells as such. The player can cast 1 spell per turn and does not need to fish through the heros to see who still has power left. This is a probable improvement, but I'm not totally sold on it yet. The biggest change it the city growth and zone of control options. Now the cities add provinces over time and select one resource among various options to collect from the new province. My jury is still out on this feature as well. Added resource types has made the game significantly more complicated and hard to grasp. They are definitely influenced by the Stallaris game design and that unfortunately puts the game in a more dedicated gamer niche. Casual players will be frustrated with all the options and adjustable caps they must now manage.

As of a week into release it has provided nothing but hours of enjoyment for me and my friends, whom all got a chance to experience the game with me via hot seat remote play.  Several of them who are not even regular 4X players have now purchased it for themselves or have added it to their wish lists.

The reason, well if I had to speculate I would say it was because of the incredible UI.  The game takes so many dense and crunchy concepts that normally turn people away from 4X games and makes the game so visually intuitive that after a few min in the UI players know more than they should.  Even players new to the genre seem to pick it up very fast. And when people understand whats going on they have fun. 

The game is a great foundation to what could be the fanatasy 4X genres answer to Stellaris. Like them or hate them, Paradox has a good formula going with many of their games. Stellaris is on a 7 year run and continues to get both paid and free content released every single year for their still very active player base.

Age of wonders 4 already has a year long plan in the works to continue to add to a very solid start.  Only time will  tell if the DLC pricing and what each pack offers brings enough value to keep the franchise rolling for years to come, but even if they all fall flat, the base game is such a good open world sandbox with day one access to modding tools that enthusiasts will have years of enjoyment making their own dream fantasy worlds come to life.   

I highly recomend the game in its current state.  I hope the day one console release paird with PC support for remote play allows a whole new group of people to finally find a 4X that does enough right to make them converts to a genre that has been one of my personal staples since I started gaming.

Age of Wonders 4 is a well-optimized, graphically impressive fantasy strategy simulator. However, at the end of the game its features are dull, with little opportunity for strategic challenge and sustained excitement. While the building blocks for an interesting game are there, the sheer amount of choices feel both overwhelming, and, at the end of the day, meaningless.

[h1] Top 3 positives [/h1]

Game is well optimized. Even with its large maps, it runs quickly with little to no crashes.

It is a beautiful game -- lots of nice artwork with good color, etc.

It has core mechanics (racial specialization, exploration, wonder encountering) that has promise to it.

[h1] Top 3 negatives [/h1]

- For all of the game's emphasis on specialization the strategic choices you make do not feel that meaningful. Even with a one-man development team it is possible to create simple but clear strategy games where one feels the impact of choices. This game severely lacks that. It makes the replayability low. After the initial novelty of the feel of the game wares off, it feels kind of pointless.. even playing on the highest difficulty settings.

- The combat does not have THAT many interesting mechanics to it. It has certain basic things, but the range of spells and possibilities feels quite limited for a game like this. The strategy inside the combat is okay but therefore ultimately kind of dull.

- The story and writing is pathetically bad. Hire someone with a brain and a heart who knows how to write a decent-enough plot. To be fair it is a very limited story... but again there is this overwhelming blandness to the experience.

[h1] So... [/h1]

This game is, at the end of the day, not that great.

It's like when you sink your teeth into something that looks good, but has no soul, nothing fundamentally interesting to keep you coming back to it.

The core structure for a more interesting game might be there. The devs should:

1) Make the strategic choices on racial customization feel more meaningful/deep/impactful (perhaps introduce higher buffs with negative consequences as well).
2) Make combat deeper, adding a few more mechanics, and clarifying the existing ones.
3) Deepen the customization aspect of the Realm setting (also make it easier to save)
4) Make the whole ""Paragon"" thing not entirely lame (which it currently is... it feels like a meaningless progression system).",1684437141,1684437141,False,2,0,0.534984052181243896,0,True,False,False

These are nice and can be customized, but you get the same Tome options every game and really it seems like either a choice between more spell focused tomes or physical focused Tomes.

Race/form is almost purely cosmetic.  Apart from minor graphics, there are but two completely open selections (like +2 defence, +15% magic damage, 1 or 2 units ride special mounts, can build farms on X hostile terrain).  That's it.  Race has no interaction with other systems at all.  Could have simply been abandoned.

Culture, again, is pretty generic.  It determines your basic affinity (magic/research type) and your basic units, one building, and a couple of pretty forgettable spells and perks.  I honestly couldn't tell you the difference between a Barbarian, Feudal, or Imperial culture.  You then get to select a couple of culture perks.  These can be somewhat interesting, but are very easily rendered moot in a game of any length.  One is just plain stupid to ever take unless you are playing an extremely small map.  Culture does not interact in any meaningful way to anything else.

Then you have the library of magical tomes.  You get to choose 1 to start, and can select a new one every 4 items learned.  These are totally unrestricted until T5.  Each tome increases it's corresponding affinity.  There's a fair number to choose from, but it isn't nearly as exciting as it sounds.  There is little incentive beyond pursuing the Doomsday victory to going strong in one path.  You can easily max out affinity research in multiple paths with even moderate numbers.  You can get by quite well enough and not ever get a T4 or 5 tome.  The tome system has no interaction with your culture or race at all.  Every trainable unit or summon will be the same for any build.

City development is just tile selection, city buildings are pretty bog standard, empire building is severely curtailed by a low fixed city cap and a very rapidly increasing cost to increase and a massive penalty for exceeding.  I assume that this is to make vassals important, but they stink on ice.

The whole experience might be fun for one or two sessions, but unless you are only playing tiny maps and fast games, you've probably seen everything the game has to offer after 1 long session.

Too much customization with too few constraints and no effort at systems interaction makes a fairly forgettable experience.  I kept finding that I felt ""this would be cool, but X did it before and better""

It's a C+ effort.  DLC unlikely to change much, but this is Paradox, so it could be an entirely different game in 6 months.  <shrug>

The AI is complete garbage.

FWIW I noped out of AOW Planetfall in ~1h and refunded on steam. Somehow, I've dumped 21 hours into this game in 3 days.

The single-player missions are fantastic - while it's 100% scripted, it's awesome having the AI jump to your side and help you turn the tides against evil.I hope with expansions we get hundreds of hours worth of gameplay in a campaign - the structure is all there (race variety, elemental affinity, good/bad, underground/overworld, side of map...)  and the format is surprisingly immersive!

Multiplayer scales well to 3 casual co-op players. There's an official mod to increase the map size further, though we didn't need it for 3 players... maybe for 4? I'm sure it breaks at higher difficulties as was the case with Civ... at higher difficulties the AI definitely cheats, but that's expected of the genre & computing limitations. It'll be fine for the first few hundred hours :) I personally want to see Stellaris-style gateways introduced earlier into the game.

The tactical layer has auto-play so that you don't have to do a ton of tedious trash-mob fights / random encounters. If the outcome isn't great, you can manually intervene which is honestly the best of both worlds - generally you'll do this at boss fights when playing ~normal difficulty, but otherwise rarely. I find that compelling because while I love xcom, I don't want to have to do 100 tiny battles per map when only 5-10 of them really matter. For higher difficulties I imagine you'll be manually playing the tactical layer more, since the AI - while good - takes a lot more damage than it needs to at times. You can technically jump into a manual tactical layer engagement, then toggle auto-play and intervene as needed.

The world is graphically gorgeous. The world doesn't seem to have that many distinct biomes, so you'll probably notice repetitiveness eventually, but that's not a huge issue for me in Civ. Likewise, you definitely notice repeating Ancient Wonders & world events (e.g. pig/spider/octopus cowers in fear, do you let it go), but is that a really big problem? I think that depends on your difficulty level and whether you're dropping into the tactical layer a lot to win more health for your units. For beginner-to-intermediate players using the autobattle system, you'll probably never really notice. At some point it probably becomes hard to introduce more trash mobs that feel distinct but blend into the world.

Networking has frequent desyncs in multiplayer, but fortunately reloads take only ~10s. Either way they get annoying and start happening seemingly every turn after turn ~20. Multiplayer is hosted on a server, not on individual clients, which I found surprising - for that reason you can't rollback if players run into UI bugs, which is a shame for casual players. In contrast, singleplayer is saved locally and has autosave & rollbacks. For some reason, you're limited to 50 saves per campaign, which was mildly annoying for me as I'm a habitual saver. Also, singleplayer AI turns go faster if you move your camera into fog. It seems the game slows down gameplay to the speed of animations if you're looking at them.",1684402605,1684402724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has now gotten to the point where the game goes out of sync every turn on the world map and at least once during every tactical combat.  A more recent issue is upon reloading an out of sync tactical combat, the moves played out and the current state of the combat (what units are alive, what are dead, and where they are) will be completely different from how they were prior to reloading.

All of this is without going in to the fact the game will crash at least once per session, running on solid hardware.

The experience in synchronous multiplayer can only be called unacceptable at this point and my group of friends and I have been forced to simply abandon the game until these issues are resolved.

- Battle with max 3 stacks means low level units quickly become a liability and individual units are a huge risk of the enemy manages to attack them and draw in 1-2 of your armies. It's weird and doesn't work.
- Tactical battles become a real chore late game with 30-40 units in your side that need micro management; while you can't program even the basics of your strategy for auto battles.

Everything from the previous game is very much improved upon and cranked up to 11. If you wanna play Civilization but Magic, with less of the annoyances and systems that seemingly exist just to limit you in that series, (Builder Charges, Buildings and Units sharing the same production queue, etc) this is the game for you. There are some things (like unit enchantments) that hold the game back, but considering how busted (and fun!) some of them can be it makes sense they'd have to balance it a tiny bit with upkeep.

There's also a few bugs and minor issues, like enemies you mind-control losing their mind-controlled status after they ""Mimic"" the form of another enemy, either because that enemy didn't have the mind-controlled status for them to mimic or the game switches out the unit completely, resetting its status to not mind-controlled. There are a few other things but they started patching the most egregious ones out of existence almost immediately after launch.

Some say that the ability to fully customize your own race removes a lot of the ""flavor"" from the Fantasy Setting the games were set in previously, but the series has had God-like beings creating and molding their own people with magic since day 1. Yaka is heavily hinted at having a hand in at least altering if not creating the Azracs from game 1. And he outright creates the Tigran cat people from the following games. Even the Draconians from games 2, Shadow Magic and 3 are just Dragons that Tempest, Lord of the Skies, altered via magic into a smaller, faster-reproducing and more humanoid form to better cope with human birth-rates, expansion and aggression.

If you think having Halflings with the strength and ferocity of Orcs is goofy, don't make them. The game's race-generation for AI factions does a very good job of maintaining those old tropes and racial archetypes for your single-player games, so just exercise some restraint and have some fun remaking thematic races from your most beloved settings. Or just go completely hog-wild and make a race of Amphibious Pocket Princes who practice blood sacrifice, lol.

On the whole, this game is the best 4X game I think I've ever played. 9/10, 4X Game of the Year 2023.",1684256203,1684346648,True,1,2,0.518348574638366699,0,True,False,False

- style
- atmosphere 

disliked:
- combat, there is no tactic in it, like at all.
- Hero types. Those doesn't matter as well, it's just range/melee 
- Hero skills/perks. Simple boring. 
- Races. Just a skin and small perk, didn't feel much of differences. 

Pushed to negative review:
- AI in combat, simple horde rush, didn't see any different 
- Base Armies. it's just one type, that's it. 
- Spells(visuals). Simply unimpressive. Feels like was done some where in beginning of development and forgotten after.

Overall, it's just feels that when you finish even intro you already know that you'll not find anything new in this game.

Sadly I really wanted to love this game and hope with future DLCs something will change, but at current stage I would just skip it.

Great customization options in designing the perfect faction of your imagination by selecting any race you like, then add the culture, traits, and tomes to build the play style you want.  The random map options are incredible, allowing you to create a huge variety of random maps.  All of the game mechanics like diplomacy, relations with other factions, vassals, world and combat spells, and victory conditions are well done.  Turn based combat is tactical with really interesting and varried tactics depending on the units you have and how you built your faction.  There is an auto resolve option for when you just don't have time to play out a big battle but if you don't like the auto results you can still replay the combat manually to try for better results.  The pantheon system is a neat little reward for completing games, with some cool unlocks and cosmetics and a fun way for those rulers you created to re-appear in your future games.  I also really like the art both environment and unit models.  Many different races to choose from and they all can wear any type of armor and weapons and have different visual effects when you add spell enchantments or race transformations.  The units really vary both in appearance and function between the various culture units, recruits, monsters and summons.  Lots of customization options when putting together the look of your ruler to make them look just the way you want and then name your ruler and your race and design the symbol of your faction.  The game does have story realms with a story line, cut scenes, scripted events and unique goals, quests and victory conditions.  Only two are unlocked and visible at first but as you complete them, new ones become available so there are more story missions than most people think at first glance.  I guess that doesn't count as a ""campaign"" to some people but basically the same thing to me, besides random maps are what give 4x games the longevity and replay-ability.

""Mid AF""

Enemy AI is a huge problem with every 4x, and AOW4 failed to find an interesting middle ground between aggression, cleverness, and obvious mistakes the player can take advantage of. 

That being said, it is a competently made 4x and has all of the elements you might hope for. The huge customization will probably scratch an itch many fantasy 4x fans have been wanting to get at for a long time and definitely helps make it more interesting.

The glaring problem with the massive customization is that the races will end up feeling homogenized in the long run, since you will eventually be able to 'do it all'. The AI also does not know how to blend and utilize aspects of the game very well, so they might have a totally impotent combination of factors, or they may be surprisingly strong. 

I would also like to say that for a 'hero centric' 4x, the gear for your heroes is very boring and downright anemic. The enemy AI also does not know how to properly utilize their heroes in battle, and will suicide them into certain death with no effect quite often, simply because they have bigger stats that the unit they detect is vulnerable. 

I also have a serious problem with how the monster stacks work in this game. Most of the time they just sort of hang around doing nothing, usually just blocking a resource you might want to unlock. They can be ignored entirely in most cases. I wish they were actual threats that you should deal with, like perhaps inflicting an unhappiness penalty on the nearby town till they are removed, at the very least. Instead they are just sort of like livestock you will eventually harvest for exp. 

So I have some criticism with the game its true, but I still think it deserves a thumbs up. There is room for it to grow and mature and its an excellent foundation for a game.

I am sure it's not as good on the 4x front as Civ 5. I'm sure it's not as good on the tactics front as Battle Brothers. However, it blends both in a formula that is completely addictive and very, very, very fun.

One of the stupidest criticisms you will see about this game is that everything is ""the same"" because you're not locked out of tomes and races are cosmetic.

Ignore these people. This is an objectively, empirically bad argument made in bad faith. Most of these people are just annoyed by the brave choices made in the design, and the rest are just clueless.

The AOW4 devs demonstrated their racial trait of Testicular Gigantism by ripping out racial tropes. This pissed a lot conservatives off. Physically, races are cosmetic skins. Mechanically, the differences come down to their traits, culture, and the choices of their ""Race Keeper,"" who has control over the core evolution of that race on the entire map.

To summarize the innovations and other cool stuff: basically, you design a race like fantasy Stellaris, and every world you play in has a handful of unique races. These races evolve throughout the game, so you may find some units of a tough catpeople race and then -- outside of your control -- these tough catpeople evolve into frostling tough catpeople, or angel tough catpeople, or whatever. 

Culture is a big thing in this. Each culture has unique mechanics to which you add further customizable traits that can shape your strategy. No way you're playing ""Ruthless Raiders"" Nature/Chaos barbarians the same way as max Order high culture. One of these is about constant combat and massing troops from conquest and growth, while the other is more likely about diplomacy and earning willing vassals, trying to macro to victory with a defensive strategy. One of these is razing cities and looting provinces with abandon, dipping deep into evil alignment, while the other is doing much less combat and taking pains to avoid even selecting evil options in events.

I could list many more examples, but this is gonna be unreadably long already.

As for the ""criticism"" that everything plays the same due to the lack of restrictions on tomes, this criticism is just stupid.

In AoW4, the main restriction on tomes (spell research) is the order in which you choose to unlock things. You can only research one tome at a time. Every game will be close to over whenever a player researches a tier 5 tome, because that's how you get a magic victory. This means that you will never be researching everything because there's almost always little reason to not just do two T1 tomes to unlock T2, two T2 tomes to unlock T3, etc. up to T5 at which point the game is over.

Practically -- and especially in MP -- many games are reaching a boiling point around turn 60, when you're probably more like T4 tomes. If you're ramrodding research any harder than that somehow, I probably invaded you 30 turns ago for poor military/production, or you're so far ahead the game is over.

The point is that you will never unlock every tome -- or even the same tomes from different starting points -- unless you are way past the natural end of the game.

If you're sitting there in ""win more"" mode unlocking every tome, choosing to sit back and hit ""End Turn"" rather than simply pressing the win button, then yeah, you will unlock every spell. This not only seems fine narratively (you're, ahem, a ""Master of Magic"" after all), it's mechanically irrelevant because the game has been over for ages.

You will also see dumb complaints about evil races taking ""Light"" spells. There is no such thing as ""Light"" spells. They're talking about Order, which is explicitly flavoured to be about law and order, not good. Their units are called stuff like Tyrant Knights, Inquisitors, Shrine of Smiting. This is not the ""good"" magic -- it can be, sure, but it's not inherently. Your good-aligned High Elves are probably taking Order tomes, but I literally made the Forces of Satan and Satan's faction was High culture with Order tomes. (High culture gives unique benefits depending on alignment, so Good High will be different from Evil High.)

In conclusion, what this game actually does is rustle the jimmies of people who want the same old racial tropes in every fantasy game. Some people are old-school AoW fans and dislike the fact that this game completely changed directions from the older games. It completely unlocks restrictions like that and the freedom to be strategically and narratively creative is incredible. It is by far the best fantasy Age of Wonders I have ever played.

Played with my wife since launch day, each of us pretty determined to enjoy the game given the price tag. And the sad thing is, when it's playing as it should, it's a lot of fun. Except every 3-4 turns we have to revert a turn in our lobby to fix some game-ending bug.

- Persistent 'out of sync' error issues in multiplayer (improved since launch day, but still pretty common)
- Auto-resolving battles has a chance of simply NOT showing the 'battle results' screen, and the game effectively becoming frozen while waiting for the results screen to show up
- 50% chance of full game crashes during larger battles (with 5 or more armies in play). My PC is decent. Wife's is too. We both have this issue.
- Extremely laggy multiplayer lobbies, e.g. clicking a UI element or moving a unit, and the game taking 5-10 seconds to respond

Bugs aside, the UI and gameplay experience has major issues.
- There is no way to cycle through your lords/rulers while equipping / organising their items
- Units requiring you to 'confirm movement' at the end of every turn if you're moving them over moderate distances; no clue why this isn't automatic
- No menu from which to build a new faction / civilisation / ruler without starting a new game or creating a new lobby. Honestly, how the hell is this missing?
- Editing an existing ruler/faction actually creates a NEW faction instead of editing the existing ruler/faction. This leads to a ton of clutter if you don't manage your created rulers carefully

Probably too late to get a refund, so I guess I'll sit on this and revisit things in a few months.

TL;DR: If you like western fantasy and 4x games, go ahead, this is a no-brainer.

The 4x gameplay is extremly well done and I love the culture mix and match. Though, no game is free from criticism and I am a negative person, so:

- The combat is not very fun to me, especially with 3v3 armies. It is just a cluster of symbols. I do mostly auto combat. I wish there was an map option to set the maximum amount of armies that can participate in combat. I also wouldn't mind to be able to bind multiple armies together to move them together.

- Culture creation has the illusion of choice. ""Culture"" is basically the actual faction choice at it defines what you can actually build. I am not a huge fan that culture and visual representation are tied together and I hope they are changing this at some point for more diversity.

- I had a huge amount of crashes. Single player was relatively stable after a few patches but multiplayer is just crash and desync galore. There is also a really annoying ""stuck in siege window"" bug.

- Zones that had a city on them can't be annexed anymore and only taken by rebuilding the city. This is really annoying, especially as the AI likes to plaster cities everywhere.

There is no clear feedback on what certain enemies or powers do, how to work out counters, or how to do much of anything besides hit 'auto' and hope for the best-- which is usually insufficient, because I don't think the AI is capable of doing anything but either death-balling or crap-stacking.

It's hard to explain exactly how much variaty the game has, but basically you design your core race, how it looks and then 5 or 6 different base race choices, then you choose your starting magic type.

As you play you will choose more magic types, tomes, every once in a while, this expands what magic you have as well as what units you can produce and especially what buffs you can give.

A core aspect of this game is choice and designing your race. There are permanant buffs you can give your race (or any race that you have asimilated) that range from mild to almost game changing. The magic starts off useful and powerful, but by the mid and end of the game you are changing the landscape on a massive scale, you are summoning armies from nothing and your hero units have a dozen or two abilities.

A core aspect of the game is not only the overland but also the underworld, another land if you want it in the game.

Then there are the tactical battles. I personally find them fun, but they can be time time consuming at middle and later stages of the game, due to each side often starting with 18 units, and then summoning more. Luckily the auto resolve for the game is pretty reasonable and i find myself using it a lot when i just want to focus on the large scale. If you lose a autoresolve the game also gives you a option to ""retry"" with manual control.

You can also customize the world prior to starting, which has dozens of different effects and choices, so you can make it a setting you really want to play in.

City Expansion and Management has changed and I argue for the better too. While in the past you were restricted to an AOE domain with each city lingering in its center, in AOW4, this has been changed to Provence claiming, with each Provence having basic or special resources on them to be claimed when Annexed. Some even have wonders in them, much like the ones in AOE3. Combat is very much the same as AOE3, but I will give the AI some credit where they won't just run circles around you to flank your units. They do more than that this time. Another notable change is that Independent camps have been improved, and are more interactive with the world than before. 

Two Criticisms:
I only have two complains about the game in regards to the AI and Free Cities. Neither are very forward about dealing with neutral AI forces. In the case of AI cities, its not hard to out level their heroes because they won't spend much time clearing out camps on resource nodes. Free Cities, I have learned, are equally bad about it but at least have a passive leveling system (or appear to) to keep them up to speed with you. However, they won't attack or advance on hostile camps (or in AOE4, Nests). 

Secondly, Free Cities are kinda useless as except for the resources they provide. AI Civs are semi guilty of this but Free Cities are worse in that they will not sell units off to be replaced with stronger higher tier units and they are not very useful in wars either. The one time a Free City aided me in war was with another Free City and it was only to sell me two units to recruit to aid in defeating them. And it only happened once. 

Both are minor complains to be honest, but they can be annoying on occasion. It is not hard to steamroll and AI early on if you focus on getting to T3 military units ASAP. At least, you will fairly easily defeat your first enemy. After that, IDK. I have not completed a full game yet via military expansion.",1684237994,1684237994,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I'd start as a elves that were industrious, leading into lawfullness and eventually becoming paragons of light.

Age of Wonders 4 is a beautiful and intelligent game for 4X beginners, casual gamers and those who decide to get acquainted with the series. However, at the moment (May 2023) the game lacks content and mid- to end-game mechanics, making it a hard pass for hardcore strategists and fans of the AoW series.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ For new players the game provides a gentle introduction into 4X basics and tactical battles.
+ The game features pretty neat graphics and UI (for a Paradox game).
+ It provides a high level of visual customization for your faction.
+ The role-playing aspect is nice and allows you to imagine yourself as the ruler of a fantasy people, exploring and conquering a dangerous world.

[h1]Controversial moments[/h1]
* The Tomes of Magic system allows for constructing the technology tree during the game from a variety of thematic pieces with almost no limitations. So, you can make really bizarre builds like necromancer-druid-Chaos Lord-angelic being. However, you may never use the majority of combinations.
* The game is all about battles, and the economy is built around the military. Even ""peaceful"" paths to victory require a good army.
* The Pantheon system allows you to ascend your ruler as a godlike being after completing a map, which is nice but mainly unlocks cosmetics for further sessions.
* The routine of point-and-clicking your unit stacks at the global map is typical for all AoW games due to up to three armies each side taking part in a single battle. Thus, you want to move a few armies as one steamrolling horde through the entire map.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- The game, which is not cheap, is pre-divided into a bunch of DLCs, and the roadmap of add-ons was scheduled for a year in advance even before the release of the original game.
- The gameplay does not progress much through the game session, lacking significant midgame and endgame mechanics, such as espionage, World council, domestic politics, and so on.
- The storyline has been cut at the root.
- Diplomacy is rudimentary, and war is often the only viable answer.
- The AI is incredibly dumb and passive.
- Fantasy races are no more than cosmetics, with elves, goblins, rats, toads, etc. being just reskins for humans.
- The much hyped faction diversity is slyness, with only six factions (called ""cultures"") determining major faction mechanics, buildings, and core units. Besides that, you can choose two positive traits (basically, tweaking numerical parameters), a starting Tome, type of the leader (less magical or more magical one), starting weapon for the leader, and that's it.
- Multiplayer requires idling while another player is fighting manually or making decisions. Hint for developers: look at Endless Legend or Humankind games.",1684180825,1684223806,False,4,0,0.543726265430450439,0,True,False,False

The excellent auto-resolve AI is welcome and I use it far more often than manual combat, even though combat itself is engaging and fun. This is simply because I am starved for time and see no benefit when the AI does a good enough job.
Teleporters come into play late game and are buildable so you can move armies around quicker which is nice, as troop movement sometimes feels a bit tiresome. There's also forced march but I haven't actually used that yet, though it looks like a cool mechanic (move double as far in exchange for health and debuff).

I hadn’t played any Paradox games at that point so I wasn’t prepared for the level of complexity involved and couldn’t wrap my head around the mechanics. Now I’ve got Stellaris, Crusader Kings and Victoria under my belt I thought maybe I’d try the new one.

Age of Wonders 4 is a turn-based hex map empire building game in the mould of Civilization where fantasy races are competing for control of a magical realm. Each civilization has its own traits and units it can build and you have the choice of picking one of the pre-generated ones or building a whole new one by combining existing traits and modifiers. You can also build a realm, basically a whole bunch of map modifiers to choose from before they’re fed into the RNG engine.

There is a fairly token story campaign going on but it’s not really why we’re here. Three powerful wizards escape their prison and start lording it over the mortals and the mortals fight back sums it up pretty well. You have a scrape with one of these wizards and by surviving you ascend as a Godir, a powerful being who wanders between realms leading their people to prosperity.

Playing fantasy games, I have a propensity to play human warriors, a tendency I am routinely mocked for amongst my circle of friends. I enjoy making my character look like me and charging into combat waving my massive hammer but that is a bit like walking into a fancy restaurant and asking for white sliced bread, so when I discovered I could make an entire race of mes my ego swelled nicely. Then the game default named them human warriors. What the fuck’s this game? You want a piece of me too? Fine, I’m taking my sliced white and I’m smearing it in Jalapeno Sauce. They’re gonna be warrior druids with a menagerie of beasts at their command. On a side note, the selection of races to choose from is kinda fun. You can play as a frog.

A detailed explanation of the games mechanics would take too long and only confuse so I will briefly summarise them. The game will plonk a city on the map and an army containing your hero. The map is divided into provinces that can be annexed by your city as it grows and in doing so you can decide what resource in that province you want to exploit. Bandit and monster camps spawn in provinces requiring you to clear them out before you can take them over and structures with difficult boss battles will feed you lore and reward you with powerful boons, and story events will occasionally pop up presenting you with a dilemma that will shape your empire.

An army can contain up to six units, each with a set of skills, advantages and disadvantages. You can auto-resolve battles but there’s also an interesting combat system. It’s turn-based and takes places on a hex map and there’s quite a bit of depth to it with flanking positions, area of affect abilities and counter attacks making it a bit like unnecessarily complicated chess. It’s one of the things that put me off before, adding an extra layer of complexity to an already confusing game but now I know what to expect, I’ve found it to be a fun and challenging system.

You can win the game in a few ways. Hitting the turn limit with the highest score or murdering all your opponents are the simplest but there’s also the tech and expansion victories which involve building certain improvements and defending them for several turns. I pursued the Magic victory on my first playthrough. Research consists of working your way through increasingly powerful tomes full of spells for combat, buffing your units and even changing the game world and race. I went from a boring human to an icy beast god by the end of the game. There’s been a lot of work gone into the different spell combinations and I think it might be the best bit of the game. I look forward to playing around with them later to see what I can come up with.

Winning the game lets you add your leader to your pantheon, essentially a list of characters that can appear in later games as heroes for you to recruit or leaders for you to defeat and who hang around the title screen between games. If you’re looking to add all your mates as playable characters then you’re gonna have to work for it.

I’d suggest learning it in stages. Get your head around a mechanic, slam the restart button, and apply what you’ve learnt to your next playthrough as you learn the next mechanic. I’ve found I’ve restarted previous paradox games around 16 times before I truly made headway but I pretty much understood this one on my second run through so either the learning curve is much less steep now or my mind has ascended to god-like levels.",1684202324,1684202324,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Detailed rant-
I'm so mixed about this one, I spent thousands of hours in Age of Wonders series and even more in 4X addiction. AoW4 did has its ups and downs and unlike the social media and how they represent as this must be a greatest 4x, it's not, and not all the things are sunshine and rainbow.

+Pros
Customization, this is a mixed bag, its worse than endless series but still detailed and fun, yet it also took away the identity of established fantasy setting AoW had. You can make physical powerhouse halflings with full plate armours and morph them into giants etc. At this point race became a cosmetic and drifting one of the generic canvas type of games with some other serious flaw I'm gonna mention at further part.

+Animations/Graphics
It looks gorgeous, world looks appealing and animations looks fluid and well-done.  

+Music
Works well with the game, could be better but certainly above average. 

-AI
Atrocious. AI got higher tier units (3's and 4) at the start of the game which is quite problematic in early-stages but they're not a real threat, I play at the hard diff. and even with clear advantage and army number, AI will turn its back and move away without giving any meaningful thrashing, if you compare it to Total War Warhammer 3's AI, which will bite you to the death, AoW4's AI lacks the aspects of threatening and looked like a tutorial dummy AI. 
Oh, Vassal system is also need to rework, beside sharing resources they don't have any meaningful options such as attack or defend, if you think how a whole civic talent dedicated to ally (Order) this is quite half-arsed and pathetic to have. 

-Main Scenario
AoW had always some kind of story going on, started with Merlin, you feel more connected to the world, every race and adventure were actually mattered. Now, it's just few mentions and Endless series type of scenario which is pretty much custom with some text sprinkled on top.

-Races and Magic
I'm quite conflicted about this one, while they removed the identity of races they also didn't add more options to make the custom looks appealing. For example you got over 75+ spells in AoW and 15+ races with different traits, musics, unit models, buildings so on. This game however except the tome units, you just got the similar units, same goes for some tomes of magics, frost is totally filler and got only two book as tier 1 and 3 and while you can transform your race as frostling and terraform the land, you lack of the basic arsenal of spells and advanced frostling units. 

-Performance Issues
I'm playing at 3070 with quite high-end setup and get random CTD quite frequently, every time it happens my cursor drifting more and more from the play button, every other game I'm playing works fine such as total war, civic, ffxiv, d4, apex etc. I did myriads of list of ""recommendations"" such as updates, verifies, reinstall, disabling apps etc. but yea it's quite annoying.

-Personal Rant-

If you are in the verge of getting it and you come from playing/liking Planetfall's mechanics, prepare for disappointment. There is no cover system, no stagger, no tactical advantage because positioning don't matter, attack forces will start head to head no matter how they were placed in the campaign map. First action point isn't free anymore, you move you lose. There isn't a practical approach to strategy, no matter what you do, you end up clumping your units together to get the ""buffs"" from your casters. 

Although flanking is there, ""flanker"" type of units are very rare. Critical hits as of today, come before accuracy, so you could crit. with 5% accuracy. The ""Overwatch"" mechanic, both melee and ranged, is GONE. Instead we have a very confusing ""attacks of opportunity"" for melee only that feels more like a way for the AI to hit you more than you, because until you learn it, your units will die a lot for it. It has to do with these ""zones of control"" which is the three hexes in front of a unit (all around if they are in defense mode), any unit who comes in contact with those hexes supposedly gets attacked (not sure because sometimes it happens sometimes it doesn't), however if two units are in front of you only one will trigger it (the one right in front) but I have seen the AI using both; I don't know how to so I might be doing something wrong.

But my biggest gripe I have with this game is Healing. Healing is not healing anymore but covering holes with the ""Temporary Hit Points"" system. It just heals ""temporary hit points"" which are then taken once battle is over so you will go around the map with hurt troops most of the time. You can regenerate in your territory but then who wants to be there? Also, AI cheats like there's no tomorrow even on Normal difficulty, also is greedy on grabbing land even if it's right next to your cities. Graphically speaking, they did a decent job, but still the units themselves feel all the same, some share the same model and animation just a different skin leading to awkward attack animations. There is a heavy leaning towards a rock/paper/scissors system and as a result units are simplistic: sword and shield, ranged, pike, battle mage, support mage, and cavalry. Better, higher-tier units are obtained through a Tome system (the research) along with spells, but they're tied to those tomes and ultimate units (Tier 5) feel most of the time as resources wasted. The game has HUGE potential, HUGE, but right now it feels crude, rough and with lots of mechanics affecting the fun factor.

Can spam heroes

How did this make it past playtesting..?



Past the (justified) angry silliness above, honestly...I don't fully recommend it.  It is good?  Yeah.  Is it fun?  Yeah.  But it's also got some weird performance issues that make me raise an eyebrow, that season pass price is absolutely brutal, and...honestly it feels like Planetfall has more depth?  Which yeah, it's got it's 3-4 expansion DLC, but on the same coin, I never played any of that DLC, only the base Planetfall campaign, and it feels a lot more robust and deeper on the strategy end, with a lot more to research and more tactical decisions.  Here, you pretty much get everything by the end, and spam vassals instead of cities.
So I guess if you're looking for the ""lite"" er title, this one is your go to, or you prefer the medieval fantasy stuff like I do.  But if you want a bit deeper mechanics, more to do, and a full functioning game...I'd swing for Planetfall and give this one a year or two to iron out all the bugs.

Despite a lot of hate on this from some, I like the custom society aspect of the game. I hate how often I can play a 4x game and none of the factions/races have the combination of traits I like.

The customization is actually a good chunk of the fun to me.

I enjoy the turn based aspect of the combat as well. One of the things I dislike about Total War games is the real time combat. On the flip side, I also hate the lack of real combat from the Civ games. So I feel like this is the perfect in between choice.

On the negatives, I dislike the lack of units for base military in the game. There are a lot of unit options in the realm of tombs, spells, upgrades, etc. But I would like to see more ""base units"" for each factions. I would specifically like to see more mounted varieties. There are very, very few mounted units in the game.

Oversimplified and lacking. You start the game and feel like its good, for about 5 to 10 hours. Then you realize it is lacking on every front. World is mostly boring and empty. Units are mostly reskinned versions of each other. Every nation / faction plays mostly the same. It feels like there are around 10 items total for your heroes to find and equip. Do not worry here tho, they surely will sell you more in multiple DLCs. 

The AI is very, very basic only makes up with blatant cheating on higher difficulty. Individual Units stop to matter very fast. It is quantity over quality all the way. 
To take a city or do anything meaningful you need a hordes of units. You can have only 6 per stack so you cruise around with 5 to 10 stacks which is tedious. Combat is very buff centric to the point where most actions you take buff something somewhere. 
This leads to late game combat being an endless spooling off of buff cycles. It gets old fast and i find myself just bringing more stacks then the AI and autoresolving because the combat gets way to tedious otherwise. The AI can regenerate forces so fast you have to do the ""decisive battle"" multiple time till you reach an enemy city. 
It kinda is like fighting the soviets in WW2 only they get some kind of weird cheaty lend lease that spawns entire armies in front of you after you defeat what was there. 
The game forgot what set it apart from other similar titles and made it special. It feels like a grind and i regret buying it. It just feels like the soul of the went missing.

I really enjoy playing this game. There is a lot of customisation aspects that make each playthrough quite unique, which of course enhances replay-ability.

You can create your own faction by picking their race among quite a lot of different types and then a culture, which are at the time of this review are: Feudal, High, Barbarian, Dark, Industrious and Mystic. These cultures with form how your general play style and traits. You can also create a unique ""Lord"" with quite a lot of customisation.

City building and troop movement works very much like Civilisation, except you can create armies made up of 6 units each, and up to three armies can support each other on a battle map, which is turn based combat where you move around hex shaped tiles.

To improve your empire, you research what is called ""Tomes"". You can choose between a lot of different affinities with aligns your faction towards a specific type of magic, such as shadow, nature, order, chaos etc.. each time you research a certain amount of traits you can unlock the next tier of tome, which gives you access to more powerful types of magic/troops/bonuses etc..

It's a great game to play with friends too, the only downside is that it's very, VERY unstable. Most of my games desync around 10 to 20 times, which forces you reload the game, which is especially annoying when it happens in combat, because it restarts the combat from the beginning and forces you to watch all of your previous moves up until the point the game desynced.

Below I explore a bit deeper the things I loved and the things that somehow watered down my experience in the game. As a short background, I have played all AoW games (except Planetfall), being the very first and Shadow Magic the ones closest to my heart. In AoW4 I have played Story Realms only and in hard difficulty, so I cannot speak for Map Design or AI behaviours in other circumstances.

[h1] Things I Loved: [/h1]

- Just like its predecessors, the game is extremely engaging, with hours flying by with the 'one more turn', 'one more battle' sort of dynamic.

- Art style both in map and units is gorgeous. Probably closer to AoW3 than the earlier titles as these games are more similar in mechanics and gameplay as well.

- Empire Development tree offers new depth in your progression. I pretty much loved this idea, I would maybe look into adding even more options and ramifications in the future.

- Multi-choice encounters (Ancient Wonders) and Random Events, as above, a great idea that makes the experience more immersive, snapping you out of the general flow of the strategy without being annoying. I feel like the encounter chance rate is already on point so I would maybe add on the the variety and decision options.

- The Magic Tomes. I believe this is probably the biggest change to the game mechanics. There is good to it and some things I will discuss further in the next section. Like the Empire Tree, this system allows you to pretty much do anything you want with your Magic, you have a starting point but from there you can go anywhere and make sick combinations and synergies. Each tome affinity plays out like a 'Class' in a way. So multi-classing allowed and encouraged.

- Permanent Minor and Major race transformations. Amazing, I love it, and the fact that it actually brings a visual change every time shows the amount of attention to detail of the developers. Great job!

- Ruler and Race customisation is neat. Letting you create your ultimate fantasy civilization (at least in theory cause sometimes, unavoidably, the results of your actions are disappointing, it's life). 


[h1] Things I Would Change: [/h1]

- Ruler and Race Identity. This is a bit complex to put into words. Let's say there is a trade-off between No Choice and Too Many Choices. In earlier titles each race had their own unique features and lore. It was a bit of a risk-gain sort of thing. They had strengths and weaknesses and in a way you knew what to expect from them, with their own intricate personalities. It may be my own bias but I feel that there is a big charm in that and grow to love the details and certain perks of each race and what they bring to the table. Now there is the multi-class system which, as I said, it's cool, let's you do many things (too many?) with no real risk except for the one of making bad choices. I would love the Rulers & races to have some innate perks (unique units, unique magic, unique building...). As it stands, Rulers and Races are just cosmetic. Some people my prefer it this way? Not me though... I would bring back if only a bit of Race unique perks.

- This brings me back to the Magic Tomes system. I welcome the variety of options but it feels a bit inconsistent (even with lore). You can start the game with any Tier I Tome, which is related to certain affinities, but then afterwards you can go anywhere. Even if you stick to say 'Chaos Affinity Tomes' until you reach Tier III, suddenly you can chose Tier IV Order Tome? In my opinion this makes no sense and is one of the biggest drawbacks of this mechanic. It has no 'personality'. I would maybe make some affinities be correlated to others to a certain degree and let you explore the closest (starting from Tier I and building up) add some random Tomes as rewards for clearing Ancient Wonders or such (The higher tier the Wonder, the higher tier the tome, just like weapons and artifacts). Also,  and related to the previous bullet point, I would move some of the 'new unit' research from tomes to 'unique race buildings upgrades'. Magic is fine, not much new or too refreshing but I appreciate the introduction of synergies with buffs and debuffs, it adds up to the level of complexity and that's cool.

- The Siege System. Here is a great idea but with unfortunate consequences to the gameplay. I'm surely not the first one pointing this out. It is not 'fun' to wait 6-12 turns late-game to siege every enemy city, when you have 5 enemies in the game, this means you spend hours just moving army stacks from city to city and waiting. In the meantime you fight off waves and waves (I don't know if this is exclusive to hard difficulty) that the AI can generate out of thin air every 1 or 2 turns. Which is fine, but it means I have to fight dozens of Manual Battles (Automated means you lose too many units and risks losing the game) and gets tiring. [b] If only you would allow the player to go into battle straight on, [/b] you would still be facing the big handicap of fully operating city defences and walls, and then give the OPTION of starting a siege, meant to reduce the handicap, and maybe even make it inverse in terms of siege time duration (the more siege projects means maybe more time but bigger impact). If I have a huge army I will not spend 8 turns in the map to conquer an almost empty city and will be able to move on. I can't stress enough how important this is in the flow of the game and how clunky it feels at the moment. Probably my number one objection to the gameplay as it stands. 

- I don't want to dwell in smaller points but I'd like to mention the already infamous Vassal Cities. Again, cool mechanic that could do with some minor tweaks and become an awesome addition. I don't know why, but when you vassalize a city or an already existing vassal expands their borders, sometimes they 'convert' NPC army stacks guarding resource tiles. This has an awkward interaction as you cannot clear the stacks (even when they are in your territory) and they remain occupied. Thus, not grating you the bonus. I'd say either remove the 'occupy' status if they are your allies or remove the 'conversion' of NPC stacks altogether. Also, I would have a look at this particular AI behaviour as it feels like they don't do much apart from sending the odd army in one direction or another. most of the time they just wait there doing nothing (and I mean while wars are raging around them).

It's not a bad game, I have played it quite thoroughly already and it's fun, but in hindsight, I would have waited until all of the dlc are released and then bought it for 50% off at most. It's DEFINITELY not worth 50$ as it is quite literally just an updated Age of Wonders 3. Same units more or less, map textures are mostly taken from Plantefall, it's hard to tell what was actually completely new in this game as soooo much was taken from others.

Despite the downgrades though, there are two improvements which are in customizability and in city state interactions. I hated city states in AOW3 and now I quite like the feature. 

The biggest downside of this game, aside from it being a lousy copy&paste, is the ABYSMAL AI. All they do is raid during war.. even ""good"" AI. I have put a ton of hours in and never been sieged and have hardly seen any sieges. AI is absolutely awful and even if you have all the money in the world, it's not worth playing this game until that's fixed. 

Overall: 6/10
Fun game but a certain downgrade of its predecessors which it copy and pasted 99% of its content from.

In AOW, I started my first game as an orc leader and got crushed because I was a complete noob, I started again and made a different looking orc.. nothing much different yet.. 

At the end of the game I had an army of fucking demon orcs that could fly and had flaming swords. I also had some giant Balor which could wipe our an entire army in 2 moves. 

I'm now on a new game, playing as ""dark"" rats and im specialising in magic and spells. It feels like im playing a completely different game.

The gameplay is solid. If you've played the previous installment of Age of Wonders, Planetfall, you generally know what you're in for. There are some missteps, mostly involving late-game balance, in my opinion, but nothing deal-breaking. 

The artwork, customization, and level of detail are exceptional, with the artwork in particular being absolutely delightful. I have derived a surprising level of enjoyment from the simple, but entertaining story scenarios in the game. 

The multiplayer stability and playability are currently, as of May 15, 2023, poor. The main reasons for this are among the ""Known Issues"" per the developers, but there are other inadequacies. 
The main issue currently is the pluripresence of both desyncs (which admittedly, may be resolved rapidly, though only slightly less of a nuisance for it) and general game-arresting bugs, that from my personal experience, happen mainly in multiplayer. I ultimately expect these to be fixed. 
As for other complaints, this mostly derives from players being unable to do anything in the game while another connected player is either making a decision, or fighting a battle that you cannot see. This is incredibly frustrating, even playing with only one other player. Playing with more than one other player results in you and your friends essentially dodging each other to perform turn functions. Admittedly, this could be rectified by setting turns to classic rather than simultaneous, but it just seems like this portion of the game development was undertaken with a lack of imagination. 
To clarify, I have no issue with not being able to see other players' battles, that is a setting available to the host, to force other players to be able to see other player battles that they are not party to. My issue is that any player not pulled into the battle, is then rendered unable to take any action in the game at all for the duration of the other player's battle.

AoW3 did a fantastic job with adding bit of lore on each units. And while AoW4 has a separate lorebook that addresses the lore elements of the world, the unit lore is still missing. 
Another glaring flaw is the negotiation system. The earlier AoW games let you edit your offers when negotiating. You could trade weapons for cities if that's what you needed. But now trading is fixed. You have to buy or sell at the opponents price or cancel the deal.
The music is subpar, when comparing to the earlier games. even Planetfall had better musics.
AoW3 had an awesome unit rank up system where you could potentially keep upgrading 1 unit even after Champion- by giving it ranks in the champion level. Essesntially giving a tier 1 unit more life if it was at a high enough level to rival a tier 3 unit. 
I also liked the old hero level up system over the new Planetfall like system. But that's a more personal gripe.
And they also took away Draconians and the quick save shortcut button. I mean wtf!!!
Enough about the Flaws- now the pros.
The graphics is drastically better. 
There is one story realm, which is a campaign. They should've worded it better. But the other official realms lets you experience your own story much like a DnD campaign, which is kinda cool.
The unit variety and designs are also better than it ever was. I specially love how you change your race as you keep playing. 
The spells are more innovative. Unit enchantments are back and this time they affect whole groups instead of a specific unit which is awesome.
The city tab is better. The best part is unit production and building are now different.

Overall I give it 6.5/10. Mostly because I feel like this one is more like a fantasy Civilization than the classic AoW. But it certainly has it's charms that is sure to draw in new players.

RE: upon playing additional scenarios, I have to change my mind. Here are my newest gripes:
1. The game is a pure civ like now. The longer you play a big map the monotonous it gets. Most fights can be won by auto fights with zero casualty. So the main pull is also gone. 
2. The fights become monotonous because the battle maps are all the same. Gone are the unique battlemaps for each different locations and terrains. Now all battlemaps look the same AND act the same. Bridge maps are one, city maps are one, wonder maps are one and all the resource nodes are one. No uniqueness for each nodes. Wonder maps being same I can get, but not when the whole theme depends on each different wonders and their stories. 
3. The music is truly a letdown. I can't emphasize it enough. There are no truly memorable soundtrack. Even the distinct GONG that marked the new turn begining is gone.
4. The enemy AI is truly abysmal. They keep producing armies, yet don't attack in waves. And now one side cannot surround enemies even if you have more armies like in AoW2 or 3, it's always 3 armies vs 3 armies. So you can just move with 3 armies and you are safe from anything they can throw at you, even if they have 6 armies. You will just fight them twice on equal numbers. So even though the AI looks menacing, they actually easy as $h!t.
5. The new battle mechanics imported from Planetfall where ranged units can't retaliate or act in melee also means you can kill a tier V Battlemage if you can surround it with tier 1 melee units, which again, takes away the challenge. 
6. And why are there sieges?????? In previous entries I had to breach the walls myself, that should be how sieges work, not this wait a few turns and let them gather their armies. Absolutely hate it. 
7. I truly liked the racial upgrades. But each scenario being one off means you don't get to create a race that is truly unique that you can introduce in a later game. Overtime all races become the same as you research more tomes with all units unlocked. No one gets any unique units based on race if you are playing past turn 80 or so. 
8. Make the racial forms mean something other than just cosmetics. And give each race unique units at least upto tier II. Otherwise the race means nothing. Half the time I can't even tell my units apart because I have the same Gladerunner from 5 different races yet they look all the same on the world map and combat map. 
9. Unit enchantment covering all units of a type means you get a hugely buffed army by turn 20 even though you don't have to cast every turn. And the enemy AI doesn't even do that. It just makes the game so easy it's funny.
Overall, apart from from unit variations and city upgrades I find no reason to keep playing this game. I now regret the 37$ I spent on this. My new ranking is 3.5/10. I will most probably keep playing, just to complete the story realms and get my moneys worth. But I doubt I would ever return to it after that.
I don't regret my purchase of AoW3 or AoW2 just so we are clear. I still play them from time to time. They were that good.",1683304671,1684132750,False,0,0,0.52555084228515625,0,True,False,False

I might have a problem. I start the game promising myself only a couple of turns - I end up at some point realizing, that it's 4AM. I can't pinpoint exactly what is it about AoW4, but it definitely has the ""one more turn"" bug that, once settles, won't let you free. I am quite aware about game's weaknesses, namely: passive/vexing AI, that will rather settle near your borders to nick the most juicy provinces under your belt, instead of properly attacking you; occasional bugs (albeit they are fixed quite quickly); completely forgettable soundtrack. I also see through the lines, that even the biggest pros of AoW4 are somewhat... overstated. At some point you realize, that the ""race transformations"" are quite limited and repeatable. That there are certain combos that work well, so you most likely will follow a couple progression paths, just with an added flavour of your race sometimes looking Orkish, sometimes Elvish, sometimes Human. And anyway your endgame units ain't part of your race, but some mythical creatures that you need to summon and that will always look samey, regardless whether you play as demonic moles or holy rats.

Yes somehow I keep playing... I used to love Amplitude Studios and their ""soft"" French style. Yet, playing Endless Legends, usually I was done with a game after one campaign. Same with Civ6 - ok, here is my 10, 15 hours as some new Civ, thanks game, see you in 2 months, maybe in a quarter. Here, having seen my mana addicted moles ascend to godhood, I went straight to play superevil dwarfs, employing their awesome constructs to spread destruction and misery (any similarities to Dawi-Zharr are completely accidental). Addiction is strong in this one.

On the side note, one positive thing to definitely point out as unique is actually not the race creation - but realm creation. THIS is the definite replayability multiplier. You wanna play on a manawinds-scorched map? Deal. Or perhaps you want to try your luck on a constantly evolving terrain, that can blow under your very feet? You're welcome. How about playing a race of felines against a Frozen Witch, that starts with a huge empire and is out there hunting for your fur? Go ahead, make C.S. Lewis proud.

And one thing that keeps me slightly worried is... wel, Paradox. Maybe the reason why i keep playing until the dim morning light starts knocking on my windows is... knowing that this here is the game in its most pristine form. And somewhere along the line, 2, maybe 3 years ahead, is a bloated mess of DLCs, parasitic mechanics and power creeped races, akin to Stellaris. I hope i am wrong. I hope the game can grow and add new customization options, schools of magic or units, yet still retain its clarity of form.

However, all of this masks rather shallow game. Combat at its core is a simplistic “stack all buffs to win”, city improvement are all flat bonuses with different icons, and all spells are bland and generic buffs, summons, or direct DPS. This game is no Master of Magic.
All this complexity and mandatory micromanaging is fundamentally unrewarding and masks lack of design imagination.

I've never played a game where the bugs are as bad as the reviews make them out to be, but somehow this game takes that and makes it far worse. Some are minor bugs that will casually make 10 turns disappear in the blink of an eye, as you try to work around it, and others are severely game-breaking, rendering the game unplayable. I have not even been playing that long, and I've run into at least 5 really bad bugs on each playthrough. I have to wonder, since some seem impossible to miss— did they playtest this? Aside from the core mechanics that seem fine, I genuinely wonder if anyone played through a game over 100 turns. I mean, on one map you cannot attain a magic or expansion difficulty based on its no empire clause, and yet the AI will build towards exactly that or a magic victory (which you need to have multiple cities for)— and pretty much make the game unwinnable for them.
There is a fundamentally good game underneath all of those bugs, but unfortunately, it's not just the bugs that make for an unpolished game.

The AI is abhorrent, having little to no direction on how to win. They do cheat, on every difficulty. Easiest to hardest, it doesn't matter, and really, it doesn't... because the AI will generally play the same on every difficulty. I started myself off on normal, realized how braindead the AI was, and switched to the hardest. The AI is more proactive, I'll give it that, but it does nothing with that productivity. The most it will do is besiege your province and ruin some of your developments, but it somehow fails to actually start a siege with more than one stack of units. Well if the AI is this shit, I understand why it needs to cheat. Since it does cheat, it makes playing on the ""hardest"" difficulty feel cheap, since it can spawn units indefinitely— no matter how hard I swing at them. The combat AI, in comparison, is a lot better— far from perfect, but I'll take it.

Again, the foundation of the game is great, other than the AI. Squash the bugs, overhaul the AI, and the result is a phenomenal game.",1684114298,1684114298,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I have been playing the last mission, Grexolis, for two straight days. It's freaking absurd. The randomness in the game is good in general, until you play the last mission. You have unbreakable allies who do nothing apart of blocking your cities so you can't expand properly, stealing from you the little resources you can have. 

Did I talk about the enemy? An awesome AI which starts with maxed capital cities and resources (or cheats) to deploy an entire army for each single unit you're able to recruit. This happens in general in every map, but in this one is specially tedious because between the map settings and enemy buffs, even their support units can oneshot your units in one turn with ease. 

The first time I played this, a vassal city with his race and bufs spawned just in front of my city, and deployed 3 armies full of T3 units able to oneshot my T1. Oh, I was barely able to deploy 1 T1 army. The only reason you can win is because the AI is specially stupid and will not play as agressive as it should. Otherwise you would be razed by turn 10. Knowing this, you can attempt to cheese it until one of the 4 enemies decide to deploy magic victory by turn 60. Did I mention you have only 15 turns to stop them, while in that stupidly designed map you need like 30/50 turns to go from one corner to the other? If you're lucky enough to be near of that enemy when he decides to deploy magic victory, you can send your 3 T3-T4 units in time, and you will find yourself surrounded by 9 T5 armies with units oneshotting not only your units, but your very heroes.

It's obvious this quest battles and victory conditions haven't been tested properly, and it's frustrating. It's a great game overall, and I would recommend it as soon as this is fixed. Meanwhile, however, I can't recommend anyone to get involved. Right now it's an open beta. There are some bugs (like sieges bonus coming against the player if the defender attacks him). but nothing game breaking apart of this design. You can't give 15 turns to stop an enemy which is 40 turns from you. 

I hope the devs spend more time playing the game next time. This could have been easily avoided. I will have to cheese the map or play it until I am lucky enough to have all the odds in my favour. Knowing myself, I won't stop until I achieve this, and I hate it won't be because of skill or mental agility, but out of luck and cheesing.

I'd like to see water content get an AOW3-style update again, and if they could fix the sound that nymphs make when they run, which is far too harsh at the moment, that would be lovely. But I couldn't be happier with the game overall. It deserves to be more highly rated than 'very positive'.

I am completely re-writing my review of AOW4 after having played about up to day 50 on my current campaign (game number 4 now, I'm still learning the game) and already I can see  that this game isn't just good, it's a truly great game (imho).
  
The short answer is that I give it a solid 9/10.  Buy it.  

The longer answer is that if you are thinking of buying it because you are a 4x or Civ sim fan, you're going to want to have this one in your library. Age of Wonders 3 was a great game, (imo) and I can already see that AOW4 is even better. The minute I found out that there was an AOW4 (I didn't even know Triumph was working on AOW4!), I went home and bought it IMMEDIATELY and I am not disappointed!

So what makes this game special?  I'm just going to break things down by topic, things you might want to know about AOW4.

PLAY IT YOUR WAY

Even before you start a new game, there are a TON of options up front on how to set up the game, set up the game world and how to set up your race along with advanced features like turning off victory conditions, or choosing up to 8 traits for your game world.  There are SO many options in this phase of the game that you should expect to spend an hour or two just going through all the options.  Admittedly, it's a bit overwhelming at first, but as soon as you start catching on how the game is set up and played, you'll see the genius of AOW4's setup mode. Create any kind of world you like! Create any species you like.  If you want to be an army of holy rats, you can do it.  Maybe you want to be a frog army that uses ice magic, you can do it.  You can make the game as easy as you want or as ridiculously difficult as you want.  Whether you are a casual player who just wants to kick back and relax, or you are a hard core player that wants some extreme challenges, AOW4 has you covered.

THE USER INTERFACE

One of my favorite things about AOW4 is just how much better the UI looks and feels than it did in AOW3.  The interface is obviously designed for large format screens (2.7k/4k) and it looks fantastic.  I'm not sure how the UI scales down, but I think it probably will work at 1080p.  AOW4 doesn't have screen size settings (like 4k or 1080p), instead they use a quality setting that you can adjust to make the game perform better by reducing detail.  Again, something fresh and new with AOW4.  The way the UI is laid out makes absolute sense once you start playing and Triumph has managed to take a TON of game mechanics and polish them with a UI that makes sense and is easy to work with.  Again, there are going to be a ton of in-game options, and AOW4 tooltip system makes everything clear and easy to understand.

THE MAGIC

At the very core of AOW4 is the magic system, implemented by various magical tomes that range from tier I through tier 5 in power.  I don't know exactly home many tomes there are total, but there are at LEAST 20 tomes (maybe more) and these books are central to casting magic.  Spells fall into several affinity categories, and from there each affinity has 5 tomes (I think).  Magic comes in two forms:  Strategic spells that are cast on the world map and tactical spells that are used in battle.  It doesn't matter what race or class you are, you can learn any of the research into spells, but of course you start the game with affinity of 2 research trees.  Spells are not an afterthought in AOW4, they are at the very core to the game and there are a TON of tomes and spells to learn.  

THE RESEARCH SCREEN

Like other 4x games, you can get buffs and abilities as you progress, and AOW4 has a great research screen where you can choose even more options (on top of the options you already picked) on what buffs or abilities you race has, or how the game is played.  If you later add tomes to your collection, you can open up more research paths than the initial 3 paths you have at the start.  Again, you can go up any tree of magic, but like most 4x games, there's a trade off.  The deeper you go in one tree the less points you have  to spend on other trees, or you could go for a more balanced approach.  The other trade off is that you can use Imperium to expand your city, or to pump into research.  You have to choose:  Go bigger or get better? I haven't even gone through all of the options yet and I've played 4 games now.

COMBAT

One thing that sets AOW4 apart from other games like Civilization 5 or 6 is that AOW4 is, at it's heart a game of conquering and conquest, and the combat system is right up front.  You can choose the AI to fight battles for you, or you can enter the battle screen and fight your enemy turn by turn on many various battlefields.  Again, it is obvious that AOW4 is going to throw some more variety in the mix to keep things interesting.  If you want to add other victory conditions like expansion, magic research, allied victory or highest score, you can do so in the game options before the start of the game.  If you turn off all the other victory conditions, the only one you cannot turn off is the ""Military"" victory condition, which makes total sense.  When AOW4 is stripped down to it's core, it's a game about combat.

 TOTAL IMMERSION

From the very first screen, AOW4 wants to suck you in with nice music, fantastic fantasy art and, of course, great game play. The theme is ""fantasy"" and boy does that include a lot!  The narrator of the game fits perfectly in this fantasy setting.  The musical score is subtle, and nice.  The other thing I noticed is that the diplomacy mechanics seem to work better than AOW3, and AOW4 is constantly throwing variety at you.  Your citizens come to you often with problems in the empire and you have to make decisions on how you want to handle them, and actions have consequences. You usually have several options to choose from on how you want to react. Also, alignment is a big part of the diplomacy mechanics of AOW4 so you want to watch out for being naughty or nice because your actions will have consequences.  Once you start figuring out the game, you'll realize how much work went into making it.

At the end of the day AOW4 is greater than the sum of it's parts.  AOW4 is a VERY polished game considering it only came out a few weeks ago.  This is a solid game that has obviously been designed by really enthusiastic developers that wanted to put out a great product from the very start.  I'm already a huge fan of Paradox games, and this game falls in line with other 4x games out there.  So far I have not run into a single technical problem or bug.  AOW4 does NOT feel like a re-tread of AOW3, but it takes the best things about AOW3 and makes them even better.

4x games are notably similar in mechanics and game play to one another, so AOW4 has gone out of its way to make the 4x experience feel more like an adventure than a turn after turn grind.  And if you don't like the options you picked, you can always start a new game.

If you are already a fan of games like Endless Legend or Age of Wonders 3, you will probably love AOW4!

Lastly, and this is an important point, you get a COMPLETE game when you spend your $50 to buy AOW4.  No expansions necessary, there are enough options and game mechanics to sink a ship in AOW4.  AOW4 is a complete game, and even if Triumph is planning on putting out expansions, I really don't see what they could add to the game that isn't already in the game.  This is not a ""release for beta test"" game.  It really is a completed, finished product.

Hope this all helps!  I'm going back to playing my game.  =)",1683951550,1684092151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Create a nation whose ruler is of a different racial Form than their subjects.  Like, you could make an elf witch who is the queen of the frog people.  Or a rat man who rules a nation of cats.
-You can expand your city into the territory of a neighboring city IF you are at war with that nation AND your city has gained enough population to expand its borders AND you move an army directly onto the province building.  Then you just click the button at the bottom, the one with the two self-circling arrows, and tell it to take over that province.  It usually takes one turn, and then ownership of that tile converts to your control.  Of course, it usually makes more sense to just besiege the city center and try to capture the whole domain, but sometimes you may not have good enough armies to defeat their entire defensive force.
-You can move over and across mountains.  You can’t build city provinces on them (as far as I know) so that made me think mountains were impassable obstacles.  But they’re not!  It just eats up a ton of movement points to go from one hex to another if you’re trying to pass through mountain terrain.  It’ll take you a few turns to get up and over, that’s all. 


Things you CAN’T do:
-Win a military victory by simply making an alliance with ALL of the nations on the map.  I tried that.  The other nations were all a bunch of nice guy goodie-two-shoes, so I figured it would be real easy to convince them all to join me.  And it was easy, but when it came time to ally-up with the final empire, it said the ruler couldn’t join me because there were too many alliances.  I guess I should have expected that, huh?

Anyway, my analysis:

AoW4 wants you to get lost in the customizability and replayability it offers.  And that’s great, BUT, just so you know, the options available to you right now are focused on a very familiar set of High Fantasy tropes.  If you want to play as cultist robots or time-traveling stock brokers or psychic squids from R’lyeh, that’s not part of what you can do (yet).  You can play as righteous feudal Orcs or tree-loving Dwarfs or necromantic Hobbits from Hell.  Greco-Roman-esque Mole-folk.  You can create Mana-addicted Blood Elves who live in actual Silvermoon City.

Don’t get me wrong, if you’re into role-playing and story-telling, the tools you have here can go a long way, actually.  And the gameplay underpinning all of that is still top-notch, even if the novelty of crafting your own civilizations starts to wear thin after you’ve built one of each of the six Culture options you have to pick from.  There’s still plenty of room to mix and match the different affinities and tomes and all that.

Another thing I want to address:  There’s an “Expansion Pass” available for sale for another fifty bucks.  I’ve looked at what you get with the pass, and the base prices of all the expansions combined is still only 60 dollars.  Paying ten or twenty bucks every quarter for a new set of features probably makes more sense for a lot of us than plonking down fifty bones right after shelling out that much just to get the base game.  I guess it just depends on your finances, but lordy have mercy.

I should also mention the performance:  I’ve only done single-player, but I’ve read that some people are running into problems with the multiplayer support, so be aware of that.

For me, I have a recent-ish, okay-ish laptop with very poor graphics support.  I turned the graphics quality down to Medium.  I have to say, the performance overall has been far better than I would have expected given my specs.  I wasn’t even sure the game would run at all!  To my eyes, Medium graphics quality looks pretty good.  But I’m probably easier to please than many of you.  Still, in my opinion, the performance has been outstanding.  I’ve seen others making the same remark, too.

AoW4 is, as of now, one of my favorite games of all time.  Certainly my favorite 4X.  I’m an Explorer-type gamer.  I’m not a power-gamer, nor am I an achievement-hunter.  I want games that let me sit down and cook up weird stories and weird ideas, and then let me sit down and see how those ideas play out in the mechanics.  AoW4 is a game that gives me exactly what I want in that respect.  I couldn’t have asked for better.

Paying 50 bucks for a game is a big deal for me.  But Age of Wonders 4 is not going on sale any time soon.  It’s already being hailed as Game of the Year by people whose opinion I take seriously.  So it was either pay the whole price now, or wait like five or six years for a seasonal sale to come around and finally knock it down to 80% off.  You know?  Well, I’m here to tell you I’m glad I decided to risk paying full price.  It was worth it.  This is one of my favorite games.

AoW4 is a great game. Everything is really well tought-out and it shows. I had a very distinct feeling that the devs of this game actually bothered to play it. I was totally hyped when I started playing. I have only two big reservations. Music is horrible compared to previous installments. Even after 80 hours I couldn't get used to it. They try to implement several paralell motives but it doesn't work and the result is cacophony. Soundtrack is better replaced with previous AoW. AoW 3 in my case, with a splash of AoW 1. Last campaign mission is stupid tough. Not cool. Instead of challenging it quickly becomes a boring chore of defeating vastly superior foe on every turn. Very distinct ""Warlock - Master of Arcane"" feeling. Feels like a sequel to that game. I liked it, so it's not a bad thing. It's just that the vibe is there and it's quite strong.


Good:
+ Not perma combat healing. This changes how you play the game. Love it.
+ Adjacency bonuses and abilities. Awesome for tactical gameplay.
+ Separate build queue for buildings and units. Godsend...
+ Vassals are permanent after reaching the end. This makes a lot of sense and peacekeeprs a great choice.
+ Combat casting points not shared over fights in a turn. Much better!!!
+ Can cast in any combat. No extra penalties for not having the main hero in the army.
+ Unicorns leave rainbow trails.
+ Appreciate that there are no achievements tied to difficulty.

Bad:
- Not adjustable camera angle. Fights seem somehow too far. I like more detail. Can zoom in, but that's not what I mean.
- Didn't do proper unit voices - generic grunts are probably worse than nothing at all.
- Lackluster unit leveling compared to previous installments. I used to care about every single unit back then, taking care of them used to be very rewarding. Every new rank they felt stronger. Now I don't care. Just more HP and +10% dps +some minor improvement.
- Arctic climate is now depressing. Used to be romantic. Frostlings are no longer cool to play.

Other:
* Hero spells have been turned into abilities. This simplifies the game but also makes every hero feel the same.
* I believe this to be the golden age for this game. Quickly play it before they destroy it by dumbing it down as in Planetfall. The DLCs will probably destroy the relative balance, although since they are not based so much on opposition as they were in Planetfall, it might not do so much harm.

A worthy successor, a very pleasant surprise, redefines the genre standars. A gem to play. Just turn off the horrible ""music"".",1683878386,1684083651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are great

Pace is good

Variety of tech trees to focus on for replay/variable strategies

Unique buildings for each race/type if you will

Cons:
The item drops are kind of generic, I wish they had a better variety that you get from exploring.  But I a sure some modders could improve this area.

AI Turns take a long time even on normal maps when playing on hard etc, which is what I focus on, because of the number of units the AI has to move but it is worth dealing with.  Hopefully the devs can do some further optimization in this area.

It combines the classic 4X strategy and turn-based tactical combat that I love, with a new and innovative magic system that adds a lot of depth and replayability.

The game lets you create your own fantasy empire by choosing from a variety of physical forms, traits, cultures and societies. You can make anything from angelic elves to demonic dwarves, or even mix and match different elements to create your own unique race. The customization options are endless, and each choice affects how your empire grows and interacts with others.

The magic system is the highlight of the game for me. You can seek out powerful tomes of magic that grant you access to different schools of magic, such as fire, death, nature and chaos. Each tome unlocks new spells, units and abilities that you can use to shape the world and your people. You can even transform your people physically by using magic, making them more suited for different environments or combat roles.

The game also features a rich story-driven campaign that spans multiple worlds, each with their own challenges and secrets. You can play as one of the Wizard Kings, who are trying to become gods by mastering the tomes of magic, or as one of their mortal champions, who are fighting for their freedom and survival. The campaign is full of twists and turns, and your choices have consequences that affect the outcome.

Age of Wonders 4 is a game that I did not expect to fall in love with, but I did. It is a game that offers a lot of variety, challenge and fun, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy strategy games.

On race/wizard customization screen hard to see what is changing cause of bad lighting and zoom options.
No quicksave hotkey - only from menu. Some hotkeys cannot be reassigned. Hotkey cannot be easily cleared.
After exiting menu the whole screen blinks.
Almost no options to control camera. Initial speed of battle, speed of overland movement, what/who to observe.
Abysmal overlapping tooltips with hyperlinks producing more tooltips, obscuring buttons you need to click cause tooltip popups over it while you move mouse and doesn't disappear.
Fast floating messages, kinda important maybe, but never was fast enough to read them.

IMPOSSIBLE to remove city ruins to reclaim province and its resources!
SIEGES lasting up to 10 turns (even with siege projects), that means your army just idle doing nothing unable to leave. For 10 turns. With general turn limit on a game equal 150 turns.

Customization that removes any sense. Like mixing all (and each affinity has opposite one) affinities in same wizard/playthrough. Unending research that forced to select tomes even if you don't want to.

AI that tend to do stupid things like creating a town next to you that cannot acquire provinces, moving armies from one point to another and back next turn for dozens of turns. AI duplicates equipment from nothing on each new hero, hiring several dozens of new units with high lvl heroes each several (3-4) turns without any limitations on possible money, mana or whatever even after razing half of it's cities.

Victory conditions are bland, technically there's just 2 - kill everyone (with allies who will not help you ever cause of stupidity) or build 3 structures and wait 15 turns (on big enough map any AI will just fail to get to these structures in time).

In general this is downgrade to planetfall with more vivid graphics and magical scent in it.

Sadly this game is just a shadow of the former Age of Wonders games. So much of the exotic and complex game play of the previous AoW games is gone. This game is just bland. The races you play and encounter are just cosmetic, no longer matter at all. The spells and magic system is just copy/pasted variations with slight changes. The biomes no longer matter. It used to be a hugely impactful thing fighting in hostile terrain with races that hated snow/swamp/desert/etc.

Even visually, for a 2023 game it's just bland. The world maps are uninspired and small compared to previous AoW games. Want to play on a large map with a small number of factions? Good luck with that. Want to play on the surface or underground only? Nope, no longer.

The combat system seems to have gotten the most amount of attention, and it's okay. But it gets slow and boring as you play a map. I end up auto-resolving almost every battle unless the AI borks it, and then I manually resolve it.

If a game developer comes across this... Please, for the love of god, add the option to raze or ""cleanse"" cities of evil factions without becoming evil myself. Really any other option other than another vassal would be nice, especially to free up that territory for your own expansion.

The Bad: AI

The AI does not really interact with one another, and in Story 5 (Normal) it's really on full display at its worst.
- Friendly AI was actively choking off my territories with outposts in just the first few turns basically turning it into a 1v7 by turn 20
- Enemy AI was attacking me on all 3 borders having just simply waltzed through Friendly territory to do so, without any conflict whatsoever
- Enemy Hostile infestations never/rarely appeared to attack Friendly or Enemy AIs, or vis versa
- In game 1, the enemy AI had a magical victory triggered around turn 65 and friendly AI walked armies up to enemy borders and just walked around which left me to have to try and solo conquer 4 factions and traverse the entire map in 15 turns... spoiler, I didn't.
- In game 2, after I stopped enemy Magical Victory by sheer dumb luck, the enemy AI sort of just stopped playing the game for 30+ turns and then when I went to cast for Magical Victory, it kept attacking 2 naked outposts for all 15 turns, only to abandon the sieges the turn before killing them...

Pros:

1. The race customization and world customization are great!  Stop putting your elves in trees, everyone knows they belong in an industrial setting and evolved on the planes in barbaric hordes.  Use your imagination a bit, stop the old tropes.  Make your race whatever you want.  

2. The scenarios are actually pretty good.  No replay-ability at all, but much better than the older AOW games.  They are still a bit puzzle like, but perhaps more than one solution exists since you pick your own race and customize it. 

3.  I love the tree system for choices.  It looks simple.  It is simple, combine it with many different possibilities.  

4. The battles are fun.  Has the right amount of control.  Feels just about right. 

5. DLC and Workshop will make this game perfect

Cons:

1. The end game. It's horrible!

For example, I just played a massive 8 player game.  Unless you turn off magic and explore victory you'll likely never see the AI players except for your scouts.  Even on a small map it's incredibly easy to pull off a magic victory.  In my massive 8 player game, it took me 102 turns.   I knew I had won by about turn 80.  What a slog.  hit the end turn, wait a minute, hit it again.  Autofight a battle for the seed.  YAWN!  Common guys, you can do better than this!  The problem is with larger maps there is no player that will be able to march an army over and stomp on your seeds of victory.  The AI went crazy my last game.  All my enemies instantly ask to be my ally.  The friends went the opposite direction.  4 players allied with me suddenly.  What the heck?  Made no sense.  I guess they wanted to jump in on the victory?  

Fix the end game, make it more interesting.  80% of the game is great.  The end sucks.  By the time you get some nice T5 units you'll never use them in combat (unless you want to fight the useless end game mobs it throws at you).  I've decided to turn off all victory conditions except military.  It's the only one worth playing.

Game is addicting and very fun, when it works.  Singleplayer I have had no issues so far.  But multiplayer is a f*cking jumbled mess.  Literally at the start of every turn, desync, twice every manual combat, desync.  Opponents moving...game crashes.  We've been soft locked where everytime the opponents are moving, it would crash and would have to revert to the previous round or we CANNOT continue the game.  That being said, it will reset your awards if you've collected any during that previous round and I assume to prevent save scumming, the game would reduce your rewards as well (from what we've experienced).  Sometimes when the opponents are moving, my game would just freeze and I would have to task manager close it.  My buddy got a blue screen once during the frozen opponents are moving screen.

At the current time of this review if you want to play with friends, I really cannot recommend it.  You will spend about 40% of your playtime restarting the game and reverting rounds.  But if you do want to play it solo, I would say go for it, there is plenty of content for you to do with all the scenarios.  Faction creation is super neat too.  You have a decent amount of options to choose from.

Honestly, I can't think much else to put here review wise. It really is just fantasy Civ, but with a lot of fleshed out fantasy systems, such as: 

Player spell casting which can impact your units through permanent enchants and mutations, the world and tiles, enemy armies; 

Unit battles are grid-based, turn-based combat which is just as competent as others in regards to skill and unit variety, also player combat casting here too;

Unique civilization creation, lots of fantasy races to choose from as a base, with different ruling types and affinities, traits which will influence everything about your play and the roleplay you'll have with other rulers.

After 7h I only just finished my first game. So far I haven't encountered any bugs, the game runs fine, the UI (for a super complex game) is very convenient. Everything is in the right place. Even little details are implemented in a way that just makes sense.

E.g. when manually saving the game (there is autosave as well), the savegame name defaults to something along the lines of ""important turn XY"" to distinguish it from the autosaves. Of course you can change the text, but the default one makes sense and manually saving a game becomes a very quick two click affair.

Or another detail: When starting the game you have the option (right away, before the game loads) to continue your last game. It even shows you the name of your last savegame. Click that button, and without having to skip any menus the game boots straight into the last savegame. Compare that to Forza Horizon, where you CAN'T EVEN HAVE different savegames, and which makes you wait 5x before you actually sit behind the wheel.

The game feels really polished, I haven't encountered a single bug yet and performance has been decent. It can definitely slow down a bit during large sieges but it doesn't bother me too much given that this is a turn based game. Turn times are also fairly quick, probably quicker than Civ 5/6.

The environments and enemy designs look great which makes exploring a joy. The UI is also pretty good although not perfect. For example I wish I would not have to confirm every turn that a unit should continue on the path I set before without turning off notifications for that unit altogether. The game also features the same tool-tip system as CK3/Victoria 3 which makes learning the game easy. You can just hover over any word you do not understand and a popup with more information will open. 

I didn't love the combat at first but the more I'm playing the more I get into it. Choosing buildings in your city also feels meaningful with many building providing more creative bonuses than just +10 gold/mana/whatever.

A highlight is definitely the option to create your own race. I think Stellaris is still the gold standard in that domain but for me AOW is right behind it. By finishing games you also unlock some more visual customisation options which is a nice incentive to keep playing. I wish more games would do something like that. 

Speaking of finishing games, another thing I like about Age of Wonders 4 is that games do not overstay their welcome. A single game might last 100 turns until it is over. The smaller scale helps avoiding the late game slog endemic to this genre, where you just throw doom stacks at the AI until you get to bored to continue.  

As a standalone game, this is better than the Civilisation games in my opinion. Granted, no one play these games without DLC, so I hope this games also receives enough post launch support to keep it fresh.

Now the not so good to terrible. Desync all the things anytime you play multiplayer, typically once per battle, never on campaign map except over end turns. This game is horribly optimized, it doesn't feature a standard resolution option like every other, so if you have a 4k monitor the game just runs in 4k, and so on. There are work arounds but they have to be reapplied every single time you play. Enemies will field far more stacks then you easily, despite smaller cities and resource pools. Their heroes rank up much faster even while abstaining from combat, (some level 11 when yours are 3-4 despite fighting every turn). Be prepared for some very unfavorable engagements even on normal difficulty.

Now the worst, really hoping this gets remedied asap. EVERY SINGLE TIME the game or ANY mod you are using gets updated, ALL of your multiplayer sessions will fail to load indefinitely. You cannot force the game to load and update the mods like it would in other titles, you cannot revert the mods back to previous versions of themselves to resume, you cannot force steam to simply never update worship content unless you are unplugged and cannot do multiplayer without a LAN cable. So basically you can play vanilla, or you can play single player with mods, but you can't do multiplayer with mods at least during this time.

Absolutely adored AOW3, multiplayer didn't suffer from any of these issues, hoping #4 can get there. This game has utter loads of potential, but if you were like me and paid for the premium and all potential DLC, had a bunch of mates do the same only to find out they can't play together the way they want, well upsetting is an understatement.",1684003369,1684003369,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

It reminds me a bit of Heroes of Might and Magic 5 in some ways with your heroes and armies and the tile based, turn based combat system.

The graphics are pretty good, I get the feeling there might be some balancing issues, but.. I don't know what they may or may not be since everything seems powerful in its own right.

The customization of your faction is absolutely amazing, I love it, 10/10. My only issue is I wish there was more customization and some of the traits seem more powerful than others in terms of gameplay. One common trait I seen taken up is Overwhelming Tactics, since a 20% buff to crit chance is pretty nutty, ngl. I get the feeling the game is going to get more fleshed out over time in terms of customization, kind of like how Stellaris was fleshed out more and more by DLCs. 

The combat is pretty tight and the music.. awww man the music. It really does a great job of setting the tone. I really want to hear more of this composer's work. The battles where you are uncertain of the outcome and fields of trampled grass plays.. mmmm so good.

I hope the devs listen to criticism and take some things to heart.

My recommendation is buy the game, try it out for about 2 hours and decide if you like it or not. If you don't you can always get a refund via Steam's refund policy. I've been hooked onto it, and I hope to see this game grow and change into something greater over time. 

---------

Now I'd like to address some of the complaints and negative reviews I've seen. Mainly from the old timer AOW players. I want to go over just a couple complaints and then respond to them.

Things they don't like:

1. Racial Identity is non-existent. The common claim is that races are just amorphous blobs, stripped of any identity, but I think that is kind of the point. You are given the creative freedom to mold and shape your own unique race based on racial attributes, culture, societal traits, tomes, and more! You want Angelic barbaric warrior halfings, go nuts! You want to engage in some Nature oriented Heavy Industry Elves, have at it! You want some Frozen Orc Paladin holy orders running around, heck yeah! The race itself has the identity you choose to give it, rather than it being pre-defined. With the customizations in place you can have oh so much variety and options in your playstyle. It opens more doors than it closes. More playstyle variety. Take for example Orcs in AOW3. They got +5 health +1 Melee ATK -1 Ranged ATK (Going from an example I saw in a post, this could be inaccurate) This naturally gears those orcs to a specific playstyle of melee oriented. This is very restrictive, if you want to play ranged you can, but its already putting you behind the other factions. In AOW4, you can easily swap traits for the build you want. In AOW4 you could give your orcs Keen-sighted and give them a 30% accuracy on ranged attacks, so you could live out your wild orc hunters fantasy, or expert longbow orcs, whatever really.  I think its a rather boring world where every orc is exactly the same, every halfling is exactly the same, every human, every elf, etc. etc. More customization is never a bad thing in my opinion. Variety is the spice of life, as they say.

2. Micromanagement removal. From what I've read, a lot of old AOW players are mad that a bunch of micromanagement elements were taken out, like Settlers for example. Honestly, they can ditch that stuff if you ask me. Getting rid of micromanagement makes the game more accessible to new players. Reason being, it doesn't have as steep of a learning curve to 'git gud' at it. I love RTS and TBS games, but they do have learning curves to them, steeper than ones in say.. an FPS game. The more micromanagement you add to it, the steeper the learning curve becomes and the less appealing it is to new players to get into. I, personally, don't like to micromanage every little detail, I don't need to personally touch every single grain of rice my farmers farm. (Exaggeration, but you get my point lol.) There's a reason the term micromanagement is typically associated in a bad light, its tedious and most of the time, not enjoyable, but.. apparently not the case with AOW oldheads.

3. No unique racial units. This has been addressed by many before. Culture wasn't a thing back in previous iterations of AOW. Racial units have been moved over to Culture, so you still have the racial units just under a different name and thus giving you even more diversity of your chosen units. A Ratfolk Berserker, Human Berserker, and dwarf Berserker might all be different based on their Mind/Body traits. Hell the Ratfolk berserker might be more skirmishy, weaving in and out of the fight to hit weakened targets. The Human berserker might rank up faster and still do massive damage even when half the units are whacked. The dwarf berserker might be extraordinarily tough and fight in formation with other dwarven berserkers leading to a +3 bonus in their total defenses making them extraordinarily tanky frontliners. The racial traits can be swapped at faction creation too so you can have all manner of unique and interesting combinations and playstyles!

Like it or not, change is happening. It seems the devs want to simplify things somewhat so new players can get engaged with the series and with this engagement.. you get more players who will potentially look at the previous titles and give them a shot and then make their own judgement calls.

With a lot of the hate and vitriol some old timers are spewing in the discussions and reviews section, I think I'd rather stay away from AOW3 and its predecessors given how toxic these people are coming across. I get it, I really do. This feeling of spite and anger, that's what I feel towards World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Games that had better times in their past and changed for worse in present day. That doesn't mean change isn't good, it just isn't what we want. Overwatch and WoW made changes that made it easier for newer players to get into, which is basically what AOW4 is doing. It's going to alienate the oldtimers but bring in some fresh blood. Face it, you just don't like change, even if its beneficial because you're set in the old ways. I get it, I really do.

At the time of this review its sitting at an 83% positive (Which is 2% greater than AOW3 :P) They must be doing something right, but only time will tell if this changes. For now, I stand by this review. It's a good game in my opinion.",1683997396,1683997585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My experience comes mostly from the campaign. The last mission was terrible. It's supposed to be 4v4+the player (4v5) but in my case it was 3v3 for the most time. The orc starts with lots of vassals that spam flying AOE mages and sends groups of 3 stacks one after another, so it's really hard to take any vassal out and defend your new cities. I've defeated him by some miracle when I yolo-ed across 1/3 of the map with 3 of my  stack while being chased by 5-6 full stacks. 2 of my AI friends were trying to defend against 1 enemy kitty, and the kitty was winning before I came to help after dealing with the orc. 1 AI from each side were AFK the whole game, my last ally was able to take out his opponent (almost lost at some point), and then went AFK for the rest of the game defending 4 of his cities with 5-6 full stacks each when NO ONE attacked him. I've played that on easy and it took me about a whole day worth of hours. Not a single other mission in this game or missions played on normal in AoW3 or Planetfall was such a drag. 

There are other things I'm not happy about, but they aren't as important. I really wasn't looking to play more after that last mission. Can't recommend right now.",1683994379,1683994379,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are new to Age of Wonders franchise, this game can be good and entertaining for a few days, but if you have played any of the previous entries.... you will be sorely disappointed. The game is a wildly scaled down version compared to any of the other entries, and while there are a lot of ""customization"" options, none of them mean anything at all.

After start phase of game there is nothing new or meaningful to do in the game, just an extremely boring grind. All the coolest features of the previous games have also been either taken out completely, or been implemented only party.

Sad to say it, but this game has about 20% of the mechanics/content even compared to AoE2: Shadow Magic that was released in 2003.

Alternatively, if you get this with a bunch of new players to a 4X type of game, then it could be worth the laugh and adventure.. but it all falls away after the first game or two.

Stellaris, Civ6, Age of Empires, Warhammer40k.. the list goes on. Sure, there's magic and stuff but its just another point system in a lacking economy anyway.

I was very skeptical at first due to the incomplete nature that Paradox tends to release their games in, but this was a surprise. I might not be the biggest fan of 4X games, but I enjoyed playing Age of Wonders 3 many years ago and decided to give this game a shot. In short, this game is very good for anyone who enjoys fantasy war games and city builders. There are loads of customization options and builds that you can use, each with a unique playstyle. If you want a deeper review then I'll post one below, but in short, it's a solid game.

Customization (9/10)
I'm going to start with the customization that the game provides you with since there are an insane amount of combinations you can use. There are 6 different empire types you can play as (Feudal, High, Dark, Astral, Barbarian, and Industrious) all containing unique mechanics and units that make them play completely different from one another. Personally, I found Astral to be the most powerful and most enjoyable but unlike many other games, all 6 can easily become the best when used correctly. The gap between them is almost non-existant, Astral just caters to how I like playing these kinds of games and thus is the one I stuck with. From the 6 empire types, you can also pick from 10-12 races each having unique traits and mechanics. These range from the normal humans and elves to frogkin and even moles. From here, you can create a custom ruler with an endless amount of cool armors, helmets, and other customization options including some that you can unlock by playing the game. There are multiple classes that your ruler can be, each being good in their own way (although wizards and summoners are better). I don't really have any complaints besides I wish they had more knight helmets because I am a huge sucker for knights. Very very good job on this front. 

Campaign Map (9/10) + City Building (5/10)
The first major part of the game is the campaign map and city management. There are an incredible amount of different maps that each have different mechanics depending on where you play. Some maps may have more of some resource than another. Some may have certain types of monsters whereas some may have irritating combat mechanics (crimson caldera lololol). There are lots of cool locations to explore and a wide variety of mob packs that roam the map. The infestations are neat and I really like the ancient wonders. On the other hand the city building, in my opinion, is pretty lackluster and was something I didn't really care for. You basically just queue up a building or unit without much thought into it. I didn't really care about specing my cities since I could just build everything at some point. The defensive buildings are totally useless when playing singleplayer (which is what I play since my friends are all FPS people) because the AI rarely ever attacks you. There are no barracks or recruiting centers and a lot of the time you won't even really be using your own units since, in my case, summoning units or collecting units tends to be better anyway. Overall, the campaign map and design was really good, the city building is really lame. The game also seems to suffer from what I deem the ""Paradox effect"" which makes the game become duller as time goes on. The start and early midgame are really fun but then you get too powerful and the game becomes a slog to finish. It's a shame but I felt myself getting annoyed after playing a certain amount of turns.

Combat (5/10)
Combat is difficult to gauge review-wise for me. Overall, I think the combat was alright. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't terrible either. The AI is actually competent when it comes to combat and tends to play to their advantage. Magic was fun to use, especially when you build around it. The massive variety of units provided a nice refreshing mix of things to fight. The problem was that the combat itself just felt dull and repetitive. It never really felt satisfying killing units and honestly I didn't really care for the battles that much. The base speed for the combat is way way too slow so thankfully they added a speed increase option because the animations are really sluggish. For some reason, I got insane lag on giant battles which made them frustrating to play (and yes, I have a very good PC that has never had lag problems). It just felt very mediocre. I'm not sure if it's because I have been gradually trending away from games the past couple years, making them harder to have fun in them or whether the combat wasn't satisfying, but I didn't enjoy it all that much.

Graphics (9/10)
This game looks surprisingly good and is a huge upgrade over Age of Wonders 3. The unit details are really good and the atmosphere just feels nice. No complaints here.

AI (7/10)
Wow, a Paradox game has good combat AI? Insane, I know. The AI when fighting you is actually good and makes fighting them a challenge. The problem is that the campaign AI is still as braindead as the rest of Paradox's AIs. They will refuse to kill nearby stacks and half the time won't even try and raid your territory. They just run around like a chicken with its head cut off. Thankfully, good combat AI makes up for it. 

Research and Tomes (10/10)
Now this is something that I loved about this game. The sheer amount of different tomes that you can use is so cool to me. Each tome has cool buffs, units, or spells that you can apply to your arsenal and the best part is, they aren't locked behind your starting one. You are free to research and use whatever you want and that provides some really fun combinations. The fact the stuff you research actually appears on your soldiers and leader is also really awesome. It might be weird, but I absolutely loved this part of the game. 

UI (7/10)
Paradox creating a decent UI is weird to me, but well, here it is. This game has an easy to use and learn UI that explains basically everything in it. It can be difficult to find certain things and I'm not a fan of the health bars that units have in combat, but overall, I didn't have many issues with it. Having a good UI in a strategy game cannot be stressed enough, so it's a big positive from me. 

Music (7/10)
Eh, it's alright. Nothing special but not an insta-mute.

Conclusion
The game is solid and is certainly something I would recommend to fans of the 4X genre. Is it the greatest game in the world? No. Is it Paradox's best game? Not even close. However, the game is still fun and contains an incredible amount of customization that people can play around with.

I feel like from all age of wonders, AoW4 was truly made for me as someone who likes to both roleplay and build weirder and weirder combinations and working around any possibly weakness that combo will have.  

If you just wanna min max as much as possible, you might not enjoy this game as much especially if you're very centered into just being a powergamer and playing with only the best of the best possible combinations, watching tier lists like a drone on youtube to figure out the perfect combo and take out all the experimentation allows you to do from yourself by learning through others.

But if you wanna do crazy stuff and just ROLL the world by being good at the game instead while still roleplaying then this is the game for you.

I literally ask anyone who comes home to make a character with me and from that i got: 
1. evil aligned imperialistic druid toad domaining a water dominated world with sea monsters 
2. evil aligned underground earth altered, stone titan (the tier 5 materium hero upgrade) world destroyer cats 
3. good aligned goblin knights with a tendency for questing and exploring ancient wonders
4. good aligned flying demon barbarian orcs uniting free cities against a demon king
5. fanatical greenpeace angel cats terraforming into a giant forest a sandworld filled with undead creatures and barren sand oceans
6. Ice feudal mage queen filling a desolate world with ice in a dragon infested land
7. giant high elves with steel skin that dabble into undead summoning to protect their blessed holy archers

and there's a bunch of others but i'm just about done for now writing this review i wanna go back to playing

Imo this game has the most experimentation age of wonders ever had, any dlc added to this game will have so many ramifications on new combinations that I can't but just be excited for the future and I really hope this game just keep on giving.

Original review: 

I just played the game for 11 hours straight, I stomped some elves and humans under my imperial molekin boot and after putting a world in flames i already started my second game as a barbarian meele mage in a max difficulty dune like world full of infestations that respawn every 10 turns or so.

I'm addicted, its certainly different from age of wonders 3 and i do miss some of the cultural faction uniqueness (where are my shuriken throwing tigrans from AoW 3 for example) but its a very worthy sequel and i think it has amazing dlc potential already

First Edit (May 3th 2023, 10:16 p.m. 25.7 Hours Played):

Pro's:

- The sound and music is pretty good.
- Some of the art style is ok, but it still feels way too clean in places.
- It's a sandbox 4x fantasy game.

Con's:

- No campaign.....I mean for the price id expect at least a campaign to play through....not just a sandbox 4x fantasy game.
- Poor UI all over the place.
- No keybinds for pretty much anything.
- Boring unit choices at later tiers in many cases.
- Hero upgrade system is uninspiring and boring.
- Smaller combat map sizes and only 3 stacks per side. It just doesn't feel epic.
- Lots of optimisation problems in combat.

So much potential to actually produce a truly meaningful experience but it falls short in way too many areas right now. If they add a campaign, work on the UI, give better unit choices, a better hero system etc - then there is a chance to polish this into a winner.

This is endemic to 4X games in general.

Please, when you give me options for the map, I'd like an option where I can set my enemies where I want them. Why do I have to have them spawn near me, or on the same continent?

I don't play 4X games so I can spend the whole time fighting from turn one.

Because You (the developer) want to create tension that I (the player) do not want, you set up stupid spawn locations. Diplomacy is crap. Stop pretending it isn't. The AI doesn't fight amongst themselves. Basically, it's me vs. the world. The whole world. So, if that's the case, don't let an enemy (all AI are enemies) near me. Give me enough time to build up my stack before I'm involved in an all-out war.

If this is what I want, I would never play any other 4X game other than Warhammer 40000 Gladius. That's, by far, the best 4X wargame out there. They don't waste my time to try and curry favor by setting me up with stupid AI and their stupid diplomatic misgivings.

There is so much wrong with this game, but there is also plenty good with it. Basically, until they release more content, this game is very generic, in a bad way. I'd rather spend my time elsewhere.

There are a few downgrades here and there too, which is a pity, namely the graphics (world and combat map features are nondescript and hard to tell apart, as are units) and the unit customization. But it's mostly just the same boring AI, the same unit abilities with some slight reskins etc. But hey, youtubers hailed this game as one of the best 4x ever for some rea$on, so I must be dreaming...

EDIT: a few more hours in, I need to rectify one thing: the AI is even WORSE than Planetfall's. Units with teleport combat abilities (including the main hero) will happily use them on turn 1 jump ahead of the rest of the army and therefore be destroyed the next turn.

The game is highly unstable and crashes frequently.  The most common way for my games to end is with a crash.  Further, when the game crashes, a bug report is performed which provides you a link to report crashes too.  However, clicking on the link only redirects you to a paradox website which claims you do not have permission to access the website.  The bottom line is that the game is unstable, crashes often and customer support is not accessible from the apparent means to contact them.

What is even the point of having Allies?  The AI is both incredibly stupid and incredibly malicious. 
Playing on story mission 5 normal difficulty.  It is barely turn 20 and there are two enemy AI's constantly throwing 6 stacks at me.  I barely have the resources to build even one army.  The mission gives you 4 ""allies"" but you'd never know there were there.  Because they never come to your help, and instead actively ignore the enemy AI as it tresspasses their lands to attack the player.  Literally every enemy AI, every free city, and all their vassal cities are targeting me, and only me, while my 4 Allies just build massive MASSIVE armies that never leave their borders, or even attack things in their borders.

I want to recommend this game, but holy crap, this not a fun experience.  Wasting hours of a gameplay and you can do absolutely nothing while getting dogpiled.

The ""diplomacy"" is non existent.  Your ""Allies"" basically exist just to be shops to buy and trade things from.  And not even what you want to trade.  Creating Vassal Cities?  For what?  To have an even worse version of an ally that still won't help AND I can't trade with them?  Why?

- Multiplayer is a huge very very big chore to play because of the *constant* desync issues and the fact that every single player decision pauses the game world for everyone (battles especially). Playing online requires far too much patience to be consistently enjoyable
Multiplayer combat is additionally held down by the fact that the game often doesn't differentiate sides for the spectators so watching it becomes even less fun, and if there's a desync during it (which is very probable) you have to rewatch the entire thing from the start. This gets boring really, really fast
- VFX is one of the weakest areas of this game and not up to any modern standards. The art and game world look great so the animations and effects really stand out as subpar. Can't help but be reminded of how amazing HOMM V battles looked in comparison, and that's 17 years old by now
- Most tome content is weak or very situational and doesn't live up to the fantasy of any given theme. Then there are outliers like tome of the horde. Game needs some major tuning imho
Tactical and world spells in general I'd say are a big disappointment in terms of value/impact, especially compared to AOW 2. Feels like the game revolves around stacking buffs and summoning units.
- There's scarcely any big differences in gameplay even between radically different builds. You really have to try and find your own fun with this
- Magic victory is easy, boring and frustrating to play against. Stacking the required buildings together on the edge of the map and standing afk for 15 turns gets stale really fast
- AI behavior is a hit and miss, especially when they are far away from the player or allied/vassalized by you
- Campaign is 5 missions long. lol
- Moving around on the strategic map is *excruciatingly* slow. Glad to have mods fixing this
- Tier 1-2 hero items are boring
- Diplomacy is rather barebones

Things I liked:

- Love the art
- Unit designs are cool
- Many customization options. Shame the gameplay doesn't entirely reflect this
- The traditional empire management / technology research / warfare thing is rather nicely streamlined in my opinion. Game is enjoyable to learn
- Co-op battles are fun
- Empire technology tree is impactful and varied, although you tend to pick the same useful stuff over and over again as long as you have some spare affinity to progress multiple different branches
- The concept of tomes and race transformations, even though it's lacking in delivery
- Doing away with static races, which adds a lot replayability
- Realm customization
- How the strategic map looks
- Events

The ""games are hosted in the cloud and you can get in to make your turn at any time"" thing is a mixed bag for now. It would be cool if the game wasn't utterly plagued by desyncs.

First, i am not complaining about any bugs. I don't care about that one bit as it's a temporary thing that has nothing to do with actual game play.
Second: I am Okay with the direction the dev's have taken this. But they broke this in some very fundamental ways with either being rushed and thus cutting things out, or simply taking a lazy wishy-washy direction. It can be fixed, but again, as it stands, i find this to be a disaster that you will quickly get bored of.

The sad truth is that this game took the same approach that Wizards of the Coast took with D&D. Your race, Does not matter. In fact, there is very little that matters at all.

RACE:
Your race is cosmetic only. COSMETIC. Your custom Skaven/Goblin/Halfling races can be just as strong as Orc beefcakes on steroids even though they are small, and scrawny, even with the sliders all the way up.(in comparison) While this is funny, it's entirely out of place. Seeing goblins live in High-Elf cities is jarring. Your races don't even have they're own cultural appearance anymore as this is a select-able feature that shares the same tile sets across all races. There are no unique racial units making for diverse play styles, as again, everything is the same.

MAGIC:
The Magic system is even worse. Where before we had Magic Alignment, we now get access to EVERYTHING. The only exception is that we can only pick a single Tier 5 spell tome. Towards the end of the game usually. Since there are very few of them and we can still pick up everything else, this leads to a rather Homogenized game experience. It's even worse in multiplayer as there are only 2 real paths (Super Meta) that EVERYONE takes. So unless you have friends that are okay with avoiding this, be prepared for short, intense, blandness.

CULTURE:
It replaces class, im okay with this. This is also where your unit tree is determined. Im not okay that we all get the same appearance and the same units. It's like races dont matter here. (because they dont) There is no racial underlying appearance for your culture. There is no racial deference in your unit tree aside from the cosmetic of (insert form here). The ""unique"" units are now apart of the spell tomes; spell tomes that everyone has equal access to.

SOCIETY:
This is new and i honestly like this. It changes up how er play in a good way. There is allot of potential here and the modding community is already hard at work expanding on this. I expect great things here, especially in a year when 2 or more of the DLC is come out.

AI:
Is profoundly broken in some of the stupidest way i have ever seen. You dislike the races/groups the games provides you to fight against so you make your own super opponents to gift you with that wonderful thing called a challenge. NOPE! Your Uruk-Hai lead by the witch king Angmar, Evil raiders with every advantage and reason to go on a genocidal path of destruction. Only they are stanch Isolationist. They build 2 cities and sit there doing nothing for the rest of the game.
REASON?! The game has decided that this setup should have the Isolationist PERSONALITY and there is nothing you can do about it.

UNDERGROUND:
Allot of us enjoyed the underground life style from previous games. Well, too bad. It's complete trash here. Going underground is actually a major blow to your economy and more. There are no magical resource underground save one or two found in separate city-states. General resources such as Mines and Food boost are limited and scarce. The way the underground is generated in general is mindbogglingly bad. There are few locations that you can even place a city and hope to compete with the surface. These places have City-States in them already. The few others have so little to offer, Typically 2-3 resource deposits, as compared to the dozens above ground and such limited room to expand and grow your city that its a freaking joke.
I do expect this to get a fix, either from devs or modders very soon however due to how unplayable it makes underground races and game play. Unless you like losing every game.

In conclusion this game has lost it's identity. To butcher a line from FLCL, 'They're flatting all the races, smoothing out all the wrinkles so everything is the same.' The play is a Homogenized, flat mess that quickly grows tiresome. It's amazing at first, until you realize that there is nothing unique here in strategy, diversity and approach. A very good example of this is the Tigran race. And no, you cannot recreate old races and strategy's because of the standardized unit tree limitations and hard meta, magic tome scaling. That is not to say there are no strategies to be employed here, but they are limited and limiting. For so many options, there are so few paths and choices.

THIS IS FIXABLE
But i fear it wont be because of the holy white knights from WoTC that have invaded the forums to S*#% on the hundreds that have taken to them in complaint, in protest, solution finding and with suggestions to improve this is constructive ways. They're accounts might say they have allot of time in the game; On the home screen while Shift-Tapped into the discussions ALL DAY LONG. It's easy to spot. They drag discussions down into stupidity with shallow arguments.

Again this can be fixed, in simple ways even. I have doubts the mod community can do this without source code.
(1)
Give us the a third racial slot for terrain preferences only.
(2)
Give us the ability to design our factions unit roster within reason.
(3)
Give each race they're own city and 'maybe' unit appearance that alters with culture choice.
(4)
Limit how many Magic Tomes we can acquire in each Tier.

Simple, stupid, to the point.

As a short clarfication, this review was initially negative, due to some bad first impressions regarding a lack of lore info, like missing unit and race and descriptions. The former is still valid, but the latter was more of a UI issue, since it was just somewhat hidden in the tooltips. I do think that info should be more prominent and should also be a bit expanded, but it's certainly not enough for a negative review.

Anyway, I've since resumed playing, and the game actually has a lot more to offer than I initially thought. It's a bit too early for a full review, but I'd say the positives certainly outweigh the negatives. And since this game is probably the closest to a real worthy Master of Magic successor, I'd certainly recommend it, even if not everything is perfect yet.

I had never heard of this series before, and it wasn't on my radar at all, but all of a sudden all of the Civilizations channels I follow started talking about this game so I gave it a try. So very worth it.

This game is the perfect love child of Civilizations and Heroes of Might and Magic, with a bit of Total War thrown into the mix.  It takes only the best parts of all of those games and mixes them together to create a gameplay loop that is at the same time familiar to fans of those franchises, yet unique enough to be its own thing. City building and diplomacy aspects of Civilization 6 are on display, but combat is much more like the HoMM, which is fantastic in my opinion.

Customization is also king here. Thanks to all of the incredible customization options in this game, I can't even really tell you how many factions there are because every game your units, skills and traits are determined by what you choose to pick, both at the race creation screen but also throughout the game. The first game I played, I was using a race of molemen who used Earth magic to create golems and eventually turn themselves into a race of golden gods. The next game I played a Druid/necromancer hybrid of cat people who's concept was that they descended from Egyptian gods who utilized all beasts, living and dead, to further their goals of conquest. Now I'm playing a race of assassin halflings that's elevated themselves to Angels of despair, being experts in deception, mental manipulation and deadly strikes.
All of this comes from decisions made mid-game, and that really makes you feel in complete control of the direction your civilization is taking.

I'm just raving, so I'll wrap this up. The game is excellent. If you're on the fence, just look up some of the excellent youtube videos and see if this is your type of strategy game. If you do feel even remotely interested after that, take the leap. You won't regret it.",1683835173,1683835173,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

-First you create a realm to play in. This is not a simple random map generator. You get to pick up to 8 modifiers (there are lots to pick from) to the realm you want to create that's basically setting the rules for your game session,and some of those greatly change the way you approach to the game. 
-There are no fixed races. You pick a physical form like humanoids,orcs,rats,toads etc.. You pick a trait from 2 lists of different traits for that race. You want keen sighted molekin? You want desert dwarves? You want bloodthirsty cannibal halflings? You can have them. 
-And then you pick a culture for your people. There are 6 different cultures for now, all with their own versions of basic units and combat/empire building mechanics. 
-And then you pick a starter 'tome'. Tomes are thematically broken down version of the tech tree. Each tome has 4 to 6 technologies you can unlock that are spells,unit enchantments,new units etc.. and most tomes come with unique buildings. As you research new stuff,you will be able to pick new tomes. This modular approach to tech tree is a really cool idea to me because it means your tech tree is fully customizable. You can adapt to your enemies or the realm you play in, or you can stick to your races theme for rp reasons. Even if you play the same realm rules,same race and same culture, picking different tomes means you are playing a completely different empire.
-And then all the choices you made so far regarding your culture,your traits and your tome, give you affinity points with which you unlock empire upgrades during the game. As you get new tomes, you get more affinities and branch out to different paths.

With this amount of customization, the replay value is already great. You can create the races/factions from your favourite franchises or fantasy tropes. Game's pacing is also good, it doesn't feel too quick or too slow.

[h1]The Illusion of choice[/h1]
It looks very polished and units are overall great quality for a 4x game. On the surface the customizabilty of your race and leader is very fun and lets you create your own stories. The minor enchantment / major enchantment system are really cool ideas while simultaneously very disappointing. The minor enchantments add to your race as you modify them in small ways to ""customise"" / adapt your race to fit your chosen technologies. 

This is a really cool idea and I would love it if it didn't break two other major systems that this games predecessors relied on. The problem is you can add every minor enchantments to your race so you don't have to pick and choose who gets what when you can just add every modifier to every race eventually. The same can't be said for Major racial enchantments as these at least are an actual choice but they really are muddled in how much they differentiate themselves from each other as three of the four add mobility based changes that basically do the same thing. They all on paper are different but seem very similar in play probably due to balance reasons but it adds to the muddled feeling.

[u][b]Heroes[/b][/u]
The enchantment system breaks the cool idea of having different racial heroes by making it optimal to choose only heroes of your given race. I love the idea of hiring heroes from my vassals, but why would I use their inferior race as a hero when my race is now made out of gold, is invisible in the forest, and has innate magic resistance? I want to include the diverse elements of my fantasy empire in a playthrough instead optimisation says not picking heroes / units of your chosen buffed race is a poor tactical choice. In this games sci-fi predecessor at least heroes of specific races had unique skills available which made them worth taking. Here they have the exact same skills available outside of a few unique abilities seemingly only available on vassals units which while cool don't change things up enough to make me choose them over my magically enchanted race.

[u][b]Unit diversity and Rally of the Lieges[/b][/u]
Similarly the enchantment system also breaks the choice of using the cool and unique units available from outside of your racial unit pool. The various mythic units of unique and diverse looking Trolls, faeries, monsters and animals are beautifully rendered and on paper add some fun diversity but if I am honest after the middle point of the game they just aren't worth using. Sure they have cool abilities but since units of a players race are super soldiers and they cost the same resources they end up inferior and I don't replace them when they fall in combat.

The new rally of the lieges is a unique idea from any 4x game that I've played in that you can periodically recruit from your vassals and the wonders you have found and explored some unique units you don't have access to in your culture natively. On paper this sounds wonderful. It's cool that I can use that mythic dragon, or that faerie in my army, but eventually I ask why am I paying for these cool troops when I can get a better troop on my own? In the middle and early game they are super fun and rewarding to unlock by the end they are a trap which is problematic for that sense of Wonder.

I really miss the unique structures and races found across the map that added such diversity to a given play through in age of Wonders 3 and the ability to create unique armies is muddled at best due to the enchantment system.

[u][b]Unit tiers and Mixed signals[/b][/u]
Unit tiers have been present in the ""Age of"" series for as long as I've played them. Which an increased unit tier representing increasingly powerful abilities and stats making them a more potent threat. This doesn't translate with the enchantment system unfortunately.

Units can get a variety of cool buffs based on their typing but tier 5 units are seemingly all mythic and often are missing the tags that enable them to have the buffs that might make them relevant late game. Missing out on the buffs to all units of a certain type just makes them a poor choice because they cost significantly more for similar results. This is painful because they are without exception fun looking and thematic units which don't see much play.

They also cost precious imperium to maintain, a resource whose main function is to enable expansion of your capacity to field more cities / heroes and add very cool abilities to your empire. This is a good mechanic to discincentivize you from using entirely armies of Tier 4 and 5 units late game but I already wasn't going to use most of them because a bunch of my racially supercharged tier 3 units are just as good if not better. 

[u][b]Tomes and the illusion of choice[/b][/u]
The Tech tree, such as it is in Age of Wonders 4 is a series of magical tomes that are supposed to define your society and how they will develop. It is presented every time you finish a new research as a choice between different tomes giving you the idea that you are picking between different ways to customise your play. The problem which seems to be an overarching theme is that eventually you can just research all of them in a given play through.

You can start the game as a society of order with a dab of nature magic but eventually you will also pick up demons and undead magic just to make the technology notification go away. This is further broken once you realize you can actually just pick any tech instead of the presented five by clicking around the UI.  There only five mutually exclusive options presented and they show up so late that they don't feel unique enough in a given playthrough to differentiate it.

[u][b]Cassus Belli / Grievances[/b][/u]
Over time every player is going to do something to irritate their neighbours unless they are being very deliberate and careful. This makes sense and adds conflict to the game which is a good choice.

The problem here is implementation getting your chosen race / population to support a conflict with your neighbour is weirdly balanced. For example if my neighbour builds next to me I gain 40 points against them to help make my people support a war, but befriending a nearby neutral city gives them 8 points to use against me. The problem is that these numbers are matched against each other so instead of me having 40 points against them and them having 8 against me I effectively have 32 and they have 0.

This muddling of grievances is an odd choice especially since I can simply buy my way out of any grievances to change this balance in my favour. I have found myself paying my enemies gold just to get my people to support a war against them. This is a very silly and weird interaction, if I want to go to war against my nieghbour I probably shouldn't supercharge their economy by giving them a large amount of gold.

[u][b]Missed opportunities[/b][/u]
They left the mod system from Planetfall behind which I believe was a huge success in making armies and conflicts more diverse and fun. A tier 1 / 2 unit in Planetfall could be customized in so many ways that it made them relevant in mid to late game conflicts even with worse base stats. In Age of Wonders 4 this system is not present possibly because it doesn't feel right for the setting but it's a huge miss for me. Tier 1 / 2 units just don't see play for me outside of the first 30-40 turns which isn't a lot in a 4x game.

[h1]Summation[/h1]
Age of Wonders falls short of the high bar of expectations it set for me and I am disappointed and cannot recommend it. It presents you with so many choices and eventually due to design and pacing of the game the choices prove to not actually have been choices at all.

Those dramatic combat moments should be the times where all the choices you have made up to this point come back to either delight or haunt you with perceptible consequences on the game board, i.e. in the blood and sweat of deadly combat between warring peoples.

The hex battle board itself is often gloriously illustrated while the environmental obstacles and interactions are quite engaging. The character models are uninspired, their animations are stilted and stiff, and their impact on the field of battle is lacking. The whole combat scheme is almost surely a port from a mobile game that was abandoned at some point and adapted for this project. All that said however, I really only have to point to the 'cinematic' slow-mo shots at the end of battles as the epitome of the game's flaws: unimpactful, underwhelming and un-wonderful.

I would have loved an open RTS-style battlescape with command of units, monsters and artillery interacting in a fully immersive environment subject to the choices the player made on the over world.

Though I didn't spent much time in it, I considered it as an inspiring game with great potential. So I bought Age of Wonders 4 as soon as it was released and recommended my friend to do so, which has been the worst choice I've made this month (maybe this year). I felt guilty to have him waste money on a bunch of shit.
    Briefly speaking, I've spent around 7 hours in this game, which of course makes it hard to request a refund. But my actual play time is less than 50%, most of my time is wasted on rejoining a multiplayer game, waiting for others to battle with fucking goblins, and annoying so-called ""internal errors"". All these things made me extremely exhausted. I hate my competitive character, cause it forces me to struggle with terrible servers and stupid game features.
    I'm not among those deep gamers, but at least I'm willing to pay for those great games. If I could enjoy it, I don't care whether there is a discount or not. This game offers me with only pain instead of pleasure. I regret it now, I could have used the money to dine out, to buy my mother a hat, even to subscribe my favorite vtuber. But see what happens now: I sit in front of my screen in the most saddest position, drown in tremendous sorrow wondering if I'm fooled by the game makers. I'm a typical 21st century loser - cheated and wallet emptied by game companies.
    I hope to get my money back, even thought the time ruined by the game would never come back. This is the first time I fought back against those ghastly games. I may fail, but never surrender. As Ernest Miller Hemingway said, a man can be destroyed but not to beat.

There is a new interview with Lennart Sas (google interview with Marco Wutz):

-Triumph only retained a few core features for AoW4, everything else was open for debate

-They intentionally changed a lot to make the game for appealing to the masses, fully knowing that it may alienate a faction of the old players who focus on lore above all

-AoW franchise needs to keep growing as everything is getting more expensive (my deduction: 'loyal' old playerbase is not enough)

-Customization system allows for way cheaper (!!) development of the game as it is done much faster and can be tested a lot easier

-He says it took them up to 6 years (!!) to create, flesh out and test a distinct race of old

-The way the game is, they can pump out DLC easily (next one is playable dragonleader and lizardfolk)

citation of a central interview part:

""Triumph would then prototype these ideas and get them into the hands of some hardcore fans of the series, “who are often our worst critics.” Sas continues: “And then we can say, ‘Okay, if they didn’t entirely hate it, then maybe with these new features we can attract a broader audience.’”

The focus on customization in Age of Wonders 4, which allows players to create their own rulers and factions to play with, has been one of the big hits among players – it was also a result of the team being bold and correctly weighing the risks in the above context. “We knew that some of our core players from Age of Wonders would hate it, because they’re all about the lore,” Sas says. “They like fixed factions. But we also knew that a lot of people would love it, right? So that balance is a tough call. You can’t please all the people all the time.”""

My opinion:
So they streamlined AoW in the direction of Stellaris to tap this huge player base in order to have an easier life while making a lot more money, while also deliberately throwing the 'lore and race' fraction of old players under the bus. An understandable business decision and also - given the huge success of AoW4 - for me the definitive death of one of my most favorite game series as i knew it.
But i guess there was no alternative. In a project the worst thing you can do is to try to tend to everyone/everything, you need to make a plan and then stick to it overall.

For every old player they lost, they gained at least 10 new. I will see myself out and maybe retry AoW4 when a definitive edition is on sale.

If I could I would refund the game and would not have even buy it had I seen this before. Still, for what it's worth you can have fun with the game, the smartest thing would be to wait for the sale however or until dlc adds more depth to everything.",1683413809,1683769990,False,5,0,0.500040888786315918,0,True,False,False

Unlike prior games of the series race is more a bonus and cosmetic thing as the key defining attribute of your empire is your Society type.

I found if all you do is play the same society type every match it's the same as playing the same civilization/race over the course of multiple games, which is where I think some of the complaints I've seen came from where every match feels the same. A Human, Elf, Rat, and Dwarf Industrialist will all play like Industrialists for example, but get 6 different elves across all the different society types and they'll all play differently at the tactical level.

The magic tomes and affinities are pretty fun to play around with to. These add another level on top of the society type that determines the kinds of enchantments and mods you'll use. As you progress though the match you'll get stronger and stronger tomes through research, and you can even begin to mix and match to your heart's delight. 

Wanna be powerful spell casters that can raise the dead? Go for it! Want to be a High and orderly based society teetering on the brink as you get more chaos tomes and turn the people into literal winged demons with goat hooves, horns, and red skin? You can do that to!

And gameplay wise this is a good game. Dare i say better that both the previous games in a lot of ways. I like where they went with core mechanics and its fantasy world is amazeballs. 

BUT! It has one glaring issue that i think a lot of people will wind up getting disappointed with if youre playing this mostly as a single player game. And thats unfortunately the AI.

So let me explain, the battle AI is actually good and gives you a decent challenge. Its the world map AI that just absolutely blows. I just finished my first run. And again had a lot of fun with it. But when it came to the point where factions were starting to declare war on eachother i started noticing the terrible world map AI. 

First off, like in planetfall there are infestation units that will periodically roam the map and attack you and other AI factions until you destroy it. My entire campaign i was the only player actually attacking these Infestations and their nests. The AI Factions would simply just move units near them but never actually attack them unless an infestation came into their borders.

There are also murauding guard units that are stationary that will guard resource nodes rendering them useless until taken out or removed. But the AI factions didnt seem to care about these either. The ai takes provinces but just leave the guards on the resource nodes with out clearing them.

Then theres warfare. I had countless wars pop off in my game. And i watched as my allies would simply just wander unit stacks aimlessly around the map while being at war and never make a move on the enemy. And like wise the enemy never bothered to attack us. I also used scouts to survey lands of two AI that declared war on eachother just to see them both moving units near eachothers cities but never attack eachother.

I only had it twice where in a war with and orc AI where i sent in my armies to take out their capitol and they would spot my armies and counter attack with their own stacks. But that was about as aggressive as i saw the AI on the world map get. And this was on normal difficulty.

So while i really do like this game. As someone whos going to play this game mostly single player. The fact that the world map AI just seems mostly brain dead and not programmed to be aggressive at all during wars, really is disappointing and winds up making games completely boring. I know i never have to worry about defedning my cities in a war because the ai will literally never come attack me. All i have to do is send massive stacks to them. And that just ruins the replay factor this game could otherwise have for me.

I dont really see myself playing many more matches in this game until something is done to tweak the AI in the world map to be better than what it is. So there fore at this time i cant give the game a thumbs up or really justify the money i spent on it even though otherwise the game is great.

If you can look past Poor AI then by all means this game is worth it. just personally i'm not and will not be having as much fun as i could with this game until hopefully the world map AI gets tweaked.

EDIT: So i came back to throw this in here. Since everyone was bashing me for playing on normal i did a test run on hard to simply watch the AI behavior. Heres what happened in my game as bullet points. I'll give the AI credit where credit is due that at least on hard the AI did take out infestations and such this time around, albeit very slowly and in a passive manner. But wars, they typically felt the same. The first war on myself wasnt declared until about turn 71 turn 72. which is about normal. And in this war it was between myself and an AI directly bordering my south. So i sat all 8 of my 6 stack armies at the time on my two southern cities and i counted as by as late as turn 87 she didnt even try and attack me once. my scouts instead spotted her armies, as with my normal game, just squatting in her cities shuffling around. 

And it was also around this time my ally who had damn near 20 armies declared war on the guy to her left. Youd think they'd send it all on the city closest right? nope. for another 15 turns they too just shuffled their units around near their cities before finally launching the only attack i ever saw them do in that war. which they lost miserably. 

Going back to my war. After waiting til about turn 96 and no actual attacks on me yet i decided to delete all my armies but two and have those two armies defend my capital. It wasnt until i did this that magically the AI decides to send all its armies at my undefended cities. Takes them, brings their armies to my main city but never attacks me there. Mind you i have two stacks of units here while she has at least 8. But not one final attack from her to end me when she easily could have. In fact she decides to completely retreat all her armies after raiding my provinces. 

It wasnt until about turn 118 that the guy to my north declared war on me and sent about 15 full stacks to a few tiles outside my main city. Even then he decides to, once again shuffle his units aimlessly right outside my city until turn 129 where he finally started to siege me. Which makes no sense. 15 armies against two should have been an instant siege as soon as he saw what i had defending. Not aimless shuffling of troops for ten turns.

So while the AI showed more agressiveness over all on hard during wars. The way in which it was done was incredibly passive and the AI seems to get stuck in this unit shuffling mode. And i still would argue because of poor AI behavior i didnt have as much fun as i could have on hard either because in order for the enemy to even be aggressive towards me in a war i had to purposely delete armies just to see it. If i hadnt i almost garuntee the AI would have just camped all their armies at their cities until i either asked for peace or i threw my units to the slaughter. 

Even age of wonders planet fall had better AI in my opinion when it came to wars. I dont ever recall the AI in that game being super passive after declaring a war on me like they are in this game. And for me it just makes gameplay dull. And thats just me and my own personal gripe. no one has to agree with me. its how i feel about it. Still a great game over all. But the AI just for me makes it not worth playing games if i know what theyre going to do every single game. which is just sit there and do nothing until i lose armies either on purpose or not. For me AI in a single player mode is a big part of the experience and my personal experience with it in this game is just meh. again simply my opinion and everyones inclined to agree or disagree with that sentiment.",1683357583,1683754819,False,515,14,0.809032201766967773,74,True,False,False

This is absolutely one of the best games I've played in a very long time.  Its visuals are polished, it runs smoothly (I've not had any of the crashes reported by some others), it is well-balanced, it seamlessly blends things as widely different as city-building and turn-based combat, and it's just plain FUN TO PLAY.

I'll admit I wasn't initially going to buy this title.  I'd not played any of the previous Age of Wonders games and thought the learning curve here might be too steep or I wouldn't understand the lore or whatever.  Can confirm that wasn't a problem at all...sat down to ""fire it up for a few minutes,"" next thing I knew 4 hours had gone by and despite being 3 hours overdue for sleep, I really didn't want to quit. 

You need not any prior AoW experience to play this, you don't need to be particularly good at Civ-like or city-building games, and you don't even need to be a whiz at turn-based combat.  Age of Wonders 4 will walk you through the game concepts and introduce you to the character progression systems as they come up.

And the race/character progression/customization system is truly fantastic.  There is an almost painful number of spells to learn, traits to adopt, bonuses to earn.  Minor and Major Transformations alter the appearance of your crew in the process of giving them boosts.  Want to go a different direction later?  You can!  My proud race of sword-wielding feline warriors decided to dabble in magic ""just once,"" now they're blasting people with lightning and healing one another and teleporting places and glowing in the dark and showing the nearby band of rude horned frogs who's boss.

You can also turn it on the in the middle of a fight when you just need to mop up stragglers.
The second part is the real meat though. You can costumise completely your ruler and his civilisation, as well as the very world you will play in. And that doesn't stop at the character creation. You will continue to modify your race and civ throughout your game, such that two games with the same ruler can actually turn out really different. I also appreciate how it doesn't limit you at all.

This is simply a great game! Totally addictive! I've played AoW3 a lot and there are some changes that feel very innovative but the whole experience also feels familiar in a nice way. I love creating new races and then playing them a certain style. So far I've played Arcane Elves and Druid Elves. Not the most creative, I know, but it was so much fun! 

The new game mechanics like the tomes make for huge replayability. You can play your own race in multiple ways simply by chosing a different path through the affinities. My Druid Elves had a huge army of beasts in the end while sprouting angelic wings themselves while the Arcane Elves gained the ability to phase.

The tactical abilities of the units, the spells, the heroes, it all comes together neatly. In the beginning I was a bit overwhelmed by all the aspects I had to consider while building my empire, but hour by hour it all made more sense. I really like that all your cities can't build the exact same buildings, so each city feels unique. The amount of options is incredible!

I'm really looking forward to the expansions. I hope they'll add more options for creating worlds, like the amount of trees or water you want in that world. In AoW3 that was possible and it'd be great if they brought that back. I also hope they'll add a way to get more imperium, as of now there is no building to boost this resource. And as the higher tear units need it, but you also need it to develop your empire, there should be some way to increase it.

-End game is an absolute clusterF. All fights boil down to 3-stacks going at it, ie 18 units vs 18 units (plus summons) every battle, really tedious and just turns into an autoresolve simulator. Why not limit fights to 1 stack and keep the player engaged throughout the game?

Some minor gripes:

-Having different visuals for cultures seems like a neat idea, but really limits player choice since if you're like me and can't stand some of the armor visuals (looking at you Industrious). Why not let the player chose how you want your faction to look at creation?

-Character itemization is underwhelming. For comparison HoMM has a lot of downright awesome items for your heroes, while AoW4 is mostly some random gearpiece with +1 defense or whatever, often totally forgettable.

-The general power creep in regards to armies. Having cool racial units in tier 1 and 2 that quickly become obsolete (unless playing Horde). Late game your own dudes are replaced by stronger researched ones, leaving you wondering why there are race choices in the game to begin with.

Great game, lot of interesting game play, but needs a lot more work. Would still recommend if your a fan of the series.

EDIT: CPU utilisation for this game is ridiculous, upwards of 80% continuously while playing. I suspect this leads into the bad stuttering/lag mid/late game. 

[b]The essay: [/b] 

[b]Visual's/Graphic's:[/b] The game looks great, can't deny that. The world map, spell effects and even the detail on character models. There is a huge variety of creatures and they look fantastic.

[b]Race/Hero creation:[/b] Probably one of the best parts of this game. At first glance it doesn't look like much, but so far I've managed to make everything I wanted to with whats available alone. If dev's add more in the future or I manage to unlock more from the pantheon thing, it'll be fantastic. A definite highlight.

[b]Cities and Outposts:[/b] Seems a bit more effort went into these, plenty of building types to choose from and a lot of effects on your cities growth. The new expand by regions as you game population is also more fun, adding a more tactical approach to expanding your territory. Outpost are also a nice touch, as these can be used a number of ways to benefit you and hinder you enemies (and sometimes friends... what?).

[b]Item's and Spells:[/b] Could do with more variety, seems that the same items drop every map and rarely see much new once you have played about 3 worlds/maps. (I just don't want 5x orbs of lightning and 6x wands of blizzard... I want variety!).  Also, I get that they tried to streamline the spell system. But I generally felt, a) there's not much choice, and b) couldn't be bothered to use what I had available. Aside from the race altering spells and a few weapon enchantments, I hardly bothered with anything else, even stopped using summons early in.

[b]Limited Hero Skills:[/b] 3 trees to choose from, but you have to unlock skills in that tree to get the rest, this get tiresome. Once you have a few good ones, you basically look for anything that may be useful just to dump points into and use them up. 

[b]Hero Signature Skills:[/b] Hero Signature Skills: These are simply frustrating. There should be a option to refresh the list (even if a limited number of times) as you generally get stuck with things you don't want or need on the hero your using. Also, very limited selection. As there are so few, why not let the player pick from the whole list.

[b]Affinity and Imperium:[/b] The Affinity world tree and skill on said tree are rather good. Feel like there could have been a few more branches/options though. More Affinity types or perhaps mixed affinity skills. Perhaps this will be a future addition, we'll see. I can see what they wanted to do and for the most part managed it. My only real issue here is I tend to b-line/rush for the things I know will be useful. You tend to lose some of the enjoyment then. 

[b]Campaign:[/b]  Ok, so this is a sore point for many a long time fan of the series, myself included. AoW, AoW:SM and AoW2 were great for having a plot. Yes this game has a few story maps you can play, but its all very low effort. I don't think it would have been to much trouble to have a small part of the team put something together. I have to wonder sometimes why still dev's/publishers don't learn from EA's mistakes, even after EA themselves did.

[b]Crashing/Bugs:[/b]  Obviously most people are aware of a number of crashing issues relating to graphical error game crashing, this I believe is being worked on. There are a few other graphic related bugs that can ruin the game a bit. These are mostly related to hero models and how weapons just aren't held correctly. Some float just out of reach, some out right turn invisible. when using a flying mount, they can disappear, end up in the heroes arm pits or generally half inside the heroes body in general. 

[b]System Temperature:[/b] The game seem to push even high end PC's a bit. Both CPU and GPU temps run rather high. This tends to end with people lowering graphical settings as not to burn out tech. Obviously this weighs ill for the game design/coding/resource management.

[b]Doomstacks:[/b] Yes. 6 heroes, game won. 2xwarror, 2xcaster, 1xranged and 1xcaster/healer.

That out of the way, there are many flaws such as:
The AI is quite dumb and either wins by massively outranking your units or just loses without a fight. 
AI also barely if ever (i don't think I have EVER seen on do it) use world map spell casting. 
I am constantly healing my units, buffing my cities, spawning t4 and t3 units with mana, etc. The AI will only apply army buffs but very rarely have I seen them do anything else which just makes them too easy to kill.


On the performance side: 
Crashes like fuck. Bugs everywhere. 


Multiplayer is extremely messy. Desyncs happening very often, massive lags that literally last 5-10 seconds of the game completely frozen when a player researches endgame spells, I've also had crashes that forced us to restart the map because we could not load back in. When players do any kind of decision in multiplayer, the others can't do anything but the game doesn't really let you know, especially if you were already in a menu. What ends up happening is you THINK you have done an action, only to discover 5 turns later it didn't register because someone was taking a quest/combat decision. The game really needs to make it more obvious when you can't take actions, as it stands it acts like you did the action but then you didn't

Time to decide which province (and its benefits to production of a city) will be added to the city. Made friendship with a city-state? Here is your gold, access to resources, and future possibility of integration. Every single action in a turn can have value. You don't even stop to question if you want another turn. There is so much to do, so much feedback given for your actions in a turn that you just go for the next one, after all, you want to see what happens when your hero invade an ancient ruins to claim it, but you are still six hexes away from it, so, another turn, please!

Negative points? This game does not take your hand and teach everything. Also, the game has a story-line, but it is short. The purpose of the story-line is just to teach you how to play the game, and present different world creation templates, so then you will get a better understanding of the worlds you can create. This, allied with the fact that you can create any factions, allows you to create specific worlds with specific factions that fit whatever scenario you can imagine. Want to make a world plagued with the undead, or thriving with wild animals, or abundant with magic resources, you can create it! Want a world with a human feudal faction, an elven mystic (magic) faction, and a dwarven industrial faction? Got you! All the other races just add up the possibilities.

Everything I wanted Total War Warhammer to be, this seems to deliver.  The gameplay loop is really tight, but there is still a variety of ways to approach the game and the combat is engaging enough to be interesting without being too complex and bogging down the strategic/overworld map gameplay.  The campaigns are short and sweet which encourages experimenting with your character/race builds and the pantheon system is a cool way of tying together your previous playthoughs.

Right now, the only downsides really boil down to some minor interface/control issues that will probably get smoothed out in future patches.

I enjoy 4X (and strategy) games in general, and also have a great time playing games like Civ and Endless Legend, but Age of Wonders has always been closest to my heart. So, is this new fourth Age of Wonders worthy of carrying the name?

In short: very much yes.

Graphically, I actually prefer Planetfall as I really liked the more ""clean"" aesthetic, though AoW4 has a very pleasing watercolour-ish effect. It's colourful, beautiful, and evokes a lot of the same feelings that especially AoW2/SM did. However, I am not a massive fan of the graphics of the leaders/heroes - I feel like they're a bit on the ugly side compared to the beautiful portraits of 2 or even the graphics of 3. Hardly gamebreaking flaws, but notable to me nonetheless.

This game is heavily focused around random maps and fixed scenarios, and you should not enter this expecting an epic of a campaign like 3 or especially 2/SM. The campaign maps which exist are generally good and interesting, with a fantastic final map (as of the time of writing this review, there are no DLCs available even though it does very blatantly leave it open to expand there). If you loved 2, you will see some familiar faces which will bring you a lot of joy, and I'm excited to see where they take it. The focus on random maps is fine because they actually tie the progression into a more overarching story (that you create) - the need to create a pantheon of rulers and conquer realms. So, they're still random, but you do feel like you're progressing toward a goal nonetheless.

The gameplay is among the best in the series; fast, dynamic, with lots of customisation options, and a good number of quality of life changes (as well as the ability to create buildings and units at the same time, for instance!) - there's a LOT of focus on aggression, expansion, and heroes, but anyone playing an Age of Wonders game must do so expecting military to be a large part of the game. This still isn't a game with the breadth of something like Civ - and that's not a criticism, as not every game has to be. AoW4, like its predecessors, pulls off its slice of the pie with extreme skill.

The AI is currently a bit on the limited side, however; granted I've only finished the campaign (on Hard), but I've felt they're a bit inconsistent and ""cheaty"". Your allies may or may not choose to help you, and often they only feel useful in combat if they're literally placed in the way of oncoming enemies. AIs may war against each other for eternity because while it is happy to cut down outlying armies, it rarely actually sieges and kills anything in a decisive manner.

On higher difficulties, the AI very blatantly cheats as it clearly has vision of the whole map and has a vastly stronger economy than yours. AI Hard felt like a good challenge - strong but not ridiculous, but AI Very Hard was absolutely obscene in some places, just endlessly throwing massive amounts of units at me, regardless of taking heavy defeat after heavy defeat. It's also a very cautious AI so, combined with its seemingly infinite vision, you can expect it not to do much after you become really powerful as it simply judges *nothing* is worth the risk. All of this can be improved, but it does mar the experience a bit at present.

The amount of customisation in the game is also astounding, but one bit which is a little bit odd to me is that racial choices are effectively cosmetic; a rat with the same two chosen traits as an orc will function exactly the same. I would've liked to see some innate and unchangeable traits, even if minor.

I could go on forever, but suffice to say: incredible game. It's fun, addictive, simple for newcomers but extremely deep for experienced Wizard Kings, with a huge amount of customisation and build options. There are flaws, and most of them can be worked out with patches - people say there are performance issues at the moment, but my build is so strong that I don't notice anything - bear this in mind and do a bit more reading up on it if your PC is on the weaker side though, as I do hear it repeated enough.",1683672819,1683672819,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

City production now has separate resources so there's no longer a choice between recruiting units or building structures, just do both at the same time.

The leader/faction customization is excellent, both before and during the game.

The combat system is engaging and robust without being confusing. The spells are fun and varied, both in and out of combat. I like that you can undo a move, but it seems weird that you can't also undo an action, especially since you can redo the whole combat, both auto-resolve and manual. It's also annoying that you have to set the combat speed in every battle if you want it to go faster. There's no default setting in any menu even though I want to change the default value.

I do wish the spells were organized better in their list. I think by default it's alphabetical, and you can definitely sort by cost and whatnot, but I think arranging them by type would make much more sense.

Warring other civs can be a slog because moving stacks around takes so long. You also can only ever have 3 stacks fighting 3 other stacks so if you brought 9 stacks to fight 9 others, its 3 different combat instances and you have to be very careful to maneuver the correct ones into range to participate. It's also really frustrating that pillaging an improvement in my opponent's lands is seen as an 'Evil' action, but somehow slaughtering their armies isn't?

I've been at war with the entirety of the rest of the map and had no one actively come after me. I don't even bother with diplomacy if I'm going for 3 of the 4 victory types because they all declare war on me near the end anyhow and they don't do anything once they do.

I like the all the tech/research trees. I like how the choices you make impact the units visually. I like the fluff it adds and the way it impacts the events that occur as a result. I don't like that when an event pops up, there's no way to minimize it or delay it so I can make an assessment of my empire before committing to a decision.

I like that basically all the builds are viable from what I can tell. That being said, Wizard King and evil civilizations are going to struggle with stability, even with the features that are supposed to offset that.

I'm annoyed that I can't cycle through my heroes on the details screen. When I loot some piece of gear that I can equip, there's a button that takes me to the Hero Details Screen, but it only takes me to my Ruler. There isn't a button to cycle through all my Heroes that could equip the gear. I have to close the screen and manually click on each Hero one by one.

Moving whisperstones around is also unintuitive. There's no menu for moving them around as you see fit, instead you are required to hunt them down wherever you've assigned them, click remove, then go to the spot you want them and click give. This might not make sense if you haven't played the game, but imagine needing to go to four different menus just to transfer one thing from one city to another.

I don't like that despite all the different flavors of races and cultures, a lot of the core units are functionally the same with some re-skins. It does get better as the game continues and more tech is unlocked, but it's a little boring that the units I have at the beginning of every game are basically the same.

Half of the things in the game are confirmed by left-clicking and the other half they're confirmed by right-clicking. Its just un-intuitive enough that I have to actively think about it each time.

It can be difficult at times to select a unit stack on the world map. More often than not, you'll end up selecting the city they're in, or the province they're standing it. I have had to click 3 and 4 times to grab the stack I want to select and this is after almost 60 hours of game time. This is the first 4x I've played where that's been a problem.

I don't like how long it takes for turns to turn over once you've seen more and more of the map. You have to sit and wait for each unit in each faction to physically move around the map even if they're not on screen. I did find a workaround sort of by zooming out to the low-detail map, but doing that seems to cause bugs from time to time where the resource icons on the map disappear, the names of the province improvements won't display anymore, or the game won't show the strength of two opposing forces anymore when I mouse over them. These bugs seem to resolve by relaunching the game, but it's a pain in the neck when the alternative is to sit and wait for every stack in the game to move around.

There's also no way to resolve all queued orders, so if you've told your stacks to move across the map for the next 4 turns, you have to click an alert for that unit, then confirm the movement, then watch them move, then do that for every single stack you've done that for, every single turn. It's really annoying.

I've had probably 6 crashes to desktop in the roughly 60 hours I've played which is on the high side for my tastes. There don't seem to be any commonalities about when or why.

I absolutely love how game concepts in menus are underlined and when moused over, provide more details about their functions. These menus are nested, so if there's a concept in that first menu, you just need to mouse over the next one to get more information. It's a great feature that more games should implement. Unfortunately, there are so many underlined items, you'll often cover up information you didn't mean to, or open a nested menu by accident when navigating the UI. It can bog the experience down. Overall I'm happy its there, I just feel like it could have been implemented more elegantly.

There are zero hotkeys in the game. Like none. You can't even set any because they're not an option in the menu. You have to click. Every. Single. Thing.

Overall I would recommend the game if you can handle the crashes and the bugs and nearly complete lack of Quality of Life improvements. There's a fun experience to be had and plenty of replayability.",1683664438,1683664438,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game has a lot of good going for it. Creating your own faction and upgrading it is great. There are some bugs with visuals when too many buffs are active but those will hopefully be resolved. Would be great to have a screen where you can inspect your current faction and choose the visuals in case of multiple buffs. The game is overall solid and has a little bit of everything known from 4X games. Unfortunately after playing for some hours and through the first two scenarios my conclusion is that the game is just too tedious. It doesn't give back enough for the time it takes to do even basic things. The third scenario now presents me with a giant map, but due to city limits I can only have 4-5 maybe 6 cities myself. Number of armies is quite limited and there is a lot of walking your army across the map involved. Doing that turn-based is just sooo slow. Conquering four more enemies with their 2-4 cities each on the far side of the map while micro-managing reinforcements walking all over the map to the front line just sounds like a boring chore. Let me also point out that the ""tech tree"" is very shallow. You have six or so units available at the start of the game and then unlock few additional once through tomes. Then you get a couple of bufs and that's it. And due to high cost of units even in late game you still will have armies consisting mostly of the same cheap T1's you had at the start of the game.

---

First let me say that I have played this game only for 10 minutes, but I have already a fully formed opinion I have to share with everyone else. This game is really bad. It crashes immediately when I launch it and then I can barely play the game afterwards. And yes, I do have a top notch gamer PC and the latest graphics drivers from 2019 installed. Now let's talk about race creation. I hate it. How dare the developers give everyone freedom in designing there own faction to play how they like. Female dwarfs without beard? Strong elves with fire magic? Nobel rats with divine magic? This is blasphemous to any fantasy I know, and I know a lot of fantasy. Now everyone can have fun with his own setup instead of playing exactly the well defined archetypes I like. Lastly I want to say I am disappointed by the turn-based mechanics. This game would really need real-time combat, because that is just better and everyone knows it. The devs never listen to the community as usual, and especially not to me.

Furthermore, I'm actually not sure that the developers themselves like playing this type of 4X game, since that's pretty much the only thing that could explain the lack of options for making the map bigger, but keeping the player count constant.

This is something that a  very large percentage of 4X players like to do so it missing is for one of two reasons:
- Incompetent decision making from management, over ruling well meaning devs. I.E., The feature is not present due to ineffective leadership that do not understand the product they are making.

- Everyone, both the decision makers and development, are incompetent and that's the reason.

Neither of the options bode well for the future of this title IMO!

Seriously, the customisation in this game is huge and it initially overwhelms you with complexity and systems and spells and armies and diplomacy and yet... it's all so shallow. I can be playing as a righteous human paladin and yet the game basically feels the same as if I were playing an evil goblin sorcerer. The game has loads of systems but none stand out as being particularly good so I'm left with a 4X game that feels better than Civ V, worse than Civ VI and doesn't even come close to the divine heights of Civ IV. At best it feels like a poor mans Civ VI fantasy mod with janky AI.

I don't think the games bad because it was initially a lot of fun but after ten hours I felt like the best was behind me and by the time I reached twenty hours I just wanted to stop. The phrase ""wide as an ocean deep as a puddle"" never felt more apt here so I'm left wondering if ten house of enjoyment was worth full price?

Also pantheon system really reminded me of why modern games need more unlockables: incentives for players to replay game a lot.

Its relatively simple if you're into this genre, but pretty fun. It's got some nice mechanics and both being a warmonger and a friendly dude feels viable. So thats good.

Love the autobattle with the ability to fix it if the AI is stupid. Its really fun to play on your own.

Multiplayer however is a different story. I swear they didn't playtest this. It desyncs constantly. Fortunately there's a hot reload that works very well and fast to fix things up.. it takes like 5 seconds. But if you were in a manual battle (or another player was) you have to replay the whole battle. That kinda sucks.

Also, you cant input commands when another player has a decision menu up. If you're on the map screen, it tells you this. If you're in your own menu.. you can just click stuff and nothing will happen. Needs much more clarity and QOL features for multiplayer.

But if you like the genre, you'll enjoy it.

It's core features and gameplay functions well and does what you'd expect out of a fantasy 4x. I'm a huge fan of the story and themes established by your chosen Ruler and all others in the game vying for ascension, and how the meta currency comes from victories of your rulers ascending.

It's generally pretty good, and if you like what it seems like on the tin, you'll likely have fun.

However...

Some criticisms: mostly things that could be fixed in future patch updates, really. Shouldn't need ""DLC"" level fixes, I don't think.

1. Multiplayer runs like crap, simply put. it plays well enough, but it is slooooooooow when you're playing with people and AI, along with a lot of weird inconsistencies like jerking your camera to wherever in the FoW the bots are doing things.
2. The AI is...terminally passive. It's the simple type of 4x AI where it will only ever engage if it sees a sure victory, and otherwise will stick around its home not doing much. This might change on the highest difficulties, but the AI already gets so much help from passive cheats to keep it competitive that I don't see much value in the highest difficulties myself. The AI will exist, you'll do things, and sometimes they'll get mad at you. Typical 4x fare in this regard.
3. The games customization of the factions is COOL. I love the unit enchantments and how they keep even basic units usable through the entire game, but the problem is that because everything can be anything, very few choices will end up having much real identity other than the type of victory you're angling towards. And, further, each victory is something you'll typically be passively pursuing because all of them are pretty similar ""end game"" conditions.
It's got this ""When everyone is special, nobody is"" energy for the actual mechanics, even if the aesthetics of the factions are really good.
And finally, 
4. Alignment seems to be the biggest and most important thing for diplomacy, far above any and everything else. If you share an alignment, you'll easily become friends and allies. if you're opposed alignments, the Ai will typically mercilessly denounce you, fabricate grievances, and generally be annoying, irrespective of other shared societal traits and behaviors. Neutral prefers good, and being good or neutral; provides a lot of passive benefits like more and better random events, while being evil assumes you must be the world conquering warmonger, and being evil gives intrinsic debuffs opposite those gained from being good, Less events, and those you get have higher odds of being negative.
Alignment as a whole feels very half baked in the ""Peter Molyneux's view of moral relativism"" kind of way. Someone declares war on you because you're ugly? Alright, you can fight back. Damage their provinces to deny them resources in the war effort? Objectively evil. Which is just..eh...? Really? You're sieging cities and at active war. Is destroying a quarry really evil in the context of casting magical nukes on capitol cities(which doesn't incur an alignment penalty by the way..) and holding murderous brawls with armies to gain the upper hand?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of that said, these are things that could easily be improved over time, and in the short week since release, the devs have been active in bugfixing and trying to get things moving, So I'm hopeful and will continue to play, myself. I just want readers to know that it's a good game, and by the standard of recent major releases all being trash fires, this is refreshingly functional and complete. It's paradox, and the AoW franchise has never been ""Endless DLC train to death'd"" like the other games they make, so it's a good pickup and new content will help to add more: rather than just adding content that should already be there.

Solid, worthy pickup if you want to cast magical holocausts while ushering in the age of stars and dropping doomstacks of summoned units every single turn endlessly.

AOW 3 story bit on the fence if we got to compare, AOW 3 story is nicer in regards of progression feeling, but if I got to think on the custom ruler I do like this a bit more with the pantheon selection and all.
We don't talk of Planetfall (For me that's not an AOW game, it should be consider spin-off I don't like AOW with futuristic theme)

Customisation its got a good amount, I like the minor faction change, and major faction change spells, but what I do feel lacking is the over all species creations.
They made it more cosmetic with AOW 4, so it doesn't feel special in that regards. 
Plus it feel limited to setting your own lore, like there should've been a planes/living environment, it shouldn't just be two selections and then you got to make a choice of either skill type driven or environment.

 I don't think I would play this game too much. There no uniqueness to the races and the campaign there no dialogue. I find this to be very, very lazy and poor choice on their behalf. How can a Catman have the same stats as a human? that to me is beyond me.

Other glaring problems are Tier units, Early tier units become obsolete too fast Planetfall due to unit mods and synergies early units were still useful. diplomacy is very shallow too. 

 While there some positive changes made like recruiting troops while building at the same time, Graphics and art style are beautiful. The music and voices overs has greatly improved.... but that's about it. The most important aspect about Age Of Wonder has always bees the fantastical Races, and they removed that aspect completely, They have no racial units, no special effects or traits you could make a Dwarf play the same has Elves they are just a visual change. This greatly disappointed me, Since Planetfall expanded greatly how to customize individual units and the races itself play different Kir'Ko could not play the same has Syndicate, for example.
  
 This change would make same if the game had only one race and you could customize that race, the factions we create feel the same all the way until midgame. That's when they start to feel more unique, so you have to grind the game for hours just to see some factional difference. I feel like It took 1 step forward and went back 2 steps if we compared with Planetfall.

This no longer feels like Age Of Wonders. since the core point of the series was the Fantastical races uniqueness and they removed that. They could have made this change in another new series but not such a long running series like this. The game feels samey for hours no matter the race you play.

They knew for months they had complains about this and they could have implemented simple changes like for example giving the Races 3-4 hard fixed traits, and then add 2 more neutral race changes. What bothers me the most there are no unique racial units, Age Of Wonder 3 did this better.


 I will be going back to Planetfall. Unless they give the races some more powerful fixed straits at least like in Age Of Wonder 3. In my eyes this game is not worth playing at the moment.",1683166789,1683602582,False,1,0,0.451127827167510986,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Faction customization is amazingly broad, and often the choices you make just sort of write their own backstory. Very well done with the faction editor. I've probably spent more time in the faction editor than I have playing the rest of the game.
- Enchantments are fantastic, and you can create some really cool units with them.
- Modding Tools are included. I jumped on Steam to report a bug, then found instructions for the modding tools, then managed to use those tools to verify that the bug is just an incorrect description. It's extremely rare to find a game that open.
- The core gameplay is a lot of fun, and the game does a good job of organic storytelling. It feels like stories just emerge from the variations and mechanics in the game.

Cons:
- Repetitive - When you get a solid army built, the battles can get repetitive, going through the same button clicks every time to apply hero abilities, get troops in formation, etc. For instance, every battle with a caster hero you'll want to apply Channeling, and High units need to be Awakened to activate their traits. They are fun mechanics that add a lot of strategic depth, but some automation/presets or even just a ""cast all"" would be nice.
- Not enough battle maps. This kind of goes along with repetitive, but it's less a systemic thing and more a lack of content. The number of maps on which units fight is relatively limited, making battles feel stale after awhile because you know where the AI is going to go and how to exploit a particular map.
- There are some minor bugs with descriptions that make things confusing, and I've had a few crashes. That said, stability and polish are far above the usual release nowadays.
- Some of the units just don't really have a place in their factions, both Culture units and Tome units. AoW3 had the same issue - some units just don't get used. This might be an area where some unit modification/variation could make a big difference.

Wishlist:
- You can pick armor and faction colors, but I'd really like to be able to change some of the base unit colors and armor pieces in the faction editor.

- Fun (5/ 5): 5 out of 5 is an understatement. So far the best game i have played in 2023.
- Bugs: Some minor bugs, with rare crashes. Multiplayer issues. However, considering the game was just released, I'm sure these will be fixed with future updates / fixes.

**Briefing about the rating**
Imagine if Civilization married Total War. This is their baby. However, without the overly complicated wars in total war or the overly complicated technologies in civilization. This is why this game deserves 20 out of 20. On top of that you get the following:
* 20 pre-created factions from the start.
* Ability to create your own faction with so many options to chose from to make them unique.
* Multiplayer supports up to 9 players.
* The more you play the more you unlock new maps, new abilities, new functions, and new cosmetics.
* The game play is fluid, smooth, and nice with an easy to learn tutorial.
* Each faction is different than the rest, giving an identity to your race each time.
* Each alignment has its own tree and magical books to learn spells from which are separate and has its own identity.
* When you win you can ascend that leader you won the game with. To be included in the games pool of heroes. So he might visit you in future games as a hero to be recruited.

And the release was (almost) without problems - someone had problems with the game crashing, but I didn't have any. And the developer released a hotfix quite quickly.

Race customization, magic mixing, absolutely awesome. You can create a standard race of raiding orcs or high elves, or you can go completely crazy and conquer the world with hobbits riding spiders who control hordes of undead. The combination is endless.
The games have a brisk pace, no boredom in the mid-game, no clicking away and waiting for something to build.

Personally, I've encountered only a few crashes and hangs due to AI turns not processing. Despite these minor issues, I've thoroughly enjoyed the 18 hours I've logged in the game. My advice is to appreciate the efforts of the developers in fixing these issues.

Difficulty: The difficulty level may vary for each player. In my experience, I typically face over 100 enemy armies by turn 20, but others may have a different experience.

Game speed: The game's speed is decent, and I find it suitable for my playing style. While some features may take some time to get comfortable with, once you become familiar with them, you'll be able to make decisions more quickly. Some people complain about the lack of diversity, but I personally find it to be enough, especially given the game's $50 price point.

Experience: As a long-time fan of the RTS genre, I've played many 4X RTS games, each with its own unique twist and attractions. While I cannot compare this game to other Age of Wonders titles or other 4X games, I believe it's a great addition to the genre. With the level of customization and specialization available to players, I'm satisfied with the game's depth. Although I may desire a bit more in some areas, I'm happy with the game overall. I'm confident that any customization or diversity enhancements that I'm looking for will come via DLC or mods. Even if the game's depth remains as it is, I'm still eager to log many more hours of playtime.

Closeout:  This game may not be for everyone, especially considering the RTS genre's niche audience. However, if you're willing to pay the price and want to experience a new and fantastical world, I highly recommend giving this game a try.

I tried Age of Wonders: SM and Age of Wonders 3, but I couldn't get the former to run well on my PC, and didn't like the pacing of the latter. Happy to report that I absolutely LOVE Age of Wonders 4 and, while there are definitely some areas for improvement think the game will go down as a classic. 

First the good:
(1) The art design is superb. While many unit types are ""generalized"" across/shared by different races, the engine still makes them all appear unique
(2) There are tons of interesting ways to build your race/empire. The whole process is a lot of fun, and leaves lots of room for experimentation. I've found myself playing a mix of the pre-made races/cultures (which are traditional) and those I've made myself
(3) All the mechanics of the game blend together well and allow for lots of great strategies toward victory.
(4) The quest design is good (for a 4x game) and adds to the flavor/lore of the world.
(5) The spells are a lot of fun, especially the transformations. you really feel like you're growing in power over the course of the game
(6) Great sound design

Now the bad/areas for improvement
(1) Some spell areas/schools need significant buffs. Necromancy, in particular, is extremely underpowered and has a very slow start when, historically, it has allowed for rush tactics in strategy games. Souls just accumulate way too slowly, forcing the player to decide whether to invest them in necromancy spells or units. My recommendation would be to remove the soul requirements for spells, and keep them for units, but there are other ways to balance it too
(2) Some spell themes are missing and/or should really be branched out of the spell schools they're in. For example, there are water elementals in the game, and one of the story missions has you fighting an obviously water-themed character, but there are no actual water spells in the game to cast/use. Mental spells are spread across dark/chaos when, in my opinion, they'd be better suited for their own spell school. Perhaps patches/DLC will fix this, but for now it's here
(3) The racial transformations change your units, but don't really change your culture. For example, in AOW3, playing an undead race would change the mechanics for building/growing cities. In contrast, with one exception, racial transformations don't affect your city planning/resource generation. 
(4) The graphics are beautiful, but its difficult to get performance to run smoothly. Things can slow down a lot in battles

This game has an awesome in-depth mechanics and customization system for more advanced players, but can be automated and simple enough that new or casual players can enjoy the game without feeling completely overwhelmed. There's a great balance of exploration, diplomacy, warfare, character creation, and empire expansion/management that really scratches my brain itch and its' need to compulsively problem-solve and strategize on a grand scale. In addition to the mechanics, the graphics are beautiful, but not too advanced that a relatively older device couldn't handle. Of course there's a few bugs, and the game can crash from time to time, but overall this has been pretty minimal. Multi-player is actually much easier to coordinate than I was anticipating. I tend to drop connection fairly often, but was able to join back up to on-going sessions with relative ease (now, how long I actually stayed is a different story!) Multi-player can get a little laggy depending on the number of players you have, the complexity of your map, and how many world units are active, but again it's not too bad if you have a solid connection, and a relatively decent device to run it on. I've tried playing the game on my Steam Deck as well, and it's working pretty much the same as my PC -- but it does seem a little more buggy/crashy (for all the reasons listed above) at this point in development.

Outstandingly optimized to zero lag at all. Not really a casual game.

There might be too much customization and freedom here. I don't feel purpose at first, seeing I can become anyone I want. But further in the game, I see that there are race mechanics that allow you to modify your race and it's pretty fun.

Overall, awesome game, really pricey game, well-polished in terms of performance but I would like to see some updates in the future regarding gameplay and general lore.

For example, playing civilization I know that I'm actually playing a game where rulers strive for world dominance. Here, having dwarves, rats, and other otherwordly creatures, how can one certainly say what they need or want in this world. Am I a freaking unicorn? If so, why am I not strolling through the fields freely. Of course, this doesn't demonstrate what's going on in the game, but really I felt pretty lost in the terms of my roleplay purpose and direction, like there isn't much motivation to roleplay, and it gets even more depressing seeing that you can make your hero look badass without putting effort to it, like he was born like that and that's it. For example, in Crusader Kings 3 I have motivation to become a powerful ruler, because the game rewards it in terms of lore. In this game, it's just the gameplay. Noone will give you a pat on the back for your achievements in the game like they do in CK3. It is notable to me, even though for most people this might not even be an issue or anything they will notice during their play.



Verdict:
Buy it if you have the money. The game is worth it, it has a lot of content, new mechanics and it is quite polished. The game sometimes feels like it has been targeted on quite really young audience, but overall it is enjoyable, but not to the extent of playing it for a really long time in one go. I would do this in CK3 because it's motivating and rewarding me. This game is more about gameplay and I don't get much rewards DURING not after the play like they do it in CK3.  

These are just my honest first impressions of the game and it might have more to offer than I have discovered to this point, again, indicating it has a lot of content in it.

A few hiccups here and there - some stuff missing from the interface, instead of selecting an army one selects a province sometimes, also a few random crashes (but the game autosaves very often so that's not really a huge problem).

This is a Triumph for the Paradox shareholders.
For us gamers it is just a prettier iteration of the same game, with very little innovation or improvement of the flaws existing since AoW 1. 

Major problems remain such as the AI, racial imbalance ( probably in their minds fixed !?! ....by giving every race the ability to be identical except for looks - effectively removing racial differences. A cop out.) and empire management such as a horrible UI for managing items, heroes etc or adding underwhelming buildings  (reduced to + or - numbers for min/maxing your economy that the cheat AI doesn't concern itself with) to your drop down list cities (now with new reduced limits!).
Old issues like 'embarkment' where units magically become ships when they move into water, and the associated after-thought of water combat seascapes make the map landscape redundant, detracting from flying units and any strategic thinking - all because it is 'too hard' to make an AI that can use ships.
No map editor (even AoW 1 had this). No campaigns anymore.

This new iteration does add more races, with a greater focus on prettier aesthetics rather than mechanics which IMHO is just a poorly veiled future DLC revenue stream of more DLC clothing,  DLC races, DLC etc etc... ad infinitum. Same content, just repackaged.

It is clear where Triumph/Paradox's priority lies; Not with fixing the weakest parts of the game/franchise for the players, but rather in monetizing AoW to the maximum for the benefit of their shareholders.

Quite a pretty little game by itself, but having played AoW since owning AoW 1 box edition on CD bought in a shop (just imagine!?!) years ago - I would not recommend this game to anyone except my enemies who I wish to be fleeced with DLC and sold the same old repackaged content for a new over-inflated price.

From the customisation options which keep it feeling fresh each time to the robust and realistic diplomacy each element is balanced to add not subtracked to the whole.

The combat itself is intuitive and doesn't feel like a slog and you can totally skip it with out feeling guilty by using it's great autoresolve. Some of the replayability features like unlocking cosmetics or running into a hero you created in another campaign feel like icing on the cake but I really hope they are expanded upon like giving you the option to have a fully decked out hero you made start a new campaign or randomly join you!  

Age of Wonders 4 is now my go to strategy/4x game and I have them all. Hats off the Triumph Studios and thank you. I'm a little sad I won't be dusting off Heroes of Might and Magic as much but can't wait to see what they add to the game in the upcoming expansions.

The gameplay is engaging, but sadly not one that triggers the one turn more like many similar games can. 
Why am i recommending it than? Well, it has potential. The game as is has a lot of issues, many I hope they work out as time goes by. The Ai tends to be very timid in attacking when it is uncertain of victory in a specific fight. It will often shy away from 3 stacks if it can not beat those stats with its own, even if it has 6 or more stacks nearby to  do a followup attack with.  
The customization is quite a lot, though in the end as a game progresses that initial customization matters less and less. 




Pros
 Lots of customization.
 Lots of unit types
 Lots of research
Cons
 Horrid story missions

At first, I downvoted because this game is very poor for multiplayer: Out of sync all the time.
There is an in-game fix, but it doesn't always work, which forces you to revert a turn and reboot.
This wouldn't be a big issue if it didn't happen nearly as often as it does (about every 20 turns or so I am forced to revert a turn, which gets very frustrating if turns are long and hard-fought).

There are no racial units. No factions at all! society traits are nice but there is no singular identity. It somehow feels bland and uninspired. It is a let down from AoW3.

The bad:
Seems way less deep then Planetfall. Combat is way more simple and the campaign is actually just five very short battles.
The alignment system in this somehow sucks more then the previous games. There is legit no reason to be evil as it only brings negative penalties

The game is buggy.

The pantheon unlock system for terrible cosmetics and origin options is a slog and should just be removed.

To new players, this game feels like Civilisation, Total War and XCOM had a baby. Continental maps combined with tactical battle maps make for a wonderful mix of gameplay, and the game is visually appealing, familiar in playstyles to other games, and a good time sink. The fantasy elements are fantastic, and being able to tailor a race away from the norm is very satisfying. The tech trees, in the form of tomes of magic, are a brilliant alternative to a standalone system — not being able to unlock everything in one game makes this very replayable.

What makes it unplayable, however...

Multiplayer doesn't work for a number of reasons, fundamentally because you can't connect to your friends at all (in a genre usually designed for multiplayer). I can't comment on multiplayer because I literally cannot play it. Quality of life basics are non-existant: cameras constantly track movement in tactical maps (and you can't turn it off), so with many units moving on a turn, your map is spinning and causing motion sickness; the UI is clunky and all over the place; and the map mechanic for a cartography-style world map means you can barely zoom out before the map is visually simplified. The tutorial is poorly designed for a game this vast, and favours teaching tactical options over basic gameplay mechanics. Diversity/inclusion is minimal, if not vacant: only he/him and she/her pronouns are accepted in the game (what if I want genderless mystical elves?) despite it being 2023 and only one afro-type hairstyle to start with is disappointing. The game difficulty seems to curve drastically mid-game (which is only 30-50 turns) leading unexperienced players beaten down and confused. If you had a theme in mind for your order-driven high society humans, you'll likely receive a mount, weapon or unit that makes absolutely no sense for your immersion. Maps sizes cannot be adjusted further than the distance between leaders, so large maps with few leaders are impossible, which is a shame. Maps feel incredibly cramped despite customising distances to ""far.""

As for the game's performance on the Steam Deck, it runs pretty well. However, I would love to see it officially verified, as there are some key improvements that could be made for Steam Deck users. For example, the UI needs to be scaled for a screen so small, especially text fields. Additionally, the recommended settings need to be better calibrated, as I often experience performance issues with FPS dropping to low 10s, especially during big battles or when I can see someone else's empire.

Finally, the control mapping could also be improved. I think that Age of Wonders 4 could take a page from Civilization 6, which mixes joystick and mouse behaviors in a more intuitive way that flows better for the gamer.

Yes some more ""options"", but so much feels awkward and unintuitive, especially the combat. Worst combat so far in the whole series! Make it AoW2:SM or AoW3 but not this awfull 3point system. Yes, it's very similar, but it feels just awful. HP to Damage feels wrong, too much HP, so combat is streched out. 
Graphics look more generic than ever. Somehow better, but no charm to it. UI is a nightmare!

So 26 hours more and this are some additional thoughts:
AoW4 pretends to have lots of options, especially the early game feels very samy. Almost all have the same basic troops and differentiation comes late. No clear different paths. In earlier AoW titels you had clear paths for your play, by the magic Books you choose or by the profession in AoW 3. The Races felt way more Distinctive too. Now the race traits you choose at creation are minor and you can barely recreate any of the original Races or Leaders. (Yes, modding is an option but makes it just more complicated, not compatible with each other or imbalanced)
And then the magic, there is one dedicated tome for some of the Elemental magics, so going Fire means rather going Evil than anything else.
No map creator! That was always a pillar of previous AoW titles!
I hate Provinces! Since Endless Legend came up with that stupid concept, all tried to copy it. Just makes it more convoluted, ugly and tedious and of cost of the Creator! And most of the problems of previous Titles could have solved better.
Too many buildings in Cities! I didn't think that that would bother me, but when you have to build 5 of the same, just to get something decent and that for several ressources, then it just gets tedious and feels like padding to stretch out the game. You get barely anything special for it. And then you have to look if you want to boost it or not. So scattered and not focused at all!
Then they don't even allow you to choose the size of the map at creation, or you can't create a Leader or race outside of the map setup!
Why is the leader creation half assed? Barely any faces for some races! You had it in AoW3, you weren't able to import that models? Why have some races the option to choose from any race body type and others not?
Some models got very goofy, What happened to all the Elementals? AoW3 style looked way better!
And fing huge hands!
The independent recrutement sites from AoW3 could have used some improvement, but now they just deleted them completely and just filled the maps with independent cities that are more of the same.

So they wanted to make it less micromanagement heavy then previous titles, by making it more tedious, less focused and less distinct than ever!

And I hate the new healing system! Temporary Hit Points! Seriously!?

All in all, way worse than AoW3 or AoW2:SM in my opinion!

Game feels like an altered version of its predecessor, with extended diplomacy and city development. The game has been simplified and cut in areas, that needed no tampering.

There is no real campaign, so that’s major a downgrade. I’m not saying that AoW 3 had any means a great campaign, but it had its moments. It was adequate at conveying the lore and story to the player. It gradually introduced player to different classes and races, their strengths, and weaknesses. Now you just dropped to the deep end of the pool, and good luck! It’s a frustrating experience. There is no way around it, this new pantheon points and ascension system just sucks. I just can’t make myself care about any of it, and skin unlocks remind me of lootboxes.

Previously defined races are little more than skins, replaced with enormous amounts of fiddling. Races have lost almost all of what made them unique. Some of the old races are missing, replaced with toads, molemen and rats which have no identity. The races feel soulless and there are no racial units.

Terrain matters less. It’s still there, but just watered down. Strategically building cities to a previously difficult terrains, such swamps and forests is now less impactful with the changes. Overall, there is general lack of any meaningful terraforming, again maybe because the terrain is no more as relevant. In this series previous entries terraforming, was integral and interesting part of the game. In AoW 2 and 3 you could literally see map changing to represent your empire and its people. As you conquered more and more. It was brilliant way of physically demonstrating players achievements.

Player can’t flood land, freeze water, or raise mountains. There are some terraforming spells, but they feel pretty niche and are a shadow of their former selves. In AoW 2 and 3 the player could create hazards and chokepoints on the world with spells. You could poison your domain, and clear terrain, destroy roads and bridges etc. Fun, flavourful and engaging.
Spells also feel uninspired. There is so many summon spells (can’t even summon dire penguins, so what’s the point) and vast amounts of buffs. Many spells are just slight variations of one another. Players just stack mind boggling amounts of buffs, and I can’t emphasize this enough. Units buff, combat and world spells buff and it’s just dull.  Previously you could summon vines to tear down fortifications, double gravity to drag down fliers, regenerate walls, reanimate cities, explode corpses etc. I am not saying that the AoW 2 and 3 spellsystems were perfect, but least they were much more interesting and felt more impactful. One single spell even in early game, could easily mean defeat or victory. Race transformations are a cool idea, but again mostly boils down to buffs.

I hate the new siege system. Gone are the days of storming the walls with ladders, blasting gates open and reducing walls to rubble. I remember in previous game, desperately throwing civilian units to block gates, so that my archers can shoot one more turn. Grasping victory from the jaws of defeat. Now you just sit and wait 1-6 turns holes to appear and it's just a battle with extra steps. I mean I get it, they wanted a siege mechanic, but this just slows down everything. You can spice things with some siege projects, but man I miss cannons and trebuchets in my armies.

Battles are smaller, instead of max 42 units, there is now 36, so the scale has gone down. I guess, it’s matter of opinion, but I really liked the massive battles. In AoW 3 It really felt like you had grown from tiny fief fighting small skirmishes to a massive empire wielding huge armies. Even more so in Aow 2. Now the player can reach the battle unit cap much faster, so the impact is diminished. The adjacent army hex rule is also gone, and replaced with some sort of system, which honestly, I don’t understand, so armies farther away can participate in battles.

Nevertheless, battles are still quite long slogs, so reducing unit numbers meant very little in that regard. Battles drag on also because you can and should stack buffs (up to nine times!) Stacking bonuses gets tedious fast and slows down the combat even more. Units are also more tanky and combat temporary health regeneration is much more readily available. Heroes and rulers have so much health, it’s absurd. This all contributes to the length of engagements. Water warfare is still very, very dull, even more so than AoW 3. Why is the battleground open water always? Where is the coastline, shallows, cliffs, raging whirlpools, and shifting winds? Where are the water fortresses and cave entrances? This is just extremely lazy design.

I am not a big fan of needing heroes to establish outposts and cities. Maybe it will grow on me, but currently I do not like that pioneers (settlers) and builders are gone. There is a layer of strategy missing from the game without civilian units. No more escorting settlers, building towers to your kingdom’s peripheries and laying roads with vulnerable civilians. The hard choice between expanding your empire and improving your military is gone. Every unit is now a roman soldier, that can now dig and build roads, with empire skill unlocks. You can’t also build narrow underground tunnel chokepoints because the entire province is always leveled when digging. I used to love creating winding tunnels and fortifying choke points. Visit structures are gone, so a there is another layer of strategy missing. No more building superhighways with haste berries, with dem sweet melons en route.

I mean I like some parts. Land battles are still generally fun regardless of being buff central. Art has definitely improved. I like the decisions and little random events. I enjoy that I can spent resources and gamble when exploring ancient wonders. Changes to hitpoints and mind control are welcome. No more mind control and heal cheesing. I do enjoy the extended city planning, building and economy which is something I would like to explore more. Though it still feels streets behind other modern 4X titles. Game runs alright with my older rig and I’ve had zero crashes. 

Mostly AoW 4 innovated in areas that it did not need to. It cut and simplified features that I enjoyed immensely in AoW 3. And sometimes replaced them with worse mechanics. I’ll probably keep playing because there are just enough things to enjoy. But currently I can’t see this reaching same amount of joy as Age of Wonders 3 did for me.",1683542661,1683542661,False,295,7,0.752127885818481445,50,True,False,False

I picked up AoW3 after watching Total Biscuit's glowing review of the base game and for many years, it was my post played game on Steam. I also loved Planetfall although that's a sci-fi game and not fantasy. I heve never played the earlier games if that's important for you to know.

[b]Faction customisation[/b]
Let's get this one out of the way first, shall we? Yes, it is entirely possible to make every single race exactly the same way if you really WANT to make them that way. Each faction (race) has a mind and body trait which you can change if you want to. If you choose the exactly same traits, culture and Tome, you would have exactly the same faction as the last one you played with those choices except for the faction appearance. Now, you CAN do that if you really want to but that's your choice and, to be honest, would be really boring. But it's also possible to make them unique as well. the stock factions that ship with the game are all different but you can make your own and make them any way you like.

There are lots of 'races' to chose from, several cultures and many tomes of magic with which you can customise your faction and yes, they change the way each faction plays. Feudal cultures are different from Industrial cultures. Are they SO different that you feel like you're playing a completely different game? Not really. I guess it is possible to do that as I haven't explored all the possibilities but apparently necromancy is harder to do than other types. I'd say my Industrial Dwarves played very differently from my Feudal Goblins as a result of the choices I made both at the start and as the game progresses. is it Endless Legend  levels of difference? Not really. 

[b]Is there a campaign?[/b]
Yes, there are campaigns but they're done differently from the previous games. Now we have story realms, each of which is a mini-campaign. I've played the first two and I'm not going to lie, this is my least favourite way to play the game. I don't enjoy being told what to do and prefer to make my own story when I play and there are plenty of realms for you to play this way.. But if the campaigns from earlier AoW titles were your prefered way to play these kinds of games, this isn't going to work out for you.

[b]Realms[/b]
You may wonder where the fairy rings and other special sites that allowed the player  to build these special units but they're done differently here like Plantefall's different world types, you have several different realms which have different biomes and special features on them. You can use the presets or customise your own and keep them. And there are many different possibilities here.

[b]Early release bugs[/b]
While I have not experienced a single crash or game stopping bug in the my first 30 hours of play, there are plenty of folks who have including one streamer I was watching. There's already been a hotfix patch for some of the crashes but since I never had any to begin with, I can't say how much of the problem has been fixed with it. Obviously, in a few weeks time, all this will likely be history.

Of course, there are lots of small and not-so small bugs present as there often are on launch. The game's balance is also a bit off in places with certain spell tomes being better than others. But I haven't been frustrated or inconvenienced by any bugs but I'm a fairly relaxed gamer so YMMV.

[b]Paradox is the publisher[/b]
If you're a gamer for whom these kinds of political issues are more important than the game, well, here's another Paradox Interactive game for you to hate on. Is this going to be a DLC hub? There are four DLC planned for release in the next year but if this game goes the same way as AoW3 and Plantfall before it, that's going to be it. It's not a PDS game (EU, HOI, CK and Stellaris) and we all know those will be supported for years after release. This one will probably be finished quite quickly so if you want to wait until development work on the game is done, you won't have a long wait. It'll get fixes and balance patches for some time afterwards though.

[b]How does this compare with the earlier games in the series?[/b]
This IS an Age of Wonders game in spite of some of the silliness you'll see on the Steam discussion boards at the moment. Like any franchise that has legs, the fans of the much older games in the series are outraged that this is not a direct sequel to AoW1, 2 and in particular Shadow Magic. You'll see the usual '[i]dumbed down for casuals[/i]' comments made on the boards if you're interested. If you're a fan of these old titles, I'd strongly recommend watching some videos before you decide because, like Civ has changed dramatically since Civ IV, AoW has changed dramatically since 2. And hell hath no fury like an old gamer 'replaced' by casuals.

[b]Tactical battles[/b]
like previous AoW games, the core of the game is the tactical battles and this is where the game excels for me. Plantefall had a strong focus on ranged combat but in AoW4, there is more focus on melee and magic. Some builds are squishier than others or are very vulnerable to certaion damage channels while resistant to others. For example, my tanky dwarves could go toe to toe with pretty much anyone and were resitant to charms but as soon as the electric channel came along, my units went down hard and fast. In my current game, my goblins are definitely less tanky but get a damage bonus from standing together which increases their damage output. Combined with their numbers, they can swarm an enemy very effectively.

[b]The strategic game[/b]
The city building is nowhere near as sophisticated as the building in a historical 4X game but it's sufficiently deep to keep it interesting and to play an important part in the game. It's perhaps not as deep as Plantefall's but it's a whole level up from AoW3's expanding borders. There are only a few base imporvements you can build but depending on your culture, you'll unlock specail improvements that synergise with others better than the basic ones.

[bCities and ]Sieges[/b]
One of the coimmon complaints we read about AoW3 was that you needed to keep a garrison in each of your cities and that why could a single scout take over a metroplis of millions without a fight? Plantefall fixed this by having garrisons for each city and AoW4 does it differently. Now you must siege down the walls before you can assault the city, units or no units. there are a number of sige projects both players can deploy to influence both the length and the lethality of the assault. is this better? IMO, yes but others will disagree.

You have a city cap which starts out at three but there are affinity bonuses that can increase this total. I didn't usually have more than 6 cities in most AoW3 or Plantefall games and so I hardly notice the cap. You can vassalise cities instead of adding them to your own control so it's possible to have large empires if you want.

So, overall, yes, it's a fantastic 4X TB strategy game and IMO, the BEST AoW title I've played yet. I';ve given it an ujnconditional 'Thumbs Up' but does that mean I recommend you buy it? Hell no. :D Do your research, watch a few videos if you have the time and make your own mind up. We're all different and all this review demosntrates is that I like it, very much.

It has some good points, the game is engaging, the auto combat (which I've been using a lot) seems fair, and the world is colourful.  The manual combat is fine, with a tolerably good enemy AI, and lots of options for turning combat to your favour.

It is definitely a 'one more turn' kind of game.

On the other hand, the UX is bad.  The interface is non-intuitive in lots of places:
Your hero can build an outpost to annex a wonder they have cleared, but you can't do it in the province that has the wonder, the outpost button will not show if you try that, you have to build the outpost in an adjacent province, obviously.

Your armies can dig through soft earth underground if you buy the right early-game enhancement, but to do so you need to walk up to the wall, click on the excavate button, and see if the wall is excavatable, you can't actually highlight excavatable areas while being able to move your army.

I've played the game for thirteen hours, according to Steam, and I have yet to work out if it is possible to cycle through your heroes in the hero management screens.  If, say, you have a shiny new object to give your main hero, and want to pass the almost-as-good alternative to another hero, you have to return to the main game screen after giving the shiny to your main before clicking through to the hero management interface to pick the hero to give it to.

I picked up a nifty mythic level unit for one of my armies, but the game started showing up 'resource shortage: souls' at end of turn.  The game has never mentioned souls as a resource until then, has no indicator anywhere that they might be a resource (they're only valid otherwise if you research a particular branch of magic, I think), or hints how to get them, or even if it is possible to do so.  I ended up disbanding the unit, because I had no idea if it would turn on my troops when the turn ended.

Some interface decisions make sense, but overall it feels as though it could have done with a polishing pass.  The tool-tip pop-up information interface is good and works well though.

The game has a big story-driven, multi-stage campaign like-thing going on -- it tries to get you to follow a set of prepared maps, telling a story of dimensional invasion by a bunch of wizards from AoW2 (I think, if I'm reading it right).  I've done the first one, and am not interested in doing any more.  I really don't think that 4X games lend themselves to storytelling or on-rails plots.  The first one felt like a tutorial map, except that the game already has one of those (it was fine).

The story campaign started with a someone trying to be my ally despite severe faction differences, and then they started stealing my territory while telling me how wonderful I am and how I'm doing the right thing to stand up against another bloke who I've barely met and who I'm not even at war with.  It was annoying.  It was also a very small map and the quests given were all very linear drivers towards fighting the other guy.  I feel that 4X games should be more open-world than on-rails.

I think my biggest complaint is the map size.  The maps are tiny, and there doesn't seem to be an option to increase them.  I picked a custom world with four players and the distance between the starting location as 'far'.  I still met the first of the AI opponents before I founded my second city, and the next before I had a third.

This, instead, is proper new entry. I really like the fundamental focus on custom races and campaign generation. The whole set up starts off with exciting you about all the possible campaign and faction set ups. Each map you generate is made up of many different unique mechanics you mix and match at will, and then each faction you can make has to be made up from many different mechanics you mix and match at will as well. It even has long term progression, further outlining how each game you play is a whole new campaign for your wizard, not just yet another bland random map you generate.

And then on top of that the gameplay of each faction is pretty compelling too. The progression through power levels inside the game still have this unique AoW focus of magic being the main measure of your power, you still keep mixing and matching what your race and faction are even as you play and approach end game. The idea of everything from what your culture is to what units you can have being separated into Tomes of magic is appealing to me for some reason. There's nothing in the game that isn't in one of those books, and choosing which books you collect has an almost a gacha satisfaction to it.

Pros:

The game strikes a perfect balance of deep complex systems and accessible easy to understand mechanics. You don't need to understand every individual aspect of the game to succeed and have fun in it, but there is a lot to explore and experiment with when you really want to. I have learned something new with every scenario I play; new spell synergies, new army tactics, new ways to plan my cities, new ways to dominate the enemy. I've played more than 40 hours already and I feel as though I've barely scratched the surface.

The amount of freedom in customisation is immense. The central gimmick of the game is you handcrafting a unique species and evolving them with crazy magical effects to create something that's wholly yours. There are no standard Reclusive Elves vs Bloodthirsty Orcs, Mountain-dwelling Dwarves vs Greedy Goblins. Nothing is set in stone. You can make those archetypal races if you want, but they're just a small handful of the millions of combinations of factions you can create in this game, all before you even get to the magical transformation aspects. It's not a perfect system, and I'll get into some of the drawbacks of it later, but for the creative driven player it is incredibly fun.

Combat is great, way better than previous entries. It's faster, more strategic, far more interactive than its ever been. There are hundreds of units with millions of combinations of traits and enchantments to change how they feel, but it's never overwhelming or confusing. Every unit has a clearly defined role and playstyle that's reflected in their banner icon so, even if you've never encounted say a Demonic Frostling Tyrant Knight before, you always have some idea of how a unit should be utilised and how best to counter it. In older titles, I would tend to just rush to the high-tier units and stomp through armies with sheer numbers because the combat generally came down to whoever had the beefiest melees and the shootiest rangers. Now, I'm actually engaged with every fight. I'm developing unique strategies for each army, experimenting with unit compositions, and continuously utilising low-tier units in my armies for the entire game. It's fantastic.

Cons:

No game is without its flaws, and AoW4 is by no means an exception. Let's start with the big one: the Technical issues. I have encountered a lot of bugs in this game. Models glitching out, UI freezing up and lagging constantly, and no short order of crashes. Thankfully, the devs are working hard to fix everything they can, and there is a ""hotfix"" beta version of the game you can opt into to receive regular small patches as they go. The game didn't launch in a broken unplayable state like we've grown used to these days, and it's improving every single day, but it's still something you should expect to encounter at some point. Here's a few notable ones I'm currently dealing with still a week after launch.

- The Dark culture's archer unit, the Pursuer, has a broken profile picture after receiving transformations. It displays as a giant triangle on a blue sky and just makes me picture Pyramid Head frolicking through the meadows every time I see it.
- When an Iron Golem unit dies in combat, its polygons stretch across the entire screen until it despawns. This one may be fixed already, I don't see Iron Golems in every game, but it was consistent with every unit in the game I saw it in.
- This one really annoys me. When you choose a new research that completes instantly because you have a lot of points banked up, the game freezes for about 10 seconds while it tries to update your choice. It happens every single time you instant finish a research, and that's not a rare occurrence in the endgame. Irritating.
- Ancient Wonders just don't have events attached to them sometimes, just throws you into a fight unceremoniously. I've only encountered this in the Story Realms but it's really jarring when it happens. It might have something to do with AIs interacting with them before you but I'm not sure.

Back on the topic of faction customisation, while there is a ton of freedom for you as the player to create and explore new possibilities for your races, the game frankly does a terrible job of populating the world with interesting and distinct species. Every Free City race you encounter outside of the Story Realms seems to be a randomly generated species with no connection or cohesion to the rest of the game. The game has a bias towards putting a Free City with YOUR race nearby to your starting location, which is great, but it never seems to do that for the AI opponents. I had a game with two Free Cities populated by red mole people. You could not tell them apart, which is a really hard thing to say without sounding racist, and their cities were right next to each other. The two cities were of different cultures, and therefore different species, with no defining traits to differentiate them from each other, and were both separate from the AI ruler who was ALSO playing a race of red mole people. So there's three red mole races on this map and nothing for you to latch onto about any of them. I wish the Free Cities were ruler's race so there would be some cohesion in the world but alas that is not currently the case and it kills a lot of the fun role-playing aspects of the game.

Speaking of the AI rulers, oh my god they suck. The AI in combat is pretty good (though still exploitable) but on the overworld they are absolutely pathetic. All they do is turtle. They build a giant army of 20 stacks of units and just sit in their cities doing nothing. I have never once felt threatened in a war against the AI. They'll sending raiding parties every now and then, burning your provinces and being a minor nuisance, but they refuse to assault you at any point. In 40+ hours of play, I have never EVER experienced a siege on one of my cities. I have done dozens of siege fights and I have never once seen them from the defenders side. The only time an AI has taken one of my cities is because I left it undefended and forgot to build walls. I've only played on Normal difficulty so far so I don't know if the experience if different on the harder modes, but I've read some players' experiences on Brutal being the same. 

The biggest nuisance with that is in the Magic Victory. When you go for a Magic Victory, you cast a world-altering spell that gives you immense power, everyone in the world who isn't already allied with you (assuming allied victory is on) immediately declares war, and you have to defend three points in your cities (or the cities themselves) for 15 turns from waves of spawning marauders and an onslaught of AI armies. Except there is no onslaught of AI armies because THEY NEVER ATTACK YOU! The Magic Victory should be a bloodbath of you defending an endless wave of desperate armies with your incredible power. You gain such a massive advantage from casting the final spell that triggers the victory; every affinity has a unique crazy effect that makes you a powerhouse in combat, on top of halving all of your regular spell costs. But you never get to play with that immense power because no one comes for you. The AI is all too willing to just sit at home and wait for them to lose the game, so all you end up doing for the Magic Victory is pressing end turn 15 times as fast as you can so you can move on to the next game. It's so anticlimactic, they NEED to change this.

Conclusion:

Despite my gripes with the game, both major and minor, I absolutely love Age of Wonders 4 and I want others to love it to. There's a lot more I can write about the game, both positive and negative, but the simple matter is that AoW4 is a truly special game and I believe the developers care enough to make it the best game it can be.",1683523869,1683523869,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played AOW3 as well as Planetfall. I enjoyed both of them - even spent the time to write up a unit build tree for AOW3 that is still pinned last I checked. This game is better (and doesn't need a build tree thanks to the in game chaining tooltips)

Comparing AOW3 and PF, there were parts that I liked better in each. AOW4 takes most of those best parts, brings them together and mostly improves them. A very short list:

 - Diplomacy is much more flushed out
 - The province system from PF was improved and is much more rewarding when growing your city
 - The system for supporting armies is much better - range of 3 hexes now so don't have to play the fill-the-hexes game in the world map before attacking. It also allows you to use your mounted/high speed units to ride on ahead from site to site without having to wait so long for the walkers
 - Extensive customization of your race, leader and the realm. Much as been touted about this but it really is quite good.
 - Unit mods from PF were turned into unit enchantments from the magic tomes, which is easier to manage and still lets lower tier units play past the early game
 - Chained tool tips for all in game terms and mechanics. You won't believe what a difference that makes in getting the info you want exactly when you want it
 - There is a ton more to like but I'll leave it there

Some bits that were lost, which may be important to you:
  - Lore. In creating fully customizable races, race specific units (and their flavor text) were dropped in favor of a modular framework. If you were into all the unit descriptions from the previous games, those are gone
  - No campaign. I actually enjoy doing campaign missions and although I do miss it, the story realms are kind of a campaign-light. And honestly, I don't mind it as much as I thought I would. The fully customizable sand box experience more than makes up for it
  - No race specific traits (they were basically pushed to culture selection). This is a hot topic but fortunately, it is moddable so expect mods to add these back in (like this one: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972670716)
  - Looking over the modding docs, I'm pretty sure we can expect mods that add chained stories with custom cultures, units and abilities. I expect someone will go to town with it - something like a Demon Cycle inspired campaign (from Peter Brett's books) would fit right in.

Some bits that I think would make it even better through DLCs and mods:
  - More cultures. There are currently 6. It would really add even more customization and allow you to create exactly the different ""races"" that you want. Examples: Merchant, Zealot, Imperial, Nature
 - I personally think 2 mind + 2 body traits instead of 1 each would improve customization as well though that could cause balance issues. However, I would imagine that would be offset since all races would get them as well. Not sure if that is moddable.
 - Although the combat AI is pretty good, the campaign AI could use another pass. It isn't terrible, but the combat AI is better.",1683516272,1683518893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So, if you really enjoyed that game you might dislike this one. 

The units are no longer special to each race, instead they are dependent on the path you take for your civilization. If you go nature you get a lot of units to do with nature and animals. It is actually a lot of fun and diverse so far. I assume more options are going to come in DLC and maybe even some new races. The races do have differences in the bonuses they get based on their race and they are very unique and fun. Even more options than in AOW 3.

*Just to be clear* I write this review not out of anger, I'm not refunding the game. I actually enjoy and love the game, I love making characters based off my family members and giving them crazy attributes and traits, like I gave my brother the trait of a cannibal who destroys everything. I write this review for the devs to one day fix the game crashing constantly, because when the game works, it's a blast and joy to play, it just kills my entire mood towards this game when I'm all into a battle just for the game to crash out of nowhere. Luckily the game is very good at auto saving right before a crash, so normally I can load up right where I crashed at. Though I did have to make another play-through because I was on an endless crash loop during a battle after every time I won the battle, and I couldn't afford to lose the battle. So hopefully the devs will one day patch any crashes in the future and I'd be happy to change my review.
*One last edit* Game keeps crashing constantly, it crashes during auto-battles, and it keeps crashing when I try to animate any of the heroes I killed.

Don't feel like reading the whole thing? 
Down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game! :)

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Age of Wonders 4 is the ultimate fantasy creator; it allows you to design and develop your creations and see them evolve into new beings! From barbaric moles to engineer elves and toad lords, the freedom to create races and imbue them with traits is incredibly rich in this 4X strategy game! It traps you in a world of magic and, well, wonder!

The characters you play reinforce the game's roleplaying, thanks to the cultures one can pick. Playing as the good guys is not an aesthetic but a conscious choice to help neutral parties and keep your citizens happy. It changes the approach to each match and how you play the diverse rulers, whether premade or original ones you made. 

[h1]Control and Map Design[/h1]
The affinities and tomes are the blood that keeps the game fresh, for there are multiples of them, each offering significant bonuses. Chaos benefits from fighting all the time and razing cities, while Materium is about expanding your economy and filling your vaults with gold. The tomes include many spells that serve unique purposes and become extremely powerful as they develop into further tiers.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973035590

The affinities and races try to communicate that Age of Wonder 4 is a game about choices and adaptability: To start new worlds and see what is abundant, what is lacking, and which are the correct decisions. Rulers have their personalities bundled with strategies to defeat their enemies and control their vassals: The world is full of dungeons, provinces, and resources that can make all the difference between joining the pantheon of Gods or being another forgotten mage in the annals of history.

[h1] Strong Points[/h1]
The game's strong point is that it is one of those titles you grab and cannot stop playing; it doesn't become boring or lose its appeal, managing to stay as fresh thirty hours in as it was during the initial three. The secret sauce? It's a colossal library of options when making characters and gameplay styles. The limit is your imagination, for chances are that if you can think of it, you will find a way to make it a reality in the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973035772

The story worlds are challenging and rich in the tale they communicate to the player, featuring some twists. While some players might dislike how unfair some of the story realms can be, others will enjoy the added challenge and some lore to enjoy with the visited worlds. Pulling out strategies is satisfactory, as you can, for example, make a mainland full of ice and undead to keep your foes at bay. 

[h1] Art Design and Visuals [/h1]
Visually the game is impressive, especially regarding the monster's designs. From giant demons made of black fog to trees the size of a building or gremlins with demonic pitchforks, there is a variety of untold amounts with great personalities that make them come alive on the screen. You can even get bone dragons, archdemons, or golems if that fancies you too.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973035416

The beautiful game maps feature rich diversity, from cold deserts to islands in the void or lands overrun with lava. There is a lot to admire and glance upon as you play the title, and characters' transformations reinforce that even more as their skin becomes steel or they get Gaia's favor and become one with nature. Animations can be lacking in combat, but with so much variety in troops and content, it can be forgiven more easily.

[h1]Sound, Replayability and Performance[/h1]
Regarding the sound, Age of Wonders 4 provides some high notes, but others are lacking. Effects in battle are lackluster, as attacks can sound generic between units. Voice acting in the narrator is a treat, particularly when unlocking new tomes as she speaks about their origins, purposes, and authors. The music is phenomenal, which makes me puzzle about why the developers made it an occasional thing rather than a constant one over the world map.

Regarding replayability, the game has enough content to keep you hooked for 30-60 hours for the average player. Those that dig deep will find themselves with a title that can easily net them 100-300 hours as they explore every layer the game offers. The DLC roadmap also adds exciting content, such as new units and dragon rulers, which is something to look forward to!

Performances-wise, I could run the game only at 40-48 ish framerate on High settings. Like most strategy games, Age of Wonder 4 suffers from the issue of not running as smoothly as it could, but by now, that is a trend of the genre and not something new as we have observed in titles such as the Total War series and the such. Some crashes also placate the game, but for now, they are user-generated, meaning you get lucky like me and barely suffer or constantly get them. The developers are working hard on them and have released multiple hot fixes.

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Age of Wonder 4 is a fantastic strategy game full of wonder that can provide you with hours of fun, challenge, and surprises that don't get old as you spin your narrative with it. The prospect of creating so much and then taking it to the battlefield and experimenting with it is rich and full of innovation! It is a beautiful game to explore. While it offers less profundity than its predecessor and suffers from issues, it is a breathtaking game for those who enjoy fantasy and strategy.

This is a potent mix of Heroes of Might and Magic, Civilization and a dash of Total War.

You build your own faction with specialized traits, then add more traits in a roguelike-fashion during your campaign. The system lets you build hundreds of unique factions- Demonic Human Farmers, Arcane Golddigger Dwarves, Angelic Orc inquisition, Undead Elven hordes, you name it.

Units also transform visually with each trait/upgrade, letting you build some crazy-looking units!

Campaign length is very reasonable, ranging from 20 to 100 runs depending on map size and scenario. This means you can actually finish a campaign in one sitting and try a new crazy faction straight away!

Don't be put off by the small army size of 6 units - up to 6 nearby armies on the map engage in combat together, so you get proper epic 18 vs 18 unit clashes in the end game.

The Good:
- Making your own race is great.  Nothing is locked between visuals and traits which I love (except for some special mounts like Unicorns).
- The game is beautiful
- The game is fairly intuitive for the level of depth as soon as you get left click = see info, right click = commit action
- There are unique ways to play from single city, underground, razing, etc that keep the game fresh for multiple plays
- Reloading in multiplayer and playing asynchronously is really cool.  This means if one person crashes it doesn't take everyone with them, even if it was the ""host""
- Auto combat is very fair and if you don't like the result you can choose to manually battle after auto combat which I adore.

The Bad:
- AI is weird.  For example one of my vassals is standing on my resource node and won't leave.  They tend to eventually get stuck wandering or in a single position.  They declare wars then do nothing.
- Multiplayer issues abound.  Luckily reloading is fast compared to Clausewitz.  The really painful part is desyncs during battle where the battle will replay (non-deterministically) after you reconnect and watch it.  Luckily so far out of like 10 they have all favored the player more in the second run.  This I imagine will not be as fun in PvP.
- Balance is poor but to be expected on launch, mostly due to things that lie in a gray area between bugs and working as intended.
- Moving/Actions are clonky in multiplayer.  I think this has something to do with rolling back / blocking actions when certain other decisions are being made by players.  Issue a build command or move 4-5x before it finally ""sticks"" is not uncommon and I don't know where I am supposed to be looking to know when tis possible for me to take actions again.
- Playing optimally takes a ton of time, so if you can't learn to let go a bit, turns might take quite awhile.

Short-Term Things I'd like to See:
- ""Goto live"" after a battle desync.  Replaying a 45 minute battle towards the end during a desync has made us end many a sessions and dread going back to a session.
- Better UI indicators when I can't take actions during MP.  I don't want to spam click and I don't want to hold people up because I didn't realize I can now take actions.
- Queueing buildings/units/spells should not cost money/mana until they start building.  I'd love to just play out X turns in a city without tying up all the gold.  If I don't have the gold when it gets to that building just throw me a warning/notice and cancel it.  This will speed up multiplayer a lot.
- Somewhere in the UI let me see how each unit contributes to my army power.

Longer-Term Things:
- AI/Balance
- More unit options",1683505060,1683505060,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- AI tactical combat. 
- Diplomacy is more difficult than previously as it ought to be.
- When setting Combat to manual only, allowing AI to take over whilst in manual combat is a plus for me. Planetfall disabled that option for some reason, which was a negative for me.
- It seems to have a slightly greater focus on RPG than before which I like.
- Better layout in the notices as they appear than previous games, they now include submenus.

I haven't played long enough to assess the strategic AI. I felt that Planetfall's AI was inferior to AoW3. AoW3 pressed the player so that cities could not be left open without defense. I'm hoping that the AI has improved over Planetfall which was overcautious and encouraged turtling by the NPC.

Improvements that could be made:
- It can sometimes be difficult selecting armies especially over city tiles. Sometimes I have to go into the Armies menu to select the army stack.
- Combat speed defaults to normal (slow), unlike Planetfall that sets the speed to last selected option. Invoking that option as in Planetfall would be good.
- Implementing something akin to Empire mode in Planetfall would be awesome.
- Pantheon list is cumbersome. Possible heroes are currently mixed with possible Leader opponents.
- Prioritise heroes in the pantheon when recruiting would be a plus.

I started the series playing Age of Wonders 2 as a child, along with many other strategy games like the Settles, Star craft, Age of Empires, Empire Earth, etc. I own and enjoy many other games in the same style, like Warlock, masters of the Arcane, Endless Legend and space, heroes of might and magic, etc.

I feel like this series has maintained its spirit and identity very well over the years, and I can say I enjoy this one the most. I feel like the design is well thought out, the systems are enjoyable to engage in, and I enjoy the modular culture and magic system that meaningfully emphasizes different playstlyes.

I feel that this a faster pace than other 4x games, and I enjoy that the combat feels like it rewards thinking things through in terms of army build and movement and attack vs defense.

It's quite fun, looks good, and runs well for me, although I am aware there are issues with it for some folks. I'm not a huge fan of the grind to unlock stuff, and you can tell they are adding stuff in future, as though there are many options, we need a lot more.

It's a great game for sure, with some great options, but I do have a few complaints. The naval stuff is dull and I avoid naval combat as it also just feels bland compared to the normal battles. Having only 2 traits for race (beyond society that is), feels limiting and I'd like to be subterranean AND have quick reflexes for example. The flying units actually animated slower than their normal version, so take longer to travel (although you can speed that up by double clicking), and I feel that if an army is only flying units, and especially a solo flying unit (like a scout), it should not have to go into 'boat mode'. The entire naval system is my least favorite part of this game in general.

Putting that aside, and it's mostly minor stuff, I'm really digging this. Being able to be cannibalistic, cavern dwelling halflings, or industrial orcs that dabble in nature magic is fun stuff. The regular combat is very good, and in general, the AI is decent for auto battles, although it can fail at odd times, but since you can retry the fight immediately, that's not a huge deal. The animations and graphics are great stuff, and I love how all the different tomes look.

I look forward to what they bring next, and if they can fix the issues many people are having, fix the lackluster naval system, and give us more options, this is going to be a fantastic game.",1683501319,1683501319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the unfamiliar this game is basically a modern Heroes of Might & Magic with win conditions similar to the Civilization series.  The game supports many different playstyles due to the combination of spells granted by the various spellbooks, the race trait selections, and the racial society traits.

The tactical AI is fairly good at using its buffs.  It does struggle with the idea of flanking in close combat sometimes and it also can be a little too passive if it has a bunch of shield-wall capable units, but nothing that I've seen from the AI has any game breaking issues with it.  If you don't want to fight a match, the auto resolve for tactical combat is actually really good since it is an actual match played.  You can even watch a replay of if you don't want to manually control the tactical battles.  If you're dissatisfied with the result, you could also reject the outcome of the battle and restart the fight with manual control.

The strategic AI is mostly governed by personality, which dictates their attitude towards forming alliances, using grievances, and trading.  Despite that, they will still be very likely to declare war with you if you start one of the victory conditions.  As far as I've played on the normal difficulty, the AI is actually decent at the game and does build armies, upgrade their cities, and use all spells they have obtained through research.

Game performance is pretty smooth until you get battles that contain the maximum of 36 units, which is 3 armies of 6 units for both sides.  This was my main issue with the game as it'll go down to an unflinching 20 fps at that point for the tactical battles.  Outside of tactical battles, frame-rate is stable.

[h1] TL;DL at the bottom[/h1]
[list]
    [*] [h1] AI: [/h1] Straight to my biggest concern - the difficulty and passiveness of ai strategy. On any difficulty ai is too weak and has no chance of winning agaist human players because they are too friendly and will not ruin your peaceful existence by any means. Yes, they will denounce you or even declare a war on you BUT THEY WILL JUST EXIST AND PLAY IN THE MOST DEFENSIVE AND PASSIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
AI can send you at most a few scounting units to raid your provinces but you can just spawn any battle unit in your city to easily defend your territories. Their behavior doesn't change on any difficulty but they will have some kind of ""head start"" which scales with increasing difficulty. When you get the grip of the game it becomes very unchallenging and uninteresting to enjoy the game. Casual and unexperienced players maybe will have some fun playing but the question is: for how long? To conclude, FIX YOUR GOD DAMN AI PLEASE.

    [*] [h1] PERFOMANCE OF THE GAME: [/h1] This game is pure early access in terms of optimisation. Devs already are tring to fix some issues but it's not enough. Basically all my played time was in multiplayer and the game is unenjoyable there: constant desyncs in the late game, game freezes in battles and in the world map, fps gradually drops as the game progresses (ex. ~140 fps on turn 1 and 40-60 on turn 100). The specs of PC don't matter at all cuz the game doesn't know how to utilize them properly (my friend has 2070 laptop and i got 4070 ti and both getting the same perfomance and fps).

    [*]  [h1] MULTIPLAYER: [/h1] I have some positive things to say about multiplayer: the process of creating a mp session is fast and smooth. If you get a desync or your game is bugged and doesn't let you finish your turn - you can really fast reload it or reconnect to the server without the need of creating a new session and loading the last save.
Now to the negative sides: the biggest downside of mp is not be able to manually battle units alongside with other players: they need to wait for you to end the battle or watch how you fight other units. And this feature forces you to auto-battle almost everytime (unless you lose some units because auto-battle is stupidly dumb then you have to manually combat). This leads us to the main point: YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ENJOY PLAYING WITH OTHER RANDOM PLAYERS BECAUSE OF THIS BULLSHIT.
I was tired of watching/waiting battles of 1 extra player, but imagine if there are 3-5 extra player the game will last ages of time.

    [*] [h1] BATTLES: [/h1] They are ok in the early game but in the late game they become really boring and unimaginative: magic looks very dull and not impactful/impressive. Visual effects are very simplified and plain. Units are pretty much the same (they differ visually and by element of magic they use from each other). You have no challenge in battles at all and after a few turns you enable auto-combat to skip this faster and have fun in the strategic gameplay (which is much better then combat).

    [*] [h1] CIV VS HoMM: [/h1] Pretty much everyone noticed that this game is the baby of CIV and HoMM. [spoiler] Except HoMM went for ciggarets and never came back [/spoiler] CIV aspect of the game is very enjoyable and fun and makes it better parent. As for HoMM aspect: Dungeons are ok but the artifact you get are dull and just not fun. Mounts differ by very small margin (ex. some kind of battle buff or allows you to ignore movement penalties on the world map), other items give some little buffs like hp or damage in combat and nothing globally. One hero per city is a dumb rule and it forces you to playing other armies without one (to be clear, you can recruit more heroes with 1 city but you pay more for them and it costs you 30 gold per turn extra which you cannot afford early game). All in all, HoMM is a terrible part of the game which can be fixed with patches/DLCs or even mods but the question is when. Right now you can enjoy the CIV aspects of AoW as it actually put efforts in raising its child.
[/list]

  [h1] Pros: [/h1]
     + Singleplayer is far more enjoyable and is not as irritating as multiplayer.
     + Civ aspect of the game is great
     + There is auto-combat
     + Pantheon
     + Many scenarios to play
     + Race customization is cool

  [h1] Cons: [/h1]
      - Multiplayer is broken and unenjoyable
      - AI is dogshit on any difficulty
      - Battles are boring
      - Perfomance is poor
      - HoMM aspect of the game is trash tbh

Only issue I have currently is that the AI on the campaign map is SUPER dodgy and needs a bit of work. For example, I built an outpost and my ally AI parked a group of units on it. My outpost is now ""occupied"" and I can't do anything with it.  However, as this is my ally, if I attack them to get them to move I then break my alliance and go to war. Their units have been parked on my outpost for 20 turns and will not move. Other than that annoyance. The AI is just a bit stupid in general on the campaign map. Enemy AI is easy to outsmart and just stacks hordes of units together and your Ally AI is actually more of a hinderance.

There are bugs, and the graphics option is very minimal (E.g., missing an option to turn off DOF, bloom, etc., without going into the config file), but hopefully those get added in with time.
--------------------------------
My original review was negative based on a rather extreme bug where the launch version of the game fails to detect amd 7900 xt / xtx cards and causes the game to use the cpu graphics instead, leading to frame rates in the 10s and below.  I was able to fix this eventually via an ini edit after finding a thread in the discussion form but this was a rather extreme bug and I hope it's since been fixed.",1683065109,1683494501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved the previous Age of Wonders fantasy games and both AoW 2 Shadow Magic and AoW 3 were absolutely brilliant, and I do see the very same spirit again in this one. Which I am quite happy for as Planetfall was not at all to my liking so it is refreshing to see they went back to their very well crafted roots.

The customizing of AoW 3 has just been improved and you now have even more ways to create your custom empire from a different options. This is a bit of a double-edged sword because now the factions themselves lose a bit of their uniqueness as a result and maybe they went a bit too far here, I will update accordingly if I should get this feeling.

But so far with my first game the parts where they improved on, especially the city management and spell book/empire system are very enjoyable and allow a lot of custimization and meaningful choices while still not cementing yourself into your choosen path. The battle system is fantastic as ever and is basically AoW 3 refined - which actually is a good thing as the combat in AoW 3 was near-perfect.

So as a very early review, please take it at the moment with a big grain of salt due to my lack of hours (again, I probably will update it later on and write more), if you enjoyed AoW 3 and looking for a worthy successor, AoW 4 very much so delivers.",1683494453,1683494453,True,2,0,0.507684946060180664,0,True,False,False

Graphics are very pretty, sound is good though not thrilling.  The play of the game isn't all that similar to other Paradox 4X games or others in the genre, so again it appears to have a steep learning curve but with a few viewed videos it all makes sense and that apparent learning curve disappears.  Play 20 rounds of a game using the easy map and the main human faction and all the basics disappear.

Biggest knock I have so far is that the creation of buildings in your cities almost feels like an afterthought... there isn't the feel of a significant change being made that you get from the same action in, for example, Civilization VI.  It's hard to explain, but clearly the game is more unit-centric than city-centric, at least for me after 8 hours of play.

If there was any one gripe I would stick to, it's that the naval aspect of the game truly is nothing more than an obstacle.

The main focus here is less on a campaign and more on a sandbox experience which I think is implemented well, but personally, I would rather have a more detailed campaign. Some highlights, in comparison to the previous game - are a much better diplomacy system and more options for role-playing, such as alignments and affinities. 

The only thing that I really dislike is minor UI things. It is easy to be confused by what LMB and RMB do in this game and since the game never asks for confirmation of your actions it is easy to accidentally move your unit or use a skill. The same goes for some in-game menus. When you choose the next spell to research, you can lock one spell and then pick the one you want to research, but if you accidentally click on a spell first then the game considers that you made a decision and closes the window. Similar problem with levelling and diplomacy windows, they all have different call-to-action controls which is super confusing. 

Devs please, create one set of call-to-action UI components and use them across all interfaces in your game. This is like UX 101.

The modding potential here is huge.

Visually, the modular system also shines. It's satisfying to see your units visually change according to the combination of racial transformations. You could also mix any culture with any unit, which is quite an amazing feat.

Lastly in comparison to previous AoW titles, this one is more streamlined and ""balanced"".

First is the race/culture thing. It's kind of neat that you can change the traits of a race, but what do you get when you give Elves the same traits as human? Pointy eared humans. It goes further if both have the same culture choice. Gone are the units that seperated races from each other. Sure, as you progress thru the game and choose tomes you can get some diversity, but in the above mentioned Human/Elf comparison the differences are just visual. Next, is maps and the lack of an indepth map editor. The maps are too small and crowded for my liking. Can I create a map? Not really. The size of the map is determined by the number of players. You can't pick a map size then pick how many/how few of players you would like for that game. Also, you can't increase/decrease the  number of mountains on the map. More than once my staring city was hemmed in on more than one side by mountains that you can't settle/annex. Can't turn off the underground, best you can do is make it small and uninhabitable. Road building is done by armies now. This makes no sense to me. Only hero lead armies can build outposts now, and you must build an outpost and then turn that into a city. The diplomacy compared to AOW Planetfall is lacking, especially when it comes to free cities. Instead of a limited number of whispering stones how about some kind of diplomat? It sucks when you can only talk to one free city because you only have one stone. Yes you can get one or two more by spending imperium in the empire tree, but you also need imperium to found cities and for diplomacy. All in all Go play Planetfall.

Another amazing feature is there are quest decisions in-game which will change your alignment and how you interact with the rest of the AI and players. Really well thought through.

[-]Balance (certain under-powered affinities and tomes) 

The Pantheon progression system single-handedly solves one of the biggest problems with strategy games for me. Whereas normally the end of other games become snowbally and boring, pushing me to start a new one, the pantheon encourages you to finish the game and progress the pantheon. I really hope it is expanded on in the future and other 4X/strategy games follow suit.

The story realms are a great addition for a focused story driven experience, and I hope more are added in the future.

Race creation has decent depth for a base-game and should only get better as more content is released for it.

Gameplay and graphics are excellent.

Overall balance is good, although some affinities feel significantly stronger than others. Hopefully this can be addressed by bringing some of the lower powered affinities and tomes up to the levels of the stronger ones.",1683465165,1683465165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the things that stood out to me about the game was its combat system. It was both challenging and fun, and I found myself carefully planning my attacks and turn movements in order to succeed. 

Positives:
The variety of units available added an extra layer of complexity to battles, which kept things fresh and exciting. I also enjoyed the pace game, which allowed me to forge my own story line and made the game play feel dynamic and engaging. The technology/research, in-game economy, politics, and cultural alignment mechanics added an extra layer of depth to the game and kept me invested all the way through to campaign completion. Speaking of campaign completion, the addition of your character into the halls of your ""pantheon"" is so cool! I put alot of effort into my main character, so it was very rewarding to see him firstly, angelize the entire race of humanity, then become god emperor of mankind, and finally be immortalised forever in my pantheon!

Negatives/wish list:
Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the game, I did feel like it could have benefited from more core unit variety, especially in the late game. Additionally, I found myself wishing for more customisation options and hero items, as I kept seeing the same high-tier items appear repeatedly. This took away from my immersion a little bit, but I'm not stressed because I know there will be a strong modding community behind this game in the future.

Closing thoughts:
Overall, Age of Wonders 4 is an excellent addition to the turn-based strategy genre, and I highly recommend it to all of my friends. While there are some minor areas for improvement, the game is an engaging and I can't wait to start my second campaign to add yet another Godkin to my pantheon.",1683464736,1683464736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Age of Wonders 4 is what would happen if you took a Heroes of Might and Magic styled game, mixed it with Civ 6 and Stellaris. The basic gameplay is creating a faction with different abilities, magical affinities, story line and ruler, and fighting it out in a realm, or... randomly generated map. You build cities, make friends, go to war and attempt to win the game either through sheer force, magic or economy (iirc.) You'll be leading armies of 6 units, including a hero unit, into turn based battles to achieve your victory.

Now... I did say this was similar to Civ 6 and Stellaris and let me unpack that a bit. This isn't a 4X focused game. After putting more time into the game, learning it's systems, playing around with it and talking to series vererans, AoW has always been a more combat focused game. You have the OPTION to win in other ways, but combat is really the meat here.

The Stellaris comparison comes the form of making your rulers. There are preset rulers and their races, but I've found the real joy comes from making your own wild creations. I've seen people complain that the races feel like blobs, no personality. Same thing can be said about your species in Stellaris, their just portraits, but it's how you imagine them that adds the flavor. Sure there's no REAL difference between orcs and ratkin... but could you imagine an Orc swarm build? That'd be terrifying, and what my current play through is. Or hyper magical necromancer dwarves. Or tree hugging rats... Sure gameplay doesn't change all that much if it's swarm rats or orcs or elves, but that's where imagination comes into play.

There are a few issues though.
- I'm not a huge fan of the tutorial. It's very open and relies on your going to the right hex, clicking the right boxes or opening the right menus. I failed a few quests because I didn't press the right hex to open an outpost builder, I assumed new cities was locked behind city upgrades.
- Naval combat is a bit... wonky. If you have flying units, or water units or ship units it looks fine, but if you have normal land units in naval combat... it just looks like boats slapping each other. Was hoping for maybe... arrows or a simple boarding animation? It just looks a bit lazy.
- It doesn't seem like range units, be it magic or arrows, get a bonus from higher elevation. I don't know if that's hidden away in some stats or it's accuracy instead of damage, but it's a bit odd to see, or... not see in this case.

All in all, this game is fantastic. It builds such an amazing atmosphere with it's music, sound effects, graphics and effects. Waging war feels great, leading 3 armies to siege down the last enemies capital city feels appropriately epic as you use all your spells for extra units, money for rushing new units in near by cities and attacking bonuses. Could do with a bit more map variety for the battles and dialogue but other than that, this is easily one of the best games I've played all year and can see this being my GOTY for right now.

Love the amount of customization and stories that emerge while playing the game and leading your chosen faction, coupled with excellent 4X gameplay. BUT the biggest leap in comparison with AOW 1-3 is the presentation - the game looks beautiful, the art style is top-notch, hero models and units are detailed and a joy to look at, something that was severely lacking in previous games. Easily the best looking fantasy strategy ever made, they finally nailed it!

Pros:
- Excellent mix of 4X and HoM&M style games.
- Beautiful art style. Seriously, no amount of praise is enough. Every single unit is beautifully designed and modelled. Living Fog from the Shadow Tome is *chef's kiss*.
- The amount of customization when it comes to creating your faction is astounding. Various traits, enchantments, summons, transformations... just wow! Same goes for generating a Realm.
- Interesting exploration via side-quests and empire events.
- Engaging gameplay loop.
- Awesome soundtrack.
- Tactical battles are better than ever, striking the perfect balance between streamlining and complexity.
- A truckload of new features and improvements.
- Attention to detail, such as your actual units & heroes being visible during various events, when entering an Ancient Wonder or approaching the portal etc. Or naming convention for NPC heroes, all seem consistent and interesting. Or the little bits of lore displayed on a parchment paper when entering an Ancient Wonder. Or the fact that Wizard Kings can opt out of racial transformations while Champions cannot. Or hero mounts being interchangeable. 
- Clean UI (with a single caveat, see Cons).
- Hot Seat!
- It's got DWARVES.
- ... and playable Molekin!
- Finally no dire penguins everywhere! ^^

Cons:
- This is my single biggest gripe. The unit banners during combat are obnoxious, big and ugly. You are given the option to turn them off, but a lot of combat-related information is tied to them and gets hidden when the banners are gone (e.g. the amount of damage dealt and received). An ideal solution would be to either only display banners of your selected unit vs highlighted enemy (it's kind of already there when playing the attack animation) or making the banners MUCH smaller. Or moved to the side of the screen and stacked, Total War style. Currently we've got our custom-made armies and the beautiful environments completely obstructed by the UI. 
- An occasional random crash may occur from time to time. Nothing drastic, in my case the game crashed several times over 70 hours I clocked so far, Nothing major but needs to be pointed out.
- Physical Form Traits are kind of underwhelming. While Society and Culture provide some game-changing options, Physical Form Traits are just minor stat buffs (+10% damage or +10 HP). Would love to see some more meat here, something more defining. 

Side notes:
- Some folks complain about the lack of campaign, but personally I don't care, not a fan of campaigns in strategy games anyway. The existing Story Realms do the job just fine. 
- Some folks also complain about performance -- can't really tell, the game runs like a charm on a mid gaming spec (RTX 3060 | Ryzen 5600X | 16GB RAM).
- Some folks also complain about this not being an Age of Wonders game, because... reasons? I guess some do not like the free-form races or the expanded 4X elements. Dunno, the game has evolved and it's the best iteration yet. Every AOW has been slightly different, bringing in new ideas and dropping some old ones. Direct comparison to AOW1&2/SM would be unfair due to the age gap, but imo AOW4 is miles and leagues ahead of AOW3 & PF. 

All in all the game is GOAT. Get it.

Bad 

- Mediocre combat UI. As much as the campaign UI is great the combat one is a mess. You get used to it after a while but there's no reason why buffs and debuffs aren't clearly displayed with mouseover infos above the unit's stats at the bottom. Will be fixed eventually, either by the devs or by mods, but still.

- Combat performance is ""bad"". I know it's bad bad for some people, I personally have good FPS but I do hear my beefy PC breathe heavily during combat. And while the game looks great it doesn't look 3080ti-and-12900k-sweating-buckets great, so some optimization may be required.

Neutral 

- It's a game where players have a lot of ""creative freedom"" when customizing their factions. Which means that stuff will be unbalanced as hell : enchantment-stacked fortune-fed tome of the Horde tier 1 archers with 100+ damage volleys, hero support skills being vastly better than battle or magic skills, wizard king origin that can win battles turn 1 or 2 by double casting OP spells while the ascended champion twiddle their thumbs. And that's just after 35h of gameplay. While I don't mind it one bit because I only play solo or coop vs AI I don't know how PvP will play out...

- The soundtrack is good as always, but nothing really sticks out for me. It's a nice ambient jam but lacks the bangers of the first couple of Age of Wonders games. That's just my personnal taste though.

Good 

Everything else. If I had to single out a couple of improvements over previous games :

- The tome system is fantastic, so much freedom. While as I said before this might create balance issues in PvP it is an absolute treat in PvE. A beginner can focus on one theme and do just fine while a veteran can start experimenting with culture and tome combinations for some truly strong custom builds. *Chef's kiss*

- Unit enhancements/transformations are so nice to use compared to Planetfall's unit mods. Pretty much the same depth without any of the hassle. 

- I really like the way they've made your average custom game be a part of the overall ""meta"" game progression with the Pantheon system. I know a lot of people might be bummed by the lack of a full narrative campaign but I'm not a fan of those campaigns where you play a bunch of different premade characters and factions. I pretty much only ever played custom games anyway.

- The new siege system is good. Adds a new layer of possibilities and in the end plays better than Planetfall garrisons and obviously better than having to leave armies in your cities at all times to avoid some random enemy flying scout razing your whole metropolis ._.

So yeah, the game looks great, plays great, has awesome replayability and a wealth of content and possibilites. If you're not the biggest fan of how messy and janky Total War's real time battles can get then Age of Wonders 4 offers the cleanest turn-based strategy combat on the market. While it is hard to compete right off the bat with the sheer amount of content and IP of the Total War Warhammer games and DLCs, this game comes pretty damn close, for a fraction of the price and with a better polish.

Age of Wonders games are 5 out of 5 for me, keep 'em coming Triumph.

Pros:
+ Alot of customization options
+ Graphics feel modern
+ Fun characters
+ It feels random everytime I play
+ MODS already available, doing quality improvements <3

Cons:
- It keeps scrolling my camera to events that I don't care about, and I can't turn that off. Annoying!
- Multiplayer: Feels bugged, desyncs happen regulary. (However fixes with a Reload button)
- Multiplayer: You need to wait for someone to finish their battles before doing anything, some battles can take 20-25 minutes. I would love to at least be able to finish upgrades or look into more customization while people did their battles.

Some current issues I've had:

The strategic map AI is too timid when it comes to attacking cities. It will often bunch up its units menacingly, but then fail to actually make an attack. The tactical (combat) AI seems fairly decent, but for some reason doesn't like casting high level spells.

Expansion victory type feels a bit tacked-on and similar to the magic victory without all the cool bonus effects.

Weird limitations with the UI. You can't make a faction unless starting a new realm. It's annoying to go through your heroes to find who needs a new ring. You can't edit the auto-generated descriptions for your custom factions.

#1 - It's really good. This makes Age of Wonders 3 look like a bare-bones game, in comparison. There's a lot going on here.

#2 - Sometimes, it's a bit too much going on, maybe. Free cities, other empires, random monster armies on the map, annexing provinces, diplomacy, skills, spells, affinities, empire skills... it's a lot happening each turn, which at times is great, but at times is slightly overwhelming. That said, it's just 150 turns on default settings, so I do get that each turn needs to have a fair amount to do in it.

#3 - If you auto-resolve battles, you're missing out in many ways. The tactical battles are like mini X-com engagements with more in the way of tactics this go-round.

#4 - Research in this is a mixed bag. The tomes system is not bad per-se, but it resorts to the same 3-card monte that I hated with Old World. I really, really despise having to choose from just 3 techs each time I choose, and having to pay something to flip 3 new cards... I don't know. Again, it's not an entirely bad system, as it ties into the affinities nicely in some ways, but I really hate teching this way, and again, this was one of my strikes against Old World, too.

#5 - UI is beautiful and largely works well, but a slight bit of redundancy at times... some events will pop-up AND still have a reminder in the check-list prior to ending the turn. And in some spots, I have to select to cast a spell but do it without targeting anything... overworld spells seem to keep needing me to take one menu to cast it, then a turn or two later, another menu to target what it's cast on. That's silly... let me cast it and pick its target at the same time in the same turn. It's needlessly split between initiating the spell, then targeting with it on an entirely different turn. That isn't necessary at all and should be simplified.

#6 - There's a whole lot to learn. This is night and day compared to Vic 3... I got Vic 3 and was shocked how little there is to do there, and it's nice to have a Paradox game that actually does have a lot to learn and process again.

#7 - Performance-wise, it's great. Just make sure the newest GPU drivers are downloaded, because there was a late-April update I hadn't picked up yet on my AMD GPU and the game was all kinds of stuttery at first. But after the driver update, not a problem at all running everything on High graphics quality.


Overall, this really surprises me. This makes up for the massive disappoints I had with Human Kind and Old World when it comes to turn-based 4x games as of late. I assumed it would be decent, like AoW3 was, but this actually might be the best Paradox game in a few years. Not quite perfect, but definitely one of the best turn-based strategy games I've played in some time, and gives me Heroes of Might and Magic 3 vibes, which is a good thing.",1683426780,1683426780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Heroes found outposts & settle ruins which cuts out the need for settlers & units & structures have their own separate production queues which really helps the pacing of the game letting you get to the fighting faster without sacrificing your city building too much.

- [b]Nostalgia:[/b] Playing the first few hours gave me some nice flashbacks to the good old days of playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3. The game seems to be doing the genre justice.

- [b]Faction Customization:[/b] It seems like there is a wide variety of races you can choose from and other ways to customize your faction. That together with the variety of tomes and different buildings it seems like no game ever has to be the same.

- [b]Auto resolve cancel:[/b] If you auto resolve a battle you can always retry the battle manually if you don’t like the results. Not sure if this was part of the easy difficulty setting but I really liked this. It prevents the randomness from playing to big of a role.

- [b]Three option Research:[/b] Every new research you start is one from a choose of three random options. I liked that it prevents me from becoming overwhelmed by options. You can always pay to get new options.

- [b]Looks great:[/b] The theme and world look beautiful. I particularly like the scrolls with artwork and flavour text that open at certain locations.

[h1]What I didn’t like[/h1]
- [b]Zoomed-in map visual clarity:[/b] It was hard to see what all the objects and armies on the zoomed-in map were. I often zoomed out to the world map to get a better but less pretty overview.

- [b]Enemy range:[/b] I was often counting out how far enemy archers can walk and shoot so as to stay out of range. The game does show how far they can walk but doesn’t show their range.

- [b]Ancient Wonder battle:[/b] The first ancient wonder I came across was not clear that it was going to lead to a tough fight. I thought it was just something I could claim. 

[h1]Why others should try it[/h1]
It plays a bit like a mix of Civilization 5/6 and Heroes of Might and Magic. If you are into those games you should be good. There is alot to discover.

Let's start with your faction creation - I was really looking forward to that mechanic, and, well...
Your race has two traits (in AoW3 it had up to four), nothing prevents you from changing those traits (making each race, essentially, rubber elves).
Your civilization has only two available traits, some of the options presented are just bad, some are a must if you don't want to suffer later on.
And no, you can't take drawbacks to add more traits.
Your culture has a limited roster of units which you, outside of summons, cannot change. Want a 'High' culture with knights, or a 'Dark' one with frontline defenders? Too bad.
Speaking of frontline defenders, a unit with spear and shield does not exist - or I have not encountered any.

Combat in general is, largely, the same as it was in AoW3 and Planetfall - map is small, whoever lands a good first strike wins, archers suck, AI will always move in a tight group and stay out of you reach for as long as possible, not only ruining immersion, but also needlessly prolonging the fight, while being annoying af and pretending to be a tactical genius, no matter who you fight - feral swines, swamp trolls or ascended angels.

On economy, city-building and empire-building side, situation is atrocious. You will pay gold to make anything. And then you have to actually make that thing, by using two different production tracks and capacities - one for units, one for buildings. And no, you can't speed things up. Oh, and you will want gold for diplomacy, since AI always wants to be bribed in order to make a beneficial pact with you. And minor cities will have constant events that will force you to pay with gold or something even more precious, punishing relations or alignment as an alternative.
Speaking of making gold. Let's suppose you have a gold vein on map and you just claimed that region. A gold mine will provide you with 15g total. A single T1 unit costs 60 to make (plus production time), around 8 to upkeep. And if you cast any enchantments you will also pay upkeep for them per every unit it affects. And if you want some units from your vassals, they will also cost gold. And building an outpost costs gold and upkeep (and time).
Sure, you can cast that one transformation spell to make your entire race into gold golems, or build that astral bridge teleport, but what if you did not want to play king Midas - or go with astral books - in the first place? Seems like the game has other opinions and what you want is sort of irrelevant. 

Naval combat and exploration are anemic, settlements and races - and dedicated naval units - do not seem to exist. 

Compared to other games of this genre:
Warlock has better map exploration, city development, economy, and is more intuitive.
Dominions has better strategic and tactical combat, magic system, economy, and is better explaining what your faction does and how you are supposed to play - and simply is a better game. Also it has water-based races from the start, no dlc required.
Civilization Beyond Earth has a better affinity and civ perk system. Economy is, arguably, worse.
Hero's Hour is better, even though it is limited to military victory, riddled with balance issues, and it's AI is not good.
This all reminds me of Fallen Enchantress - a lot of customization, and not much of an interesting gameplay. 

tl;dr : pretty visuals, utter mediocrity of strategic, tactical and economic systems, plus some rather unrewarding customisation. Breadth of an ocean, depth of a puddle. Pick something else.",1683408884,1683408884,False,1,0,0.47486037015914917,0,True,False,False

And it's great!)

TLDNR: I think the best entry to AOW to date. If you're a fan of high customization of races, maps and scenarios in an RNG setting (which grows as you unlock more through the Paragon rank system = win a game, get points and unlock cosmetics,and new map presets/race options), this is the best 4X Fantasy version you will find, and will only get bigger and better with DLCS.

Really nice spin on the AOW series, clearing taking lots from Stellaris in terms of customization, but condensed into somewhat of a LITE version of it (or Total War) small maps being able to complete in about 4 hours with lots of toying around) and obviously much longer if you scale it up --- Tome system to modify your race 'as you go' is neat as you don't always follow the plan you first set out to and the results/ending of your race design can be pretty interesting and makes it feel fresh each game.

Some people complain the lack of unit upgrades compared to Planetfall, but this isn't really true as it's just been simplified as Unit Enchantments (based on tomes) that run a mana upkeep and apply to your entire army (only to relevant units)... so you cant buff 2-3 units in a group of 10, it'll be 0 or 10, but it honestly saves time and let's you focus more on the other aspects.

Personally, the splitting of Draft income (building troops) & production income (constructing buildings) with their own incomes, and own construction timers, is a godsend...I've always hate having to cancel or pause buildings because I needed more troops, or vice versa.The gameplay just feels so much smoother and more satisfying and you can still tech/expand with emphasis on larger armies or stronger infrastructure (or dedicate cities to one or the other).

Other complained story is lacking, but there are Story worlds with scripting and such, so it's not like it doesn't exist, personally with all AOW games I generally just played random gen, or custom maps, anyways to keep things fresh/new and unique an experience. I'd only play a story or campaign mission once ever at most.

Check the Discussion board / Bugs section and you'll understand immediately -- hope it's resolve soon and hope I can leave a ""real"" review with more than the 1.6hts of trying to troubleshoot, workaround, tamper and whittle system files, game files and the works in hope I can try to play more than 5s without blowing up my PC.",1683163897,1683405902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Believe me, I've been looking.

I've bounced off all the previous AoW games for various reasons, and this one has fixed, well, pretty much all of them. There are more and more meaningful options to customise your character, faction, and power set, all of which have implications through a given game and add replay value. City management is more interesting and less reliant on spam settling, while the tactical and strategic combat are as interesting as ever (the fix to the ""add nearby stacks to a battle"" system is particularly noteworthy). The magic is powerful enough to be fun and varied enough to hit all kinds of different fantasy aesthetics.

So how is the Age of Wonders4 (Aow4)? Simply, it is good, really good and I do enjoy playing it. Does it mean all is nice in the fantasy realm of Valley of Wonders? No, definitely not  but we will come to that later. First, let's list good stuff.

Graphics in the game are really good and nice for the eyes, for world maps, unit models, tactical maps and guis. If you zoom in or out it maintains high quality and allows you to enjoy details.  Animations are nice, maps are truly living places and you have feelings that you indeed explore a new breathing world. Exploring is really fun. Kudos for the graphic team.

Level of race/faction customization is just amazing. We never got to this level ever before. Magic Dwarves? No problem. Flesh eating brute elves? Here you go. Nimble, nature loving orcs? Sure. List can go and go. Add to this 6 different cultures with different units plus plenty of different tomes of magic that basically allows you to build your own tech tree for additional units, buildings, spells, mechanics and you will have difficulties deciding what to play next in your next game.

New city management with provinces and pops with deciding what feature you want to add to a new province is great. Much better than growing hex city radius in AoW3. New system feels more natural and goes more toward civilization management.

Combat is much better than in Aow3, which was too fast, too brutal and chaotic, always in the clashes in the first turn without time and space for tactics and chaotic race who will flank who.
In AoW4 it is gone and it is much better. There is more space between fighting armies in the tactical maps allowing for maneuvers, flanking is still valid and good option but now with more focus no buffing and debuffing skills plus other traits that promote and buff keeping tight or mutual supporting formations player has much more options to choose from that are 100% valid and useful. Plus a new morale system. With low morale not only providing fumbles that halves damage output, if one side is experiencing too many casualties it will just route with units running away from the battle. Sweet!

Autoresolve system is quite good. You can auto resolve many simpler combats to speed up your game and do not worry about losing units or getting them too damaged. Of course many times if you play manually you will get much better results than autoresolve if you understand combat mechanics and unit skill enough but if you do not like the result you can immediately choose to redo combat manually if auto resolve did something strange. Great feature!

New siege system is nice, you do not have to keep armies constantly in the cities, fortifications will allow you to free those units and buy you time to recruit new ones or return existing amries to besieged cities when need occurs. However, I have a feeling that this mechanics is not balanced yet, favouring the besieged city side as the city can quite easily increase the level of its fortifications while assaulting armies besieging projects have limited options and impact. It is quite easy to need to spend around 10 turns besieging a city before you can assault and believe me that is far too much time to redirect sufficient defense to a city under siege. AI on high difficulties can cheat like hell and even your strong armies can get caught in troubles sometimes.

OK, so after initial sweetness let us move to bitterness.  

Some design choices made by devs call for revenge to Heavens. One of my biggest complaints will be converting units. Since the start of the series enemy units that you managed to mind control till the end of the battle joined you afterwards. It was a very powerful skill that allowed you to obtain powerful units outside your factions. Only a few units could do it, which made it so unique and precious. Now it is gone due to whatever reason - I guess devs will say: balance. Yeah, right - do not pull my leg. The same is with healing, it is just out of the window now. In Aow4 we have temporary heals during battles but back on the world map all is gone. Dev's argument is to prevent snowballing.  Believe me I can still snowball but I will have to play all my combat manuals to minimize damage and spread it out through units.
Flying units now need seafaring technology to fly over water- again most probably due to 'balance' issues.
We get city cap and hero cap so our expansion is limited again. If you add all this together it starts to look like devs had problems balancing gameplay in later phases of the game so they put speed bumps all along the way so you should win the game before noticing issues.
Army stacs are still limited to 6 units down from initial 8 in Aow1 and Aow2. Still I do not know why, especially in AoW4 when many units skills are much better and more beneficial to use you can get very nice synergies and army builds but with only 6 units per army possibilities is limited.  

Next is game stability. I know many people had issues. I had so far 3 crashes of the game plus one end of turn that could never end. So in total my experience was not so bad.
There are also some issues with game performance. In larger battles 3 full stacks against 3 full stacks a battle can start lagging the longer it goes.  Also sometimes in menus, especially magic tomes and heros/armies faction creation menus you get strange lagging.

As we mentioned heroes/factions creation: there are not enough colors available to choose from available roster. That will be easily modified by the community but still it is a strange design choice. Also 6 cultures start to feel a bit too few after multiple games, especially that each culture has only one set of unit outfits - nothing to choose from. Especially with some many options to choose in other areas of the game. I guess we will see new ones in incoming DLCs (paid ones of course) which we will talk about a bit later.

And now value for money. Up to this point I would still give 8/10 for AoW4. But with value for money it has to drop to 7/10.
Game is quite costly itself, not to mention the expansion pass option. With multiple DLC already announced it looks again that some features were cut out of the basic game so I moved to paid DLC later on in a more flashy way.
Of course we could see it coming as Paradox is (in)famous from its predatory money squeezing DLC practices not to mention that Triumphs Studio did quite well by itself in this regards in AoW3 by first cutting out halflings, tigrans and frostlings out of basic game to sell out later 2 DLC in which these faction magically returned.

Still 7/10 is a good score and I would recommend this game for any fantasy and 4x players but be prepared that Paradox will bleed you dry out of money again on this game.",1683402035,1683402035,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

The tomes, wonders and heroes open up different ways to build your empire, for example some hero might allow you to recruit wild animals in his city, while another would give you access to ""Mystic"" culture features you wouldn't normally get without picking a tome for it.
You can ""evolve"" your race, as well as other races you pick up along the way. Like making them have steel skin, become undead or grow wings.
Free cities, your cities and your heroes can give you quests or ask for help (not just kill this or that, maybe they had a famine or need a specific resource), usually there's different ways of dealing with that, sometimes affected by your good/evil alignment or your culture.
The AI is competent and dealing with it, specially the free cities is actually fun. The ""barbarians"" are also well done.
The graphics look great, by the way.

I am aware that the game has a lot of positive reviews praising some of the new aspects, such as customization and graphics. I will not question that it was an interesting and decent addition to AOW4; however, it does not make the game good in itself. I have played AOW for almost 20 years and had high expectations from this new chapter in its series, and as I said in my review of AOW 3, that game placed the bar very high, which means that Triumph Studios had to work thrice to make a better game.

I love the AOW series because of its exciting campaigns, characters, dialogues and music (especially in AOW2 and some in AOW3). I was hoping this game would have a decent drive and compelling story, and, to my surprise, it does not have either! Yes, the game has no exciting stories, characters, or campaigns, and basically, the entire game is just a series of random maps I quickly get tired of. There is no feeling of wanting to play ""another turn"" before you go to bed, and most of my thoughts while playing were wishing to beat this map as soon as possible in hopes that the following map will be more enjoyable.

As for music, the game has yet to have any memorable compositions. I simply do not remember any strong themes after playing several maps of AOW4 (though I admit that I only played some factions and not all maps). The main theme is interesting, but other than this, most of the different compositions do not feel unique. Having said this, I still can easily distinguish between most of the themes from AOW2, even after not playing the game for a long time, because each of its pieces has a soul. I also liked themes of AOW3 from Michel Van Den Boss which could give inspiration in battles and world exploration. It is very unfortunate that I cannot say the same about AOW4.

Currently, the game has no handcrafted maps, and the only way to play this game is to enter a random world that often needs to look more attractive. Some of the maps I saw seemed so unrealistic (even by magic standards) that I had to restart the game several times to get immersed in the world. The sea exploration/battles seem incredibly dull and unnecessary (although previous AOW games also had this problem, at least sea exploration was more thrilling and rewarding back then). I also want to question the decisions of Triumph Studios to casual the game by placing harsh restrictions on the number of cities and removing workers/builders units so that the heroes can build new cities. The fun part about the previous game was developing the world on your own, building roads, and eventually migrating your nation to different parts of the world, which is impossible here. This is a massive downturn into more casual gaming, which is a bad sign for TBS games. Look at what happened to HMM series, whose developers decided to take a casual approach.

The series of maps they call a story is the worst-written campaign I have seen in a long time. To me, this is just an insult, for I care little about army customization and grinding wheels. The developers clearly spent too much time on the ""unnecessary"" graphical improvements that they forgot to hire qualified writers. It is funny that I seriously think of sending Triumph Studios my CV/Resume to consider me as their writer. So, if you see a new DLC that adds an exciting campaign, you know what has happened :).

I am sorry, Triumph, but you can do better than this. Because of this, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Notwithstanding, I hope that the game improves, and so will my review.",1683350323,1683397591,False,7,0,0.54560774564743042,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER
This is the pettiest, peskiest, most annoying AI I have ever seen.

In each one of my games so far the AI found extremely creative ways to screw me over.

If the player is reachable by land they love to bee-line into their territory to take out their starting camps, while ignoring their own and at turn 80 the resource nodes near their Throne city are still occupied by the now Tier 4-5 maraduer guards.

I straight up had a neutral AI settle an outpost right next to my Throne city at turn 20, which was then immediately upgraded into a city and then it used IMPERIUM to gain a pop just so that it can steal away 4 of my resource nodes in 2 turns.

It's also hilariously easy to defeat the AI sometimes. It often leaves it's leader pretty much undefended, and you can just summon some units near their throne city if you want to snipe a quick victory.

The diplomacy is also weird, if the enemy leader is dead, you cant negotiate with them, so If you don't have enough grievance you cant declare a justified war until the leader respawns. And it likes to die. A lot.

Allying an AI nation is not worth it, they will never fight eachother. If you grant them open borders, they will just settle a city to the place you wanted to annex, if you give them an ability to annex your claimed provinces, they wont spare any imperium to take all your provinces on your border. If you introduce your ally to your enemy AI they will straight up ally eachother, and screw yo over when you call them to war.

The city states also seem to be idle. They don't seem to like moving out of their territory, if you are at war with a city state, you can mostly ignore them, because even if they miraculously send an army, you will get a notification that they are prepairing to attack you.

The only reason I gave a negative review, because I would like to see the AI impoved.

Also please do something with the water combat, it looks a bit weird.

Otherwise I'm having a lot of fun with the game. I'm playing on an old lower-end computer and despite that I never had perfomance issues, the game runs smoothly in the 30-40 fps range, I have only noticed drops while using massive spells, but that is survivable.",1683392628,1683397231,False,7,2,0.538473188877105713,0,True,False,False

The customization options are insane.  Add to that the way they've allowed you to permanently shape the pantheon of your domain by adding leaders from past games and you've got a recipe for tons of replay-ability baked in from the start.

Way more customisation, new mechanics, polished things that were annoying in past instalments, new creatures, etc. Overall definitely awesome 4x game. Good balance between complexity and accessibility imo, which puts the game in more people's reach if you are into 4x or want to discover the genre.

For now, Everything is outstanding and definitely worth the price tag. EXCEPT multiplayer which is a big problem for me. I love playing these games coop style with a friend or two spending multiple hours building our empires and armies, trading resources and all. At the moment, there is an ""Out of sync"" problem that keeps appearing which forces us to exit the game, host has to go in the session's settings and click on ""revert"" to revert what happened in the round setting us back to the beginning of our actions. The issue seems to appear when you start doing battles since the error mentions that the game couldn't find the defender stack. Battles happen quite often, so it is rather annoying to be stressing about if the game will be out of sync or not on each battle.

This issue alone throws me off a bit. Past Age of Wonders did not have that issue and coop (or multiplayer) is core to this type of game, which baffles me as to why they would let this happen. I do hope they get on this issue fast as I am seeing a lot of threads online of people complaining about it.

This game is one issue away from being the perfect 4x experience imho. Will update if it gets fixed.

Every run feels different and unique. I do agree with the criticisms that the initial cultures you choose do not feel super unique, especially in the late game. That being said, the tome and affinity system more than makes up for it. It makes me never want to play another historical 4X again with their super rigid factions.

There are so many features that should be in every 4x going forward. Seperate queues for units and buildings? Heroes who can be governors and roam around the map? I'm depth tactical combat with the option to autoresolve?

The game is by no means perfect. There are several annoying problems, like not being able to create a custom faction without starting a game. Or how difficult it is to select units on cities. I fully expect these issues to be cleared up with time, however.

There are a few issues that are far more glaring. Naval combat sucks and oceans are incredibly bland, with almost no reason to expand on to them. Where are the water based magic materials or wonders? Where is the magical tome letting me summon a kraken or other sea monsters. That would go a long way to making the oceans feel more alive.
I am also disappointed that there is no desert focused tome. I was really excited to create undead tomb kings from Warhammer, only to find that there was really no way to do that. Also, the lack of flavor text in the game is really disappointing. The units and buildings have super cool designs and names but that's it. It want to know more about these creatures, but aside from a few in game events, there is almost nothing. These are issues that could be fixed in DLC or updates, but it is by no means gaurenteed.

I'd love to love this game, but in its current stage it's held back by some big problems. 

1. The empire building has no meaningful decision making and that part of the game is over mid-late game, where you have fully maxed out towns identical to each other. 
2. This unholy child of Hex-Province map feels awful. No sensible choke points, province types have very little impact on anything. Wish they'd have picked either hexes or provinces and not this confusion.
3. Racial customization in start has minimal impact on anything beyond unit stats. Actual 4x gameplay between factions is almost identical.
4. Autobattle is so good that there's only a couple points in early game and lategame where it can't win for you, reducing your turns to a cycle of 'autobattle' -> 'click research' -> 'end turn'.
5. Diplomacy, which was hailed as a strongpoint, comes down to setting whispering stone to a town and then forgetting about it for 20 turns. 
6. Unit balance has not been beta tested sufficiently. Certain units and abilities that let you summon free units are broken OP and trivialize all combat if stacked in sufficient numbers. 

Parts that I liked were hero customization, and how enchantments affected it. Allows you to make really powerful hero units and get those good old Age of Wonders vibes from winning with your strong heroes. Weapon enchantments and racial enchantments were also cool concepts, but need some polish to add cons or opportunity cost to them to avoid reducing them down to 'stack 'em all on at once'.",1683388474,1683388474,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The Bad.

Multiplayer is laggy and buggy.
Gameplay is watered down. -> The armies and hero upgrades are very meh.
Fighting is meh and laggy/glitchy.  ->Battle maps keep getting smaller and smaller...
Still only 6 size armies. -> ""You can bring another army with you"" This is not an argument.
Race is IRRELEVANT, its just cosmetics -> Less depth again.
No map size slider. -> Self explanatory

The Good.

Provinces are a nice touch.
Tomes are interesting but needs a lot more depth.
Empire tree is a nice thing, needs a lot more depth.
City building is pretty good.

Great turn-based strategy game, maybe the best of 2023, that leans a bit towards CK3 with its events system.

For newcomers and beginners - play first  a 1st Story Realm instead of toturial, because it is just a a big skirmish map. While the story mission has a small map, with very friendly AI. It is a lot easier to get a hang of things during gameplay. Also, expand qucikly and built as many cities you can within your starting limit.

+ great customistaion mechanic, combined with 'tomes' that make your race more unique
+ unit classes, types of attack, and many, many skills taht will put your tactical mind up
+ vassal system where some cities are just small factions that you can deal individually

Netrual:
. map division into provinces that can be taken and settled, a bit of simplicity IMO
. also have mixed feelings about units on the battlefield. In previous games, every army around the targeted army would join into battle field, now it is fixed at 3 army per side.. As I see the benefits of this (always a balanced unit count)
. you always need to have more units on the battle field, even low level ones will mess with your army unless you have strong IV tier units. Having more units will grant you most of the time no casultities.
. graphics are okay, but it is not a CoH 3 ;) UI seems a bit clunky during battles, but it is okay on world and city screens
. rally units from vassal and ancient wonders - I rarly us it, I like more special sites/town/dwellings from AoW 3, when you needed to bound/conquer those location to get acces to super unique units like dragons and giants etc.

Negative:
- no true unique units from any races, as they are tied to culture system (currently 6) and tomes units... I miss a unique unit from AoW 1&2 where you wanted to take over a city of different race to access their units.
- battle chaos with spells. You and AI drop so many support spells that screen becomes a total mess. I also miss very strong ultimate spells.
- less worldmap spells, inn previous games you could i.e. turn water into ice and move your armies around

That being said. the naval combat is bare bones. The multiplayer is very slow as no one can do anything on the campaign map as long as someone is in combat. this is a huge problem in the middle to late game when fights are bigger and take longer. if these things get fixed, then it would be one of the best 4x games of all time in my opinion.",1683379027,1683379027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just don’t get it, this game is perfect.
The visuals, the diplomacy (way better than Warhammers 1, 2 and 3), the diversity of characters, technology research system with Tomes and stuf(similar to Civillization, but in a fantasy way).
You can build so many different buildings, you can get and upgrade provinces around cities, build roads and outposts. Even use spells on World Map!
You also have champions/heroes that have levels, skills, items etc.

The fighting system is a mix of Warhammer and Civilizations, but done in HoMaM 3 way.
The map and stuff that exist on the map make your travelling more fun, random events and so much more.

4X games can often be [i]a little much.[/i] Genuinely impressed by how quickly and eloquently AoW4 on-boarded my dumb ass. The tooltip system here isn't [i]new[/i] but I rarely see it implemented so well. There's a lot of sauce with which to get lost in, but I never did, and that's maybe the most impressive thing about it.

As well as just randomly generated maps for you to do your wizard king thing over, there are more hand-tailored, smaller maps that have narrative hooks built in that act as a kind of semi-tutorial. It's hand-holding, but only if, how, and when you want it. Otherwise, go buck-wild. Lead your hog-riding molemen into a savage war with the undead frog people to stop them from blanketing the entire world in a shadowy miasma and twisting all life into un-life. Or whatever, you do you.

Make no mistake, the quantity can only exist because of the framework. Yes, every society will have a granary and a library, but sometimes the low level gold-generating building is a mint, or sometimes it's a torture dungeon. Functionally, exactly the same, but very flavourful. I think past the supremely well put together base mechanics of this 4X Turn Based Strategy Game, the [i]flavour[/i] of AoW4 is really special.

My favourite thing about these kinds of games is the story that forms around you, around the game. Civ doesn't really have this, and it's for that reason that, I hate to say it, I may never play Civ again. There is a certain sameness present in the game owing to how much is actually just [i]the same but different[/i], but if you're not the kind of lunatic who puts 900 of your next 1,000 hours exclusively into a single video game, you shouldn't lose that flavour. You create the character that leads the people you created on a path that you lay out. You decide how to deal with the problems that come up, and while that is often ""Good/Evil/Not today thanks"" or ""I want the outcome what gives me Money/Science/Military/Etc"" it's always couched in something flavourful that becomes a part of, or even informs the direction of, that specific story for that specific game. It's very role-play-able, and I think that's what makes games like these exciting and fun, outside of the still very present, but cold ""one more turn"" nature of these game.

I found myself frustrated with how rote and bland so many games of Civ ended up being. I was massively overwhelmed with just how much [i]stuff[/i] there is to keep track of in more grand strategy games.

- A fully customizable) and fantasy ruler of great powers which actively participates in his or her victories, so I have someone I can consider being ""myself"" there. :-)

- A big variety of spells, magic and abilities with the possibility to specialize both yourself and your heroes.

- Some extra ""rpg"" events in Crusader Kings like fashion. It is not too deep or long-term (it does not seem they would be remembered and possibly backfire later in some narrative manner) but it is still a welcomed bonus which makes the 4X game more immersive and its characters (including your ""main protagonist"") more ""alive"".

- Beautiful world graphics.

- Turn based combats which can be interesting and fun to perform but can be also automated so you don't have to waste your time with those which are not. Like when you're clearly going to win it.

---

Alas, there are also some cons. Personally I disliked most:

- Still very poor and primitive ""diplomacy"". I long for a 4X game which will put some ""rpg"" factors in this too, so that my relationships  with other rulers can be deeper and more ""personal"". The closest to this so far was probably Civilization V (not six!) but even there it was far from great.

- While the rulers can be fully customized and are finally in full 3D, graphically - unlike the rest of the world - they are not very nice. At least they were not to my taste.

---

But in general, the pros far outweigh the cons and it is a good, enjoyable 4X game with some rpg elements and a main ruler, in my favorite fantasy setting.

I've played Planetfall in the interim and  it was already a step up from the previous entry, with AoW4 it's a step up even further from that as well. Though if you were looking for more Scifi that'll have to wait if they would want to approach that again.

The level of customization is always phenomenal when it comes to the Age of Wonders series and it's good to see that still being the case, with four future DLCs already in the plans for what's next for Aow4.

They've also introduced a ""Pantheon"" system where previous characters that have completed their campaigns can show up in your future games, think like Stellaris and the option to add them as a faction you will meet.

I would like us to be able to customize what the AI would do with the faction, however, but if they're willing to stick with this system I'm sure it'll come with time.

If you like the genre already it's easy to appreciate the stand-out fantasy setting and unique mechanics that accompany it. If you're new to 4X games Age of Wonders 4 is easy to pick up and learn within 20 minutes which in no way is due to a lack of depth or meaningful choice. Unlike other Paradox titles anyone can easily enjoy this game without having to consult a wiki every couple of minutes.

As of 5/6/23, 4 days after launch, my only gripes are very minor. Unit variety for factions and the most common of enemies is a little lacking in terms of wide and tall design, I see the same units often and they're not all too different from one another. Some faction choices are much more powerful/impactful than others, choosing between your units gaining lifesteal when a spell is cast vs ""When you unlock a tome a random skill in it gains -60% to its cost"" is embarrassingly one-sided. Finally I wish there was more quality of life stuff, like the ability to make a new faction without instantly loading into a game with that faction or the ability to tell a city you don't produce anything in anything to stop annoying you about it every turn.

I know some people don't consider it an adequate fix to a game's problems but the fact that the game was designed with mod support in mind alleviates my concerns about these issue because ultimately players have the tools to whatever they want about the game, including altering world variety and balance as they see fit.

but i am underwhelmed. on the surface its the same kind of game. civ over world xcom light tactical combat. but its very simplified compared to AoW:Pf the units are rather bland, simplified and same-y you cant upgrade them, there is nothing really unique about the different races and higher tier units are just the basic unit with higher stats, a different skin and maybe one extra skill. the tech research system is both simplified but also slightly obfuscated and confusing (i dont quite understand the rules of when you unlock new books).  the turn pace (rate of building, exploration and healing of damage) feels really slow. ive played 2 games so far(over 13 hours). small games with 3 ""players"" tops and they took FOREVER. one of those was the tutorial!! bleh. there is also a bunch of details that seem weirdly hidden (no way to see the strength of a unit unless its by itself. no way to see the per turn cost of a spell until after you cast it etc)
but the worst thing is i find this game to be boring for some reason. i dont feel a pull for ""one more turn"" and that to me is fatal.

THE GOOD
* Combat is very well done. Imagine if total war battles were turn based, had tiles (hexes), and used spells. It adds enough depth to your usual x4 ""unit X attacks unit Y, see results"" without it becoming overly complicated.
* Customization of your civ/faction/leader is also well done. I was able to make multiple custom factions that I felt had different synergies and played very uniquely from each other. Some of the customization options were a tad lacking (mostly picking armor colors) but there are already mods for that.
* Because the customization and combat work so well with each other, it made it easier to role play your leader/faction and become more immersed.

THE DIFFERENT
* Buildings and unit recruitment use different production queues, which I liked, but also felt it took some interesting choices away. 
* It is combat oriented, don't expect any diplomacy/culture/religion/etc victory conditions. To win each map you either A) Conquer everyone, B) Settle/absorb enough cities to cover a certain amount of the map, and then defend your territory for 15 turns, or C) build 3 ""science"" buildings and then defend those for 15 turns. All 3 end up with 99% of the AIs hating you no matter how good your relationship was beforehand.
* There is an underground portion of the map, but I feel it's very underutilized. It would make for interesting play if the AI used it to secretly move troops, or if the underground could affect things above ground (or vice versa). As it stands it's serviceable but you can largely ignore it.
* There are a lot of free cities/city states by default. Good because it means more AI interactions and intrigue, bad because it's very hard to expand your empire without becoming evil and conquering them, or waiting for a large potion of the game for them to like you enough to be absorbed.

THE BAD
* Naval combat is very bare bones, and most of the maps don't feature a lot of water, so a majority of your combat will be land based.
* Battle maps need more variations. I can't tell you how many times I've fought on the same ""farm"" battle map, and I've only completed 3 games.
* Due to the limited victory conditions a lot of your games will feel very similar despite the customization available ie what research you focus, your build order, what units go into your army, and what spells you use.
* In the 10 hours I've played the game has crashed twice, both times locking up my PC and making me hard restart it. Not cool. I've also encountered a bug where my faction leader will be contacted from the astral sea (main menu) by.... herself? I get the intention, it's neat if you have some faction leaders ""sitting on the bench"" and they reach out to help, but maybe make sure they're not already in the game first.
* There are a few ""staple"" unit roles missing from the roster. Where are the siege engines? Melee mages? Spies or diplomats? Traders?  Why are calvary so limited that unless you pick a certain faction origin and also specialize in them, you don't get any at all?

Overall 9/10, will continue playing when I want a more combat oriented civ.",1683339305,1683339305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Age of Wonders 4 does a lot to address the complaints of previous installments (janky encounter management, ballooning city micro time, limited ways of victory) and addresses them all while keeping the gameplay fresh, fun, and true to its roots.

While it's still a fantasy wargame 4x at heart, the developers have done such a great job at catering to other playstyles that I feel comfortable recommending this game to more casual 4x players. During faction customization, you get to decide what you want to play and more importantly, how you want to play. Throughout five-mission campaign I got to play as the following-
 Feudal moles who had mastered the earth. Cannibalistic Halfling barbarians who terrorized the seas. Mystic Elves who had given up their lives for demonic and undead power. Industrial Orcs with an religious fervor and mastery over fire, and Dark Frogs who had ascended to a state of pure mana. While there were some overlaps in tomes chosen and traits picked, the starting traits I selected helped guide my playstyle (cannibalistic destroyers for halflings meant I was always raiding and always eating the bodies of my enemies) while the tomes researched gave me access to new units, spells, and techs.

 Culture played an important part too in determining the core gameplay mechanics you would need to use during battle. Dark cultures excel at punishing enemies with a heavy amount of debuffs while Barbarians are excellent at the game of shock and awe. Mystic cultures get more powerful the more spells you cast in combat and industrial cultures can transform their huge defensive bonuses into an offensive powerhouse. 
The game does such a good job of letting you dictate your playstyle and isn't afraid to let you have fun with it.

So whether you're new to the series and want to try it out, or a die-hard that's been playing the series since 1999, I highly recommend giving this game a try.",1683329317,1683329317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Altough, out of all 4x titles the game resembles a less popular, but undeniably influential Master of Magic.

On another hand, if you have played previous AoW games, be it Planetfall or AoW III, here is a short list of most significant changes:
- Now, instead of picking your class, race and couple of additional traits and later just researching options provided by these you decide your build during your session. ""Races"" has been mostly replaced by ""Cultures"" - they determine units available to you and provide you with an in-built playstyle which you can either embrace or diverge from later on. 
- As you play, you will also research and unlock Tomes - you start with one and pick the rest of these as you play. These replace your ""class"" from older AoW games. Tomes provide you with new spells, units, buildings and other neat things. They are divided by affinities - these are basically schools of magic. You can combine majority of them without any ""significant"" exceptions, but some work together better than others. Combining Tomes of the same affinity is always a good idea, but some combinations of different affinities can also work great. The charm lies in figuring out which combinations work well together and which do not.
- Army stacks reinforce allies much further - you don't need to move in triangle formations anymore.
- Multi-model units lose damage as they lose models. This changes how you play tactical battles in comparison to other AoW titles.
- Sector system from Planetfall is combined with city building from Age of Wonders III. 4x part is developed quite well in comparison to AoW III.
- You can upgrade your Empire through affinity system, which requires Imperium - a new resource, which is very limited. It is also required to upkeep T4-T5 creatures, similarly to how cosmite upkeep worked in Planetfall.

The game however still retains issues which previous titles had. Mainly, the dreaded ""desyns"" which happen in multiplayer. On the strategic map they are quite manageable, with a couple of exceptions, but in tactical combat they happen constantly. The worst form of it is a ""crash desync"" - desync which reloads your combat, and then forces the game to crash every time someone loads into combat, until players reload their turn. I would recommend you to be wary of this.

All in all, the game is a very worthy title. I would recommend it to people who like 4x games and to those who liked previous AoW titles, but do be mindful of netcode.",1683053890,1683329197,True,8,0,0.536532163619995117,0,True,False,False

With that out of the way, I've really enjoyed the game. It's only been three days and I have 55 hours played, which is pretty crazy. The customization options for your factions are immense, though there are a few missed opportunities that I'd like to see mods fix (beards for elves; applying visual changes from the Race Transformations during faction creation; saving the names of cities to your pantheon leaders; saving the heroes of your pantheon leaders; non-clothing accessories like tusks, hooves, or horns; the strange lack of hair color options for race units despite leaders having plentiful options). With that aside, the game is very addicting and fun. It demands long sessions, but that's true for most strategy games, and it isn't so bad that you can't complete a campaign or two in a day. I've also really liked the fact the game gives disincentives to expanding your empire with cities, as there is a soft-cap to the amount of cities you can have (which can be increased through racial traits and perks). 
I'd absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs and strategy games. Doubly so if you enjoy fantasy, as you can recreate the majority of fantasy races from other forms of fiction (I've been doing a lot of Warcraft races, myself).",1683326350,1683326350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

CONS: Only a couple but one is serious.

- The multiplayer has a few hiccups but I managed to play several hours of a multiplayer game with only one disconnect. As we approached late game we had more and more desyncs and started to get more crashes. While playable, it is by no means a frustration-free experience. When this problem no longer presents I will edit this review accordingly.

- The autoresolve seems heavily weighted in the player's favor and can make the game seem trivial once you get several high tier stacks going.

- The AI plays a bit smart diplomacy wise, but when it comes to war they can be non-committal. They will siege you but then lift the siege and open themselves up to a counter-attack. I never felt like my main capital was threatened in the 3 games I have played thus far.

PROS: Where to start?

Age of Wonders is a continuation and an evolution of the previous series. The entire package is excellent- tutorial, atmosphere, music, art design, and most importantly: the spells! There are so many awesome spells to cast and affect your gameplay.

- Spells are amazing and such a fun way to change the map and customize your faction. Want angelic nights with lightning swords? Check. Want undead Dark Elves with frost blades? Sure. Want barbarian frogs with some inquisitors? Sure.

- Strategic spells are also lots of fun. Clone your leader, teleport an army, crack apart an enemy city's defenses... there are so many great spells and I haven't even used 10% of them yet. Variety is the word of the day here.

- Bright colors. Beautiful music. Fantastic art design. Great narration. The game really immerses you in it's beautiful fantasy world. However, I'd like to hear more of the narration. Maybe every spell you research can have a brief snippet recited like researching a tech in CIV VI?

- Tactical combat is fun and has a high skill ceiling and a low skill floor. The more time you are willing to invest into it, the more depth you will find. Tossing my leader into the enemy, causing him to beserk, and then making him unkillable was a fun combination. Gleefully sending a dozen low tier units to die in battle so I can raise them as zombie and then explode them was another. And sieges are great fun.

- Customization. You can make your own wizard or champion. The customization has a surprising amount of options. It's cool.

- The Pantheon. I know that ""the grind"" is a point of contention among fans. However, Triumph has been very open about the Pantheon since almost day one. One of the earliest dev blogs back in february was about the Pantheon and getting XP to unlock new stuff. Personally, I think its a fun meta-mechanic that actually ties into the game in a meaningful and immersive way.

issues
- maps are bland, remember all the cool structures to clear like ancient ruins, tombs, dungeons giving cool rewards and unique bonuses to certain troops - none existent, the only structures you can enter are wonders and you don't see them often. You end up with large areas of map with nothing in it.
- forms instead of races, why? races had their unique traits that were thematic for them now every race ends up with similar units and strips the depth out
- The underground is empty, i sent a scout down to explore and there was literally nothing down there if fact it was at this point i requested my refund
- temporary healing in battle - don't like this why can't i just heal my troops how i want to
- combat in general seems to be dumbed down. Retaliation doesn't use action points in fact you can't use up enemy actions points this takes a lot of strategy out of the combat for me

I watched a lot of youtubers (paid i assume) to rave about this game and i had my reservations watching them 

my conclusion is that at release this game is not good enough to be a sequel to AOW3 however that might change. So for me back to AOW3 think i will try an Orc Arch Druid this time, that's right an Orc big scary thing with big teeth not his form with the traits of an Elf",1683322463,1683322463,False,4,0,0.50265955924987793,0,True,False,False

The only selling point this game has over either is that you can customize your nation(even though many customization options are locked behind progression for some reason, you start of with one leader origin and unlock others later which is moronic WHY???), but even that is in the end quite meaningless as all alterations and race modifications you make during a campaign get reset after a match. There is no carry over of traits ( excluding hero progression which is trash cosmetics mostly). 

Just play Civ or if you like the real time combat go play total war. Or better yet play crusader kings...

This is just a mediocre middle ground between the two

Here is a list of complaints after 5.6 hours that I could be bothered to play: 
-The claiming system is annoying, it is a juiced up version of people getting pissed in civ for settling too close. Sucked in civ, sucks here even more

-Trying to click on specific units and moving them around to specific areas on the map is annoying, the world is not hex based like CIV is yet the world has massive differences in terrain. Trying to select an army to move it around is annoying af. You have a flying unit, you cant click on the sprite you have to calculate the terrain below the sprite which is tad harder than it should. Highlight the ground better.

-the combat system tries to one up civilization yet falls straight on its face. Instead of having a mix of melee, ranged and siege units you just fill your armies with the highest tier units possible to get max amount of military power. And then you just simulate the result. Even if the battle is 50/50 at most you will lose one or two units which is pretty much nothing. There are no pyrrhic victories which the system desperately needs to function, bigger stack wins always doesnt matter if it is all supports as long as they are high tier, for 0 cost to you. Not thought through.

-Cities expand in visually incredibly unseemly fashion and it is simply not as fun to manage as it is in CIV 6. Planning things out where to put improvements etc. doesnt exist here. The city management here is quite laughable just spam spam spam all the buildings for points you need doesnt matter what. There is no fixing this. 

-The roleplaying, this games only selling point is completely ruined by the fact that nobody cares who you are or what you are about. The fairy elfs that love nature and kissy face trees and whatever will have no problem with the most evil necromancers as long as the necromancers dont start wars. OR GOD FORBID, take lands the fairy princesses claimed. That is the greatest crime of all unimaginable. But resurrecting babies for your slave armies yeah no biggy. Your race and traits are completely meaningless(and the buffs and nerfs are completely pointless too they affect nothing in any significant way)

-The story is a series of missions that last on average 50 turns. the missions have a plot of ""bad guy is doing bad stuff and it is your duty to stop him!"" But I am 100 evil the most evil crazy lunatic of them all why would you ever ask me to do this??? This is fail RP. There is no evil storyline, you have one story line and you will follow it to the end whether it fits your rulers character or not. FAIL RP. Customizing a character does not equate roleplaying. Wake up.

-The story missions also play out in similar fashion, build up army and conquer cornpops castle. Zerg rushing is completely viable once you realize this. There is no point to starting settlements or anything of the sort. Just build up 4 armies and send them to enemy capital ASAP for free win. And no, you wont miss out on epic gameplay if you do. 

-There is no point focusing on science, culture or war and go for that victory condition because you can just keep spamming buildings as much as you like. But I never even played the sandbox so maybe I am completely mistaken but it sure didnt seem like it from the story missions. They say every playthrough is different but frankly it looks to me that every playthrough will be always equally basic because there really isnt any differences in things you could do. Just build the same buildings every time and annex the mine provinces as soon as you can. Bleh

What I cant wrap my head around is why these 4x devs wont add lineages. I know some total wars have had this, but give the ability to marry allies or nobles to get heirs and as your leader ages those heirs will become rulers. Similar to Crusader kings, but in a 4x setting. But no, instead lets just have this immortal guy in charge that will lead for eternity. 

""Wonder why people think our game is kinda lame"" Because you did nothing new (other than the race customization which again, maybe an hour of content). It just isnt that good.

If you are planning on playing, skip the missions and go straight to a sandbox. Oh yeah the maximum amount of AI is less than 10 hahahahahahhaha
Babys first strategy game over here

Also performance is quite terrible. FPS especially. Load times on an SSD are not a problem, FPS is rather low for how crap the graphics are and how small the map itself is. (again less than 10 AI limit)

But if you have never played civilization total war or any strategy games and are interested in this stuff you might like it. But just buy total war shogun 2, CK2/3 or civ 6 if you would like to get this. They are better. CK2/3 especially for roleplaying

On the note of DLC, it is clear they've already made significant portions of it, you can see the promo material on their season pass page.

AOW4 is an amazing game and one of the few I felt no issues getting the season pass for. Its strength is its variance and replayability, which I think other 4x titles really struggle with.

As mentioned about my AOW3 game time I loved the game but rarely did I ever finish one. I often got bored after snowballing too easily across the map as the tech tree often fizzled out and build queues in cities were resorted to just pumping out units like a 3D printer.

What AOW4 does differently, is it incentivises me to complete it via the cosmetic and power changes to your faction, it evolves in so many ways I can tell that was a core focus of this game. The unit roster is smaller but the possibilities are far more. By far my favourite system is a persistent pantheon, like you are assembling your own dysfunctional Greek house on Olympus. All faction leaders you win with get to ascend and return in future games. Cosmetic gear gets unlocked and new realm choices appear, it has amazed me no other game has come up with this concept before (that I have come across at any rate). 

To finalise, the combat is a lessor focus but still enjoyable. I find it unfortunately limiting only 6 units per army but like you can stack many together to make huge battles occur. It has a learning curve and is deceptively deep with unit abilities and synergies but is something that without the strategic map would be very hollow.

But if you love AoW then you'll love this, or if this is the first time you're playing the game, you may get your money's worth. For me, this is too expensive for the limited experience. I'd buy on sale for $15 in a year after its had some improvements made.

The main problem is the same as AoW3: It's boring. There's no spark. There's no chemistry. I played a lot of AoW2: Shadow Magic but I think I'm burned out on it. I came to AoW3 with some misgivings about the unit design and other changes but since I'd gotten a lot of play time out of its predecessor I bought it. I stopped playing within a week. In hindsight, AoW2 Shadow Magic ended with me having no enthusiasm for the game. It's a tough call. How do you rate a game that you got a lot of hours out of but are sick of by the end? Good? Bad? Well, for me, it's asking whether I got 100 hours of gameplay out of it? For AoW2 I think the answer is yes. Whether I'm sick of the game at that point or not is the difference between ""good"" or ""great"". And the time threshold changes based on experience and price. There are certainly cheap games I only play 50 hours but I get a lot of enjoyment and I recommend.

The best lateral comparison I can make to my AoW burnout are the Civilization games. I have not nor will ever buy another Civilization Game because I'm full up on it from the days of Civilization 4. It just doesn't grip me anymore, especially for the price point.

So why did I even buy AoW4? Because I think the changes they've made to simplify things were a move in the right direction. Why did I refund? Because the game is *still* too tedious for me, especially the combat. One friend said he finished his first fight without really knowing what he was doing but ""brute forced"" it. That to me cuts to the heart of the problem with all of AoW. The combat is too detailed and technical without adding enjoyment. I honestly think a simpler combat system would work better for me. When you find yourself not intuitively understanding the rules for flanking, counterstrikes, etc. then what's the fun? That's not to say you *can't* understand it. However, having done that work already in AoW2 I can say that I don't find the combat mechanics good. They're... complex, but not enjoyable. 

The strategic redesign of the game was a bit underwhelming. Again, I feel it added complexity without enjoyment. The provinces are kind of a good idea, but the province improvement system just didn't grab the part of my brain that loves strategic building.

Whisper stones? Huh? Ok I guess. Good mechanic, but strange thematic device. I guess I'm Sauron now talking to Saruman. Not my style of mechanics chrome. A plain negotiation limit is more my taste. I'll do my own RPG story-telling in the background thanks.

I am very happy with the change of emphasis to heroes. Some locations *require* a hero to engage. This is good. The game could do more though. Like units can't move without a hero to lead them, or you can only have so many independent stacks on the map at once. One of the other tedious aspects of AoW has always been logistics. Moving single units around to get joined with an army or basically building armies without heroes to go do mundane tasks has always made games a slog. Micro-managing unit logistics are still a fundamental aspect of the game, though. I don't know how they could change this to make me happy without basically changing what the game itself is. If you like this, you like it. If you're me, you don't.

Thematically and visually the game is still so... so... SO dry. I actually ended up attacking one of my own units because I was really tired and couldn't tell them apart from the enemy. This was a bit soul crushing and at this point I had to admit to myself I wasn't going to get my money's worth from the game. I didn't realize this immediately. I slept on it and it was in the middle of the night that I woke up and thought: I don't want to play this game. It's like the moment when some people realize they're going to leave their partner: I don't love this person. I don't want to spend any more of my life with them.

Refunded, luckily. Like an old partner, I'd happily pony up the cost of a few drinks to get drunk, go back to my room, and do the fleshy jig of the mommy-and-daddy dance once for old time's sake, but I'm not going to commit $50 and a long-term relationship.",1683307304,1683307304,False,4,3,0.461191385984420776,0,True,False,False

THE BAD

I am playing this game solely on my GPD Win Max 2. And the performance at 15W is a little sluggish, even with everything at low or turned off. The 2D Strategic map runs like butter, but the 3D Strategic map will be generally sluggish. To be fair in a Turn Based Game its very easy to ignore, but if you expect it to run smoothly be warned.

I think the performance is hindered by the graphical options which are a little lackluster for a PC Game. Something as simple as dedicated fullscreen mode, or the ability to set the resolution manually are missing features/options that feel like rather odd design choices. 

The Render Slider IMHO is horrible tradeoff where anything below 100% becomes excessively blurry, with a weird dithering LOD effect. Let me lower the resolution, and have more effective ways to maybe go as far as disabling trees, or 3D features sur a resources replacing them with flat icons.

There could even be some effort put into allowing people to operate their empire while viewing the 2D Strategic view. I find it strange that when I click on a town in the 2D view, I have to zoom in in order to see its city overview screen. Should be able to issue build and move orders from this screen.

If you want your turns to go buy faster on a low end machine, zooming out to 2D view before hitting end turn will help a bit.

THE GOOD

The thing that I loved the most about Master Of Magic was coming up with Custom Wizard Builds, and trying to push for a certain theme or playstyle that I felt like exploring. Sure it could result in some rather OP builds, but I felt it fit with the whole Power Fantasy Wizard feeling I was going for in the first place.

I dont have enough experience with this game yet to see if the same level of OP could be reached. But from the titles of some AO4 videos Ive seen come out. I think there are already some extremely powerful builds that people have found. This is great for people who like to not only finetune their playstyle, but exploring different ones. It gives the game a lot of replayability which is very important for these types of games.

The way that they broke down races into their appearance, followed by faction, social and other traits makes for an interesting approach to customization that goes a bit deeper than other games in the genre offered before. This is compounded by the rather intricate Tome system with some minor/major changes you can apply to your race/faction. If you take the time to look at the tomes, their spells and unit enchanements. You can surely find a Goldilocks combination that will feel just right for you. It could feel totally overwhelming for some though. Just take your time with it!

The city management and expansion feels refreshing! Great combinations of incity buildings, with improvements you build around your cities. Some of which depend on your tome or racial choices which feeds back into the crazy levels of customization. Definitely a unique take on terrain exploitation when comparing to the older days of MOM.

Another really unique thing is the patheon system. Allowing you to level up your pahteon in its own skill tree. At first I was disapointed as the first skills are related to cosmetics it seems. But afterwards you start unlocking things like unique traits that give you even more customization options to build the craziest fantasy race you could ever dream of! I cant tell for sure. But it feels like this is the first time we are getting some kind of progression that goes beyond just making your wizard stronger while playing a game. You can unlock things to use in future games. I like it!

Overall I am beyond excited to keep digging into this game, as well as see what the upcoming expansions will bring to the table. Not to mention the amazing mods the saints of the internet will create.

No need to rush and buy it. Go look at some YT playthroughs or go read the wiki. If it resonates with you give it a shot! I think this has the potential to become another staple in the Fantasy 4X genre.",1683302169,1683302826,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

If you've played Stellaris, HoI, etc., you have a pretty good idea of what you're getting into. We'll have multiple DLCs stretched across a few years, we'll have some updates that fundamentally change how some systems work and we'll get a million different Workshop items to fill the voids.

Having said that, I've played one game so far and I'm thoroughly impressed with what I've experienced. Let me just summarize my experience from beginning to end by telling you I started off with a race I called ""Shadow Orcs"" (yeah, I know, the name sucks but I just wanted to jump right in) that were dark/shadow focused orc warriors and ended the game with undead frozen vampiric blight orcs with fire-imbued weapons and enchanted cities constantly spreading ice and snow across a world slowly bowing before my might. I interrupted a dark ritual in an ancient ruin and after killing the beings performing the rite, I completed the summoning they were attempting and summoned the evil creatures from another world: Dire Penguins (this is not a joke, I have screenshots to prove it). The role-play opportunities in this game are endless, there's both a surface map AND an underground/Underdark area ON THE SAME MAP, near endless customization and enhancement of your race and Godir (essentially your avatar in game), custom map creation, and as you continue to play the game you earn points to spend on even more customization/cosmetic options for your race.

Three main critiques: First, battles in this game just feel meh. They can be grand, epic affairs with multiple units from different armies on both sides fighting over territory, cities, sites of power, etc. But it essentially equates to selecting your ability, right clicking on the map and watching a small animation as numbers and status indicators pop up over your units. The battlefields look great, but the overall feel of battle kinda leaves you feeling like it could've used some more TLC. The other complaints are QoL gripes, such as requiring RMB to activate ANY abilities in combat or the world map. Wanna launch a special ability? RMB. Wanna cast a spell? RMB. It can throw you off and become easily frustrating in the midst of an already stressful battle. Also, the pop up info screens obscure LMB clicks when selecting things like units, construction options, magic research, etc. The pop ups trigger after holding the cursor over ANYthing for more than 1 second and will block you from clicking on the item you wanted. Then the pop up triggers again a second later. It's mildly infuriating.

Overall, I think this game is worth the asking price, especially if you're just wanting the base game. I can already tell I'm going to poor countless hours into this and it'll more than likely become my current obsession for the next little bit. Good game, great presentation, some QoL issues, but an overall great experience!",1683290765,1683290765,True,1,0,0.504639923572540283,0,True,False,False

Doesn't mean i dislike the game, but i just wanna focus on one thing, so we may get it and can have more fun.



THERE IS NO MAP SIZE!!! Which has been key for every Strategy game, since games like CnC, and every other Paradox Title (Minus HoI and CK, fixed Worlds). We had Map Sizes for the other AoW titles, i'm pretty damn sure, at least AoW3.

The Map Size is connected to Distance and Players, in a weird combined way. More Distance means further away the Empires will start from each other, which also means, more Empires/Players, the bigger the Map Size. WHO IN NAME OF ODIN THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?!?! Just give me a bloody Map Size Selection/Slider. You had it in AoW3, that i remember. Do it again.

And to finish it off: There is no such thing as ""Body Type"" for Genders. There's Gender/Sex, and that is it. Male and Female. Body Type would mean the variations of sizes/physiques, including parts of the body, and maybe some other terminology i am not familiar with.

Spell animations look like SHT. I wish I could post a video here showing how ugly they are. 
But looks like they hired a high school kid with barely any skills and no imagination. 
Disgusting I can't believe I payed for this. 

I guess I was hoping it would look at least as good as the old Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic games. 

Without a doubt that older AoW game has way better spell animations. 

They also clutter up the damn screen and everything you are looking at  with nonsense things.

Imagine clicking on a unit and it has an outline covering it up PLUS a circle whirling around it PLUS a hexagon that appears. 
SO All that is now covering up the unit you are trying to see. 

So why make a unit model at all? if you just going to cover it up with all this nonsense. 

It like its there first time making a game of this kind.

Which leads me to believe they hired cheaper workers to get the job done and its showing. 


Bad animations everywhere. So CHEAP LOOKING

The game is a really great strategy/tactical game but unfortunately it is marred by severe lag even with the smallest of maps regardless of the level of computer that it is run on.  As the game approaches a higher number of turns 50+ there is significant lag.   The game also bricked a multiplayer game after a desync issue.   Moreover, the bug crash handler for the game has a error code 500 right now so you can't upload crash report data for them to begin resolving.  I tried playing this with several friends but I can't recommend at this point.

After playing some more with the map customization I am really disappointed that the level of customization since AoW 3 has been removed or made mutually exclusive for so many options.  The way that that maps and realms are presented are fun and graphically engaging but I am unable to make the same level of modifications that I could in the last  game even though those options are around.  The same can be said for many modifications to races as well.  

I think it is important that one of the most successful and engaging parts of past AoW games since 1 has been the replayability and capability to make lots of customizations to the maps and races.",1683114701,1683280157,False,2,0,0.46631389856338501,1,True,False,False

A serious Game of the Year contender, especially within the 4X genre. Easily one of the most ambitious strategy games I can think of due to its complex tome-based magic system and stacking racial enchantments that are visually shown on your units.

I'm a big fan of the series, starting with the old ones and fell in love with shadow magic. I enjoyed age of wonders 3 and planetfall a lot. This new entry has been great so far.

AOW4 is a brilliant step forward in the 4x genre. There are so many fantastic (pun intended) things I could talk about, but the real game changer is splitting the production of units and structures into their own queues. Not only does this speed the game up and feel amazing, but it also allows for some really interesting focus strategies. I can lean into increasing my ""draft"" income to produce units faster, but this usually means that my city does not advance as fast.

The tome and culture systems are amazing as well. Being able to create your own faction by also choosing different traits allows for some really interesting choices. In previous titles, each race basically played a certain way and you had to lean into their intended strategies. In AOW4, you have so much customization that their form really means nothing more than cosmetic appearance. Want evil dark elves that are NOT magic focused? done. How about Magical Orcs? yes!

Age of Wonders 4 hits the nail on the head with their new game, perfect and every way possible, very customizable, not just in the character customization, appearance, culture, race, and organization of your race, but the setting, how your cities develop, your research and spells, and even how you play the game. Its easy to pick up on and play quickly, and anyone that's played a 4X will find their intuitive system and dynamic but simple structure to beginning the game will find no problems diving in head first into this game and finding enjoyment very quickly.

The races are all 2 passives picked from a list of about 20. This list includes things like +10 HP, +10% melee damage, -1 turn of a debuff... They aren't exciting and there really is no impetus to mix and match. My guess is there are probably 5 reasonable ones and chances are you will only see value in maybe 2-3.

Then you get to pick from 6ish classes for your faction. Two are essentially the same broken ideas from Stellaris, another game with 0 balance but loads more stylistic choices. Fanatic bad guy and fanatic good guy, while the other four are permutations on which resource you would like more of, food, research, recruitment and money. There is another resource, mana, but that is not boosted here. Food/Growth is always broken in a Paradox game because Paradox thinks labor would be the most important thing in a sufficiently advanced/magical society. Because Paradox is confused. They can barely understand what the word asymmetry means let alone implement it.

After that, passives for your culture! Select 2 of around 15. This is the bulk of the customization. In true Paradox fashion nearly every pick is mundane with a few interesting evil picks. Paradox also has a edge lord complex so the only interesting (not saying powerful, just interesting ones) are evil. Put the Fedora down Paradox employees.

Then choose between whether you want your leader to get it done with spells or troops.

All factions basically get and 2 of a melee troop (shield, spear, assualt) and 2 of a ranged troop (physical, magical, support) as defaults. Theoretically you get a mounted troop too? Perhaps that's tier 3 towns I tend not to play my games that long because they become such a tedious boring mess.

While you play, instead of techs you research spells from a tome. You select one tome at a time and get more I think every 3 ""techs"" researched. The tomes each have between 5-6 spells with maybe a unit or summon or two replacing a spell. There are around 15 tomes. Many spells are enchants that improve a faction with a minor passive like +2 damage (like 10% of your damage) and have a chance of proccing something. There is little apparent synergy between these tomes, likely in an effort to avoid builds but all this really does is avoid making you interested in the choice.

Frankly building your own faction isn't new. Nor is it better balanced, for whatever worth that is for a game that will get MINIMAL if any multiplayer time in 90% of peoples libraries. They clearly design these games around fundamental systems like population or HP, and when they do that all the asymmetry disappears. If everything is directly comparable to everything else through your base game-play, then whatever works best in that base system is going to win out. You need to create separate systems and ensure managing those systems paces out at around the same pace. I.E. My metal based economy matches your magic based economy at around the same time in the game. 

That's not present here. We are all working with the same resources and you need people to grow your resource base... So why not grab the perks and faction buffs that give you the highest resource base? Yeah I can make a map for my culture but that really doesn't seem compelling. I can turn the difficulty down too I guess if I wanted and experience the same effect.

The game basically is a pick list of innovative 4x features. It has the race building of the ""Endless"" series of games and then later picked up by Stellaris. In both cases these later two systems feel much more creative (though can produce very unbalanced results). There are city states, done far worse than Endless Legends and I would say worse than even Civilization 6. They even brought my personal least favorite innovation in 4xs ""boosting"" first seen in Civ 6. Boosting is a cancer on the genre, made for people that need short quest like goals to feel like they have direction. The problem is the entire system really doesn't reflect the state of play, and it's up to you to decide whether it's worth it to boost or just build what you think you need at the moment. It's a decision that creates 0 immersion and speaks to the broken mind of someone who needs to fill out checklists in lieu of making meaningful decisions. This is exacerbated by boosting being based on building provinces and population growth and possibly if those provinces have been raided? I actually have no clue sometimes I feel like I am losing boosts or not getting them. Regardless the system is abysmal, as it is in Civ 6.

The pantheon is purely trash. It's not even a little meta progression like some niche 4x games have done. Probably due to the balances issues that would cause the 4 people playing this multiplayer (3 of them likely for the first and last time after they realize how magically broken this game likely is).",1683129415,1683263102,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The amount of customization and ways to play your race and empire is stellar. Paradox should learn from these guys for their Grand Strategy releases too. This game is perfect example of good base game that has huge potential for expansions, but it is a finished product as it is.

Honorable mentions:
+ Tutorial and tooltips system, very easy and fun to learn the game
+ Combat, units and battlefields have surprising depth for 4X
+ Interactive events where decisions are based on you personally as well as ruler traits and affinity
+ Tomes of Magic is a genius research system for 4X and honestly devs could just release packs of tomes as DLCs and it would be enough, haha
+ Global spells and race transformations are epic

Areas that could be expanded in the future:
- More naval and seafaring mechanics
- More unique Ancient Wonders and landmarks on the map in general
- Add more flavor to the map - moving citizens between the farms, flavor descriptions to city improvements, etc. Very easy addition but that would add even more to the scene and immersion
- Add some kind of additional ""ages"" system so you can feel more the progress of time and development from simple farms to epic full map magics, akin Endless Legend eras
- City development UI feels a bit clunky, can definitely be improved

Also I happen to be quite harsh when it comes to this. I've left some uncomplimentary reviews for the Total Warhammer series at launch and was quite disappointed with HoI IV when it first hit the shelves. I consider it a major problem in game industry nowadays to release half baked titles only to attempt fixing them over years with DLCs and novel content.

Having made the plunge, I must say, the above certainly doesn't apply to AoW 4. Contrary to my worries, this has got to be the best game I've played at launch for years.  In other words, it's fricking great! Most of the negative reviews  simply did not ring true at all to me. There is plenty of customization and enough different gameplay paths to keep me hooked for hours. And despite the medium low PC specs, the game runs decently enough for me not to notice any performance hiccups.

In fact I am quite overwhelmed by the amount of content in the base game! Definitely matches up if not surpasses of what was in the previous entries, at least in their vanilla stages. 

I've also noticed some clear inspirations from Paradox's other games, such as Stellaris and Europa Universalis in terms of UI and race design. 

Obviously there are some things that are not perfect, some features I'll likely prefer to mod out and some blatantly open for future DLC that Paradox so much loves to hoist on us. But my overall impression so far was of an incredibly thought out, tightly designed and mechanics-wise sound game across the board, with very few major bugs or glaring gameplay flaws.

I think a great future lies in store for this game, as long as they don't shelve and forget about it like they had done with  Planetfall.",1683256194,1683256863,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

Okay So i am a AOW fan played the 1st to 3rd game skipping only planetfall. I am also a 4x fan so yeah games like CIv and Warhammer done that. Also i know that the game is more of a sandbox then a actually AOW campaign game.

So for ppl coming into this game thinking its a AOW game... Well sorry its basically a Sandbox game. Why i say this...... AOW is about the story as mention this is my opinion. The game has some story ""World"" but compare to the previous campaigns it is lacking...

For ppl thinking this is a 4x Game.... Welllll yes it is. Think Humankind . there isn't much trade resource, Resource is link to mainly gold, mana, food, research and production. it doesn't effect what units can be built. There are wonder and things that once you get 3 of it grants you some boost. Diplomacy is lacking since you don't hav much to do apart from making friends and making enemy. you can trade but the lack of ""trade resource"" make it boring. pretty much i just send them the 50 buck and that it they will either wanna be your friends or hate you. City states grow fond of you abit too quick imo but they are naggy at times so i guess its okay....

Units. you have culture based units which includes, Scouts, Archer, battlemage, Soldier and support. you can then add more units from certain tome which give you more archers, calvary and battlemage and afew others, then you get Summons and also units from the wonders which you can get from duty of liege and random event. overall tome units have more skill then base units

Ranks. Units starts at Recruit each rank up you get more health, at ... i think it was elite or champion you get 1 extra skill or get a promotion to another unit and then legendary which give you another skill. the skill are the same depending on what units it is archer all get eagle eye at legendary. i have seen 2 promotion units, Feudal Pikeman and Copper Golem.  Rank up is done poorly imo Spellforce conquest of EO makes it better.

Tech....... well its called tomes here and they are link to the 6 ""Element Affinity""? you get 9 tome for each affinity 2 set from rank 1 to 4 and 1 for rank 5. There are condition to get rank 5 like need 5 shadow affinity or something. each tome has about 4-6 Items to research. you might be able to get other tome or research items from random event. in 1 game got a ""demon"" that came asking if you wanna get a cryo tome. what item available to research are random from what you have gotten but there are so little you can research you can pretty much get what you wants easily. I blame my Civ gaming for this but there are just toooo little to research.

Spell. you get battle spell and global spell. most global spell will have persist spell that rank perm bonus  as long as you can upkeep it. other are just a 1  time use like summon or change landscape and so on. Battle spell..... seems like your stuck to 3? From my game play Buff and debuff are more useful then atk spell. Strengthen spell.... my 2 full stack legend lost to 3 full stack of recruits-veteran with pretty much the same tier but they have fire range atk and strength buff 22Plus damage per hit. 

city building. Your Pop are unhappy with any and all improvement on the land build farm they aren't happy, mine same, woodcutter same, quarry yup unhappy. building are pretty much for resource increase and units nothing much to talk about

Custom World.... This is very nice you can make a custom type of land and weather, and the most fun is a world with ever changing landscape as loong as its not claim and ever growning mob but i have no idea far placement for players are about 7 to 8 turns away.

Custom Race. well you know the races, you seen the skill and cultures. nothing much to talk about. just what tome you choose will change what they call you.

transformation. Seriously 1 of the things that got me was the transformation but meh it wasn't that big of a deal imo after playing. you do get some bonus like flying or invis in forest or walk faster just to mention afew ah also some cosmetics change.

Overall it feels like a okay but lacking 4X game might be more fun in multiplayer i guess. So to buy now or later.... Wait for a discount or even better wait for DLC then wait for discount. 

As mention this are my opinion of the game if your happy with the game good for you if your not well you aren't the only one disappointed.",1683254959,1683254959,False,12,0,0.535958170890808105,0,True,False,False

This game is bomb. Think 4X like Master of Magic/Might and Magic/Fallen Enchantress mixed with the tactical combat of something like Into the Breach.

Comparing it to AoW 3 and AoW Planetfall: I was a little disappointed that the campaign is more generic than AoW Planetfall, and it doesn't have near the same level of story telling that AoW 3 had. The world is mysterious and left vague, but the event system from titles like Crusader King's focuses storytelling into the campaign missions in a way that feels fresh and makes each playthrough unique.

The unit upgrade and modification system at face value seems less customizable than in AoW Planetfall. This is deceptive, the units upgrade by type, and the buffs are tied to the Magic Tomes which act as nodes in a research tree. This is an elegant flavored system that provides a lot of unique playstyles and focuses you into bundled abilities that synergize well rather than in Planetfall where you just tried to jigsaw something broken.

The empire management is vastly improved from Planetfall, but the core of it resembles the same. The Empire Development track is a welcome addition, adding a lot of unique abilities that synergize cross-track, but also helps optimize vertical and horizontal playstyles.

The ability to play tall seems to be better than in AoW 3. I won't lie, but I need to play around more with tall civ in this game as well as in Planetfall.

The tactical combat feels the pretty much the same as AoW 3, but with the QoL features that would've made it pop. It's shares the same interface as in Planetfall, but the damage type and conditions system has been toned down for a focus on buffs and area control that resembles more like AoW 3.",1683249970,1683249970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played and beaten all 5 current story realms with some of the preset factions, and already I'm itching to combine and try out all the different ways to build my own personalized play-style. Oh and one more thing, it's probably not mentioned by others too much, but the pantheon system is perfect to encourage players to keep playing and unlocking more traits, early items, and even styles of realms (from icy biomes to volcanic terrain).

I'm looking forward to see what the dlc has in store for those who got the expansion pass version. Also, if you see this, based on how they've stated the release of dlc. If you get the Premium Edition, you save about 10$ U.S.D. compared to getting the base game, then buying the expansion pass (a/o dlc seperately).

Singleplayer is great. Smart use of synergies will turn around autoresolve wipes into complete no loss stomps, but the game is still very challenging, as the AI is pretty good.

Multiplayer is prone to desyncs requiring everyone to rejoin, all players are blocked from moving while any fight is ongoing, and the lobby list is full of dead games that will never start(probably). Can't kick people, or force turns outside of three very arbitrary short turn timers. Starting a game is difficult, and playing one without autoresolve combat will require a lot of finesse, especially when there are more than two players.

It's what I would have wanted an Endless Legend 2 to be, if such a game existed. It's what I hoped Humankind might turn into (obviously minus the fantasy). It's a brilliant realization of many of my daydreams when I think on other 4X's I've played and their ""potential."" As it turns out, it's a beautiful thing when so much of that ever-elusive potential is brought into being right at the start of a game's life instead of being left as merely something to hope for.

[b][u]Customization:[/u][/b]
One of the big ticket selling points in the marketing for the game, both on the store page and ads/trailers delivered elsewhere and for good reason. AOW4 backs up the big game it talks when it comes to customizing a fantasy empire. What sets it apart here, compared to other games which also boast of customization, is that it doesn't stop being meaninful after empire creation. The quests, magics, and general aesthetics and even victory conditions keep the founding theme of your empire alive for the entirety of the game. Many games come up short in providing a lasting sense of identity for your empire and instead the player has to resort to keeping a headcanon in an effort to provide context for their actions and keep the story going, if that's something they're interested in.

[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]
While I'm talking about story: no, this game does not have a typical campaign. There is no button on the main menu that will tell you you're in the campaign mode. [b]However[/b], I find it pretty disingenuous to suggest that the game has no story simply because there is no big button labeled ""Story Mode"" on the first window. The game absolutely contains stories of varying lengths. These tales are told via specific story realms (which are themselves mini-campaigns with narration and interesting objectives), realms in general through the creation parameters, quests, and the empires at play which have strong identities in AOW4. 

[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]
AOW4 plays like a well put together 4X. It's not going to throw veterans of the genre for any loops. You can see the roots of the genre where you'd expect to find them, and then there's some personal flair on top. One example of said flair is in the city building system, specifically the idea of boosted production. 

The process is usually as follows: select a project, it has a production time and a gold cost to start it. The typical answer to speed up the production time is to throw more production score at it. Many games have ways they handle this ranging from decrees, to civic bonuses, tile improvements which directly give production, etc. 

All of the above are options that also work in AOW4, but a boosted project is something else altogether. Something very specific that I haven't seen elsewhere. It's quite simple, and even so it still feels incredibly good to work with. The way it works is that most ""standard"" city projects have a ""boost"" criteria in addition to the typical turn time and starting cost. This boost outlines specific province improvements (farms, mine, foresters, etc) which can be built in order to slash time to build and the project's gold cost. To be clear, the project can still be started without meeting this boost criteria! But the savings for boosted projects are significant and definitely worth trying to fit in. This one extra layer adds gameplay value to the city-building process without actually locking things away. You keep the freedom while gaining an avenue for skill expression and clever planning on top.

As part of gameplay I also want to briefly touch on combat. There is a lot of it to be done in AOW4. Each of the victory conditions are likely to see your empire drawn into conflicts with other entities just by the nature of striving to complete them. On a smaller scale; quests, resource sites, and roaming dangers are also often resolved through violence. Or at least violence is an option on the menu. So right off the bat I should mention that combat situation can be auto resolved. What's nice is that the auto-resolve here isn't just the game throwing the numbers together with no regard for how those unit might be employed (rest in pace, my many total war warhammer siege weapons...) and spitting back a result. The game will simulate the encounter and you can even watch the replay after it resolves to see what went right, or horribly wrong. If you're unsatisfied with the result, you are given an opportunity to retry the encounter manually and handle it yourself. Due to the fact that the auto resolves actually plays out the battle, I find that AOW4's auto-resolve actually behaves as expected (with allowances made for the fact that you may simply be better than the AI). It's not a forgone conclusion that I'm going to lose all of my high value units while my shield fodder which I recruited specifically to soak up damage and pin the enemy do nothing but watch.

If you set out to play your battle manually, you're zoomed into a battle space that is inspired by where the battle is taking place on the overworld. If it's a siege, there will be fortifications and a massive wall bisecting the field. If it happens out in the forest there will be trees and pushes which have material effect on the battlefield by providing things like ""obscure"" or just blocking movement altogether. Armies take turns starting with the defender. Units move in accordance to their actual overworld movement value, different unit types provide things like zones of control, pins, shield walls, and even their own miniature versions of some spells. Any enchantments that your empire is sustaining come into play here as well and augment their weapons and armor and finally this is also where you as the player get to use your ""tactical spells."" Battles come in many sizes, from heroic 1v1s to 18v18 sprawling bloodbaths which may also feature in-combat summons!

[b][u]Pacing:[/u][/b]
Matches are tight, action packed affairs that tend to last me around 70-110 turns and I've seen reports of people smashing through realms in 40. There's not much of the ""index finger on the enter key spamming end turn while waiting for the inevitable approach of the heat death of the universe (or even more immediately, your CPU).""

Even in creating your faction there's so many possible combinations you can go for, and the possibilities increase exponentially once you factor in the realm, your build, and even events and items you encounter during the campaign. If you can think of some sort of fantasy trope or faction you want to replicate, chances are you can do so. 

The gameplay itself is great too. I love the city planning and development, the economy, upgrade trees, and the tomes. I'm personally a huge fan of the combat. I much prefer it to Civilization 4, 5, and 6, and I think I prefer it to Total War real time battles. I've spent a lot of time just planning out the direction I want to take my empire, and I'm all for it. I love that there's so many options to go for. 

There are quite a few minor bugs I've noticed, such as tooltips not displaying information properly (mostly the giant slayer tooltip on the final order empire upgrade for the archer buff), but none of them so far are actually game breaking, or even that noticeable. There's also some QOL changes that would be nice, like being able to cycle between heroes from the hero screen, or the changing location of the arrows to cycle between cities. 

However, I still think this game is excellent. If you like 4X games you should absolutely play it. If not, this is a good title to start with!

Some of the things I like:
-Separate queues for units and buildings
-Imperium resource spent on many choices (alignment tech tree, city foundation, population growth)
-City building and expansion much improved over previous titles where you just spammed the same building over and over
-Depth of race/tome creation and progression during the scenario, and fluent adaptations through magic, events, or other things
-Ancient wonders are world map features that provide really awesome bonuses, items, or effects (such as race adaptations)
-Besieging a city has many options on how you want to approach it, giving you various buffs, destroying enemy infrastructure, damaging enemies, etc.
-Pantheon points add tons of replayability, as they are progression beyond each scenario that carries over.

This game has a lot of potential and will grow with the addition of a workshop! Furthermore, this game will surprise you with its quality.

[h1] How it feels [/h1]
This game lives up to the classic games such as Warcraft, Might and Magic, and Civ. It's fair to say one of the game's most vital points is its flexibility. You never feel stuck to a strategy because the game evolves and adapts through the campaign or custom maps. 

[h1] How it plays [/h1]
The most significant influence is the magic system which impacts your faction (custom or otherwise), Game modifiers, free states, wandering monsters, diplomacy, unique win conditions, and gear! You can arm yourself as an oppressive warlord or a dutiful scholar of magic who can manipulate the world around you.

[h1] Personal experience with the game [/h1]
In the few games, I have played, and as often as I have played RTS, I can say this game feels good. In my first campaign, I made a race of subterranean dwarves that excelled at living underground and building massive industries. During my next play-through, I played a classic banned of marauding orcs that I crafted as a swarming race. I had cast a spell that reduced the size of my entire faction, making them the size of dwarves and converting a few into dwarves.

[h1] progression [/h1]
The game encourages growth, such as making allies or enemies through the campaign, making city-states, or wiping out all life to feed your undead scourges. Your exploration and activities will grow your play style by expanding your roster of monsters and fiends to help you. And while the starting faction units are small, your game style will become increasingly more unique as you progress, including the roster. 

[h1] Out-of-match progression [/h1]
One of the more exciting features of the game is when the game ends. The is not over after a victory or defeat. You get to grow your pantheon of gods from the heroes and leaders that conquered the world, as well as a progression tree that expands your progress further, unlocking cosmetics, new game-altering modifiers, and more!

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
There is A LOT to unpack here, and with the inclusion of the Steam workshop this game has a vast potential to be the true successor to the AoW series",1683218755,1683218917,True,21,1,0.651516437530517578,0,True,False,False

I appreciate that the devs kept around certain niche features too, like megacity mode and the ability to play against your own creations. The integration of the pantheon system is great, and the design philosophy behind the adjusted city/outpost expansion is a welcome improvement.
I've had no performance issues while running this on a low-end PC, either. 
In fact, the overall quality of the game is so high that pretty much anything which I haven't specified beyond this point can be assumed to have been done well. There's already mods which supplement nicely, too (i.e. if you want more colours in character creation). 
So, for the sake of criticism, here are the very few negative things, in my eyes (even then, two of these criticisms are more 'mixed' than 'this is strictly negative'):

-Some players might find it odd that verbal unit dialogue consists only of grunts and other non-language, but, on the flipside, there's a solid argument to be made that this allows for a more deliberate degree of ambiguity with regards to not ruining the player's immersion, seeing as you get to customize the identity of your army in deeply thematic ways. If pre-written verbal dialogue were explicated instead here, it would kind of intrude upon the personal idea you might have of what your own army is supposed to be like in terms of personality, ideals, or whatever else.

-The other half-criticism I have is that, while the world generation (called 'realms') has been improved upon in several ways, and now allows for some really unique circumstances and identities, it has also been slightly retracted with regards to the specificity of biome generation; in AOE3, you were able to use a slider to precisely configure how much of a certain type of biome (or biome feature) you wanted to see. That's been done away with, so now certain combinations are inherently impossible (i.e. if I want to make a purely arctic world with 0 chance of any other biome interspersing, I can't do that--although, to be fair, I can come rather close with the options allotted to me). But I can't really write this as being an altogether negative feature for two reasons... firstly, that the new parameters which have been added are a huge upgrade and some of them necessarily restrict certain generative possibilities, and secondly, even in AOE3, you couldn't fully customize the biome appearances in the way that was advertised (because certain biomes had to spawn), but, if I am to remain critical here, I will point out that you could at least get a bit more exact in this respect. 

-And lastly, the only truly negative thing I have to say is that it's really annoying how you have to fully start a new game/session in order to customize/create new factions. It would be nice to be able to make a faction without having to commit to actually getting into a game first. You could do this in AOE3. I don't believe the removal of such a feature was necessary.

Overall, 9/10. If I were having performance issues this might be a different story, but unlike some reviewers here, I've had no such troubles.",1683218615,1683218615,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1669000,137785448,76561198102305059,0,25,4995,1,442,1708737238,"There are issues, but actually Age of Wonders 4 kind of slaps. Whether or not this game is relegated to the ""Hall of Very Good"" or becomes a stone cold classic will depend on how it is supported.

-Faction diversity: It would be nice to see cultures have more of an impact on what you can and cannot build in your cities and even what diplomatic actions you can take.
-Racial traits: Right now they don't make too much of a difference. You have traits that give +1 defense or +10 vigor, a bit more spell damage here, ranged unit range there; it's definitely the least inspired part of the faction designer. Given races are only allowed one physical and one mental trait, these could stand to be more impactful, or they could at least offer a positive and negative effect.
-Performance: Not bad on the world map with a 2080ti and 9900k at 1440p, but adjusting settings seems to do absolutely nothing to affect framerate, suggesting some sort of bottleneck somewhere. Certain combat maps, particularly forests, have very bad performance with high unit counts, but it's never unplayable. It could be better, but it's much better than Planetfall, in my experience.
-Flavor: Units are sadly lacking in flavor text, but this could be easily rectified.
-Free Cities: Probably the most overtuned part of the game right now. When vassalized, they provide fantastic economic bonuses while maintaining their own armies, and the ability to levy troops from them instantly every handful of turns is insanely powerful. Vassals should probably either have a hard unit cap so you can't just gift them tons of units, or they should not provide the overlord such a huge amount of income (or any income at all). Free city spawns have a huge impact on the outcome of the game at the moment. Yes, it's kind of cool to play an order faction and watch your six vassals slap everyone on the map around while you do nothing. No, it probably shouldn't be so easy to get to that point, especially when the AI, while generally solid, doesn't understand that they need to do their best to counter that strategy early on.

With all that said, the game feels much more polished at day one than any 4X release in recent memory, crashes aside. The affinity system is interesting, designing factions is really fun even if it could use some improvements, and while the pantheon system that allows you to unlock realms and cosmetics may be a little grindy, it's undeniably cool to elevate your leaders and then encounter them in later campaigns. The AI, at least based on first impressions, actually seems really solid. They defend cities under siege and will take fights they think they can win while expanding in a way that makes sense. Diplomacy is flexible and the AI actively engages in it based on their personality, and there is clear feedback as to why certain things are happening. The UI design and QoL features really felt like they had thought put into them. The feature most deserving of praise in this category is probably auto-resolve. Click auto-resolve, and the battle is actually simulated instantly; you can go back and watch it if you like to see how the AI plays your faction. That alone is nifty, but the great idea is that if you don't like the auto-resolve outcome, you can still opt to retry the battle manually. This removes a lot of the anxiety of auto resolving and wondering if you could have done better. You aren't shafted for using a feature meant to be convenient. You may find that you can perform better than the auto resolve, but the slightly non-optimal outcomes are a very fair trade when you're mopping up the map at the end of the campaign, or fighting weak marauders, especially if you can try to correct the results yourself if you don't like them. It's a breath of fresh air.

I'm really hoping that balance issues and the faction designer are going to be improved and iterated upon in the future, and that the only content we have to look forward to isn't just new flavors of races tacked on to existing systems.

That streak continues for Age of Wonders 4, which is already an excellent addition to the series following the robust Age of Wonders 3 and the more eclectic sci-fi experience of Planetfall. 

The Short Version:
Age of Wonders 4 is a great addition to the 4X genre and does a lot to allow for map, faction, and playstyle diversity (even within one faction start).   If you have any interest in 4X games or the Age of Wonders series, you should get this game.   It is already great at launch (technical problems were highly over-represented in initial reviews) and with additional patches and content will only get even better.

The Less Short Version:
Age of Wonders 4 contains a number of interesting departures from Age of Wonders 3 and Planetfall (which both featured roughly similar templates for factions, encounters, and diplomacy).  The first, and potentially most jarring, is that your racial phenotype is now purely cosmetic and has (to my knowledge) no gameplay effects outside of chosen traits (which can be applied to any phenotype).  So, racial characteristics are now cosmetics paired with some (sigificant) faction modifiers instead of determining what base units a faction can recruit.  Instead, Cultures take the place that Races did in Age of Wonders 3, while the rest of faction customization comes from some additional chosen Culture traits, the Tome system, and Empire Development.

Tomes and Empire Development are the engines that drive what I think makes Age of Wonders 4 so special in the Age of Wonders series.  In previous games, the Magic/technology that could be researched by a faction and the abilities that a faction could attain in a game were almost entirely predetermined in faction setup.  In AoW4, you can change the trajectory that a faction can take in the middle of a game and pivot to different magical effects that may synergize differently with your factions's cultural/racial effects and the current status of the game and map by choosing different magical tomes to add into your repertoire.   Each tome also gives you points to unlock special powers in Empire Development.  I won't go into the details (that would take a long time and there are other reviews that do it better), but even for a given trait/tome combination, there will likely not be enough time and resources to fully upgrade one's Empire Development, leading to even more interesting choices.

There are a few tome affinities that seem to have more going on than others (Order, for example, essentially boosts vassal income and nothing else), but most affinity paths can work with a variety of intended playstyles and situations, leading to even more possibilities for replayability.

I could talk more about Diplomacy, the wild powers of the tomes, racial transformations, combat, etc., but in the interest of time let me just say this:  I have completed one full match of Age of Wonders 4 as of writing this review.  With all of the variety and options, with all of the near-infinite combinations of playstyles, I should want to play as some other faction and try out a radically different approach.   For most games, that is exactly what I would do.  But that's not what I want to do in this game.  Instead, I want to play another game as the same faction, even using the same tomes, and just use the synergies that I discovered last time more effectively, which I anticipate will open up different strategies both in battle and on the campaign map.",1683217310,1683217310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2 things:
1) I would like to be able to type in the lore for my faction. The generic dwarf lore often just doesn't fit my faction, I would like to be able to explain that they teleport their city called Silvergate from realm to realm to do battle with the wizard kings.

2) I know there are a decent selection of end game units, still I would like a couple cultural specific one, (Even though it's not 100% necessary) An expanded culture DLC pack would be something I would pay for.

City building is robust, but not overly complex. Exploring the map and finding secrets is incredibly fun, and the combat is very satisfying to engage with.

I first played the introductory zone, and thought I had made a mistake buying this game. I felt I was clicking end turn and waiting a LOT for things to happen, and then had so much magic I didn't know what any of it did. After 2 hours, I won a military victory at 123 turns and moved on to the story.

I made a Druidic Orc faction, and boy was it fun. I also stopped rushing through the turns, started checking the spells I had, reading the tooltips, and spent 4 hours playing this making it twice as long as my first campaign zone. Despite it taking twice as long, I completed this campaign on turn 27!

This game is like Civilization, meets Heroes of Might and Magic, with the customization of Stellaris, and the spells of Total War: Warhammer. 

Unlike Civ, Stellaris and Total War however, it encourages you to finish a campaign, as you get rewards, progressions that carry across to be used in new factions or races in the future. Additionally the Hero you played as, if you complete the level, can come back in future campaigns, which creates some cool storytelling moments.

The game also has a UI like Crusader Kings 3. In a good way. It has nested tooltips, cool story events and moments (which are worth reading).

This game encourages you to take your time, slow down and not rush through it. That said if you are feeling lazy, you can auto-resolve the battles, or have them auto-play out while you watch the AI control your forces. You can also change the speeds. It's a fantastic addition.

Some simple tricks and tips are: Kill all the small mobs and enemy groups that you can see. The rewards are very worth it. Always try and be at your max number of towns but don't go over. Always be at your max cap of heroes, but you can go over this if you have the extra 30 gold per turn.

I picked this game up on a whim. I had a LOT of work to get done today. It was 11 hours later that I finally put it down and went ""oh damn.."" when I realised I was going to be up until 2am doing the work that I was meant to get done earlier today.

It reminds me of a mixture of Civ and Heroes of Might and Magic 3. If you enjoy either of those games I think you will really love this one. The core gameplay is super solid and everything feels quite polished. The only complaint I would have is that it is hard to have an identity in this game. Most games have really unique races that scream for a playthrough with each, but AoW4 gives you so much customization that it is up to you to attribute the identity to your heroes and factions. I'm not entirely sure this is a complaint however because the customization is so amazing and makes the game infinitely replayable. Lastly, I LOVE the pantheon system. Basically it's a rogue-like system where every playthrough gives you experience to unlock different rewards. I love this because at times 4x games can feel unrewarding to finish. This makes sure that you actually finish your games and encourages you to keep playing.

I'll add more to this review as I play it more and go back to the other AOW games to contrast. What I will say directly, though, is that I don't expect sequel games to be exactly the same, otherwise I'd not like x com EU/EW , X Com 2, or Chimera squad, for that matter since they're all sequels to the OG xcom. 

What I can say, so far, is that the game is pretty decent in terms of 4X's. One thing that I loathe in such titles is when the decision is made to skimp on the AI. This game doesn't do that, and what's more, the tactical battle's auto-resolve feature actually works in a way that doesn't make you want to avoid it because you know you could've won the fight in a manual battle. 

I have had some crashes, but, no performance based issues (thankfully). I think this is the one AAA in this current release of AAA games which actually launched pretty well. That said, given that the game itself still has a smattering of crashes that happen for who knows what reason; it might behoove you to wait for a sale if you're unsure. They have a hotfix beta that resolves a lot of the crashing, but, I just encountered a crash.

The new & updated systems have breathed new life into the series and the range of customisation is amazing. 

I see a lot of people complaining that the customisation makes everything the same or removes diversity which couldn't be further from the truth. If you build everything the same way then yeah, but that's on you. Get creative and you can create a whole swathe of diverse factions. 

The new province system is great, it adds more depth and strategy to your city building and new ways to test your alliances, whilst also giving you the chance to recruit powerful units such as dragons. 

The spheres of magic is another thing I see people complaining about but I don't understand why, it gives you a wide range of magic/tech schools to choose from and gives you the ability to create a theme for your faction which is brilliant.

I've managed to play for some hours now (with a single crash at the beginning, but since turning down the graphics one notch, switching v-sync from on to off and opting in to the hotfix patch everything has been stable) and am enjoying the game. My fear was that I would find it too similar to planetfall and lose interest, as that game simply didn't ""click"" for me. However, perhaps due to the fantasy setting, which in my opinion is better suited to a limited land-based map than sci-fi, that is not the case. The different elements do fit together and create an absorbing atmosphere; the mechanics are easy to grasp yet their interplay is sufficiently complex so that there is plenty of opportunity to optimise them and implement a strategy; the combat has the right elements to ensure good tactics have a significant impact. This is a *good* game.

That being said, it could be better. There are elements that I'm afraid do not engage me so positively and which might, with more play-time, even begin to annoy:

- Racial Enchantments/Improvements: Back in the days of Master of Magic my favourite strategy was to focus on getting nigh-unbeatable super-heroes, troops rarely got an enchantment from me. Here I don't enchant troops or heroes, I enchant species. This actually does feel more appropriate for a wizard-king and has a nice impact on the game. It does mean that multi-species armies take longer to enchant and upgrade, which is a shame but can be ok, as multiple races also means a variety of different troop types, i.e. the price of flexibility is higher enchantment costs. But the enchantments themselves are no-brainers with only one choice - it's always better to enchant than to not enchant and the only choice you have, is which affinity you are going to bind a species to. I feel that here you could implement something more impactful. Whether it's a traits and points system like stellaris species improvement or a skill-like tree or simply grouping enchantments together in clusters and allowing one choice per cluster, all would give a stronger feeling of making a choice. Each change should then be implemented by the current spell cast system, that can remain and is, again, something appropriate for a wizard-king to do.

- Hero Items: Although nice in theory, the items I've seen so far feel bland. The choice of weapon is significant as it changes how the hero fights, but the type of weapon is what is significant, I've not seen much impact between different tiers of weapons (although that might change in higher level maps). The other items offer either a skill (which is ok) or a minor boost to an attribute (which is ok but pretty boring). Some slots seem to have very few items, for me I've found half a dozen items for every slot save legs, there it's only a single piece of heavy armour - and one which I don't use to boot, as for some reason it blocks using the mount slot. What I would like is an item creator (if not on the map, then at least at the pantheon level, with the possibility to send items to the next map), enough items for every slot with at least some choices that do not block other slots and for some different, more unique bonuses. Perhaps even bonuses to how a hero governs (see next point)?

- Heroes as governors: You get a hero with each town and, as there is no penalty for then going on adventures with the heroes you then add a stack of units to that hero and go gallavanting off around the map. Each hero brings a minor improvement to some aspects of town production, which are quickly forgotten. It all feels...superficial. There are a number of things that could be done here: larger bonuses when the Governor is in town or have visited in the last x turns (thus allowing them to still adventure somewhat), gaining xp in town for building and governing (as an alternative to wandering around), giving the skills that a hero gets on level-up to include both a combat bonus and a governor-bonus (both is better than just one, unless they change the hero system completely and differentiate between administrators, generals and super-combatants) and finally, giving each hero a single, truly impactful ability that affects their town (e.g. an order affinity hero could set a minimum cap on town stability, that increases as they level up...although then again, town stability is at the moment not an issue)

- Troop Bonuses from Town Buildings: This is only a little issue, but one that niggles at me. There are some (unique) buildings that a town can build that give troops that are built there a bonus. Nice. But. I don't like the micromanagement of only building in certain towns. What would be nice, is if the bonus could also be gained if a troop stayed in the applicable town ""training"" for a turn or two.

- Province Improvements: The system is fine as far as it goes, but the adjacancy bonuses are time-consuming to plan for. At present each province can contain a single building. Depending on the province type and the available resources there, the provinces might be limited to a single type of building that can be built there or there might be a selection. It would be nice if, at certain population levels those provinces with a selection could be upgraded, i.e. at Town Pop 8 allowing a province 2 buildings, at Pop 12 a third building etc.

Final words: Despite the (understandable) review bombing for issues some players have with game stability, I have been fortunate to have a system where the game is stable and so I am in a position to evaluate it's potential. It's good, it's fun, I would recommend it (perhaps after the first major patch or two for those not running windows 11 or with an older GPU) but I feel there is room for improvement - here's hoping the DLC will address these topics.",1683187436,1683187436,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Launching with expansions/season pass [u]does not[/u] feel like they were purposefully holding back features/content.

Happy to change my review if I see fixes.


[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Graphics are good and UI is clean and well thought out
    [*]Customization of your race at game start and customization of race through the game is great
    [*]Combat is meaningful and auto-resolve isn't the best way to win fights
    [*]Lots of spells and creature variety
    [*]Research Tree is multi-layered giving players a lot of options and strategic choice
    [*]Diplomacy (from what I've played so far) actually works
    [*]Alignment system where event and in-game choices can affect diplomacy and your cities
    [*]Province system is good and city improvements scaling on province types is well thought out
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Some race traits, hero origins, and map modifiers (non-cosmetic game mechanics) are locked behind a meaningless grind wall that doesn't respect your time
    [*]Free City system needs review (AI doesn't tend to leave its own borders and the Vassal system is economically very strong and game breaking such that not having a Free City near you at start puts you behind)
    [*]Multiple playthroughs may make you feel that all the races feel the same because the true choices that diverge player units comes from the tech tree
    [*]Units are not customizable like in AoW: Planetfall (mounted units feel bland too)
    [*]Artifact/hero equipment system is mostly RNG since there doesn't appear to be crafting
    [*]Enchantment scaling needs review because Tier 1 units costing the same gold upkeep and mana upkeep enchantment-wise as a Tier 3 unit feels bad
    [*]Edit: After more plays, I realized that there is no water strategy. If you're hoping for amphibious adventures or cities ala SM's Alpha Centauri, that's not here
[/list]

I have a lot of thoughts about this game and that's a good thing, because that means I like the game enough to think about it. Long word vomit broken up into sections to follow.

[b]My Gripe with the Grind[/b]
As of posting this review, I've fully played through two games in the course of 10 hours. I see myself playing this game a lot, but right now I'm pretty discouraged to play because of the meta-progression system. [b]Locking gameplay mechanics in a 4x sandbox style game behind a meaningless grind wall is a poor design choice.[/b] After 10 hours I leveled my metagame progress to level 7. That means I unlocked six nodes on a tree with 49 nodes total. The nodes are divided in a tree where following 12 nodes will unlock three gameplay mechanics (traits/origins). Some nodes are shared but ultimately, to unlock every gameplay mechanic, you need to get to level 49. All the other nodes are cosmetic. There are also 7 map modifier unlocks that are all fully unlocked at level 28 (not based on the nodes).

[u]My biggest issue with this is that the experience awarded for this meta game progression favors short quick wins.[/u] You can cheese a win in 15 game turns and get 500-550 experience or you can play out a standard game in 100+ turns and get maybe at most 1000 experience? [b]The system is not respectful of a player's time and therefore feels meaningless.[/b]

I'm not opposed to game mechanics being locked in progression, but I would have much preferred something more meaningful like unlocks rewarded for achievements (First Game Win, First Game Win as a Wizard King, First Military Victory, First Technology Victory, etc). The progression system is fine for cosmetics but locking game mechanics behind this system just makes me balk at wanting to play, especially knowing that some of the mechanics are things that are exactly my play style. It's reminiscent of a cheap mobile game monetization strategy to force players to pay for faster progression, but this is actually a ""big box"" game with a ""big box"" price tag. These kind of grind mechanics for unlocking gameplay options are better left to MMOs and gacha games and have no place in the 4x strategy gaming world.

[b]All the Races Feel the Same[/b]
That's because they are. The choices you make at the start of your empire are fairly minor and are not truly race defining. It is very reminiscent of 4x space sims where you checkbox positive and negative modifiers using trait points when making a custom race and have maybe one defining unique thing (eg: lithoids not needing food or hive minded or robots). The only difference in AoW4 is that there are no negative modifiers really and many of the really interesting choices are locked behind the grind wall. 

However, AoW4 has a difference in that your race can evolve over the course of the game. Much like Amplitude's Humankind, your empire will take on new traits over time as you progress through the tech tree - which the tech tree system is pretty fabulous. Your units that felt like the same units everyone else had, will start feeling much more diverse as you choose different tech choices from your enemies and allies. The racial variance, however, still might not be enough for some players when comparing to other games like Total War: Warhammer. As a whole, the races are more similar than they are different and instead of completely asymmetrical gameplay, its more divergent gameplay styles over time.

[b]Tome Tech & Affinities[/b]
The research tech tree is very well done. There are different elemental affinities and your race starts with 1 or 2 affinities based on racial creation stats. You gain more elemental affinities by choosing Tomes to unlock and research. Each tome adds several new spells to your tech RNG pool, a boost to a single elemental affinity, and unique customization options in the form of unique city improvements, racial modifiers, or gameplay options. There are multiple tiers of tomes and you have to research two of each tier to unlock access to the next tier but they don't have to all match the same affinity. But it can help because alongside the Tome Tech tree there is also the affinity tech tree. 

The affinity tech tree is fixed and unlocks more options the more affinity you have (main way of gaining affinity is by picking out tomes with that affinity). You spend special currency to unlock nodes on this fixed tech tree which have powerful effects. For example, progressing through the Chaos affinity tech tree for allow you to one time summon a Balor or give you bonuses for razing cities. While progressing through the Nature affinity tech tree  might allow you access to an unlock that lets you summon animals whenever you expand your kingdom's provinces. The affinity system is very similar to a ""culture"" or ""government"" system found in 4x space games that allow you to unlock powerful passives or one time effects.

Edit: I've played 5 more hours (totaling 15 hours now), which was 1 game win and 1 game that can't continue anymore due to a crash. Then about 30 more spam cheese 5 turn wins to unlock all the game play unlock nodes on the Pantheon. You only need to reach Pantheon Level 35 and I've uploaded a screenshot showing one of the possible most efficient unlock routes. Good news is the leveling is flat. So you need to win 34 cheese games or roughly a little more than half as many normal games to unlock all the gameplay options.

At one point an orc leader who had befriended me right away at the start of the game was about to be betrayed by a family member but i did not join the side of power hungry relative and the very next turn i ended up with my orc ally as a vassal with the many advantages which it allows in the areas of additional income/resources etc.

Huge selection of buildings,units,spells to be researched and built so as to be able to gather resources from mines, quarries, markets, libraries,stonemasons,pantheon shrines which act as conduits etc. When it comes to the military there are long range units such as archers and spellcasters along with melee units to protect them as they unleash their volleys of aerial death.  

Combat is elegant and intuitive reminding me of AGE OF WONDERS PLANETFALL, SPELL FORCE EO, MASTER OF MAGIC with fear instilling DEATH DEALING WEAPONS! FEARSOME EYE BULGING SPELLS! and TERRIFYING RAMPAGING ARMIES A PLENTY!!! All draped warmly in GODLY ASTONISHING LIFE LIKE ANIMATIONS! 

Excellent game mechanics such as flanking where you do extra damage to enemy forces and using the terrain for cover at different angles. Before committing to an attack you will be shown the odds of a successful hit. There is also friendly fire which is awesome to see as my archers will let loose with their arrows only to have one of the attacks hit a friendly unit who is right next to the enemy. Spells are a major tool in combat as they can buff up your forces with all sorts of enhancements. There are also spells which can conjure up units which can join your army and aid you in battle. High morale helps in getting successful critical hits while low morale will make it more likely of a missed attack. Also the more damage your units take the less effective they will be.

World maps, structures, ancient wonders, resources, friendly and hostile forces all kiss the visual senses deeply and passionately with graphical gorgeousness with no lag or stuttering as you explore the world of AGE OF WONDERS 4. No slovenly lazily half done graphics here. No pixels here please but we may except pixies.

Ancient wonders can only be explored and cleared out with a hero in your party. They come in three levels of difficulty so prepare well for the enemy shall not spare you of their wrath. Infestations are also another danger which if not taken out right away when encountered will become a major threat as they grow and spread as a city would.


Music is as a soothing cool summer wind making one happy with beyond description game relaxing calm where the thinking process is stimulated to the max with the most exquisite succulent mental feast of rule sets and modifiers.

Sound effects bring cheer with their comforting soundscapes as well as adrenaline triggering combative terror as spells smash into screaming enemies shattering them like a mighty hammer upon the most fragile egg shells. Yay verily there be good fighting here for ye raging slaughtering types while others will prefer to engage in a more diplomatic approach.

The spoken audio for the excellent tutorial and advice is fantastically done by the female voice actress. One of those voices which fits in perfectly like Leonard Nimoy does in Sid Meier's CIVILIZATION series. It integrates perfectly with the games user interface where everything is extremely intuitive and easy to get into where the necessary info or commands is but a click on the screen away with great results making me feel i just discovered a new toy which was hidden in holiday gift wrapping paper which is saying, ""Explore and open me "". 

Ruler creation is as flexible as ever full of options on the appearance and skills of she/he/IT! who will be your avatar in this world of mind reeling evil and glorious good! You can also create your own game world setup for example a Death World with undead everywhere in a graveyard landscape of desolation.

Tech trees and tomes have a certain randomness when it comes to researching spells/tech which is welcomed and adds a ton replay value due to the huge amount of content that is available to discover.

Excellent performance with no crashing or lagging on my i7 8700, 16GB Ram, RTX 2060 6GB Vram, WD Black External Game Drive, Windows 10 with the latest updates.

For AoW4, I've done both the campaign and the random scenarios and I'm having a blast. Did a fae realm where they hate evil, and I was the evil lich. Was super fun to start the magic victory and suddenly see all other rulers put aside their differences and join up against me (think Sandro from Heroes 3). Knowing that they would do that, I prepared teleportation circles in key locations to defend my empire with much fewer troops.
