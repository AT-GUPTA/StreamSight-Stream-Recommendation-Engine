Despite the game being simple graphically, it has the most beautiful boating I’ve ever seen in a game. The way the water moves is just mesmerizing. The art direction allows for the game to look quite beautiful in other areas as well. 

Complaints I have with the game all revolve around two mechanics, the stamina and the death system. Stamina takes way too long to regen. It’s fine in the early game, but it’d be really nice if there was a late game item that makes stamina regen triple or something. (maybe introduce it around the Plains Biome) The problem is that everything requires stamina, so I’d be stuck in some fights just walking around waiting for my stamina to regen. That’s not fun. 

My other complaint is with the death system, it’s too punishing. Yeah death should have consequences, but when you get to the mid game dying is waaay too harsh. You lose experience AND your items. This isn’t like Minecraft where experience and new weapons are easy to grind out. In Valheim, losing your gear permanently is game ending since new gear is incredibly hard to make. I would’ve rage quit if I lost my gear. Also because I kept losing exp on death, my levels never went higher than 40. If you can’t reasonably make it to level 100, the level cap should simply be level 50 because you will die, a lot.

Despite all this I had a great time with Valheim and am excited for a final boss to be added eventually. (hopefully)",1708829051,1708829051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
892970,129640825,76561198062125527,19,12,48657,4465,48657,1708821608,"Like most games of such genre it has enormous potential. It may devour thousands of hours easily, but not currently. Right now it needs a reason implemented. Like a lore says: it's a world of ghosts and willpower is their fuel. Player's willpower is strictly linked with game's features. Right now we have a few biomes (zones with different environmental conditions, wildlife and reasources), typical grinding for better gear and rather humble building system.

Spended almost seven hundred hours in this game which in my case is enough. I'm not finding most games interesting. ""Valheim"" is nothing new - basicially ugly version of ""Skyrim"" without quests and reasons but with building menu. All there is is one big grind against world which only knows how to steal effort; Time is an enemy, boundaries are hostile and most npcs will kill on sight just for the hell of it. No escape from this valhallic purgatory by any means. Game is not new and its updates are very slow - much like ""DayZ"", but ""DayZ"" is a lot more ancient. I won't bother with saying what's good, because that's for people to find out. Will only speak about things that bothered me throughout all my time with ""Valheim"". To help others avoid problems.

- I truly recommend to play on PVE servers only. Vanilla or hardcore. Simply because people are too toxic. They're the main reason why mentioned ""DayZ"" is evil and stressful game. People are constantly trying to destroy each other if such option is available. Game is not fun anymore when that happens.
- Mists are everywhere; each biome has its own version and even buildings won't stop them from taking over player's monitor. Especially annoying during snowstorms, while sailing, exploring plains and deep inside mistlands. Some of the mists cannot be blown away, even with wisplights. Particularly a bluish one inside mistlands. Fighting inside that is a needless challenge.
- Npcs are omnipotent and are seeing through walls and mists. Being detected from seemingly nowhere is a common thing.
- Swimming and sneaking are both fueled by stamina. If one runs dry then either health will be lost or stealth effect will be gone. Swimming penalty scales with amount of health.
- Npcs don't have stamina and can chase -in ideal scenario- forever. They only have cooldowns on some of their skills and patterns. Learning that is the only way to win seemingly unwinnable battles. Which in the long run makes every combat situation predictable.
- Everything is based on items. Without items there is no chance to go against anything outside meadows (starting) biome. Npcs in this game have no fear and are fighting to the death so without constant gear upgrades game turns into one sided slaughter. The main problem here is that avatar is not getting stronger by training with items but because of using them. That makes our hero a paper one.
- Not enough skills that could cultivate innate characteristics (strength, durability, memory...). No reason to actually train. The best skill currently is ""blocking"". It's a life saving skill imho, especially in tight spaces. But getting that to sufficient level is too much of a hassle. Amount of damage received has nothing to do with it. Players are abusing swarms of ""weak"" npcs to get it done.
- Limited creation menu. Player can't even fully use resources found in vanilla, either architectural or environmental. Can't even plant everything that can be normally harvested.
- Npcs's bows are heavily bugged. Their arrows have no range and never fall. Arrow just vanish after flying outside of rendering zone. The only thing that makes arrows weaker from ""stalker"" series gauss rifle's load is the speed of flight. Its relatively slow. Still, fighting a few common archers (mostly undead) is not a pleasant experience. No armor will help with that. Enemy archers of bigger rank (star or two stars) are pretty much the biggest threat in the game.
- Npcs's animations not fitting their actual position. You can see that enemy archer is not even aiming at ya, but he is. And not only archers. Every npc is having that problem. Calculating that mistake while fighting can save a lot of time.
- Npcs's range is way beyond their physical (model) capabilities and also ignoring walls while at it. Seeker is a grand example of dealing damage through any obstacle.
- Some npcs are so strong that can destroy stone or metal objects with their bare hands/teeth. Common wolf will do as an example here.
- Death penalty attacks only devoted players. The more hours you put into the game, the more you lose when ""dying"". This kind of penalty doesn't do anything to majority of casual players for they have no skills on their characters to lose. It's kinda unfair, especially on higher levels. One slip costs 5% of each skill. If you have 1 level with swimming, you will lose pretty much nothing. But 5% on level 80 means 4 levels down. To gain single high level player needs to devote A LOT of time. All of that is wasted very easily. The main problem here is mostly how unbalanced it feels.
- Some events are without sense (eg. wolves spawning in the middle of the ocean).
- Combat with white weaponry is seriously flawed. Spear is a prime example of making one step of progress and then doing two steps back. Before recent updates there was a problem with their attack ranges. Spear is a weapon with great range. But not in this game. Here you can only make a quick stab or throw. There is a big chance that thrown spear will just slip through the middle of a target without doing any damage. An easy way to lose weapon while fighting. There is still a problem with trajectories. If an enemy is standing a bit lower, then it doesn't matter if distance is point blank. Some weapons (spear once again) will never do any damage when that happens. Avatar will just stab nothing. Hence its important to fight in a right place. Enemies don't have a problem with dealing damage at all.
- A lack of real choice. Being a plaything for some myth-like ""gods"" isn't fun. Kill boss to progress further? Hang its head on the altar to unlock some silly and time limited power? Where's the option to defy those ""gods""?
- Food is too overpowered. Mostly because the lower limits of health/stamina pools are strict. No skill is making them greater which doesn't make any sense. Through training one can become healthier - its a common knowledge. But here we can only eat. This system exists solely to force players into farming and cooking constantly. These two are not bad at all but too imbalanced at the same time.
- Stamina is too linear. Constant running, working or fighting is burning same amount of food as doing nothing. Everything is based on pre-designed timers.
- Npcs are immune towards physics that could easily kill any player - falling damage for example. I've seen a wolf falling from over 50 meteres and that did nothing to him. Same hight will kill a player unless special items are involved. Checked with different kind of npcs.
- Missing secondary object manipulation mode - full rotation for example. That would open a whole new world for construction purposes. Some mods are giving that feature already, but...
- Mods should NEVER make the game. Vanilla must be solid by itself and mods should only polish it a bit. It's a normal thing.
- Not available lycanthropy for players, which i see as a big flaw, especially when werewolves (npcs) are already implemented. Love werewolves.

I understand that this game is still being developed. But time waits for nobody and personally, i don't believe in early access games anymore. Seen too many failures. If it wasn't for the people i know i would not give it a try. But they've recommended it and we have spended some time together. Overall not bad, not bad at all. Time consuming though.

Players embark on their posthumous journey, deemed worthy by Odin himself; they find themselves tasked with eradicating forsaken beings across the 10th realm. Since its release, it has distinguished itself with its engaging survival crafting loop, intuitive gathering, and building mechanics that allow players to progress from humble shacks to grand Viking halls. The integration of realistic physics adds a layer of depth and enjoyment to tasks as simple as chopping wood, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

Valheim has an innovative base-building system, combat mechanics, and exploration of its vast, procedurally generated world. The building system allows for both precision and creativity, catering to a wide range of architectural preferences. If you go looking for creative base designs from players, you will find no shortage of entertainment and hours of time lost in the blink of an eye.

With regards to Valheim's combat, it is easily compared to action RPGs, with a focus on stamina management and a variety of weapons and armor to suit different playstyles. Unique world bosses add challenging milestones for players, with each victory unlocking new tiers of equipment. 

In combination with well-executed survival crafting elements, compelling combat, and exploration, Valheim is recommended for both veterans and newcomers to the survival genre.

getting 2 deer trophies was a nightmare. i was aiming straight at the deer, i didnt realize this game was made by people that never EVER shot a bow in their life. in their mind, an arrow will curve down even if your target is a few yards in front of you, so you have to aim way above the target. took me a while, lots of arrows and misses to realize this atrocious violation of reality. then there was no more deer. i had to reload the game to get another one. (just a bug you will tell me, pfft, it counts). Then i realized i was approaching the problem the wrong way. i was thinking realistically when i should have thought ""video game"". OF COURSE, these neg-iq devs wanted me to literally sneak behind a deer an melee it. as if that was something even remotely possible. THATS what i was supposed to be doing, sneak behind A DEER like were a rogue in world of warcraft. 

finally, i had enough to summon the what ever this is.

a moment later, the house that took me what seemed like hours to build is completely demolished. 
there was no in between. first you fight little scrub mobs that you 2 shot and do no damage. the moment later, you get rampaged by a boss even trough your main base. 
0 ramping up, 0 way to learn how to fight. from a lvl 1 troglodyte to a giant rampaging boss.
these neg-iq devs have 0 idea how to make a game, clearly.

There’s a lot of good here: Combat is snappy and responsive, base-building mechanics are fantastic, and the art direction, music, and minimalist graphics are all wonderful. The game has charm. But that charm was lost, for me, by the uninspired procedurally generated map, punishing death mechanics, and grind.

– 

In detail:

The procedurally-generated map is far too big for a solo player, and far too uninteresting to justify its size. The only human design in the game is the biomes themselves, but there’s only six of them. Once you’ve seen them all, you’ve explored the whole game. The computer repeats what little human-designed content there is a million times across a world the size of Azeroth. This doesn’t have a hand-designed world like Subnautica or Satisfactory.

To justify its size, the game offers a grind unlike any I’ve seen in games of this genre. At its default settings, you’d have to mine out an entire island to complete a suit of armor, and you’ll have to spend even more time lugging them back to base, then more time still refining all those materials. To put it clearly, this is the game: Mining resources on a relatively uninteresting map, and bringing them back to base.

I enjoyed building bases, particularly emergency shelters out in the wild, but sadly, there’s little gameplay reason to build a cool base like those in the trailer. The optimal base is a single room, stuffed with storage lockers, with all crafting stations crammed together. Crafting doesn’t automatically take resources out of nearby crates, so you’ll want those resources close at hand. Other games give you a reason to build multiple rooms, or solve other problems. And you can’t build anything on your Longship! 

While the combat system is wonderful, it’s marred by a punishing death and save system. When you die, you respawn with nothing, and must find your corpse to regain your lost loot. It’s especially punishing when this happens across oceans. The save system is more like an emergency backup system (for things like power outages or file corruption), and does not allow you to easily undo mistakes. This system serves to punish limit testing and experimentation. Purists will tell you it increases the tension, but I think the design is more to encourage multiplayer interaction, which is lost on solo players.

–

All that said, there’s a ton of promise in this game. Could the developers give us a reason to build more interesting bases? Can they make the world itself more interesting, perhaps by hand-designing a map?  Could they just add in a regular save system? Could they lessen the grind, and add in more bosses instead?

Part of my problem, I think, is that I have played Subnautica, Outer Wilds, and other small indie games with fantastic single-player journeys. I wasn’t going in with the expectation that this could be anything like those giants, but still, my brain can’t help but hope I’ll have experiences like those again. Valheim, with some changes, could be that game, and it’s not. It’s not trying to be. It’s a multiplayer sandbox game. And that’s okay. It’s just not what I want.",1708802515,1708802515,False,3,0,0.510638296604156494,0,True,False,True

Why do I need to click 3 times to continue a game. Put a continue button on the first screen that we see when we start the game. If the button says start, it should start the game, not got to some other screen, with yet another start button, which then goes to yet another start button that finally starts the game!

A couple of quick observations:
========================
-Can not teleport copper/ Halfwit developers don't want you doing fast travel with specific items!
-Bows in this  game are pathetic. Point blank or don't bother!
-How about a warning (more than just an occasional one), if you are in a place full of smoke that will kill you!
-if fighting on something near any building. You will do damage to that building. So, you may create more problems, if you need  to build a crafting station where there is no room for it. To continue your exploration of the building!
-The game does not allow for uneven ground level. So if the enemy is higher or lower. It will be able to hit you. But you will not hit them. Meaning, you die more than you should!!
-Game seems to crash a lot. Also as it apparently wants to be connected to the internet at all times, even when playing solo. It seems to stall a lot, if your connection lags!
-The first boss is immune to almost everything. Normal arrows do no damage at all and using a melee weapon is never going to be an option. Also, once you activate it. It will chase you forever. Which means after spending many hours building a basic base and house. If you make the mistake of running back to your house in the hopes of escaping it. It WILL smash your house down in less than 30 seconds. It is then restart time [ALT + F4]. Try fire arrows, but I wont be back. Game is pathetic!
-Make it more obvious how to repair items!
-How about turning the lights on, so we can see what we are doing. Are the gfx that bad. At least you could give us a gamma slider, so we can adjust the setting and keep playing, rather than just stopping play!
-Walking around, bashing trees and bushes, collecting food, or killing things that decide to attack you is fun for about 30 seconds.
-Why the F, do we suddenly get attacked non stop. If the respawn spot is where you get killed. Every time after that, you will respawn with no items to defend your self from further attacks!. Pathetic! [ALT + F4] time for me!
-When using a hoe to lower the ground. What keys do we use to switch between raise and lower. I accidentally found the raise key (no idea which one it was). It raised the ground too high and now I can't lower it again. This makes my building unfinishable! 
-Make building simpler. While in build mode, let us fly. While on the subject of building. Display a message telling us why we can not build. Simply making the part RED, is nowhere near enough information. Especially when we try moving the part around and no matter where we put it. It remains RED. Imbeciles made this build system!!!



My main gripe:
============
Why is building anything so hard?

I look at the key bindings, I see keys for specific things, such as build. I go back to game and press key. Nothing happens. Display a message on screen when we press the build key with out having a hammer equipped!

Why can we not interact with doors etc, while we are in building mode. Having to press several keys to exit building mode, open the door, then press several keys to go back in to building mode, is pathetic!

Rather pointless, pressing other keys, for the most part, does not do much either!

What's wrong with the idea of letting the player save the game, try some thing, then let the player continue from where they saved the game. If what they tried does not work. Pathetic how the halfwit developers will not let you do that and to add insult to injury. They take all your items away, so as to ensure that you have no chance of beating the boss, if you decide to play again after rage quitting, because the boss killed you!!!

2024 EDIT: While I still recommend this game, I have to include that mods are a MUST for the full experience nowadays. The devs have reallyyyyy slowed down their work on the game over time sadly, so there's RARELY new content. Mistlands update itself was rather disappointing, but here's to hoping Ashlands will be better.

Everything is still so unfinished. The building system is imprecise, can't build towers and structures beyond a certain height due to deliberate limitations, the combat system is basic and rudimentary, progression is uninspired and unoriginal. 
No healing items available until later in the game, which is a problem. The only way to heal is by eating food which slowly regens health. Food also increases max stamina and health but when you become hungry again they reset. Eat food again, and they're back up, but you have to wait for the health regen to refill your health to max. Acting as if you're injured when all that happened was you got hungry and needed to eat.
This could be solved by just decreasing your health and stamina limit, but leaving your current amount as is, until it's spent, like a buffer.

Anything you find in this game is done better in other survival games. This game is in early access and it shows. I don't understand the glowing reviews.
It's boring and annoying. The only thing the game has going for itself at the moment is the Norse mythology it's based on.
The game has clear signs of being developed by inexperienced journeymen who just graduated, as if this was their final year project which they wanted to keep working on.

Sadly cannot refund it as it's a slow-burn kind of game that takes a while to form a opinion on.

The mix of exploration and building and general progression is I feel fairly unique, largely because to build stuff you're forced into travelling/exploring as a means of transporting the resources by land or boat, often great distances, effectively forcing your hand into travelling new areas. 

One thing I would say, is that playing with friends or a clan is going to be a significantly better experience than playing on your own.

Things i did, didn't like below. 
[spoiler]
Things i like:I
* weapons and tools and progression pretty good.
* exploration is fun once you learn how to sail.
* Portals are a sigh of relieve. Just don't forget to take the mats. to build one on long journeys.
* I love my piggies.
* I like the variety of enemies across biomes, but within each biome there could be more variety. 

Things that bug me. 
* Building axis cycling, Some building blocks don't cycle as expected. 
* Armour stand - This really needs to change as it renders the Armour stand useless. Needs to work like a chest, not an item mount. This is so i can rapidly move items, which is boring, slow and frustrating right now.
* Occasional Server lag - As the host, running on a local network, playing with a friend on a steam deck over WiFi, I've found that occasionally we get serious death causing lag. The thing is, its the host that lags and often results in the host dying. This literally makes zero sense. Mobs will rubber band and attack the host invisibly. 
* Planting crops, i'm hoping that there's an advancement i haven't unlocked to mass plant seeds, it can get a bit tiresome.

Overall, I like Valheim. I played through it up to the end of the current content with two friends of mine, and we created a good number of memories doing so. We've agreed to come back for the next major update, having ended on a rather good note.

Of the things I like about the game, I'm rather impressed with the scale of the world and the variety of encounters to be found. The procedural generation of lands and dungeons lends itself well to emergent experiences, and while there were some disappointments to be had as a result of the system, the successes are left echoing in my mind far stronger than the failures. Some high points specifically were complex adventures to retrieve lost items which forced innovative or just desperate strategies, The current last boss is by far and away the best of the selection in the game, with varied threats yet appropriate measures to combat them. Interesting gear with special effects near the end was a delight to discover. Some enemies are absolutely terrifying and a thrill to encounter.

There are a few things I can criticize. The number of items to be discovered is somewhat low, and the realistic amount of solid ""content"" to be found is on the low side. This leads into by far my biggest sense of distaste for the game: the grind. To be perfectly honest, the amount of engagement to be found in Valheim is likely in the 20-30 hour range, but it's stretched to far longer by the level of material grind required at sections of the game, and most of our sessions were centered around resolving this. The fast travel system, a series of interconnected portals built and linked by the player, is a good one, but prohibits transportation of many materials - primarily metal - that are required to progress the game. This means the game's exceptionally lengthy sailing times are necessary not just for exploration, but the repeated shipping of materials for processing. Combined with an inane level of these materials - especially iron - required, the length of the game is artificially inflated as much as 5 times, and is the only real reason my hours are left above 100 at the end of the playthrough.

Largely for this reason, I would [i]never[/i] play Valheim alone. Were I not alongside friends to elevate the experience, this time sink would have left such a sour taste in my mouth that the game would never have been able to redeem itself in my mind.

I leave Valheim, for the time being, with a positive impression, yet the dangerously low amount of engaging content sets a tone that prevents me from really calling it ""great"".",1708688867,1708689040,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Valheim is perhaps one of the best survival crafting games out there, and is without question the most immersive, especially when played with friends. Like many games of this genre you start out naked in the woods, and you must craft items and build a base. But, it has some unique twists that can cause the player(s) to organically behave in a ""realistic"" way, such as:

- When building a house, you have considerations I haven't seen in other games. For instance, you will need a fire to keep you warm. But, that fire generates smoke, so it needs a chimney. But, rain can put out your fire, so you also need that chimney to be covered. Furthermore, you want to add comfort items and decorations in your house so you get a better rested buff.

- Food doesn't heal you, rather it gives you a health/energy bar to begin with. Additionally, different foods give you different amounts of health or stamina, so you have to have a balanced diet with multiple food sources. No farming the ""best food"", you have to diversify, and some cannot be farmed but must be hunted.

- Wood and stone is heavy, so you may want to build a cart to move large quantities. But, that cart can be sluggish when loaded with cargo, so you will want to build roads throughout to make it a smooth and easy journey. Ditto with sailing ships and docks - will make your life easier, and not in a ""5% improvement to X"" way.

- When playing multiplayer, you are indirectly encouraged to build together and share resources/labor. Yes, other games do this as well to varying degrees. But here, many otherwise expensive items can be shared by the community, attacks are more easily repealed, and tasks divided so you can get more done in less time. 

Now, I have not at all talked about the amazing sailing, the sound combat mechanics, the impressive art style/graphics that both looks stunning while being able to run on almost anything. There is a lot of wonderful things to say about this game, and a reason why myself and my friend-group have spent over 1000 hours collectively in it.

But, this is the internet, so I do need to make some complaints:

- Lackluster character customization, and what customization options exist are quickly hidden from view. You can choose between male and female player models, along with some hair, beard, and color options. The problem is that as soon as you put on armor, it's hard to tell the difference between any players. There are very few ""purely cosmetic"" items in the game, and it's always smarter to have the ""newest armor"" as it's a linear progression. When you and all your friends look the same as you are wearing the same armor, it sure makes customization feel unimportant. If players were given broader freedom in customizing the player model, if the body types were more distinct in appearance, and if there were more armors that were either side-grades or just cosmetic re-skins of other armors, this could be easily fixed.

- I previously wrote that the stealth path felt lackluster. I have since replayed the game, limiting myself to light armor and daggers. I no longer think that the stealth path is as bad as I once did, but it could still use some work. While enjoyable to use in the Black Forrest and slowly thinning out goblin villages, stealth is completely impractical within swamp crypts and infested mines. The mistlands-teir duel-wield daggers are frankly a downgrade due to the lower blocking ability, and this isn't even getting into the fact that it's hard to justify not keeping to the cultist armor as soon as you get it. Lots of little things to fix or otherwise address - or maybe making it easier to divest into a wider range of combat skills over a playthrough - but not as bad as I once wrote.

- There are a number of quality-of-life improvements that this game could enjoy. Looking at some of the more popular mods for this game would be a great starting place, but I know for sure that better granulation in building placement as well as smoothing the process of planting farms would be both well welcomed improvements to the game. 

Overall, I very much enjoy this game. My friends love it. And I suspect we will continue to keep playing this game so long as there are more things for us to do in it.",1669710264,1708646021,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Exploring feels like a quest all its own. Whether by land or sea, things can go south real quick with monsters and environmental hazards! Working the sails on your boat is fun as heck. 

The devs know how to make a lot of the systems work together in a fun way while avoiding the edge where it feels like tedious work(imo, but I haven't wanted to go past the Swamp tier of progression).

The graphics... well, it's crap, that's all I can say... It's not a great visual or anything worth having in 2024. And I would understand it as a price for good optimization and adaptability for low performance computers, but that's not the case, as you just get zero of both.
Bosses are simple as fck and without some mods the combat system isn't even close to be enjoyable or convenient.

Visibility is none, your wisp light have very small radius so does not really help with the mist.

PEOPLE LOOKING TO JUST BUILD BEWARE!!

Most of those impressive structures you see on youtube or community page are through dev commands and/or mods (so your stuff will break when game updates and mod doesn't). While the option to build at no material cost in the game is appreciated if you just want to build there are many annoyances where something SHOULD work but game says no. Building needs to be way less restrictive (especially with stone/glass). Support requirements vary from material to material and generally detracts from creative expression where you have to conform to the dev's arbitrary ""no because"" (and their army of sycophants). A world option to toggle this like the existing ""no cost building"" option would be great. 

What constitutes an enjoyable experience changes from person to person and from time to time; its a game at the end of the day. The more options people are given to customize their experience the better. Tired of the trite ""no cause realism"", ""no cause I had to do it the hard way it shouldn't be made easier"", ""no cause I dislike the idea of the existence of preferences different than mine"", or ""no cause it is the bible incarnate and should not be changed or altered in any way you sacrilegious cunt"".

While most may say ""probably not for everyone"", I find this game really has a lil something for almost everyone & can be thoroughly enjoyed with some friends and/or  mods, creativity, and bit of dedication, Its very rewarding unlike so many other games. It's a difficult hardcore game by default but now can be configured with settings. Played as ""intended"", it's unforgiving and challenging which makes the world feel more real and alive and leads to many good times and ""learning experiences"" (especially with friends).

  It's still in early access, managed by a small team who are now reshaping development with new funds and the modding community is updating mods all the time because the Dev's keep breaking them with game updates. This has to be the biggest flaw of this game IMO so far. Some may complain that ""This game is only difficult *because* it's punishing"" but I believe this kinda only applies to people who are cracked at gaming because the different forms of combat are not easy to master either. Neither are the systems in the game; mining, terraforming, building and exploration etc. all take finesse and experience, and other systems (culinary, smithing, building, crafting, exploration, etc.) are all exploratory like the first time you played Minecraft or Terraria (This game doesn't hold your hand or spoil things) and has great replayability.

This game didn't blow up for no reason. It has a solid & original sandbox foundation and simple yet robust game systems and mechanics. With game settings and mods you can tweak your experience to your liking and even host your own modded servers. This game supports crossplay & servers between Xbox *GamePass, PC *GP and Steam but almost all mods are not compatible with xbox/vanilla.

Swapped to negative. 22/02/2024

Combat upgrade never came. Bosses, still the same crap bullet sponge. Biomes are pretty good and they even added a new one with some new enemies.

Still, the gameplay is boring and to make things worse, the armor system sucks. 
Endgame armor needs IRON (which is a mid game resource).

Enshrouded's gameplay it's WAY better. It barely launched, it's a map made by hand and still has more excitement than this game. 

Valheim is still good, don't get me wrong. But, for me it's too basic now, compared to an actual good combat like enshrouded's (and they even have magic on early game, NOT LIKE THIS GAME).",1613858285,1708583044,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- Graphics: The game's stylised graphics are really beautiful and immersive, both outdoors and in dungeons and crypts.

- Sound: The music in this game isn't Dark Souls boss music quality, but it still sounds pleasant when traversing the land. Boss music is pretty nice also.

- Area variability: Though I don't like some of the areas in the game, the game still manages to keep every new area fresh and original. My favourite areas are (Meadows,Black Forest and Plains, and the Giant Turtle's back).My least favourite area was the Mist Lands. I don't need to explain why this area is bad, if you have played the game. The swamps and Mountains look great and are fun when you are slightly higher level, but the enemies slightly ruin the area when you go there with low level gear.

- Fun with Friends: This may be a negative thing, but this game is only really worth it with friends (But really fun to play with friends). Playing by yourself in my opinion, would suck.

Negatives:
- Bad (Boring) Grind: Grind isn't always bad, however for it to not be bad, it needs to be fun grind. The grind in this game is mostly mining ores and bringing them back to the base to smelt. This was probably the most annoying and boring aspect of the game (The worst thing is, its majority of the game). It's saddening because it definitely could have been made more fun. The only fun grinding aspect of the game was invading plains camps for wheat and flax. Why in a viking game is raiding done only during a small part of the game, but mining ore is done throughout the whole game? It doesn't make sense, Vikings in media raid, not spend most of their time mining.

- The combat: The Witcher 3 has this same issue, you fight most of the enemies the same way. You either dodge an attack, then hit or you shoot an enemy down with arrows. That's it. Even most of the bosses are fought the same way. You can parry, but most of the time its easier and safer to dodge and hit an enemy, especially when dealing with 2 star enemies.

- Wolves:.

- Lack of content: The game without the grind is very small, the devs are still adding to the game, but times between updates are very long.

- Building system: The building system in this game is very janky and it's almost impossible to not get stuff clipping through each other, for somebody who likes things to look perfect, its a real annoyance. Additionally some of the different building sets you get in the game, are missing things that the starting wood set contains (Like their own doors, roofs, or stairs). Why?

Ending comment: The games really fun with friends, it means you need to do a bit less grinding with certain things and even during grind, you can interact and talk to your friends.

This allows you to play a more relaxed game and bring it on par with multiplayer games. This made the game a lot more enjoyable and almost as forgiving as multiplayer games.

After playing with friends I found this game is a lot easier with just one more person than it is solo.

The only two complaints I have with the game are the fact that you can't go through portals with any metal or ore when farming it. That gets very annoying very quickly.

• The music is excellent and creates a immersive vibe.
• The graphics are beautiful and creative.
• The procedural generation of the map is excellent.
• The building feature is the best in any game i've ever played.
• Game play overall is extremely fun.

[u] Negatives [/u] 
• Difficulty level between biomes.
• Enemies spawn next to player and swarm the player constantly.
• Dying over and over to recover items dropped on death with no other way to recover them.
• Stamina mechanic is absolutely broken. Very limited stamina causes the player to just stand in place unable to attack or run while getting hit by enemies.
• Mining and digging needs to be overhauled. You should be able to dig deeper and find ore. The way various ores are obtained in the game is terrible. They should all be mined underground in their respective biomes as small nodes. 
• Stone structures are far too weak. 
• Fishing is impossibly difficult. I'm never able to reel fish in successfully.
• No diving/underwater swimming mechanic.

[u] Suggested improvements [/u] 
• Add more music.
• Stamina and health shouldn't be solely based on what they player eats. These stats should improve with some sort of leveling up system.
• Reduce/Prevent enemies from constantly spawning and swarming player. Enemies should be standing around the world.
• Add the ability to build/design custom ships. Allow player to build on the ship.
• Overhaul mining Ore as mentioned before. 
• Allow for deeper mining and add the ability to dig tunnels or caves. Allow for mine shafts, underground bases, and underground ore mining.
• Increase the strength of stone structures significantly.
• Implement a way for the player to retrieve/call back their items lost on death at the world stones/Spawn.
• Add more building pieces.
• Fish need to be reeled in easier.
• Add a diving/swimming underwater mechanic.

Every area looks and plays a different way, combat (although clunky at times) hits that sweet spot between boring simplicity and overwhelming complexity, the metroidvania elements make exploration more interesting and streamlined, and the building mechanics spice things up quite well without severely hindering creativity; all of that without mentioning the excellently executed lo-fi artstyle and very fitting soundtrack which bring a lot of life to the game. The crafting system, item variety and survival mechanics are not groundbreaking but provide some extra depth.

However, it doesn't have that much playable content in the grand scheme of things and it's not long before you run out of things to discover after you reach a new area, at which point it turns into a tedious, repetitive grind that is unreasonably time-consuming. 
Getting a new material requires doing the same, very slow thing over and over again. These materials are not only very annoying to carry around due to the inventory system, but also force you to make repeated trips back and forth with the boat and deal with the way too annoying wind mechanics. You are eventually able to acquire upgrades and new tools, but they are nowhere near enough to ease the grind even in previous zones.
A way of alerting the player when they are approaching an area they should not be exploring yet would be helpful too, especially considering enemies can chase you between biomes. Currently the only way of learning about it is to either go to the wiki or getting one-hit killed by a random enemy which often looks way less menacing than what you were actually supposed to be fighting. Since dying can be very punishing, the game encourages an overly cautious and grindy playstyle that can eventually become unfun.

When it comes to base building, the bare bones raid system quickly goes from a challenge to a constant annoyance that keeps you from what you'd rather be doing by throwing the same things at you over and over again. Farming is very janky and very slow, and shaping terrain is an unintuitive pain.
The variety of building materials is still far too limited as well, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

And then there's the elephant in the room: performance and especially the netcode are pretty lacking in areas with a big amount of player-built structures, which can lead to really bad desync when multiple people are around and makes raids an even more frustrating mechanic in multiplayer. It is also missing basic options such as an FoV slider, forcing you to mod the game if you want to change it. All of this despite having sold a ton of copies and been in early access for a long time. 

With that said, it's not an expensive game for what it has to offer and the atmosphere and world there's to explore are definitely an experience worth having.",1658933167,1708528443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I figured I would let Palworld cook a while and revisit a game that’s probably near the end of its early access journey. I bought Valheim in 2021 and played 20 hours of it before I got a bit bored. I return 3 years later and to my disappointment, I cannot find a single meaningful new thing about this game. Sure, the food values have changed. That’s the only thing I notice.

Awful. The combat is just bad. Why the heck do I have to be 1 foot away from an enemy to hit them with my spear?? The movement is janky, the combat is constant. I just really find the gameplay unfun.

Subpar, but its to be expected when you have terraforming, i.e voxel graphics. 
Performance is good on my desktop though, no issues there.

I feel like once you progress past a certain point, there is no real reason to ever return. Like if you’re using metal armor, why would you ever get leather? 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [EA/10] [/b] [/h1]
There are better alternatives out there. I recommend Palworld. I can’t believe after 3 years that I struggle to find a meaningful change. It really feels like the devs took the popularity of Valheim to the bank.

Developed by Iron Gate Studio, this indie gem seamlessly blends survival, exploration, and adventure into a captivating experience that resonates with both casual players and seasoned gamers alike.

From the moment you awaken amidst the ethereal mist of Valheim's procedurally generated world, you're thrust into a realm teeming with possibilities. The first rays of dawn bathe the landscape in a warm, golden hue, inviting you to chart your own course amidst towering forests, sprawling meadows, and treacherous mountains.

Valheim's greatest triumph lies in its dynamic and immersive world-building. Every corner of the map beckons with untold secrets, whether it's uncovering the ruins of ancient civilizations, braving the depths of murky swamps, or battling ferocious denizens of the wilderness. The game's procedural generation ensures that no two adventures are alike, fostering a sense of discovery and wonder with each new journey.

But Valheim isn't just about exploration; it's about survival in its purest form. As a lowly Viking spirit, you must scavenge, hunt, and craft your way to dominance in a harsh and unforgiving land. Gathering resources, constructing shelter, and mastering the art of combat are essential to your survival, and the game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility, ensuring that even newcomers can find their footing without feeling overwhelmed.

One of Valheim's standout features is its emphasis on cooperative gameplay. Whether teaming up with friends or venturing solo, the game offers a deeply satisfying multiplayer experience that encourages camaraderie and collaboration. Working together to build mighty fortresses, conquer formidable foes, and sail the high seas aboard majestic longships is where Valheim truly shines, fostering bonds that endure long after the final boss is vanquished.

Visually, Valheim may not boast the hyper-realistic graphics of AAA titles, but its charming low-poly aesthetic imbues the world with a timeless appeal, reminiscent of classic adventure games. Coupled with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that evokes the grandeur of Norse mythology, the game creates an atmosphere that is as enchanting as it is immersive.

In conclusion, Valheim is a triumph of indie game development, offering a rich and rewarding experience that transcends its modest origins. With its captivating world, deep gameplay mechanics, and emphasis on cooperative play, it stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when passion and creativity collide. Whether you're a fan of survival games, Norse mythology, or simply crave adventure, Valheim is an odyssey you won't soon forget.",1708470842,1708470842,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

They added the option to build with no cost without using the console. No longer does over 50% of the game time have to be tree cutting, an amazing accessibility option for me and fellow tree grinding non-enjoyers. However there is some optimization issues still looming where the fps of a certain area gets much worse the more you ""develop"" said area.

Old review around 2021: 

Awesome game first of all. The lure is interesting. The graphical style is beautiful. The generated world (maps) are always well ""generated"". The sense of progression even though its fully free roam is super satisfying, which is quite hard to achieve so that's a big win for the developers. The building systems are awesome you can make some really nice stuff in the game. The combat and survival mechanics are also decent. All in all its a great game. But two things make this game hard to recommend. The first and most important is the grind. Overly grindy. Collecting metals is ok cause you only need to do it once and never again as long as you don't lose your tool which is difficult, but the trees OH the FUcking trees. If I didn't use console commands to get around the tree cutting I would've not enjoyed the game as much as I did, especially with such a well made building system you can't help but to build massive forts and towns. The tree cutting needs to stop being so grindy for real, its a problem in all survival games and its only worse here. Second thing is play-ability with one player only. You know it and I know it, whoever you're playing with now they'll stop playing midway and you'll be left to finish alone. It feels made to be played with more than one player and makes it sometimes harder to play alone, until b-it-ch like behaviour is eradicated the game should allow better play ability for solo plays.",1627209125,1708441766,True,0,0,0.517184317111968994,2,True,False,True

Optimization. The game runs like trash. It's hard to get a good frame rate no matter what you do if your computer is not the best.

Building and crafting. All the little rules that you have to follow to do certain things can get sooo annoying. Building is a real pain in the ass because of how the terrain works and how the pieces of structures work together as well. It's so stressful for no reason.

Everything else I would say has been a pleasant experience, though. The combat is very hard a lot of the time, but it's fun that way. You will die a lot. But the gods are merciful. You'll come back.

Getting the resources for better equipment and exploring the world while doing so is really fun. The bosses are fun.

Got banned from the forums for ""questioning the moderation"" when asking about if people enjoy the barebones game without mods. Great game to buy if you're cool waiting up to a year for an actual content update and downloading mods (not supported by the way) and having to redownload and fix them every time they push out a localization update. Go to the reviews to see how people honestly feel about the game, the forums are only positive bc the mods delete and ban every negative thing they see.
UPDATE: Just got banned off the discussions for asking if you would vote this game Labor of Love even though it's in EA with a beta branch, it's a joke lol

It's a fun survival game with clear progression, interesting base building, and some decent combat options.  Unfortunately I'd only give it a 6/10 because of one very massive flaw - the stamina system.  I don't know what they were thinking with the absolutely ridiculous stamina drain / regen system.  I'd say that 90-95% of the times I've died in the game were not because the enemy was too hard.  It was because I ran out of stamina. Once you run out of stamina, especially in a swamp or other wet coastal area, you're SOL. Your strong veteran warrior instantly turns into a floppy armed fool who can barely walk. One of the other mind boggling decisions they made was that your stamina doesn't regen any faster if you have 50 stamina or 150.  The farther I got in the game, the more I was standing around waiting for stamina to regen. I can't even use any of the other boss buffs in the game, because the stamina buff is needed more often than not. You can eventually brew stamina potions and such. However, I hate having to grind out crafting materials simply to do something as basic as running around or fighting.

I usually quit Valheim from annoyance rather than boredom.  If they fixed the stupid stamina system the game would be an easy 8 or 9/10.  As it is right now, it's a 6 at best.",1708382253,1708382253,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

It's currently day 280 on my server. I mostly play with my close friend, we've played for around 150 hours. We've only defeated three bosses and most of the time we just hang around stocking up on random shit we probably won't even need. We've got two full chests of Greydwarf eyes, six full chests of honey, 99 problems and progression ain't one. I spent around 40 hours during covid online college lessons just tending to my farm and I now own 1500 carrots. I have no idea how I'm gonna use them all, but I got them. 

I recommend playing this game without being stuck to the wiki page or without consulting your progress with online sources. The sheer enjoyment of exploration lets you live moments which are hardly surpassable by any AAA(A - fuck Ubisoft) game these days.

One small con:
This is the perfect game to play with someone IF you're okay with playing together, or, in my case, I own the server, so I can play alone, but my pal has to play on a different server if he wants to play alone. If there was a way to just share the server on the cloud, that would be so much better, but so far I don't think we have the option.",1616788549,1708375739,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Right now, this doesn't feel like an early access game, it feels complete. I mean I'm sure it has no ""end"" point, no finale, but it has a ton of stuff and a progression system that makes it all very satisfying to earn.

It's a survival game, but you don't have things like ""hunger"" or ""thirst"". Instead, food is tied to your max health and stamina. Meaning eating is essential but not urgent. If you're safely in your base behind tons of fortifications, you can risk not eating and having a small pool of health for a while. It's not amazing, and if there were one thing I'd change it'd be this (I'd rather just treat it as a way to gain more health and stamina regen rather than increasing the capacity).

You slowly build your way up towards the heavier, more durable metals by picking wood off the corpses of dwarflings (trees and moss wrapped around the souls of murderers, fun bit of lore for you) and stone off the ground and crafting yourself and workbench and some basic stone tools, as well as a hut. It's like Minecraft in that sense instead the only trees you can punch down are the really tiny ones. You need an axe of varying strength for the different trees you'll encounter. Same for pickaxes and so forth.

You'll start in the meadows, work your way to the black forest for metals after you've conquered your first boss and proven you're prepared enough, then make your way to the swamp once you've defeated the second boss and gathered yourself a key needed to get your next metal and so on. It takes a while, but with a friend it can be very fun and rewarding. Just setting up your base will take hours of your time and the bit-by-bit construction really serves the game well to allow you to make your own custom homes and fortresses. When you unlock the next sort of base material and accompanying constructions, you'll feel like you've actually earned it.

Not to mention this game is deceptively beautiful. You'll understand when you've actually played it, but the lighting and skyboxes fit in incredibly well with the pixelated 3D art style, the latter of which was a very bold choice, but definitely paid off in my eyes.

I hope the developers keep at this pace. I'm excited to see what's in the upcoming updates. The roadmap looks very good.

Oh and did I mention that as I type this the game is only 1GB (randomly generated and a pixelated art style saves tremendously on space) and it costs just $20? The price is likely to increase as more content is implemented so I can't recommend enough people get in while they can if the game sounds interesting to them. The game's grown up to 5 million players for a reason.

Really, though, get a friend or two to play with and slowly work your way up. Even if you have to make new friends to play it with, it'll be worth it.

------------

It also can't be overstated how good the build system in this game is. It's quick, easy and simple. As opposed to a game like Conan Exiles where it feels immensely clunky.

Everything's attached to your hammer for building and quickly destroying buildings, and while the stability system can get annoying, it's more or less quite sensible and can even be used to your advantage (destroying all supports under something will cause it to slowly break apart as nothing is holding it up anymore; even working for nearly all kinds of rocks and ore found in the game right now, excluding silver, which for some reason resists gravity's force).

You can easily disable snapping by holding down a button (shift) if you need to make some more creative designs or to place something the snapping system won't help with (like a more stable platform by connecting two areas).

It's excellent. I can't imagine ever going back to another 3D game's piece-by-piece building system and not seeing it as a downgrade. Indie developers have more passion and foresight in their pinkies than a hundred triple A gaming developers have in their whole bodies, including the likes of Bethesda.

---------

EDIT 1: Post-Mistlands, I'd just like to say I didn't enjoy that zone. The mist just isn't a fun mechanic to work around. Look, it's hard enough to survive in each new zone when you progress because of how powerful enemies are, but do the developers really need to make it worse by making the mist just so... so... EXTREME?

I'd really rather just not play the zone at all, sadly. Pushing the mist out with tools is really ineffective, otherwise it could have been fun. I mean what good is clearing mist like 5 feet in front of you going to do? Nothing.

Doesn't ruin the game itself, but I hope they think things through better for future zones. Some irritations don't get a pass, I'm sorry.",1615660736,1708306191,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

One thing all of these games had in common was FAIRNESS!!! yeah you COULD SEE THE ENEMIES COMING!!! and after they died THEY STAYED DEAD (usually). Let me explain, at one point in this game I was in the starter biome by the safe coast line and looking to start another base so I cleared out the area of the 3 boars and 2 grey dwarfs and started building. 40 Seconds later 5 more grey dwarfs showed up and the 3 boars I killed less than a minute ago respawned right on top of me. So in the last 46 seconds I had to deal with a total of 11 enemies, 3 of which magically appeared behind me so I had no tactical options or chance of defending myself. This isn't challenge or fair, this is janky crap game design that breaks convention to inflict misery and pain. To add insult to injury the default controls are sluggish and unwieldy, with none of the tight responsiveness of the aforementioned souls likes.

I'm giving it a no because of the developers. I have never seen such a lazy bunch as these guys.
3 years have passed and all they have to show for is a new biom.
The game has a huuuuge potential if they dedicate some time into an actual combat system and if they continue as planned with the rest of the content.

Multiplayer is janky af because the way scaling works. 
the scaling, which I think is really broken and stupid, just for the sake of it. 

If you have people within a 50 meter radius the mobs get higher hp and damage. I'm personally fine with them having more damage, but the HP increase is just absurd.... We play 4, sometimes 5 people. The amount of time it takes to kill a simple mob is just tedious, not even hard.... just takes up a lot of time and that's it.

We found that in case someone dies, all except one of us will leave the area.... This way all the mobs scale down to 1 player HP and DMG. That player clears the area until the dead people can return to loot their bodies.
depends on how many allies/friends are in the proximity. 

All in all the developers have done too little considering how many funds they got at the release.
The community does waaaaay more.

After about an hour I had reached a sense of exhaustion with the Mistlands biome that I hadn't felt for all of the hundreds of hours I've played up to this point. It needs heavily reworked.

It's also annoying that the games progression renders most previous biomes and tiers of recipes obsolete after moving to a new one, there's no real reason to return to the meadows, forest or mountains once their Boss has been beaten. This also adds to the frustration of building, since any base you make becomes redundant, afterall, whats the point of building a cool base miles from the current tier of resources you need?

Fun game, but I'm not gonna recommend because (aside from the problems I've already mentioned) it has the same issue as most Early Access games, content comes out in fits and bursts and feels like you're slamming into a brick wall once you reach the end of the latest patch.

3 years of early access and they've only released 1 major update, the Mistlands. ONE new biome. In 3 YEARS. Sure they've rebalanced a few things and added some items, a new vendor NPCs, etc but how does it not feel like theft for more people?. That's ridiculous for how long this game has been in Early Access. 

I understand that this is a small team but for me, there's no excusing the lack of work they put in this game and I can't shake the feeling that they just cashed in 12 million copies worth of money and just laugh at our face now.

They redirect you to steam, knowing steam won't deal with developer bans.  That shows you the basic customer service of the developers.  Now take into account that made over 12,000,000 sales.  There's 30,000 online.  That's a net loss of some 11,970,000 players.  The majority quit before mistlands released. Millions more quit within days of mistlands release.  

Unless you mod the game it simply isn't worth playing, the developers don't care about their customers.  
The base game is ok to play, but given the latest releases of games like enshrouded, sunkenlands, forever skies, miasma etc.. Valheim is now a has been game.. is it worth returning to.. well that's your decision. 

Given my perma ban, i will always respond negatively to the developers.  I paid to use the forums and banning me because I said this would happen.. is simply unacceptable.  How can any developer hold their heads up having lost nearly 99.7% of their client base.. is beyond my understanding. 

They should be ashamed of the game they ultimately made it's a massive scam overall.  No I don't recommend the game. Many people buy it and quit within days at best a few weeks.

The devs also seem to have a specific version of fun in mind which is not compatible with my own. Had to add mods to do the following:

-Rebind the dodge key (otherwise you must hold down the mouse wheel + space bar)
-Allow you to keep loot on death (server setting max out at keeping equipped gear only)
-Sort loot into nearby chests (recently removed to... encourage engagement with the inventory system)
-Sort my inventory at all

To the devs: if players are not engaging with your systems to a degree you deem appropriate, the systems are *not fun enough to engage with*. Instead of removing a QOL feature, perhaps make the underlying system better. 

Without modding I would not recommend. With mods it's the best survival game currently available and it's not close.",1612742418,1708180478,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This feels more like a concept for a good game rather than an actual good game (as of early 2024 when i played it). I want to like it, because there seems to be a very good core in it, but it feels unfinished and poorly executed in its mechanics. Of the top of my head:

-Inventory management is terrible. Building a ton of chest and then having to find and put to your inventory materials every time you want to craft anything, is tedious and annoying. And i assume that annoyance increases exponentially as you progress and gather more mats/find more crafting recipes. And then if you change/move your main base, gather everything and do 10 trips from old base to new (portals save time, but mats such as minerals can't go through)
-Constantly draining stamina when exploring/gathering is almost never fun, especially in a big map 
-Building is almost good, but it ends up being frustrating cause almost nothing seem to snap into place when you want it to in seemingly obvious build paths (flooring, roofing etc). Also the game doesnt seem prepared to let you build on anything other than flat surfaces, but provides little of them. flattening and and raising ground to create a base area are pure exercises in frustration
-Combat is honestly a boring wait your stamina to fill again game, the enemies behave like 4 year old morons, and the combat mechanics are clanky at best, not working at worst. Even a small elevation fucks up hit boxes
-The progression is tedious af, especially if you have a bad rng map seed and resources/key areas are badly dispersed. Also tons of boring material farming is constantly required
-Meh art style, poor graphics. I dont really care for good graphics for the sake of good graphics, and I am of the opinion that an art style that fits the game matters much much more than fidelity. That being said, i think the game looks like a unity asset flip rather than uniquely designed. 

TLDR: In my opinion, good core concept and base design, badly executed mechanics and gameplay. It seems like a game I would love to play when it's actually done. For now, it feels like an alpha/early beta version.

I will change my rating if the game feels like its evolving, but it has been on early access for years so I unfortunately feel somewhat pessimistic about that

Edit: I know the game is on early access, but it been out on steam for 3 years now, so I think my critiques are fair.",1708175530,1708180369,False,2,0,0.481630086898803711,0,True,False,True

This may be seen as cheating in some people's eyes, but trust me, the grind is hard without mods. This game has problems, but it is still fun to play with friends or solo.

[b]Time Played:[/b] 29 hours (Meadows & Black Forest Completed)
[b]Difficulty:[/b] Normal

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
	- Engagingly brutal survival mechanics keep you constantly on your toes, from gathering resources to building small Viking towns.
	- Seamless integration of exploration and combat, with each procedurally generated biome offering unique challenges and rewards.
	- Co-op multiplayer is almost mandatory and adds a whole new layer of enjoyment, fostering camaraderie and epic adventures with friends.

[b]Story\Dialogue:[/b]
	- No traditional narrative, the lore-rich world and environmental storytelling immerse you in Norse mythology.
	- Minimal dialogue emphasizes the game's focus on progression, exploration and player-driven experiences, allowing your journey to unfold organically.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
	- Surprisingly charming low-poly visuals blend seamlessly with the game's atmospheric lighting and environmental effects.
	- Despite its simplicity, Valheim's art style effectively conveys the game's immersive Nordic setting, evoking a sense of every frame a painting.

[b]Before you Play:[/b]
	- Recommend playing this game with friends where possible.
	- Use a guide to progress otherwise can quickly find yourself aimless and bored.

	- Look around for Map Seeds suited to what you're looking for (eg. Optimisation, Beauty, House Building, Dungeon, Bosses). A mix of all I would recommend is seed: lE0bxYKtaR
	- Character you create and migrate across multiple different campaigns so you don't have to restart progression.
	- Meat focuses on Health (Combat focused), Berries focus on Stamina (Exploration\Mining focused).
	- Different weapons will be better for different enemies.",1708140785,1708145530,True,11,0,0.65083843469619751,3,True,False,True

[h3]Rating: 9/10[/h3]

From the moment my Viking feet touched Valheim's mystical shores, I knew I was in for an epic adventure. This survival sandbox game, developed by Iron Gate AB, offers a beautifully crafted world inspired by Norse mythology, teeming with dangerous beasts, breathtaking landscapes, and the promise of glorious battles.

[h3]Gameplay Mechanics:[/h3]
Valheim strikes a perfect balance between survival and exploration. The game introduces a unique, non-linear progression system that encourages exploration and combat in equal measure. Crafting feels rewarding, and building your Viking stronghold is as challenging as it is satisfying. The game's PvE combat is thrilling, with a variety of weapons and tactics to master against formidable foes.

[h3]Multiplayer Experience:[/h3]
Valheim shines brightly in its multiplayer aspect. Teaming up with friends to raid dungeons, conquer bosses, and build settlements adds an immensely enjoyable layer to the gameplay. The sense of camaraderie in overcoming Valheim's challenges is unmatched. However, occasional lag and server issues can mar the experience, though these are minor setbacks in an otherwise smooth multiplayer setup.

[h3]Visual and Audio Design:[/h3]
The game's visual style is a blend of simplicity and elegance, with a low-poly aesthetic that captivates. The environments are diverse, from dense forests to snow-capped mountains, each with its own unique atmosphere and challenges. The soundtrack complements the visuals perfectly, enhancing the immersive experience of the game.

[h3]Performance and Stability:[/h3]
For an early access title, Valheim is surprisingly polished. The game runs smoothly on a range of hardware, though optimization could be improved for higher-end systems to fully utilize their capabilities. Updates from the developers have been consistent, addressing bugs and adding new content to keep the game fresh.

[h3]Final Thoughts:[/h3]
Valheim is a testament to what indie games can achieve. It offers a compelling, immersive experience that combines survival, exploration, and combat in a way that feels both fresh and familiar. Whether you're a solo adventurer or part of a Viking clan, Valheim promises an adventure worth embarking on. Its minor flaws are easily overshadowed by the vast, beautiful world waiting to be explored. I wholeheartedly recommend Valheim to anyone looking for their next great gaming adventure.",1708080707,1708080707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First, the pros: 
    - The art style of Valheim is absolutely beautiful. You don't need any 4k texture mods or anything to see that.
    - Base building is actually useful and a necessary thing to do in order to advance through the game. The vanilla game already has tons of variety in base building that allows you to spend many hours building.
    - Tons of mods that can help fix some of the quality of life issues in-game.

Cons: TLDR - boring, linear combat. Long grind times to craft/upgrade equipment.

    - After the first boss, the game becomes an absolute grind. You need to collect a ridiculous amount of raw materials in order to craft, then upgrade new weapons. This gets even worse after the second boss.
    - For a game with somewhat soulslike combat, the combat is very unrewarding. Parrying is very easy, and as a solo player, parrying then attacking is essentially the entire name of the game.
    - You can dodge in combat, but there's little to no benefit of doing so. You use about as much stamina as a parry would and don't get the benefit of staggering your enemy and getting a damage boost for a few seconds.
    - Stamina feels like an absolute chore in this game. Your stamina is VERY limited unless you gather/cook and eat certain types of food to boost it. However, even with good food ""equipped"" (3 food slots, hp/staming boost, can only eat one of a food item until it wears out), running out of stamina doesn't feel like a tactical decision/blunder. Unlike other souls-likes, it just feels like an artificial block, especially so against the large mob enemies (troll, abomination). Battling them essentially is: parry, strike x3, parry, strike x3, run out of stamina? Abuse the enemies' poor pathfinding and walk around obstacles trying to regain stamina so you can parry, strike x3 again. To be fair, this gameplay mechanic would be less annoying when playing coop. However, as a solo player, it is devastatingly painful. You can eventually craft stamina recovery potions, but that doesn't change the fact that stamina is so annoying.
    - There is no weapon choice variety in this game. There's three types of non-status damage: pierce, blunt, slash. Pierce are spears/arrows, blunt is for clubs/maces, slash is for swords/axes. Enemies have resistance against certain damage types, so you need to bring all the different damage types to fight against them. However, that's about as complicated as it gets. Bring a blunt type against skeletons/blobs. Bring a pierce type against trolls. Two-handed weapons exist, but are not very useful as a solo player except for AoE attacks. Bows and arrows are essentially useless in solo gameplay except to hunt.
    - Armor variety is nonexistant too. There's either full heavy armor that slows you down, or lighter armor (troll, vine) that protects against certain status effects, or gives a bonus to a certain skill. For context though, by the time you fight the third boss (and that's going to be after dozens of hours of gameplay), there's only three different armor sets to choose from. For different encounters, there's a very obvious and clear choice of which armor to equip.
    - Boss design, while initially interesting, becomes very boring. They're not very interesting gameplay-wise. The first boss, Eikthyr has a somewhat interesting mix of parry-able attacks, charge attacks that need to be dodged, and AoE attacks. Second boss, Elder, is slightly less interesting. Summon normal enemies, summon static enemies, ranged attack, parry-able attack. Third boss, Bonemass, I found to be absolutely bland. Parry-able attack, summon normal enemies attack, AoE poison attack. That's it. Just a bigger HP tank that has both close-up and ranged atacks and can summon other enemies. A very obvious choice of armor to protect against poison status effect. This unrewarding fight after a very long grind for equipment was what made me quit.
    - Lack of vanilla farming. Yes there's mods that you can and I did use to plant and farm berries, but the vanilla version does not. What's the point of spending all this time building up a base if you still have to go on time-consuming scavenging runs for berries (used in stamina-boost foods)? Yes, you can farm some foods like carrots, but many crafting recipes call for consumables that must be scavenged.",1708050366,1708050611,False,4,0,0.522071659564971924,2,True,False,True

I fucking love this game. I got hooked from day one and got a decent amount of my friends to play alongside with me. Building a main settlement with the boys, going out and exploring the procedurally generated landscapes to see what cool sights there are to see and where to set up more settlements in wicked cool areas. Working together to take down big baddies and bosses.
Obviously we know that with early access games, we expect an unfinished product that should hopefully continue to progress and include even more stellar content held to the same standard as to what the game currently has to offer. And yes, I expected there to be a long amount of time needed to polish the rough edges and to fill the game with more riveting content.

But game devs, guys... I know you're probably overwhelmed with the massive amount of praise and players that poured into the game from release, but the speed in which content is coming out is so... soooo... SOOOO unbelievably slow. Remember that 2021 roadmap that was posted like 500 days ago? Ya know, showcasing their planned updates:
Update 1: Hearth and Home
Update 2: Cult of the Wolf
Update 3: Ships and Sea
Update 4: Mistlands
Now of course this isn't paramount, but it's what they decided to present to the players and fans for this game back then.

I'd generally consider myself a pretty patient guy, but dude... Hearth and Home came out literally over a year ago at the time of writing this. And then Cult of the Wolf sort of dropped, I guess? But it was small, forgettable, and not at all up to the same volume of content H&H gave us, so I'm not really sure what to think there. But what I can tell you, is that this game has gone from a sprint, to a walk, and then ultimately to an immeasurably slow crawl. I don't want to burn myself out on this really fun game, so I like to start a new world and character every time one of these major updates come out to experience the game again with more content included to sweeten up every new journey through the game more and more. I've been really itching to play through again, but I have no real reason to until there are some significant additions/changes that will make my next playthrough more magical than all of my previous playthroughs, like the Mistlands update, or the Ships and the Sea update, which has apparently been skipped in preference for Mistlands. Which would be fine, if we weren't all still sitting here, over a year later, waiting for SOMETHING significant to be added to the game after they very clearly have the budget at this point after the huge success of the game from launch, and even after expanding their team to ""speed up"" the development.

I'm probably coming across as overly salty or being unreasonable, and I don't want to deter anybody from playing the game in it's current state if you have yet to experience Valheim. You'll probably love it. But for those of us who have sunk hundreds of hours into it eager for more, the progression of the game is just not satisfying that thirst for more. Like, at all. I understand these things take time, but holy hell... This is a LOOOOT of time to not even come close to delivering on not even half of the roadmap's content.

So yes, I recommend it for the people who haven't played it yet. But for those who have played it and want to get back into it? Buckle up, because we're gonna be waiting an extraordinarily long amount of time for anything significant to release at this sluggish pace that it's going.

So for now, I'm gonna continue to wait and hopefully not completely forget and/or lose interest in the game by the time something new actually does come out, which will probably be months at this point. I'll rescind my negative review when the game devs give us something worth coming back to.

=Edit: *11/13/2022* - I've been really itching to play again, and I've been holding off until Mistlands comes out, but after a long enough hiatus a couple friends of mine wanted to boot it up again, so I finally caved and started up another new save and world. Gotta say, I've actually been having a blast and I've started to remember how I got hooked so easily to the game. I knew I'd start to enjoy it again once firing it up, I've just been hesitant because I don't wanna find myself burning out again before the update we've been waiting so extraordinarily long for finally drops and I look at Mistlands like ""... eh."" Ya know? I'll probably switch this over to a positive review in the near future, because I do genuinely love the game and think people who've yet to play it should play it, I've just been very upset with the sluggish pace in which the game's development has been on top of the game devs silencing negative feedback and keeping pretty mute during this process.

=Edit: *01/09/2023* - Mistlands was a pretty extraordinary update. New biome is challenging and rewarding, more available playstyles, added building variety and crafting stations, just simply put we've finally gotten a sizable update. As you can tell from my review from a couple months ago I was pretty sour with what felt like a hiatus in the game's development. But now here we are with Mistlands making me eat my own words on the quality of the game. It's one of those things where it really does just needs lots of time to curate, and while the time to get refreshing new content does take longer than I'd like it to, the content that DOES drop is pretty fulfilling. After once again completing just about everything you can do in the game, I find myself taking on ambitious building projects and mapping neat sights and biome generations while I now wait for what will probably be the ""Ships and Sea"" update. Which I'm pretty excited for, ngl, and I imagine after a few months I'll grow impatient again seeing how much time I put into the game, but realistically I should be grateful for the game we do have seeing as it's pretty stellar for an incomplete game and just be a bit more patient. Great work on this update, Iron Gate! I hope we can expect another quality update and development progress for the next big one, and I selfishly hope it arrives within the new year; I don't wanna wait another year and a half for it, lol

You will have to do multiple resource runs over multiple in-game days to gather the materials you need to upgrade weapons, armour etc, as well as gathering building materials.  This is due to the short time of day, your weight capacity (which fills up quickly when carrying metal ore etc), your tools breaking and needing repairing, the amount of materials required and the distance you have to travel to get to said materials.

I would imagine playing in a group of 10 people you could achieve this so much faster, and the game feels designed more to be played this way.

Not that you can't play it solo, just be prepared to invest a lot of time into the game due to the slow progression of gathering the materials you need.  I would say this game is probably more worth it if you are into the building aspect of the game, if that isn't something that interests you, you might lose interest pretty fast due to the time investment required to progress through the game.",1707925656,1707925656,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately I don't have said friends so I played by myself and here are my thoughts. Certainly a fresh breath of air in the gaming industry. It solved my ever lasting craving for games like minecraft but I don't think its fair to compare them two as this is good enough to be recognized as its own game. It dwells in mythology which I enjoy but to be honest I don't recall what the goal of the game was, if there was even one. The game is a quite difficult one where it takes many deaths to get a grip on the mechanic and realize just what exactly you are playing. I did really enjoy the combat system and found it was nicely balanced. But many times you are just running because you came across a monster you aren't quite ready to face. Building my base was quite fun also. Exploration felt fulfilling and there were unique items for each biome. But here are my complaints. The game is insanely grindy. I mean in the beginning its not as bad but once you get to the ore stage, Jesus Christ it becomes a chore. I had to install mods that let me increase my carrying compacity because the amount of running back and forth from the ores to your base was ridiculous. I genuinely was shocked at how much time I was wasting just being on the boat going back n forth. Which is why I say its best played with friends because grinding by yourself just isn't that fun and like all things, games are more fun with friends, which is especially this case. Overall its a great game, I would've gone more into detail but its been a while between writing this review and when I played this game so my memory is quite foggy. But yea I mean the hours speak for themselves so while I did enjoy this game, the grinding got to me and made me lose interest.

In 3 years, the developers have not done much.  There's no official creative mode, and the bosses don't scale to the size of your group.  So, if you're a solo player like me, the endgame bosses are ridiculous.  Mistlands is just annoying to navigate even with the appropriate gear/items to clear the mist.  The mist is just annoying.  It makes things more challenging, but not in a fun way.  And, on top of having to deal with the mist, the terrain is challenging with the jagged features and the constant need to jump, rest for stamina, and climb further up a misty cliff face only to find more mist.  It's annoying because it's constant and you can't ever see a large area of the Mistlands from anywhere, and it's a pretty interesting zone.  Less mist would be great or maybe a larger area of effect for the items that enable you to ""see"" through the mist.  Bosses should scale to the size of the group/solo players.

-klimat
-grafika low poły tylko dodaje uroku
-ogromny świat do zagospodarowania samemu lub ze znajomymi (naprawdę ogromny, zasiedlisz jedynie jakiś procent, reszta pozostanie nieskalaną dziczą) 
- możliwości budowania są niesamowite, po domy, twierdzę, wieże, baszty, zamki, schrony itd, itp, model budowania jest niesamowity. 
- mnogość materiałów do budowy
- możliwość zaczadzenia się przy  źle przemyślanej wentylacji pomieszczenia
- można hodować kilka rodzajów zwierząt, zarówno do walki jak i dla surowców.
- walka jest bardzo wymagająca, zawsze brakuje staminy i każde wyjście poza bezpieczny dom to przygoda
- żeglowanie zależne od wiatru to piękna sprawa
- zmienne, piękne efekty pogodowe
- możliwość modyfikacji gruntu

Playing it with my two friends this has been the best experience I've had playing a game in a while. The game has world options so you could customize however you want it, though it is recommended to leave it on default. That being said while I love the building system, the combat and more specifically the death penalty is something I wish was easier or at least more forgiving on default as right now whenever I die I lose some of my skills. The game has a simple skill system 1-100 that increases the skill the more you do it, but dying takes away some of it. By the end of the day most of my skills barely increase and it makes the game very frustrating, specially exploring. Dying means going all the way back naked and having to build more ships or rafts, using your precious time or materials. Other than that the game is amazing. The graffics make the game's atmosphere one of the best I've seen while still looking like a runescape upgrade. Looks good, better than what I've seen from videos. The gameplay itself is intuitive for anyone who's versed in game knowledge, yet there are parts you can get stuck on if unlucky. It's not permanent, but walking around aimlessly gets tedious after a while.

Do you know how you recognize a great game? When you think about that game and what you want to do in the game when you are going to sleep or doing something else. That is what happened to me here. It is a classic survival crafting simulation situated in northern mythology, the graphics are stylized, the music is inoffensive in large doses, all of these are a hallmark of a good game. That said there are a few design decisions I do not agree with.

First of all the constant enemy spawns. When you go into higher tier biomes in your progression to do your resource gathering, enemies will constantly spawn while you are doing that. The spawn rate is ridiculous, for example why cannot I clear the area for my resource gathering at least for a day? There are ways to circumvent the spawns like building campfires/workbenches, but if that is the intended mechanic by the developers, it is horrible I would say.

Second of all the game has a lot of Wurm unlimited/online vibes for those who played those games. Yet you quickly realize that the freedom offered within those game was much bigger, especially while building or aligning surface, Valheim clearly works on a grid system as well as Minecraft or Wurm do, but tries to hide it. It can sometimes get annoying when you are flattening some surface.

Third of all the tutorial. It offers some basic information, but it really does not tell you a lot of things and if I had no background in these types of game, I would have been lost. That said I ended killing first boss while still in my rag tunic with stone axe and ended in Black Forest, where my first base was instantly destroyed by a night raid I had no idea could happen. If this happened to a new player I can imagine they would have quit the game there and then.

EDIT: After playing for a while I have to add to my review that I find skill loss upon death horrible and outdated mechanic. There are two main arguments among people that defend it and I will try to explain why these arguments are mostly self-defeating:
1) You do not want to take risks, because deaths have meaning.
2) You do not need high skill level to finish the game.

Ad 1) First of all it is an exploration survival game, this kills all my excitement about exploration. There is no reason to explore. And second of all deaths already have a meaning, you just wasted however long doing something before you died and then you have to waste 5 minutes or more to get to your corpse. I am sorry, but this already has a meaning, the game just wasted minutes of your time already, what more of a punishment do you want?

Ad 2) Ok, if the game designed around low skill, why have the skills in the game in the first place? If they are not neccessary for progression, they are pointless, right? And if you are saying that people would not feel progression otherwise, then you are basically saying the skills are not pointless.",1701407956,1707761634,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's a great and fun game but Mistlands biome is a disaster. The biggest issue is the mist. The tool that is supposed to clear the fog around the player isn't working well. Whenever you move your camera or you try to run, mostly during combat, the wisplight does not follow you around and as a result, you can't see your surroundings and enemies nearby. Another question are Greydwarf spawning in your base in a workbench radius. Furthermore specific of Mistlands biome where we've got big ground level differences is that you can't deal damage to a creature that is higer or lower than you, but if this creature attacks you, you get damage. The same situation is when we're fighting against Seeker Soldiers, when they do their second attack and you can be clearly hit even if you're behind them. Another problem is cape when a player sits on krave, because some lower parts of the cape are in the water which looks weird.  
In overall Valheim is a great and fun game but these problems that take away the pleasure from playing and are little but important elements that should be resolved before the release of the biom, espescially when it comes to the wisplight. Most of my deaths in the game are related to the malfunction of the wisplight: often, when you move the camera, your angle is covered by a wall of mist because of it. On top of it the optimalisation of the game since last updates has worsened a lot. ",1682000983,1707756549,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

But they've had a massive game-destroying bug going on for 8 months now. 8 months. Basically what it does is revert your world to some prior state, wiping out hours and hours of work you've put into building and shaping everything. Loading up prior saves (which isn't exactly intuitive to begin with) doesn't work. Your world progress is permanently altered. You can bring up the console and enter some godmode commands to help you rebuild everything much more quickly, but it just sapped all the joy out of the game entirely. It's just yet ANOTHER bugged out game where you have to do endless work-arounds to get it to function. All the while you're sitting in dev's discord or their website just hoping for improvements. I'm not doing that anymore. I don't recommend you get sucked into such a fun game only to have everything you worked on be wiped out, unless you have a ton of extra time on your hands.

Definitely could be worth full price for most players, even more so if on sale. Best part is building, wandering and exploring. Loses appeal towards the latter biomes.

The last patch 217.14, added much needed server tweaks but still seems the game could still use some other adjustments, hate the term balance but some enemies seem overly strong. Even with top gear.
Dungeon RNG sucks, one can spend weeks and not find crafting parts. 

This game feels best in the beginning and even up to the midpoint era, which is about 3 of the biomes. The fourth biome isn't too bad but the 5th just ruins the experience. The experience becomes too cumbersome. 
Overall, I got my monies worth with over 200 hours just doing basic stuff and now nearing 500 delving deeper. The early experience left me enthralled and nervous as I trudged thru areas at night time. Definitely can be creepy. Again the overall games concept is a great one. just some parts could be better. Best played with others but solo is possible. 

I don't like the difficulty spikes, hit boxes, and map generation. The base game world generation could use some more options. Land density to sea, mountains, etc. I was hoping the landmasses had a bit more logical layout. Having numerous archipelagos is annoying. Perhaps a slider to make maps adhere to real world layouts? However, games infinite and unique map generation is outstanding. 

I assume modding could make this game one of the best sandbox experiences. I myself haven't dabbled, yet. some point to see the games true possibilities?",1684079366,1707682712,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros: The game is charming, the world is unique and has an interesting basis for its lore. The music and atmosphere are superb. The combat is actually deep and has varied animations, hitboxes, and dodging/parrying mechanics. Each of the weapons feels unique and has different types of damage based upon the type of strike the weapon deals. The enemies and objects all have varying damage resistances and immunities that make different weapons/tools applicable to use. The bosses are cool and use a great slew of mechanics to keep the player on their toes. The resources and progression systems overall have a great linear feel, but the player can certainly skip along this line at multiple points with skill.

Cons: The game is tedious and too punishing. It was bad enough at launch back in February 2021 and holy crap has it only gotten worse. For example, crafting the first club turns 6 lbs. of wood into a 4 lbs. club, ok that's understandable. Later on you have to turn 45 lbs of metal ingots into a 3 lbs. sword, this is absolutely ridiculous. Upgrading these items (especially late game) is even more egregious, in total it takes 120 lbs. of metal ingots to upgrade said sword after the initial 45 lbs to craft it whilst the sword stays 3 lbs., this is beyond arbitrary to the point of being bad game design. The punishment for death in all cases is the dropping of ALL OF YOUR ITEMS every time plus PERMANENT STAT LOSS (unless you have died in the last 10 minutes which incurs a protection from this stat loss, you also get a massive boost to your stats when you retrieve your corpse which makes it plainly obvious that the mechanic is too punishing without some magical bonus being handed out for such a mundane thing). I always contemplate or outright stop playing the game when I die now (since understanding the game mechanics better). The game world is massive to a fault and I wouldn't have a problem with this if you could traverse it quickly and/or it was more fleshed out, but it is not really either. You have to go on sailing trips often that are only really fun for like the first 10 minutes and after that are just you wishing you had a tailwind when you often don't and you just wait for ~20 minutes until you creep along to the destination. This wait is compounded by the fact that some items are arbitrarily prevented from being teleported unlike others (all heavy progression items like ore, metals, and heavy quest items are this way) so you effectively have to go on these tedious sailing trips often until you have totally progressed beyond the reasons that you would even visit the biome (resource collection). Most biomes are difficult enough that setting up a home/retrieving your corpse are difficult to outright impossible to do given the ai's programming to destroy buildings and swarm the player without friendly firing each other. The boss fights are often difficult to locate and start due to the player needing to find the bosses location and often times there will be many biomes in a row where the corresponding boss simply does not exist (Defeating the boss is necessary for progression to the next biome). The devs also have made these systems much more tedious with updates for some reason, Hearth and Home genuinely is a 2/10 update to me, it added some new recipes which are nice but all of the other mechanics it changed just add more tedium/nerfed existing mechanics the player can use. The Mistlands update is the only other major update released so far and it is a 6/10, it's interesting to have in the game but the zone and progression within is bound to an obscuring vision mechanic so you can't adequately progress unless you farm up a certain item to be able to literally see in the biome (and you often times will just be totally blind specifically looking for these materials).

Overall i think this is a great idea executed poorly over time, the devs need to either flesh out the game so that there aren't constant grind/tedium points or work to remove them altogether. The game has sold millions of copies and has had 2 major updates in 3 years, I get that they have a small dev team but cmon, this is a pretty poor performance for the possibility you guys have available to you.",1614449683,1707679072,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game controls like I'm moving a fighting through molasses at all times, if you just sped up the animations it would feel about 10x more responsive.
How slow this game is and how tedious it is are really what kills it. Not only does building a house take you 3 hours longer than it does in minecraft, terraria, the forest (any open world crafting game) but after you build your house you have to maintain it every 2 or 3 days. Is this game a viking exploration game or is it stardew valley where I have to do f'cking chores every day and make sure I pet my cows? Is this game about slaying dragons and sailing ships and finding sea serpents or is it about maintaining a fence around my garden and making sure my little baby viking skin isn't exposed to the elements for too long or else he wont' be able to swing his sword because his hands are too cold and he's whining?
I'm not saying you can't have mundane survival mechanics in a game with open world exploration and grand adventure, but when all I'm working on is trying to fix my house for the 20th time and it actually takes a full hour to repair all of it, that's a full hour that I'm not playing the ""good"" and ""exciting"" parts of the game. Even if I experienced the best parts of this game all the time, the movement, the combat, the tools, the building, everything in this game is in slow motion. I said it's molasses but maybe I should say it's thick honey and your viking is always drunk with mead because 1 weapon swing takes 3 full seconds, drawing and firing a bow takes feels more like firing a musket and takes just as long,  every time you stop or start sprinting there is this weird in between animation that always feels wrong, this game just controls at a glacial pace and much like in any game it's one of those things you just have to experience for yourself. The best way I can put it is that it feels like the game actually has input delay. When I press left click, my axe swings a full second later, that might not be literally true but that's how it feels. When I jump, the game has to process that command, and then the game jumps.
Seriously how do you make an open world survival craft VIKING game, and I don't like it. I don't think you understand how massively you f'cked this game up if I don't like it, by every conceivable metric I should love this game but it's just so poorly made that SOMEHOW a superfan of minecraft and skyrim with thousands of hours in both games thinks this game sucks, because it does, this game isn't for the people who it should be for and that's just sad.",1677594680,1707676408,False,4,1,0.498016387224197388,0,True,False,True

Another one of those games I hated at first but Lubi's persistance and threats made me RE-buy the game after refunding it for being straight up ugly.
Little did I know that I would have to play more than 2 minutes to see the full potential of the game.
Took a ton of screenshots of the sky that I was proud of, but Lubi's rude a$$ always responded with ""meh, thought it was something better"".

I died trying to swim back to my raft, died trying to get back my stuff on the snowy mountain with 10 health, died trying to juke the troll, died getting rolled by a giant log and I died to air.
Lubi probably popped 20 veins playing with me.

Edit 12/11/2021:

Needs more replayablity. Review will remain negative until replayablity improves.

Devs I know you can do it, so if you want to do it, do, and your game will become a classic.


Some ideas - 

1. Villager NPC's with complex needs and settlement building mechanics

2. Player made dungeons

3. complex crafting minigames which effect produced item quality

4. Seasons, advanced weather

5. A living biosphere (plants trees animals etc) which regenerates and expands players can alter through planting/building

6. Various fantasy creature cultures which view specific areas as their territory, have their own buildings, expand their population and construct new buildings, war will other settlements depending on modifiers, Can be interacted with by the player in a broad many ways (trade, politics, mercenary hiring, building commissions).

The combat takes some getting used to, and it isn't particularly deep, but it suffices; and in any case, it plays more of a supporting role to the main star, adventure. 

Valheim is a game about delving into the unknown and then slowly but surely conquering it, making use of the tools, gear, and goods you gather along the way. It rewards you for taking things slow. Case in point: I've played for nearly 250 hours and I still haven't even beaten the 5th boss (I'm getting there, okay?). It was an amazing experience when it first released, it's even better today, and there's still more to come. 

Oh, and the building is like something out of a dream. Everything looks so good, from the most slapdash little fishing shack to a castle forged from iron and stone. Every outpost you create is bound to be unique in some way, whether it be the design of the building itself or the picturesque vista around it. It's just fantastic.

Graphics are ""good enough"", but if you play games like minecraft, you're not that bothered about graphics are you?
Gameplay is satisfying. Cathartic, even.
Starting off in a little wooden shack (often one you stumble across), and building up to a massive stone castle (complete with towers, ramparts, defences) surrounded by farmland and livestock.
Exploring different areas, with different things to find, different challenges to overcome.
Murdering all manner of creatures for resources, or simply for fun.

This is a game with cool,passionate developers who listens to players unlike most games(my opinion).So yeah give it a try.

When I first got the game 3 years ago I sailed the treacherous seas, seeing all that was available to me. Eventually though, the map turned from beautiful completed biomes to vast empty plateaus promising future content to fill the zones of fire, ice and mist. I sailed those seas 3 years later, saw the same biomes, saw the same enemies, and still see the same vast empty plateaus promising more content to come later. In the 3 years since early access launch there has been 1 major content update. The mistlands. It's an interesting and unique biome with plenty to explore. But it is the weakest biome in the game in terms of depth and content. 3 years with a single major update is not enough in my opinion. I understand the small team working on the game are putting in the effort, but it's just coming far too slowly for it to matter. At the rate current development is going we'll likely see the next major patch in early 2025 at best presumably bringing a single new biome and a single new boss along with possibly some new tech to unlock. It to me seems like the developer is struggling to find ways to fit more in and make it seem meaningful. It's reasonable but I hope that we see more sooner. Until then my review stays a negative.

There's no world level timer you're racing against, you can proceed through everything (or not) at your comfort level. It's got a great balance of base ""chores"" you can do when you don't feel like fighting, but easy to access exploration and combat. With the default settings you're never quite ""safe"" because raids can happen at your base any time, but you can adjust those settings as well if you just feel like building something.

If you're just starting, there are a couple mechanics that are easy to miss, most critically that food is a mechanic. You can't starve, but you can't heal without eating. Your available HP and stamina are tied to your foods, so it can actually be more critical to have better food than it is to have better armor and weapons. The other one that often catches people is that progress is biome-based. If you haven't beaten the boss of the biome you're in, you're likely not ready to head to the next one. The hints for what the next biome to go to are a little thin as well, but if you pay attention to what the bosses drop you can usually figure out where you should head next.

At the end of the day, I'd describe it as a viking-themed Minecraft with better combat mechanics, and an amazing atmosphere.

But when I tried to go and get the boar next to them, The whole game crashed, and I lost and hour's worth of progress. I was sure the game saved every time you slept but apparently not. The game runs pretty smoothly on multiplayer and such and I'm very certain this only happened to me because I was using shadow play.  Pretty frustrating cause that boar leather is a pain early game tho, along with the deer hide.  

Also: I've never had issues using shadow play up until this point, so Idk what's up. The game's completely fine though besides this.",1706841249,1707344594,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

First the good stuff: Simple (minecrafty), yet somehow still nice graphics, very good athmosphere, weather is beautifully implemented graphically, good sounds. And the building engine offers many possibilities and is quite comfortable.
The basic game idea is Tribes of Midgard in a 3D engine, which is nice

Unfortunately this game also has massive bugs and problems, that desperately need addressing, but I'm afraid the developers don't intend fixing them. Here are the worst of these:
- Food: In a hungry state you have only 20-30% of your normal hit points and stamina, which is absurd. Imagine soldiers or athletes being unable to perform when they skip a meal once.
- Stamina: Theres too much focus on stamina. Every move decreases your stamina and for the whole gaming experience you are on a shortage of stamina, pausing every couple of seconds. Even with good food, you cannot do continuous tasks without taking breaks all the time. Annoying and doesn't add to fun playing.
- Melting metals: In other survival games you can fill the furnace with enough ingredients, so it will melt on itself for a while and you can go on adventures in the meantime. But in Valheim, you have to resupply the furnace with metals or coal every couple of seconds, which results in a huge amount of time wasted on uninsteresting stuff like carrying coal to the furnace..
- Weather: It is raining 50% of the time. I know of no place on earth, where this is the case. Not even in the northern european regions, where this is supposed to take place. It is just annoying, because it reduces your stamina regen and without stamina you can't really do anything useful.
- Fighting: In melee it's impossible to hit a foe when he is standing slighty above or below you in spite of distance. The hit area of your weapon seems te be almost exactly in front of your avatar, looking up or down doesn't change that. That's an ugly bug in the engine.
- Monster spawning: When you make noise at night, it not only attracts monsters, they literally and magically spawn right beside or behind you. I really miss the consistency of other games like ark, where all monsters have some kind of life cycle with a certain amount of consistency where they move and what they do.
- Monster nests: There are nests, where monsters are spawning. When you kill those, the nest spawns the same number of new monsters that you just killed. So the more monsters you kill, the more spawn. Not only is this some kind of weird game logic, it also displays a lack of any kind of consistency when unlimited spawns in a short amount of time are possible.
- Monster AI: Monsters attack you relentlessly even when they cannot damage you because of your armor. Also very annoying and doesn't add to the experience.

Those are my personal top 8 weaknesses or design flaws. They could be fixed easily with an update or some by more world settings, but overall I have the impression that the developers put a ton of effort into making the game really inconvenient, but they forgot to give the fun aspect of gaming the proper attention.",1707340705,1707340705,False,3,0,0.426407665014266968,0,True,False,True

TL:DR - it's great, already feels mostly complete for an EA game and TOTALLY worth the money

This game is - in all honesty and experience of the many games I have played - the greatest Early Access game I have ever purchased and played. Even when I got it mid-2021, I felt it was almost entirely bug-free for my many hours put in originally, and had a lot of replayability even for an unfinished EA game.

Now, years later, they have made a lot of improvements and finished one of the 3 major unfinished biomes, with boss included. I am currently on a 150hr playthrough with a friend who never really got into it and only made it to the swamp. We have had a blast and still trying to conquer the Mistlands now. I think the devs have done an excellent job. A lot of people still complain about the game being unfinished in only 3 years times, or the original roadmap being quickly changed to represent the huge influx of players, but they don't really deserve the hate. They have continuously worked on the game and been clear and open about their vision and team. Most of the promised content was not removed, but rather pushed back to do the many bugfixes and QoL changes that was required from a game going expectantly viral. And now the next major biome is half way to being complete and hopefully ready to play.

If you ever wanted to play a challenging open-world survival-builder game, this should top your list. Also, the graphic and sound design in the Mistlands and of the Gjall are TOP tier

Se dovessi descriverlo con poche parole potrei ridurre il tutto (male) a ""minecraft coi vichinghi"". Se dovessi essere un pò più onesto e dettagliato di così, probabilmente dovrei scrivere ""Minecraft, coi vichinghi e le bestemmie"". Tante. Perchè Valheim ti mette a contatto con la mitologia norrena, e dopo un pò il P***o Odino ci scappa. E anche Thor, che non vogliamo che il padre si senta solo, senza il figlio.
A metterlo sulla carta, non è nulla di nuovo: una serie di biomi diversi, con difficoltà crescente ed un sistema di crafting molto articolato. Un boss per ogni bioma, tirato giù uno, si cambia bioma e si procede migliorando equip, costruendo una base, nutrendosi di bacche e schifezze fino al boss successivo.
Il punto è che Valheim è un capolavoro.
Nel tempo ho sentito molta gente criticare la grafica, le musiche, mia nonna e tutta la nazionale di curling canadese del 1987.
Le critiche rivolte a questo gioco andrebbero considerate come supposte e quindi lasciate dove solo le supposte devono stare. 
Mi sono sempre definito come una escort dei titoli di crafting, non appena ne esce uno anche solo vagamente definibile come ""decente"" la mia compulsività prende il sopravvento sul mio conto corrente ed ecco che qualche centinaia di ore della mia vita se ne va per scegliere quale materiale sta meglio in cucina.

This game's design is almost perfect. Progression is almost perfect and makes perfect sense. I honestly don't remember a game where design and progressions are thought out almost as good. 

A piece of advice: get to wiki, youtube videos, etc. only when you're out of options completely or completely lost. A huge chunk of the game fun is discovering / experiencing game yourself.

Valheim can be challenging, but it's never boring. Building / farming / taming animals is nice activity that compliments major gameplay nicely. Building stuff is one of favorite aspects of this game. You can create pretty amazing things with quite limited tools you're given - and as a result you get attached to your creations way more than one'd expect. Also, ability to attach almost anything to walls / horizontal spaces - I'm talking about weapons / armor and especially trophies collected from killed monsters give this construction additional layer of personalization and connection to the world. Just pop a troll head to some unexpected area and you'll have a nice memory every time you pass it ;) 

'Raids' can be quite a fun challenge if you're not prepared; when mobs destroy your tamed animals farms you feel devastated and experience emotions you'd never thought you can experience from a videogame. You get attached to this world, to your home / bases in a very special way. Not a lot of games can achieve that.

The most amazing feature of this game is ability to generate stories. You'll get your own stories in no time, but here are couple of mine:

1) Went to find a first swamp which was absent on my home continent and saw some tall trees in water from a distance; decided to park in nearest 'meadows nice-looking abandonded village' nearby. Once disembarked I ran across 'abandoned' house and faced draugr archer with his friends - this village as I later figured had 3 draugr spawns in houses. Killed in 2 shots (first meeting with draugr) - and it was quite a challenge to swim back to that spot almost naked on a raft for 2 in game days (and in the middle of the night) (!) and get my stuff back.

2) First swamp visit is quite memorable, but it was especially memorable for me: got into a first crypt and crypt spawned 2-star archer out of pile which I didn't spot in time. He killed me almost instantly. 2-star archer is very OP - it took me quite a time to get my bronze-age top-tier stuff back.

3) First fight with Bonemass was quite a memory. I've died too close to my 'house' right next to swamp; my favorite base at that point of the game and waking up naked to blobs and skeletons running around your bed while Bonemass is destroying half your house while you try to hysterically get some of your stuff from your grave is one of the things I'll never forget.

....

There are few more stories like that; but without a doubt this game captured something special for me. It's not a game, it's an experience. You might find something similar in another game, but for me, honestly it's unprecedented. I don't know for how long I'll be playing that but it's amazing deep experience like no other no one should miss. Will be interesting to see what they'll do with a game once it's fully done.

It's by far the least amount of fun this game has to offer, the enemies you fight are also subpar in comparison to the rest of the game. I dont have an itch to scratch anymore that this game used to have because of it.

Meadows - 10/10, its cozy, not much else to say, its pretty much perfect
Blackforest - 10/10, gives you slight intimidation with the trolls roaming around.
Swamp - 8/10, getting iron is a bit of a hassle, you pretty much need a mod to make it less so.
Mountain - 9/10, i hate the wolves, but its very satisfying mining silver and the cold debuff is interesting.
Tundra* - 6/10, Fulingar are HARD hitters, i think the difficulty curve drags down the overall score
Mistlands - 1/10, i wish this was done better and with ghosts and fairies instead of bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs and bugs.

(*forgot name of it, the one that fulingar resides in)

If i dont take into account mistlands exists, then this game can be really cozy to play and its really fun to try and build a cool base and terraform the enviroment to your liking, its also fun to fight some of the bosses, i still think the deer boss is the best boss by far.
Finding materials, upgrading your kit, its just so much fun and checks almost all the boxes, so far everytime i started to play the game ive spent 200 hours in it, and i was thinking of a 3rd ""playthrough"" but then i remember mistlands and the want kinda sort of fizzled out....

Enjoyment score without mistlands is 96%

THE GOOD:
- Great learning curve allows a beginner to gracefully build up their skills and knowledge. Especially impressive for an indie title!
- Resource gathering activities, like tree chopping and hunting, are detailed in their execution and consequently much more interesting than is typical for a resource-gathering game.
- Making buildings is fun and intuitive. You encounter lots of derelict buildings, which give you ideas on how to build. Your choice of location and how you build has a huge influence on defendability. It also looks really cool.
- Super fun to play with friends! This reduces grind and creates fun experiences. Like that time my friend wanted to save time by not bringing the raft back to base. I ran to base, being chased by a troll the whole time, and I returned to my friends in time to see the raft get destroyed and both friends killed! Hilarious!
- Or that time we hurried to sail away due to perfect winds and accidentally escaped an ambush by seconds, sailing away with a horde of enemies chasing us in the water.
- Combat is interesting and tough--requiring skill. 
- Beautiful graphics, low polygon count and textures notwithstanding. Sunsets, and sailing on the sea are particularly breathtaking.
- The weather is amazing. It feels really primal!
- The Viking theme is well-researched and well-executed. It really feels like being in a magical Viking afterlife!

THE BAD:
- Grind, especially those boars are a bore (can be mitigated with world settings and multiplayer)
- It wasn't immediately obvious to me that you ""pick up"" stuff by interacting first, then walking over it to pick it up. I find it kind of annoying. It's a bit of friction in an otherwise smooth resource gathering process.
- Death comes easily, and by default it's quite punishing on your skill gain (again, this can be mitigated somewhat by your world settings).

THE UGLY:
- We've had occasional network issues when playing multiplayer, with being unable to connect to a friend or a friend being disconnected often.
- The Depth of Field setting makes the game very blurry. It gives a kind of surreal feeling, but at the cost of causing me headaches. Fortunately, you can disable this in the game's graphics settings.

Update:

After 200 hours in, I still love this game. Yes, it is quite a lot of grinding. Especially if you're like me and like to take your time and level up so you don't die that much. I think that most people make it through the game in 40 hours, but I'm still just at (latter part of the) the swamp. I did re-start at the last time I reached the swamp, so now I'm at least past that.

The game would really benefit from the development team growing by a few people. Not multiplying, but at least 20-50% (I've heard they're less than 10 people) so the development progress can speed up a bit, without losing the feeling of being a small, indie developer. 

Pros:
* The atmosphere is amazing.
* Great music (I still have it enabled).
* Nice and effective graphics, they really contribute to the atmosphere.
* Fun building mechanics
* Food and recipes
* Good fiends and foes

Cons:
* Repetitive and ""too empty"".
* Needs more varied enemies. A lot of grinding and killing non-threatening enemies when harvesting and gathering. There more of a nuisance than a threat.
* Clothes/armor really needs separate slots (you're not carrying what you're wearing)
* Textures and models could be a bit more detailed and ""beautiful"", while still retaining the atmosphere and retro-feel.
* Extremely slow pace of development.

The early game was fun up to Eikhtyr bossfight, and after which the pacing of the game massively halted on the copper grind, which not only takes a long time to mine a node, it also takes a long of time to transport and process. Having to haul ores bit by bit is not really fun and a good way to spend your playing/relaxing time.

Inventory system is not that much better either in my opinion for two main reasons: weight limit and dedicated slots. Having previously played on a modded client, it quite surprised me that armors don't have a dedicated slot, instead they take your inventory slot as normal, and reduces the variety of items in the inventory at once. Having inventory limit although encourages the use of other transporting method, but with it being static limit and the amount of ores you have to haul and how tedious the entire transporting process is, I'm not a fan of, it doesn't scale very well to the late game.

Having first couple of worlds I played got a very far elder spawn, I'm not really a fan of spending 20-30 minutes of just travelling and sailing, and probably die later on and losing everything you have. Portal could be nice as a shortcut, but evidently falls from being a permanent travel solution whenever you start needing to haul more ores, it feels just like a band aid solution for travelling very far distances (granted they're not being destroyed by some enemies around there).

Dying in this game induces a lot more stress than what's necessary, losing your items is a very common trope for this kind of genre, but when losing everything, including equipments and gained levels it really feels too harsh just for sake of it. This effectively makes secondary/backup equimpents important and thus increases the amount of grind required.

Progression, outside the scope of equipments, really lags down compared to what you encounter later on. Having character getting better solely on food system, although interesting at the long run seems just an unnecessary chore to source a good food just to be able to survive the later encounter. This also ties to character's stamina bar where it just takes forever to get back up and drains super fast especially when encountering a slight bumpy hills.

Having said that, I do like some stuffs on valheim, mainly its relaxing scenery at the early games with dynamic weather adds to the feel for enjoying resting time after a day worth of work (exclude the grinding part from here). The building system is also fun to mess around, creating a beautiful houses and places with its smoke system something to bear in mind, adding flavour on top of the basic build mechanics. The combat, outside of stamina draining super fast, is very fun to mess around, with a satisfying parrying mechanic and feedback as well to spice it up even more.

In conclusion, for me Valheim is very tedious to play and that really is a massive killjoy on my part. It has a good basis for a good game, but issues I mentioned earlier prevented it to be one, if you want to play Valheim for a relaxing time I heavily suggest using some QoL mods (and just mod it to oblivion because why not) and probably get some friend to accompany you on your journey too.

I can not award Valheim my [b]DANGEROUS GAMES, DO NOT PLAY[/b] category, as at the end Valheim doesn't make me don't want to play it because it'll make me lose the sense of time, but because I kept being reminded on how tedious it is.",1707072031,1707072031,False,3,1,0.495901226997375488,0,True,False,True

While I love exploring the vast open world; I find it to be pretty much empty. Outside of finding some neat landmarks for base building. Each biome offers little incentive to spend much time in it. Basically, grab what you need to progress and move on... With occasional trips back to restock certain items used in new crafting recipes. 

Crafting is pure grind. Nothing more. I while I don't overall mind grinding; I do find it excessive in specific areas like metal working. Everything past Bronze requires too much. Farming is just painful. Both the planting and harvesting are tedious as they have to be manually done each time. I usually find myself hating the whole process; which is not what you want from a core game mechanic.

Combat is passable. However, not being able to hit anything on a level above/below you is trash. 
This also plays into movement where your character can't even step over a slight bump... You literally have to jump over everything; which can cause you to get stuck if too close to an object.

The enemies are nice and varied from a design perspective. However, they are swarmy and might as well be laser guided. Their aggro range feels way to big. This wouldn't be a problem if your movement was more dynamic and sneaking was a thing... You won't notice this in the Meadows, but starting from the Black Forest on you will be hunted endlessly. It's extremely tiresome. 

I think my biggest gripe is the Inventory system. To survive you need equipment, gear, and consumables (3 types of food, potions, etc...). All of these take up an inventory slot; outside of whats placed on the hotbar. At least armor and accessories should be worn... At least allow the crafting of bags to add space... but nope. This crap system negative impacts the exploration & survival angle of the game. 

I want to explore... but 2 minutes of doing so means my inventory is packed. Especially, after getting swarmed by enemies. Limited inventory space also negates weight limits. It even nullifies the strength belt bought from Haldor. Because you can either carry heavy stuff or lots of stuff; not both.

I just keep finding negative cycles like this in Valheim... which makes it feel overall tedious and un-fun.
Despite my reservations, I will probably continue forward till I reach the Mistlands... But from what I've read it won't be enjoyable.

Maps do not have the higher level ore spread out across the biomes. You can find biomes with no ore at all or worse no mines. You can waste plenty of time searching these areas to come away with nothing. 
There is a slight work around. You can get a new map. But I have found that most maps have a feature you may like and switching to a new map will not have that feature. For me it is the land. You can work a land and start to set up a base only to find that the map is missing runestones or mines. The inconsistency of resources is most upsetting especially if you run into problems at the higher levels. There are some work around such as playing 2 or more maps. Any resources on your person you can carry over to the other maps. For stronger mobs that come and destroy your base, you can build up or dig your ground level around your camp. I do use this, but I dont like that I have to rely on this. If you dont, there is no real defense other than you and you can have a good portion of your base destroyed after spending hours building it. 
So the game is a good concept but the dynamics of the game make it difficult to stick it out. I have stopped often and tried coming back later. The updates seem to improve some things and then introduce more difficult things making those improvements meaningless. 
Lastly, if you want advice on the community boards be prepared to have your post closed due to rude responses. Then you may have one of your posts deleted due to your pointing out the rudeness. Meanwhile, those rude posters continue to post. I am in the game, hoping it improves, but I cannot recommend it to someone else. If you try it, beware.",1616128540,1707027695,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The building system is extremely frustrating. Why is placing items and deleting misplaced blocks tied to my stamina, it makes the whole experience more frustrating than it should be. Also good luck trying to make a flat plot of land if you don't want to spend 20 minutes walking around with the hoe attempting to smooth out little holes that just wont go away, and yes of course this takes my stamina too.

Honestly the whole stamina system is frustrating, I feel that all I do is stare at the little bar waiting for it too fill up (even after getting level 30+ on most skills) no matter where or what i'm doing. 

Then there's the progression. I feel like just as soon as a finish a set of armour, or make myself a new level of tool, it's outdated. This wouldn't be so bad, but the fact that I cant teleport with ores makes the whole process of upgrading to the new cool material feel like a complete slog. I'm on my first play-through and the idea of upgrading my gear just feels like a massive chore instead of a goal to progress towards. Shouldn't players be excited to see what comes next?

Could be a really good game, but everything you do takes twice as long as it probably should, and there are some very frustrating game mechanics (looking at you Haldor).",1707006902,1707006902,False,4,0,0.516320586204528809,1,True,False,True

You can either relax and collect materials/build a base or go into more challenging areas to fight some enemies or biome bosses. Combat is very simplistic, but not too bad.

It is a grindy game of course; you need to collect different materials and upgrade your equipment to progress in the tech tree; but the atmosphere of the game makes the task enjoyable. 

Props to the developers for (mostly) respecting the player's time and not creating too many mechanics that result in useless busy work (e.g. you recover 100% of building materials when disassembling stuff, instead of being taxed for changing plans).

The Base building and craftig is amazing, the grind for materials is just the right amount and enemys are at first very scary, but with time you learn how to be a real viking and slay them :D 

To play with friends in the world of valheim is  one of the most amazing experiences i ever had in gaming. I will never forget how it was to slay each boss for the first time for example or when we searched for the next material to make better armour.

My only ""negative"" comment  is about the mistlands. In my opinion, the mist is just very irritating and not fun to move around in. I hope maybe with a future update it will change, or you unlock a not so misty version when you slay the boss for this area or something.

Valheim is a really great coop survival experience, and it most notably is only about 1GB in size despite its seemingly enormous game world and content. It owes that fact to its timeless, low-poly, yet amazingly beautiful graphics and really good game optimization. It also has a really nice soundtrack, so you'll probably appreciate a lot of the aesthetics if you try out this game.

Something to note however, is that the developers' intended experience actually hurts the game in my opinion. You drop your entire inventory and lose a lot of skill progress on death. Anytime that you go mining for ores, you're forced to transport it by boat travel or by cart, and not through any portal system that you create for yourself. Luckily, there are a lot of world options you can change to mitigate or turn off restrictions that make the game feel overly punishing. The only problem that sort of persists is the fact that metal requirements and craftables get really expensive as you start upgrading them.

Other than that stuff, this game is really fun. There's a very rewarding sort of dodge and parry type of combat, and there are 6 bosses and main biomes for each of them, and there's a great base building element to the game that makes all of your progress feel really substantial in comparison to games like Minecraft where you could be the richest man in the world, and yet your only mark on the world is the two shulker boxes in your ender chest and a dirt hovel you built on Day 1. 

Also note: a lot of players are pretty frustrated about what this game COULD be, and they let that discount what this game actually is at the moment. This game is an early access game that started several years ago, and it has a fairly large amount of content that even I haven't gotten around to with the people I play this game with. The developers manage this game across two platforms, Xbox and PC, and add a major update semi-annually. I won't lie and say that the progress on the game is all they could be managing, but I don't think the heavy criticism of the developers is really fair. If you don't want to buy this game when its on sale, check back in a year or two if you can remember this game and try it out.

I played on default settings starting out and played purely by myself because games like this I do solo.
So I'll just make a list
- Stamina usage for mining/chopping trees (Really? Is this really needed?)
- SLOOOOOOOOOOOOW AS FUCK progression, which in part is due to the weight system and logistical limitations with not being able to teleport ingots. (Low key fuck you developers, Yes I know the cart exists but sure people like choosing the inferior option only via force) 
- The annoying food system that if you have time still on an item eaten, it degrades the benefits with time per the scale it's gone down. Some times of which you can't eat again and refresh your bonuses.
- inconsistent feelings of peace around base, you'll get annoying raids early on but then no raids for weeks? (in-game time) Does it have shit to do with killing the area boss? 
- Slightly annoying slow health tick system even if you have good food in your system, but Wet! and Cold! bullshit. Yeah I'm cold with a leather cap, Bronze Chest plate and troll leather pants, and a new addition the deer skin cape!


Fuck you otherwise for somehow being in a spot where I give it a thumbs up. I don't know why either. I do like Norse/Viking shit. But that wasn't enough to be the reason why I approve it.


ADDITIONS! As I figure/remember/run into them!
- You need a fire next to your bed to sleep in it? Another lowkey, fuck you devs. All the abandoned houses in the game NEVER have them in the house...
ANOTHA ONE - No storage in the 2nd boat you can build, the larger one, once again fuck you for having all this space aboard but no storage, really trying to fuck the player and you can't build chests on it.
Actually you know what, this is the one that is gonna make me turn my vote down. You give people 2 options of sea travel but don't make the more expensive option... better than the raft? Are you retarded? What is it faster and I don't know? If so oooooo faster... As if I already don't walk away enough from Star Citizen in travel when I need to. But for the most part? Devs? When you spend extra resources to build the better option... it usually in other games comes with this thing called perks?
- Work bench just NEEDS a roof... ah yes. Because without a roof you can't stand at your bench and use it for some retarded reason.
- You need a work bench to build something as simple as a standing torch.... it's a torch.
- You can't plant trees just... anywhere, you get hit with the retarded. ""Use X seeds on what?""...... the fucking ground?
- Bow arrow speed is dog shit, and so is the trajectory. Tell me you've never fired a bow without just saying it. I don't expect it so be realistic from when I used to own a compound bow but how about faster than the speed of a crop dusted fart?
- You need a crafting station around to tear down random structures for material, yeah I need a bench to run a hammer through some random shit. Imagine in real Nordic times where they would pillage an enemy village and in order to destroy their homes they had a team of guys around that would be like ""ight let us build these work benches around in a close enough proximity to your homes so we can use this hammer to destroy your homes. Cool? Cool.""

JESUS THIS GAME MAKES NO SENSE AND HAS ANNOYING SHIT.... I'm gonna beat it then drop it.

Holy shit it doesn't end
- If you don't have a roof over some build structures, it automatically degrades with weather. Like oh? some shitty looking thatch roof is gonna be the magical shield to it? So much for exterior walk ways up against you defense walls unless you want to repair it every day making it an annoying chore. No Useful bridges near your base unless you wish to WASTE EXTRA WOOD on adding a roof!
*sigh* - You can't teleport with FINISHED ORE INGOTS... Raw ore I get...Finished Ingots? You brought them back to base and cooked them... I don't know what other insult I can say to just...this is sad..and pathetic.
- Tanning rack is too expensive for what it's worth. 20 leather scraps and 5 Deer skins when you just need.... one? This ties into progress and gets really annoying when you want to build multiple. Yay! Grinding!
- Building a PROPER dock for your ship is difficult with the structure stability system and then being unable to put posts in the ground underwater..

Wow I'm turning this into a novel with how many retarded limitations there are.

- Is a log rolling at you at the speed of a dead slug? Rolling at you at 0.00001 m/s? and it tickles your hair? GOTTA TAKE DAMAGE! It's never killed me but... fucking why?
- How many times I can already foresee in the future that you're going to need to re-build your base PURELY because of the teleport limitations and ore bullshit. Ah yes, I got done with the 2nd boss and I'm gonna love rebuilding on a separate island doing the same shit, especially grabbing a whopping TWENTY LEATHER SCRAPS AND FIVE DEAR SKINS MULTIPLE TIMES for the skinning station. WITH THE LOW SPAWN RATES WHEN YOU ACTIVELY GO HUNTING FOR THESE FUCKS.
- Do GreyDwarfs really ""patrol"" this fucking frequently? When I'm building a hut in a black forest? Every 2 fucking seconds a group of this annoying, easy to deal with, so why are you wasting my time, piss ants come to bother me. You know in games there is a time for combat and a time to get base building done. Let me fucking get my shit done to where I don't have to stop and be inconvenienced by rejects that are so easy to deal with even in groups I'm still running a flint knife for them.
- I was up fighting all night, these socially rejected, won't stop riding my dick GreyDwarfs, they kept me up all night to where I couldn't sleep in my just finished small shelter so this is yet another survival game that can't comprehend humans are capable of sleeping during the daytime. Like Sons of the Forest which is and even worse because SotF is straight up ""My friend put me through this game"" energy.

How the fuck do people praise this so much with so much annoying shit?

Chapter 4

- I clipped myself in one of my own walls without any gear via a door and I'm stuck here with no way to kill myself.
- If you actually reach jump 100, and you jump to a slightly lower location, even by a few inches, you take fall damage. Glad you can rank up and get better skills that help you but hurt you if you dare use them.

This game will hate you too if you let it.
So everyone has already covered the sucky but somehow epic beauty of the graphics and 
the hauntingly enchanting ambient music so i don't need to reinvent the wheel... but you will,
because when you begin you will be a naked cave man who needs to learn how to put a rock on a stick just to get more rocks and sticks!
But after much banging of rocks and sticks and hunting of pigs and lizards and deer and dying and fighting little annoying stick things who just keep showing up and dying and finally fighting a big nasty stag guy...
you can now break BIGGER rocks....yay!
Oh and you can get better sticks too.
So with confidence! you build yourself a mighty unassailable FORTRESS!!!  Or you try too in amongst the constant harassment from every living thing that comes within sight... and the constant need to go out for more rocks and sticks.
But finally you achieve this humble goal and it is tested and it works and you are PROUD!
And in your pride you build a boat and you set out to explore new lands far far far away.
And you die....far far far away.
And you proudly and foolishly and lets admit it damn stupidly, try to retrieve your corpse
cos it had all that nice stuff on it...and you die...and again....and again
And then, your skills having taken an embarrassing kick to the squidgee bits you finally 
give up.
this is where I'm at...  I take consolation in still having my unassailable fortress.

Pros : Devs are constantly working on the product, observing and taking feedbacks.
 World settings can be adjusted to change the difficulty / experience.
 Large world to explore by land or by sea in a awesome atmosphere. ( Wish it would be possible to harness the storm and use it at will, it would be a nice ( team ) combo with some other power ... )
 Each biomes bring some challenges and unique dungeons, be ready to die often if you are not well equipped and well fed.
 Buff from comfort and food, no starving to death. Tho you'll probably end up breaking your legs more often than not.

Cons : Magic is still being developed. Could use more things to spice it up, like runes and more wards of some sort.
 No ways of searching for a tool in the list / no sorting order in the tool list.
 No tunneling - playing with the lay of the land can be clunky.
 Building is satisfying but can be tricky when it is related to being stable and height /  type of material used.
 Can't load the chariot on to the large boat as to make the travel more efficient ( due to collision dmg. )

 After many hours of grinding and defying death to conquer the lands beyond our farmland, friends and I have found a second wind in the game by building a fighting arena, a maze and some jumping puzzles. This is a gem.",1697514261,1706905957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It started out as a fun challenge, but as of today it turned into, well...hatred. The current final biome called Mistlands, is, simply put, a headache and not worth the time sink of effort the game requires just to explore it. You work the whole game through to this point, and I do mean work as that's how it'll feel at that point, while exploring beautifully detailed and sweeping landscapes, only to find yourself in the final biome where you can hardly see ten feet in front of you and constantly being one step away from falling to your death -- even after obtaining the Wisplight. 

The default exp penalty for dying is truly punishing, guaranteeing excessive amounts of play for little to diminishing rewards. Bad corpse runs, even with the buffs, can lead to great loss of skill that will take hours of play to replace the further you progress. Even turned down, it still hurts to die.

And as to the crafting system, there is no consistency...at all. They can't decide on spelling, nor the organization of items either by alphabetical order, biome, or type. Get ready to hunt down new recipes in the long list of craftables. You will receive a heads up when you acquire new recipes, but if you're in the heat of battle you'll be combing through lists later trying to find them all.

Should you still be intrigued to play, here are a few tips: 
 - Turn down the exp penalty, you can turn it back up later even on your current map. Like, turn it way down....
 - Make a lot of trunks, for everything. I mean it, make so many trunks you get a headache. Between the pile of backup gear you'll need and the sheer amount of resources you'll obtain, make lots and lots.
 - Build your base by water so you have a rubbish pile spot that you and everyone else won't be running over and recollecting them because there is so much garbage in this game it takes the cake.
 - If your mining and you get attacked, don't think you'll be switching to your weapon quick, it will take a couple seconds of inaction before you can make the switch.
 - Check that the split stack you make actually split the way you want and you didn't just get 1 instead of 10.
 - To ensure your whole farm field is plantable and you're not missing an unseen spot that will later frustrate you, go over your chosen space multiple times with the Cultivar. Oh, and the headlamp item as you'll find yourself planting in the dark 90% of the time.
 - Be careful chopping trees, when the one comes down it can take half the forest with it, along with any berry bushes that will not grow back.
 - Do a food check on yourself often as you start with 25hps and that's all you'll have unless you eat, which the food bonus diminishes over time leaving you with 25hps in high level areas. Corpse run!
 - Good luck, you're gonna need it.",1706905554,1706905554,False,3,1,0.480069339275360107,0,True,False,True

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for her. I remember seeing her playing it from time to time, the message indicating that she'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that she was enjoying my gift.
Last September she committed suicide.

After everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up her computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Valheim
She had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. She had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of loot. It was only then did I see just how much she loved my present. No other game she played quite captured her affection as much as this one. None of her friends really knew about it, however; it seems like she preferred to keep it to herself. Like it was her own little bit of heaven she could turn to whenever she wanted.

And because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.

I cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (I'll often find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours. And now, I play for even longer with my friends, each of us dedicated to our desired jobs.

The game itself is a Open World Base-building Survival type game set in a Viking Fantasy setting, where the player starts with nothing and crafts the basic items by finding sticks and stones laying on the ground. 

The player eventually scrounge enough mats to craft a workbench which enables crafting more advanced tools and weapons and then, when player has crafted and upgraded their armor and weapons, proceed to beat several Boss entities in each of their respective Biomes.
You might want to craft a second pair of each, when you die, you drop all your equipment and need to go get it back, and kill whatever killed you when you were possibly fully equipped.

Still a pretty neat game, very immersive environment and gameplay, the music is the best you could hope for, it really sets the mood right.

I actually like some parts of the gameplay, specifically building, but the ""souls like"" inspiration feels half baked at best, because most souls like games have a plethora of complementary mechanics to ensure combat feels dynamic and fair, while still brutal. 

 In Valheim, or as I call it, ""Watch the Stamina Gauge Fill Simulator"", everything demands stamina: building, running, jumping, attacking, blocking, archery, gardening, etc. But for some reason, instead of making this vital resource replenish fast enough to keep the action going, the devs moved much of its regeneration rate to buffs: food, potions and a rested bonus. Since the stamina gauge starts at a measly 50 points, this means the player will constantly stop what they are doing because big tough viking is tired. While not necessarily something game breaking, it was annoying enough to me that I installed some mods to make it less impactful.

 Another turnoff for me were the instakills. Valheim has a knack for killing the player intantly even if they are being careful and planning ahead (looking at you deathsquitoes), due to how some enemy spawns work and the lack of balancing for their attacks and attack patterns in singleplayer mode. The boss Yagluth is a prime example of this: there is almost no time frame between his attacks, all of which deal heinous area and overtime damage, making melee builds impossible to use even with good armor and fire resistance.

The above problems are further compounded by enemy detection that works via GPS. If the player tries to build, mine, chop wood or is engaging an enemy, others will spawn nearby and 
 join the fight, potentially leading to a snowball situation in which the odds are so stacked against them their only options left are to run or die. This happens ALL THE TIME, so something as simple as setting a basic shelter or gathering wood takes way longer than it should. 

 All in all, I don't dislike Valheim but I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone looking for a fair, balanced game. It can be very engrossing at times with its beautiful visuals and lands to explore, but absolutely infuriating due to poorly designed combat and resource mechanics. I'll return to it after it's been updated some more.",1706885776,1706886295,False,5,1,0.521975994110107422,0,True,False,True

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Oh, Valheim, you magnificent Norse masterpiece! This game has turned my living room into a Viking saga filled with hilarity and unexpected tree-related accidents. Let me just say, if I were a Viking, I'd be the one known for building a majestic log cabin... on top of myself.

First off, the graphics are so good that even Odin would be jealous. I mean, who wouldn't want to embark on a perilous journey across a beautiful, procedurally generated world filled with stunning landscapes and low-poly deer that just want to boogie?

The crafting system is so intuitive that I'm convinced my character is secretly a master chef. Forget battling mythical creatures; I'm out here creating culinary masterpieces with the precision of a Michelin-star chef. Move over, Gordon Ramsay, there's a new Viking in the kitchen!

Now, let's talk about the combat system. I've never felt more like a Viking warrior than when I accidentally threw my weapon into the ocean while trying to impress some sea serpents. Who needs weapons anyway? My fists are my truest companions on this wild journey!

But let's not forget the real star of the show – wood chopping. I've chopped down more trees than a beaver on a caffeine high, and I've got the deforested landscapes to prove it. If tree-felling was an Olympic sport, I'd be the undisputed champion with my gold medal made from recycled wood.

In conclusion, Valheim has become the epic saga of my virtual Viking life. From accidental drownings to tree-chopping escapades, every moment is an adventure filled with laughter and unexpected mishaps. So, grab your mead, don your finest loincloth, and join me in the world of Valheim – where even the most tragic mishaps turn into legendary tales!

1. The game is extremely padded to make up for its small amount of content without using console commands thanks to its heavy handed grind for the same reasons everyone else brings up.

2. The gameplay loop gets stale after the black forest. The gameplay loot consists of 15 minutes preparing everything for a journey to another island, 20 minutes to an hour of sailing to new biome, setting up a base, looking for a node and mining resources for 20+ minutes, another 20 mins to an hour sailing back to the base with your upgraded crafting tables so you can craft new stuff, doing the previous 2 things multiple times so that you can get the armor necessary to fight the biome's boss, and then doing the same thing over again for the next biome.

3. This game is the quintessential definition of wide as the ocean deep as a puddle. No, early access doesn't mmatter since the finished biomes are finished and that is the end of it. A game being in early access doesn't necessarily mean it gets magical abilities that allow it to transform its entire formula whenever, especially when the devs take a whole year to release one new biome.

In conclusion, if you're thinking about buying this game and haven't played Terraria or Minecraft, but have played games similar to it, I highly recommend the latter two. If you're younger and/or have a bunch of time to waste, and haven't played anything similar, I recommend this game.",1706841486,1706841486,False,3,0,0.475710749626159668,0,True,False,True

Started out as an Early Access game with just a few bosses, but endless amounts of opportunity for enjoyment. Now its a mostly complete game with tons of items and recipes to discover, a full slew of bosses and biomes, and endless building fun. 
My friend and I put around 200 hours into it in the first few weeks.
You can easily get carried away with the building system and forget that there are other activities to do and enemies to fight.
Dont knock the graphics until you play it. They seem simple, but simple is often a good thing. The lower poly graphics allow the game to run smoothly, and lighting effects make the game feel beautiful and immersive.

The game captures a grand sense of adventure and exploration not seen in many modern video games today. Sailing into the unknown and encountering mysterious creatures, venturing into harsh climates with enemies that can quickly dispatch you, summoning massive bosses for the first time, not knowing what to expect. Each new area you encounter has a very distinct ""feel"" to it. The devs did a remarkable job crafting the music, lighting and weather for each of them to give a diverse life to the world. Cant wait for Ashlands!

My main personal recommendations for first time players: 
1. Dont google anything. Have fun figuring the game out and adapting to the unknown. The first playthrough is always better without spoilers. 
2. You can never be under-prepared. Bring extra food, pickaxe, camp supplies on your journeys.",1706835837,1706835962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Me and some friends got this game in a moment where we had no idea what to play, but we wanted something that: [i]will be fun, won't feel like a second job, and will have a purpose[/i] (as in something to do in order to progress). And boy, oh, boy... does this game tick all the boxes!

Valheim is a survival game that is [b]fun[/b]! We can fight mobs, we can build things, we can explore the map, we can discover new and better items or we can simply fool around laughing. 

And guess what? We can do that [b]at our own pace[/b]! Can't play today? No worries, the vikings world will be there tomorrow or next week and it won't feel like you're left behind. If one of us wants to play alone he can do that just fine, [u]as long as he doesn't fight the next boss[/u] (that's ""leveling up"" the whole map for all of us). We mainly like to explore, build, level up our skills, or even grind materials when we play solo.

Also the [b]game progression[/b] is an excellent element that [b]keeps you motivated to play[/b], in case you're getting bored easily by just building nice stuff. The mechanic is quite simple: farm materials -> build better gear -> kill next boss -> boss unlocks new materials -> repeat. The great stuff is that you can take your sweet time at each progression and just explore or build. There's absolutely no hurry to advance fast if you don't want to. Maybe the new building materials.

I'm only 30 hours in the game so far, and at this pace I think I will easily reach 200 before I even finish the progression, and then just build new stuff and explore what I may have missed indefinitely, until I eventually get bored.",1706811980,1706811980,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

However it has to be said co-op online is still a god awful desync mess, mainly due to the low send/receive limit that is hard coded into the server.
This means that when you do something like take your character to a populated area on the server it has to send all that information about all the buildings/players through an artificially limited very narrow pipe.
Here's hoping they fix this and the constant stuttering outside of world saving, as it's such a let down for players trying to group with friends.

There is not enough settings for your world. I wish we could adjust more than just death penalty and portal settings.

I really like the music and art style of this game. Getting that immersion early on felt great but it all fell apart after the 1st boss.

There is no character progression like XP or atributes which is interesting. All of you HP and Stamina (and othe stats) is determined by food you eat.

Getting resources is tedious as you are constantly over the small weight limit (this is even worse later as your armor gets heavier as well). Trying to use the cart to get the resources to your base is extremely hard and you will get stuck on small obstacles (like bushes or branches) or end up in air.

The building system is actually pretty decent and building your base is fun.
Crafting is missing some quality of life like pulling resources from nearby chests.

The combat is pretty bare bones but it gets the job done. You have a light attack, heavy attack, block and a dodge (which is awkwardly bound to shift + some key by default). Perfect blocking can lead to counter blows for extra damage which is always nice. 

Enemies are varied and have weaknesses to specific damage types which is pretty cool (though again you are limited by weight so you can't carry many weapons).

Exploration is okay-ish. There are some dungeons (in Black Forest) but they usually have like 1-3 rooms with same loot and few skeletons.

On top of that many tedious and annoying ""features"". I've played this game with a group of friends in a server and we're all extremely fatigued from the many problems we encounter daily and only dragging on since we're almost done with the game(currently mistlands). I'm so over a lot of the issues we've encounter including items such as refined eitr, iron etc. getting voided by their respected forge or forge equivalent machines as well as the dreadful lag. I hope the game improves, I like it fundamentally and as a concept as well as bits and pieces of it but this shit is tiring.

Edit 1: after talking with some of the friends in the group a few glaring issues mentioned above would be:
1. Hill combat is dreadful. Without the combat mod this is the worse, too often are there times where you're fighting a seeker on a hilly terrain or it's wedged into the small space on the side of a giant skull in a dvergr excavation site. We had one of our friends die to that.
2. Stamina regen rate. They feel strongly that stamina system sucks. I partially agree with them. I do feel that stamina regen rate should be a percent based on your total stamina. It sucks when you pop 2 or 3 stam food and have 200+ stamina and it takes a few minutes to regen. It should regen based on your total stamina. 
3. Apparently the community feels similar but I did not bother looking at their sentiment(going off of what friends said). The mistlands is not fun. It has many cool elements such as gjall being an intimidating enemy to encounter in the early exploration as well the mystery the mistlands presents. Sadly the terrain navigation is annoying one because of point 2 above and two because of point 1 above lol. The entire biome could work but not within the premise of the current game. Consider the changes above and this biome could blossom more as a great early endgame environment. Also wisp torches should completely clear the area around it, not just a sphere but more like a cylinder because while I do agree with the mist being so high above the mistlands I dont agree with being un-removable because you cant put torches floating in the air or provide other options to remove the mist. Maybe a larger temporary option that is costly for temporary usage for exploration.",1706577216,1706747858,False,4,2,0.50467914342880249,2,True,False,True

Progress can be blocked by powerful enemies or bosses camping on fast travel portals, and because upon death you are reborn without any of your items, you face the prospect of a fully naked corpse run where the environment or enemies might kill you in seconds. The only way I can see around this is would be to have multiple armour and weapon sets ready to go, which would necessitate hours of farming, which is not without its own risks.

In my case - and the straw that broke the camel's back - the Elder boss appeared miles away, across the ocean, and right on the beach. I sailed to a spit of land away from his summon spot and left a portal nearby so that I could reclaim my boat or re-attempt killing him easily if I was stomped. Ofc I was smashed into next week despite wearing a full set of upgraded bronze armour, but the Elder also eventually noticed where my portal was upon subsequent attempts and finally destroyed it. I face rebuilding that boat and all sets of armour, new weapons, the lot, and honestly I can't be bothered.

I get that it's meant to be a challenge and I'm a guy that has beaten every From Soulsbourne game, I like a challenge, I just hate stubborn game mechanics wasting my time. Maybe there should be the ability to permanently raise your health and stamina to a reasonable level to give you a better chance of surviving corpse runs so that you can stand a chance at reclaiming your items.

I don't know, I think I'm just not cut out for the grind atm as a solo gamer. It's still an excellent game, if a little shallow mechanically. If you like survival games, it's about the most atmospheric I've played and extremely immersive. The thrill of sailing in a vulnerable little boat when a storm whips up and sea beasts start attacking is very hard to beat, just maybe bring a crew to even the odds a little.",1706732589,1706732589,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately it is mechanically flawed and quickly turns into actual work. I suppose this is where the ""Brutal"" in the description comes form. If you are not ready for a marathon this game will end up feeling like a 9 to 5 full time job. 

Just to be clear, if you do not intent on playing this for a hundred hours or more you will not fully enjoy it. This game is a slow burn, and even with a group it will take a long time to go through it's progression. This is multiplied by the harsh death consequences that result from quite difficult combat as well as the need to travel on foot or by boat for all exploration. The map is gigantic, segmented into islands and even with portals the risk of losing an entire hour of exploration/progression because you died in a bad spot is ever-present. 

Ultimatively I ended up not liking it. Every idea I had and every exploration intent I mustered was immediately dampened by the fact that it would take hours to get to that point. Every tree felled, every arrow crafted just became work to get to the fun parts, exploration, combat and building.

These may be symptoms of my solo experience, but even in a group this work would simply have to be divided and the boring downtime of sailing and walking endlessly would be the same, so I don't know.

HOWEVER, a game breaking bug that will require IMMEDIATE patching is the ""world-destroyer"" bug where in summary, is a bug that corrupts your save file and will thus remove any progress you have made. A trick that may help would be to back your files up before logging off. 

That being said, the game is in EARLY-ACCESS. Bugs and glitches are bound to happen but it would be wonderful if the Devs would prioritize this particular bug as it would suck the fun out of folks who worked hard to get to where they may be when disaster strikes. (FIXED)

Monsters are unique and interesting, advancing past the bronze age is where the fun starts, high risk high rewards areas with monsters that will ANNIHILATE your bums but will often drop mid-high tier stuff you can use to craft items that will aid in your journey.

The devs dont communicate and they release these tiny updates so that on steam it looks like the game is constantly updated as a selling point. Truth is they are way overdue for major world updates that people have been waiting on for 2 years. Thats the real update schedule. The devs ignore us so now they are getting a bad review!

I severely dislike quite a few things about this game and some things I absolutely despise. Also, to be honest, building is my favorite thing to do in games and its mainly the genre I like the most so the review is going to be more oriented towards that point of view.

[My Opinion on things I enjoyed, not much to say since I'm sure everyone will have a very pleasant experience with this (: ]

Challenging bosses and reshaping the terrain to suit your needs is so beyond enjoyable. I also loved exploring new areas, finding new mobs, and new crafting recipes which gave a serious sense of progression and development.
As well as building a base to suit your needs and developing it over the course of time as you obtain new production blocks and such gives pleasant memories to look back upon if you happen to take as many screenshots going through the game as I do!

[My opinion on the weapons]
There are tons of weapons and a large variety to choose from which I absolutely love! I think for the most part everyone enjoys them a lot but..

Firstly, who tf uses a spear like a kitchen knife in the hands of an unruly child? Why would you hold it mid shaft and stab only downwards with it?? Its attack pattern should genuinely be a thrust giving you more range than a small stick since some weapons do that when they shouldn't (Like an axe that doesn't even have a poke bit!)
The only thing I can think of is that the devs thought getting extra melee range was too strong so they intentionally prevented you from using the weapon correctly.. and I truly hate it. I don't use spears in this game.

I'll just say this right now, two handed weapons are completely useless to the point its not even funny. With how much stamina cost and time to attack they have, I feel like they should be doing at least 50% more damage than their one handed counterparts. 50% just to make them somewhat competitive. Because two handed weapons take like 3 times the time to swing and use substantially more stamina but only get a measly 5 to 10 extra damage.. like, huh..? Who would ever use them for anything other than gloating rights or fashion? For most enemies, you attack so slowly they see the attack coming from YESTERDAY and casually walk out of range long before you even take a swing. I also do not use two handed weapons.

[My opinions on Terrain Manipulation]

But the things I absolutely hate the most is the building and terrain manipulation. It's arguably one of the worst systems I have ever seen and the 3 years I've waited they hadn't improved it even remotely in the slightest and it genuinely pisses me off.

Not only am I incapable of shaping the terrain to my liking but it will with out a doubt be disfigured and uneven. Not only in elevation but also length and width wise as well. If I want to create a square piece of raised ground and build a wall around it, it will not happen even remotely in the slightest because what I make after hours of literally fighting the terrain will at best be a completely disfigured blob mound.

There is also the slight issue where when your cursor is too far away or too close then the game just affects the ground directly beneath you making it extraordinarily frustrating when trying to raise up an area.

[My opinion on Building]

Next major issue is the actual building of walls, floors, and roofs. It never ceases to amaze me how your character is completely incapable of building underneath a floor. If I want a pillar to connect the floor to the ground and the gap is small enough to where my character can't physically fit under it then it WILL NOT HAPPEN.

It's such a simple adjustment the devs could have implemented day one to reduce the amount of struggle I had to endure with building a slightly raised house but considering it's such a simple issue that hasn't been fixed after 3 years I truly think they're never going to improve the building in the slightest.

You also often come across inconsistencies and misalignment while trying to build anything other than a square box, but so long as you don't care and manually fill in the gaps it'll be relatively fine despite being slightly annoying if you're a perfectionist like me and need everything even.

I rate whether or not a building system is good based off of whether the tools I have at my disposal will allow me to create what I want and based off my dozens of hours of genuinely trying to build in this game I can say without a shadow of a doubt its a complete failure of a system. I never once thought that what I had made was what I wanted and never once was happy with the outcome. Even after dozens of tutorials, trials, and errors.

I basically just ignored it as much as I could and built only very simple structures because that is the only thing I will be happy with. So yeah, I honestly spent way to much time on trying to get things to be even remotely functional for me to honestly enjoy any of these building systems.

[What would improve the experience]
Honestly, if you had the farm tools visual effect be a hard cap to where its at and use mouse wheel to change the elevation of where you would build up to or flatten it would make it a lot easier and the mouse would point to what position the farm tool would bring the terrain to.. within reason of course since you won't be able to completely remove terrain like a pickaxe.

And another idea is to have a highlight that shows where to raise, flatten, or remove terrain in order to make it actually flat. That would help immensely.

[How I played the game]
When I initially played was at the start when the game was a true grindfest. I often would create worlds with specific seeds just to mine the materials nearby or use worlds to transport items through portals because it truly truly took way to long for my liking. And with that strategy, I beat the bosses in about 110 hours although I did build a big base,

Then recently I came back to the game and used Valheim+ mod which made the game far more enjoyable for me to play and I cleared out the bosses in about 40 hours and also had a big base.

[My final thoughts]
Whilst the game is very fun at times, a lot of the time its just very frustrating and I don't recommend it for most people. Some will definitely enjoy it but for people like myself I definitely do not.

I could also go on about how absolutely abysmal the games progress at development is in regards to adding new features and content, I don't actually mind as much since what I truly want is for them to improve the already existing experience because the game has a lot of potential and could be even more fun without all the hindrances.
But I definitely have to make a note and mention about how much money they made to the level of progress that actually happened over the years because it isn't very pleasing. I really hoped they would ramp up updates over time but it did not and will probably never happen.",1706675289,1706675289,False,14,3,0.573478281497955322,4,True,False,True

Introduction:
Valheim, developed by Iron Gate Studio, takes players on an exhilarating journey into the mystical world of Norse mythology. Released in early 2021, this indie survival game has taken the gaming community by storm, offering a unique blend of exploration, crafting, and intense combat. As a Viking warrior, players find themselves in a procedurally generated purgatorial realm, tasked with defeating powerful bosses and unraveling the secrets of Valheim.

Gameplay (9/10):
Valheim's gameplay mechanics strike a perfect balance between challenging survival elements and the freedom to explore a vast, beautifully crafted open world. From gathering resources and crafting tools to building structures and fending off hostile creatures, the game seamlessly weaves these elements together, providing an immersive experience that keeps players engaged for hours on end.

The highlight of Valheim's gameplay is its cooperative multiplayer feature, allowing up to 10 players to join forces and conquer the Viking afterlife together. The sense of camaraderie as you and your friends build settlements, sail the seas, and face off against towering bosses is truly remarkable.

Graphics and Art Style (8/10):
Valheim adopts a charming low-poly art style that adds to the game's appeal. While the graphics may not boast cutting-edge realism, the visuals are consistent, and the art direction captures the essence of Norse mythology beautifully. The game's atmospheric lighting and weather effects enhance the overall immersion, creating a captivating world that feels both mysterious and inviting.

Sound Design (9/10):
The game's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by Patrik Jarlestam, perfectly complements the Nordic setting. From the soft melodies during exploration to the thunderous beats during intense battles, the music enhances the overall atmosphere, making every moment in Valheim memorable. The ambient sounds of nature, wind, and crashing waves also contribute to the game's immersive experience.

Exploration and World Building (10/10):
One of Valheim's strongest aspects is its procedurally generated world, featuring diverse biomes, each with its own unique challenges and resources. The thrill of exploration is heightened by the discovery of ancient structures, hidden caves, and mystical landmarks. The game rewards players who venture into the unknown, fostering a sense of wonder and curiosity that is rarely found in survival games.

Performance and Optimization (7/10):
While Valheim generally runs smoothly, some players have reported occasional performance issues and bugs. Iron Gate Studio has been actively addressing these concerns with regular updates, but occasional hiccups may still occur. However, the developer's commitment to improving the game's performance is evident, and future updates are expected to further enhance the overall stability.

Conclusion:
Valheim stands as a shining example of the potential within the indie gaming scene. Its captivating blend of survival, exploration, and cooperative gameplay, set against a backdrop of Norse mythology, creates an experience that is both challenging and rewarding. Despite minor performance concerns, the game's constant updates and responsive development team make Valheim a must-play title for fans of the survival genre and those seeking an epic Viking adventure.

It looks nice and feels alright but at the end of the day this game will die within the year if they don't start making serious improvements on the game. 6 million sales is enough money to hire more dev's and get pumping out the content to make this game a long lasting infinite experience but instead by the looks of things they're keeping the current team of 6 people (yes six even after the millions of dollars of profit) and have a really weak road map with a few uninteresting updates over a long period of time which will be the death of this game. I'd say buy this game because its fun with friends but don't expect much more because content updates aren't coming soon and they have no interest in riding the wave and pumping content out instead its just constant minor bug fixes and updates on how many new ""vikings"" there are which is really disappointing. 

This could change but I'm not confident that it will its still a positive but just a word of caution you'll be bored quickly.


New review 2024 - Basically nothing added, pure grind filler to force you to spend hours doing  tasks that aren't fun, building still poor. Not worth getting, only fun with 3 friends and even then there are far better games with more content.

I set up a full time server and played off and on with a dozen or so friends, and it was an absolute blast. The game play is very satisfying overall. I am an exploration-focused player, and the way Valheim is put together just scratches that itch. Sailing, exploration, crafting, building, combat - all are thoughtfully implemented. And there's so much room for creative expression. We actually build a sea serpent marine park, went out in a ship, harpooned a serpent, sailed it back into the lagoon, sealed off the lagoon, and then had a captive sea serpent in the middle of our fortress.

The game is fun to play solo or as a team. I've been waiting, but some day soon plan to create another server and invite my friends back to dive into the world of Valheim again.

If you are casual survival player coming from Minecraft please do not play this game, if you play solo do not play this game. I am writing this review in hope for a dev to read this and take feedback.
First of I liked this game, I have 38 hrs but most of those hours were trying to figure out how to get recipes online and looking for the enemy, locations and items that provide said recipe. I still can not build rock base structures.

Why I mention minecraft before?
If you intend to play, gather materials and build freely like in minecraft you can not do it unless you have a crafting table every 10mts from you, the radio is so small I had to install a mod to freely build without the crafting table/bench. I had to literally build  a crafting bench in a middle of a bridge in order to continue building said bridge.

You want to go mine for 6hrs and after your inventory is full want to come back and melt all of it? You can't. The weight limit is so low (300) that if you have a set armor, 1 wooden shield, a bronze sword and a pickaxe you can only take back with you 22 -25 out of 30 copper, tin, or whatever mineral you want to mine in you before you get overweight and have to go back to you base, I spent more time walking (10 min from my base to the copper mining spot) then mining said mineral(3 to 4min mining depending on which mineral I was gathering), so the game for me became a walking sim rather than a survival.

Why can't you play solo?
Unless you want to die every enemy you encounter from the dark forest and up you can not play this game solo. Trolls after you get their armor are easy to overcome, but if  you try to go to the swamp with that armor let me tell you, you will get wrecked by those enemies, the health regen is super slow, all of the enemies in that region use poison meaning that they hit you, and if you run from them cause you are to low on health the poison ends up killing you, losing your stuff and up you go to walk for another 10, 20 or 30min depends on how far you died, if there is a river, and if there are enemies on the road stopping you.

There needs to be an armor seccion in the UI. Why? cause it looks a mess when you see your armor, weapons, food, and materials on the same space, and you can accidentally unequipped a gear if you press wrong if next to it there is food, is not a big of a deal but it will be nice just to have the UI looks clean(I installed a mod for that as well)

You want to play with your friends, you can....but you need to check some stuff before that. I told my brother to buy the game so we could play together, we live in the same house, so we use the same WiFi connection. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PLAY TOGETHER AT ALL. I don't know how they programmed coop, but every time I ""Start the server"" option on my world and enter to it so we he can join, my WiFi connection suddenly stops working on all my home devices, even the same pc i am playing with and we need to quit THIS GAME so the WiFi connection comes back, and that only happens in this game. Please find a way to fix this cause the only reason he bought this game was to play with me.

I do hope a dev sees this and fix some of this stuff or adds an option to remove some of the stuff, llike the weight limit.
Like I said before, the game is fun but some of this stuff removes the enjoyment for me.",1706479225,1706479225,False,5,0,0.513733565807342529,0,True,False,True

- At first it felt a bit unbalanced when it comes to sense of exploration and discovery, and learning and crafting. (Not as bad as, let's say Terraria, which I call a wiki game because you have to look things up to play, but still.) But later on, when I got used to how it works, it actually feels quite alright.
- No official servers. You have to start your own. (Now there's a happy developer: sell millions of copies, host nothing.)

[h1]PROS[/h1]
- Very good look and feel and atmosphere. Very nice graphics! I love the pixely feel. The mist, the sea, the storms, all weather effects are all fantastic and beautiful. Very nice sound effects. After countless hours I'm still not annoyed by the music.
- At first I was critical of the building system, but then I really learned it I guess. Perhaps not intuitive then, but now I think it's excellent. You just have to see the surface you want to attach a piece to; simple!
- Lovely to be able to build up rock/ground, level ground and hack down into earth!
- Wonderful that you can re-plant trees, and this wherever you like.
- Not much disk space required. 1.3 GB, how did they manage this?
- Never ever crashes or freezes.
- I've not yet discovered any annoying bugs.
- You can start your local game and your Steam friends and others can join.
- Or you can start a dedicated server with a headless application.
- Apparently you can move your local game to a dedicated server; very nice if you try things out first but will keep on going with the same seed and progress but now as a dedicated server (I have not yet tried this though).


[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
I had a love-hate relationship with Valheim up until around boss 3 (Bonemass). Sometime after that I started loving it more. Good game play! Fun. Beautiful. Solid. Challenging. Punishing. Rewarding.

Many of them revolve around the lack of current developers and slow updates. I want to expose these viewpoints and how they are expectations of a new generation of gamers and not that of the game itself. 

Negatively reviewing a game of this size and its duration to completion due to lack of updates is preposterous. From experienced players I have talked to, you will easily get 200 HOURS out of this game before you feel there is a lack of content. At that point either start the game again as there is random terrain generation, play with a friend, or accept that you paid $0.10/hr over the 200 hour experience and move on. This game sits extremely well balanced between not enough content and the bloat from games with too much content. 

If you want to eventually find yourself unconsciously smiling while taking a bathroom break from this game then spend the cash and download this now. I once packed up my belongings in a cart at night and set off on an adventure first thing in the morning to settle in a new space that was rich with resources and potential. My girlfriend said I had a ear to ear grin when she walked by. Reflecting on it, I realize I was having similar feelings to the first time I got an apartment. 

Me setting out on an adventure... https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093251987/screenshot/2295214860600716196/

If I can have those feelings come out from a $20 video game then what could I care if there are only a few developers.

You build your first home, play with some friends, and cook meat over an open fire with the stand. Finally, you kill some deer and fight a god that solidifies everything you practiced until that point. 

Then the nigh perpetual grind starts. Go to the new area, get new resources, and kill another forsaken being. It's quite fun, all things considered. Why give it a negative review? Well, that fun comes to an abrupt halt after you hit the swamp and have to mine iron. You are assailed by mobs from every direction, arrows flying at you, leeches biting at your ankles. You trudge through to dungeons to get the iron needed to make armor to proceed.

After that, you trek through the mountains, with the wishbone to find silver and kill a flying boss. IF you're lucky, you won't have to go through the plains or more swamps before arriving. Just about everything will take you out all too easily, and then you have to run your poor character back to collect everything he dropped.

And that's the crux of the negative rating. The game starts out fine, the grind is even fun. Up until you're getting one-shot despite having decent gear for the level before. Up until you fight new enemies you don't know the patterns for, about twenty minutes away via sailing because you didn't have the chance to put down a portal. 

You can absolutely change the game's settings, to make it less punishing. But, isn't that kind of the point? I adore harder games, but they follow the idea that death is a hiccup. You don't have to dedicate time to recovering, you just get back into it. 

Compare Valheim to whatever you'd wish, but the resources you gather the regular way are too slow to keep it all flowing smoothly. It is a fun game when you aren't slogging through death after death because all of your resources went into decent gear. It's enjoyable when you don't respawn in base, to get raided. I truly wish anyone playing this game all the fun that can be had, but it's not for me after back-to-back deaths where you couldn't do anything, besides gathering more ores and making backup equipment in case you died.

After being called out for it, they start to delete comments and ban people on the forum. Really scummy tactic, Iron Gate.

Remember the 2021 Roadmap? The modding community already did better everything that you promised in the first 3-4 months since launch. After 2 years we get Mistlands which is an uninspired, lazy implemented joke of a biome.

To those who don't game as much(like me). This game has hand-holding and it doesn't.(Feature you can turn on and off).
If I didn't have friends guiding me without spoiling anything for me it wouldn't have gotten me to the obsessive point I have with thinking through my work day ""Man, I can't wait to get home and play this.""

Crafting mechanics were a learning curve for me but if you do some quick research you'll find so much pride in figuring things out yourself. 
The soundtrack and background music is addictive and well written. You'll hum yourself into a daydream sometimes.
The game is STUNNING. Absolutely breath-taking scenery that will make you wish you could experience it in real life.

If dying wasn't so absolutely soul-crushing and brutal on every level, it might be worth doing the experimentation it takes to figure things out.  However, in order to prepare for any 1 hour adventure means 1 week of real time prep work.  Most of which is running back and forth to repair the weak ass tool you'll have for much of the early game.  All of which creates a recipe where you spend your precious gaming hours farming just to go lose it in the woods because rested buffs wear off faster than you can get anywhere, then you can't fight because your stamina tanks.

Playing singleplayer is a bore and a chore all at the same time.  Nothing feels rewarding, nothing feels gratifying, because you just finished a fight with something, and there's ten more things and a spawner coming up on you.  And that's the day time.  And you're always outnumbered, outclassed, outgunned and everything is 100000x cooler than you are.

I respect a game for being a challenge.  I don't respect it for being so unbelievably vague on how to do anything.  Or what to do.  Or anything about anything.

If it wasn't for the internet, I wouldn't have even sunk any more than a few hours into the game because it's unbelievably boring running/boating miles for a couple stacks of ore.  Thanks to the internet, there's plenty of mods to make this almost playable, but the fun version isn't anything like the ""vanilla"" experience, and it's fun is fleeting, at best.

I really don't see what people get a kick out of when it takes so long to do actually go anywhere and do anything because so much time is spent gathering 10x the stuff to make replacement gear for the inevitable ""all your buffs wore off at the same time because it takes 10 minutes to get anywhere, you can't regain stamina enough for basic fighting now, go die and start over"".

By the time you've got enough of all 3 foods, enough armor, weapons and tools, you can go build a forward base.  And then go farming again.

Go in the dungeon, farm.  It's always grinding some random resource which you don't have enough inventory space for, because everything you touch drops 3 things, most of which weigh little.  The rest is made of pure lead, and you can get a few into your limited inventory space.

It's all of the worst parts of the game on repeat for days on end, with a sprinkle of dungeon crawling.

Playing a game shouldn't feel like I'm being punished for something, and the game feels genuinely stacked against you beyond reason, even for a ""brutal, hardcore"" experience.

You simply wait for your health to very slowly tick back up.

Inventory and equipping system is also garbage. Your character will literally keep his clothes/armor in the same bag with the rest of your loot when equipped. It takes useful space and makes it that much more disorganized.

I've reviewed this game before, and recommended it despite my multiple gripes with the game that included:

-Unfair and straight up horseshit difficulty 

-Lack of content in giant world and lack of good transportation for said giant world

-Lack of updates (0 major updates before this most recent mistlands update)

-Gimmicky and unfun game design elements that feel specifically tailored to make the game less enjoyable

-Repetitive content

-No true endgame

-Stamina system and food system are kinda ass

-Lack of basically any quality of life

-Leveling system levels up very slowly and drops far too much when you die, basically preventing your character from leveling up beyond a certain point unless you are incredibly good at the game (which most people won't be on their first and second playthroughs).

-Overall lack of polish

All that being said, I still recommended the game as its few saving graces were very redeeming. Yeah, the game was really clunky and annoying at times, but it was still a great time with friends that was memorable.
The graphics are better looking than real life, the world design and base building are top-notch, the music is everything you could ask for, and the combat is just rewarding enough that it's satisfying to beat hard enemies. It's also important to mention the fuling goblins because they are very funny I think.

I have now played through the game a second time after the first major update since the launch (The game has been out for two years), and am not only disappointed but pissed at the amount of time I poured into it again just to reveal how underwhelming this new update is. To list a few: 

-ALL of gripes mentioned above are either still present or amplified due to the new biome being just as bad if not worse as any other area in the game

-New game-breaking bugs including one where your body doesn't drop your loot when you die, deleting all of your items (which actually happened to me in this last playthrough)

-The final boss is kind of cool, but the item it drops is, I shit you not, a placeholder item. We waited [b]two years[/b] for an unfinished update. Incredible.

-New magic weapons are completely pointless because you only get them at the end of the game and are very difficult to get, being overshadowed in power by basically everything else you get at that point in the game. Also important to note that there are 4 magic weapons in the game right now and 1 of them doesn't even work.

-New biome follows the trend of lame gimmicky areas with enemies that are zero fun to fight. Seriously, they designed a fully fleshed out and beautiful biome for you to explore, but everywhere you go is covered in this unavoidable fog that makes you unable to see two feet in front of you. I don't get it. 

I cannot recommend this game to anyone. The combat and gameplay are too unfair to appeal to normal casual players, and the exploration is too slow and tedious to recommend to those who are looking for something similar to Terraria. I guess the building is good, but not 20 bucks good. This game really only appeals to masochists.

Seriously, if you are considering this game and haven't played Terraria, go play that. It's very similar in progression and experience but infinitely more polished and well designed. Plus, it's half the price.

The movement and general mechanics (Switching between tools, attacking with weapons or shooting with a bow) is very clunky and feels like shit to use. Weapons have no reach at all or just plainly miss for no apparent reason. Bows have seemingly random bullet-drop (arrowdrop?) and work very weirdly in tight spaces.

The food system is also subpar, as you constantly have to keep eating to keep your HP and stamina at a reasonable level, and thats not even mentioning the fact that you are absolutely forced to have 3 different food items at once. 

The looting system is also very annoying; why do I have to pick stuff I find on the group twice??? Why does pressing E once not just put it in my inventory, instead of dropping it on the floor and then having to either walk over it or press E again on its ragdoll body.

A lot of mobs aggro for no reason other than you just existing besides them. This would be fine if they also didn't just keep that aggro forever. You can't just run far enough away, they will keep chasing you to the end of the world. And god forbid you try to kite with low stamina because you died and are trying to get your items back.

Your attacks miss when you don't align with the enemy vertically, but the world generation insists on making maps with elevation differences. Some biomes, such as the mistlands, have massive changes in elevation that get in the way of playing the game.

Items feel random and so many of them have no or one use, and you don't get to delete items till the mid game. The user experience isn't cultivated for a good time so it ends up being a bit of a frustration simulator.

Minor gripe is the exploration feels aimless sometimes and the size of the map doesn't add value just continuous clones of the same biomes.

Stop playing after the plains.

The devs for a good amount of time did little to no communication with that changing as outcry became larger. Now we're given dev logs that don't really tell us much about what's next and leaves most as broad as possible. Back in 2021 even 2022 if you had asked me if this is worth picking up, I'd say yes because what is in the game can be an extremely enjoyable experience despite a lot of systems remaining basic or staying surface level with no real evolution. Progression is probably this game's worst aspect now as the further towards the end game you get, the less gear holds an impact. Multiple armor sets and different gear options are basically useless/wastes of time vs the main ore sets. There are more games out there that saw this formula and are more committed to active development. I recommend you go after those unless you're looking for a one and done experience.

And a huge sin in these survival games is to add a unfinished biome that when updated, doesn't add the content if already generated and leaves people needing to restart the world.

I'm saying it outright, Valheim is NOT a fun game. 

Valheim's 'procedurally generated' map - and this is said quite carefully on the store page if you take my meaning - suffers from an extreme lack of randomization. The game's landscape is drawn from a heightmap, and you just get a chunk of it basically. To my knowledge, the developers have never commented on this or why this is. I'm no expert either but all I know I was able to generate at least 6 maps all with the same landscape and features.

This totally and completely shattered the experience for me.

When playing an adventure game, one of the key components obviously enough is the adventure. There is no such experience in Valheim. You can run for half an hour across the world if you really want, to be sure, you can sprint around experiencing the fixed weather and wind cycle. But underlying all of that 'magic', Valheim is an incredibly static game. More so than any other game of this type that I have seen.

The combat is Dark Souls, I'm just going to call it that in the most derogatory and simplistic way I can because I don't like this game. I'm not going to give it credit. So you have a weapon and a shield maybe, or maybe you try holding with both hands and then you smack enemies, and you roll out of the way of the enemies and more often sprint out of the way of enemies and it's perfectly functional and sometimes kind of fun when you get to bully lower-levelled enemies.

The enemies however, in my experience, get progressively more boring and less interesting as you progress. The bosses have extremely inconsistent difficulty in my opinion. The first boss is more challenging than the second and the third boss is like way too hard.

The game starts with treants (two different kinds of treants in fact over the first two zones, bit lazy in my opinion). Then you start seeing skeletons, then zombies, the obligatory slime, another tree monster, and then literally wolves. For whatever reason, two wolves are more terrifying and more dangerous, than the first boss of the game, more dangerous than a pack of skeletons even, and more dangerous a pack of zombies for that matter.

And this is because Valheim has what seems initially like a simple and enjoyable Terraria style progression system, of beating bosses to get access to new gear. However, this is the worst possible implementation of such a design because you need the wiki open on your secondary monitor to get anywhere in this game. Valheim does not signal the existence of new recipes or new materials or whatever to you. The only reason to know anything exists is because you looked at the wiki. It's atrocious.

Your progression is so lockstep with your progression through bosses, that there are times when you already have the materials to craft something, but the recipe comes from fighting a boss so it isn't unlocked yet. You are HARD gated and the game will often only unlock recipes, and tell you about them, when you get the most difficult and hard to find part of the recipe, as opposed to unlocking it whenever you find any part of it. Even if you would have no hope of crafting that thing yet, at least if the game told you about it, you might have some sort of goal.

I suspect that travel in this game was manufactured to be as slow and dull as possible on purpose. I don't know why, but it WAS done deliberately. By default, you cannot transport certain critical crafting components through teleporters.

Now, let me tell you, teleporters are necessary in Valheim. Unless you have the patience to sit there for like 15-30 minutes just disassociating while you move around the map either with your feet or by boat, you NEED portals.

By default the game says you can't move stuff by portal. You may already see the problem here.

So you constantly have to figure out methods of logistics to get, usually by boat or by foot, either the materials you need to a location where you can forge new items, or you need to get the materials to forge new items to a new outpost where your new materials are. Either way it's a pain in the ass. The best solution, is probably just to go by boat everywhere because with the EXTREMELY limited inventory in this game that cannot ever be expanded, you'll never carry every little thing you need to set up a new outpost.

And it's COMPLETELY necessary. Unless you change the game rules to allow ores and such through portals. I didn't do that though.

Now, I don't have anything against this type of playstyle, really, it's almost something I would probably do on my own but given you will have to do this so many times you might run out of say letters in the alphabet to signify all your different bases...? Wow. Give me a break.

Why does the game force you to do this? I mean, that's the kind of mechanic, that should be played FOR FUN, as in it's something you do because you find it enjoyable to build and interact with construction. NOT out of necessity. And definitely not as frequently, as this game demands. 

Since there are specific materials like iron that are required to build some more advanced structure components, you are actively limited in fact in the creativity of what you can build, just because maybe you don't want to cart a few chunks of iron across half the world just to build like a strut on the side of a building. It's beyond stupid and I have no idea why this option, is the DEFAULT.

By the way, since everything is stacks of 50 or whatever, a HORRIBLY limited number given how many resources you need to actually build anything, actually BUILDING in this game, is also a nightmare, you need to spend forever if you want to build anything even marginally tall, just hauling materials from your build site from your storage or whatever. If you are used to games like Minecraft or Terraria where you can reasonably comfortably hold all your 'paint' in one palette, Valheim is the opposite of that.

The game also has 'base assaults' where some amount of enemies will attack your base, or one of them. I only ever saw like two, random treants attacking and the troll duo (which was crazy easy once you have any bow and a stock of arrows) so I don't know if my game was bugged or what - but given what I heard about later ones, you know I'm okay with that. Oh no! I missed out on an incredibly annoying game mechanic. Oops! Too bad haha.

Anyway, just thinking about all this stuff has made me angry.

To conclude, I'll just explain the thing that killed the game for me. I stood on top of a mountain and thought, this is the biggest mountain. Surely there's nothing larger. Then I looked on Reddit and saw someone standing, on the exact same mountain, and I thought hey, isn't that mine? How does he have the same mountain. Then I learned about how the map generation works and I never played it again. It makes your playthrough less special, if every single player gets to see the exact same terrain. Sure his may have had trees in a different spot than mine, but it was the same terrain.

I've heard no response from the developers, so I assume they don't care or would prefer not to address this because it's safer for their public image. I bet most players aren't even aware of how limited the worldgen is. Maybe it's better that way, but to me it seems like people are just being lied to, and I don't like that. I don't like being lied to, so I don't like Valheim. 

This game is a veneer, it looks like it should be great fun, and it feels like you should be having a good time playing a fun adventure crafting gathering building game, then you realize nothing about it is fun.",1706148739,1706148739,False,2,2,0.423941671848297119,0,True,False,True

Valheim is a survival crafting game that transports you to a vast and beautiful Norse-inspired world, where you can build, explore, fight, and conquer. It is currently in Early Access, but it already offers a rich and rewarding experience that will keep you hooked for hours. Whether you play solo or with friends, Valheim is a game that will challenge you, surprise you, and delight you.

[h1]The World of Valheim[/h1]
One of the most impressive aspects of Valheim is its world design. The game features a procedurally generated map that is divided into several biomes, each with its own terrain, weather, resources, enemies, and secrets. You start in the Meadows, a peaceful and lush area where you can gather basic materials and hunt animals. As you venture further, you will encounter more dangerous and diverse regions, such as the Black Forest, the Swamp, the Mountains, the Plains, and the Ocean.

Each biome has its own unique atmosphere and aesthetic, thanks to the game’s charming low-poly graphics and immersive sound design. The game also has a dynamic day-night cycle and weather system that affect the gameplay and the visuals. You can witness stunning sunrises and sunsets, as well as rain, snow, fog, and storms. The game also has a realistic physics engine that makes the environment react to your actions and the elements. You can chop down trees, dig holes, build structures, and sail ships, and see how they interact with the world.

The world of Valheim is not only beautiful, but also full of life and mystery. You will encounter various creatures, both friendly and hostile, that are inspired by Norse mythology and folklore. You will find deer, boars, wolves, trolls, skeletons, draugrs, and more. Some of them will attack you on sight, while others will flee or ignore you. You will also find ancient ruins, dungeons, villages, and monuments that hint at the history and lore of the world. You will also discover hidden treasures, secrets, and Easter eggs that reward your curiosity and exploration.

[h1]The Gameplay of Valheim[/h1]
Valheim is a survival crafting game, which means that you will have to gather resources, craft items, build structures, and manage your health, stamina, and hunger. The game has a simple but effective crafting system that lets you create tools, weapons, armour, food, potions, and more. You can also build your own base, where you can store your items, craft more advanced items, and rest. You can customise your base with various furniture, decorations, and defences. You can also build vehicles, such as carts, boats, and even a flying machine, to help you travel faster and carry more items.

The game also has a skill system that lets you improve your abilities by using them. The more you run, jump, swim, sneak, fight, and craft, the better you become at them. You can also gain bonuses and buffs by eating different foods, wearing different armours, and using different items. The game also has a death penalty that makes you drop your items when you die, and a durability system that makes your items wear out over time. These mechanics add a layer of challenge and risk to the game, as well as a sense of progression and reward.

The game also has a combat system that is simple but satisfying. You can use various melee and ranged weapons, such as axes, swords, spears, bows, and even magic, to fight your enemies. You can also use shields, dodges, and parries to defend yourself. The combat is based on timing, positioning, and stamina management, and it requires skill and strategy to overcome your foes. The game also has a boss system that lets you summon and fight powerful creatures that represent the enemies of Odin. These bosses are epic and challenging, and they require preparation and teamwork to defeat. They also grant you special items and abilities that help you progress further in the game.

[h1]The Multiplayer of Valheim[/h1]
Valheim is a game that can be played solo or with up to nine other players in co-op. The game has a dedicated server option that lets you host your own world and invite your friends to join you. You can also join other players’ worlds or use the public server browser to find other servers to play on. The game also has a password option that lets you protect your world from unwanted visitors.

The game is designed to be cooperative, and it encourages you to work together with other players. You can share resources, items, and information, as well as help each other in combat and exploration. You can also build and customise your base together, and create your own viking community. The game also has a chat system that lets you communicate with other players, as well as a ping system that lets you mark locations and enemies on the map.

The game also has a PvP option that lets you enable or disable friendly fire and damage between players. You can use this option to challenge other players to duels, or to create your own rules and scenarios for PvP. The game also has a modding option that lets you install and use various mods that enhance or change the game in different ways. You can find and download mods from the Steam Workshop or other sources, and use them to customise your game experience.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]

Or one can lose themselves in the simple joys of farming, rearing tamed boars and wolves. If you can tame them. I personally haven't tackled that function yet. I've been mining and exploring and shoring up defenses against the most annoying of denizens that ever walked the lands.

Had no real issues with bugs etc, graphics work well I'd say actually given seems like intentional retro art style of like ps2 game or w/e(not to mention, like performance aint an issue right). Is bit of jank here and there, and obvi this isn't a super high budget game.

Tough game, wouldnt say unfair but some design decisions can make it tedious. Some things like think leave weight allowance alone but just give us few more slots so not doing the chest organisation shuffle every 5 mins. BUT tons o' mods and even difficulty settings for stuff like that, so it is kinda hard to hold the ""main"" game balance against the devs. 

Another reason the above should mainly just be noted, and not seen as a mark off, in case ""grindy"" as game description makes you cringe is the level of immersion the game does have because of its ""rules"". Where game can be tedious or even bit brutal in its mechanics it is also very immersive with things like not having a proper chimney and accumulation of smoke leading to you dying while sleeping over night from carbon monoxide poisoning. World feels alive, and it feels dangerous therefore and when you ""win"" feel like actually put some time, effort and thought into it. So eh, makes super limited inventory slots etc a lot easier to shrug off versus a game that is lacking in that feeling.

I have to say that I didn't like it. Progress is very slow, lots of mining needed to craft the items, also lots of time walking around while stamina being a problem all the time. Setting up base doesn't really matter since you will have to move after every boss and moving the items from A to B is a pain and a really slow process. Been playing for 14 hours and I only saw 3 types of monsters and 2 times of animals to hunt, very repetitive. The patters are really easy to learn since they have 2 or 3 attacks at most.

The only 2 things this game did differently that's an improvement in the survival genre is how food works and the boss progression system instead of the flat point one like Ark. Things like having teleportation, but then blocking you from transporting mats has no place in PVE and shouldn't be the default. Other games like V-rising copied that design thinking it was good balance or ""fun."" 

I am biased against viking settings because we've had multiple games set around them so the setting for me at least was a turn off. The music sounds like it was ripped from a royalty free fantasy music pack, the particles are something out of minecraft, and the randomly generated map makes the map design uninspired. People think by having a linear map it would change your progression to a boring repetitive one on reset, but it would be no different design wise, since you'd start in the same progression pattern as randomly generated one. The difference is, the linear one is actually interesting to look at unlike anything made by a seed.

At the rate these patches are going, I am afraid to see how many years it will be before it hits 1.0. I've seen awful games like 7 Days to Die sit in EA for 11 years so far. I wouldn't be shocked to see that happen with this one too.

This, along with Skyrim, are the only two games currently that I will never play unmodded. There's so many small things that break it for me, like short food durations (even the late game food), no crafting from containers, short days and a few other nitpicks. But all of them easily fixed with mods, making this, in my mind, the ultimate survival craft game. And it's still in early access.

The last substantial update to gameplay, Mistlands, was over a year ago now, and Ashlands being confirmed for ""the first half of 2024"" would really suggest a Q2 release, because the developers have specified quarters in the past for releases, and you'd generally want to say Q1 if you were expecting to get it out during it, unless you're hoping to surprise your fans by releasing it ""early"".
Embracer Group released back in September that Valheim had sold 12 million copies up to that point. I cannot imagine how you can bring in that many sales and not beef up your team to be able to get major content updates out at least once a year by this point. New devs obviously don't instantly mean faster updates but I have to think that when the team was 'overwhelmed' by the popularity of the game when it sold 5 million units in the first month and they later dropped their original roadmap, if they had added to the team then, we'd be seeing a lot better results around now.
Potentially 16-18 months for a new biome and meaningful gameplay changes is insane, and the content coming out in the meantime has been pretty lacking. Hildir's update was primarily building objects and cosmetics, dungeons that felt like derivatives of existing dungeons, and mini bosses that were just reskins of existing enemies with bigger numbers and a new ability, and only dropped things that unlocked more cosmetics. Beyond that was some manner of engine update, which admittedly eats up a good bit of dev time (again if they'd gotten more on board a couple years ago etc etc), bug fixes which are obviously important, and some seasonal related things, some of which managed to miss the seasons they were for.
The game could very easily be something magical when it's finished, but there are portions of the game right now that feel unfinished or underdeveloped, and not because 'there's content promised, therefore it's not finished'. My main problem is just that I want more content from the game than I'm getting. 200 hours is obviously more than good enough for the price, but it doesn't stop me from being disappointed overall, because I played the game almost exclusively with friends, and I think I was almost purely enjoying doing things with them, as opposed to anything the game actually provided itself.
Maybe they'll change their minds and release content in smaller pieces so it feels like there's a good reason to get on more often instead of one large reason so infrequently that I frequently forget the game exists. Maybe I'll ask my kids how 1.0 is.


OG:
""It's a good game, but buy it based off its current state, not its 'potential', because the update pace can be pretty glacial. 8 months for a pretty minor patch with Hildir could be a turnoff for some.""",1692708269,1706048137,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-Each new gear level is a flat upgrade which means my gear upgrade is more and more neglegable as I progress through the game. But the enemies in each biome get stronger exponentionally. This makes me feel progressively weaker, and more vulnerable even though my stats and gear are improving.
-You have to sprint if you want to get anywhere on ground that isn't perfectly flat. Which was an issue I could live with, until I got to the Mistlands, which is an interlocking series of 45° slopes. Meaning I never have any stamina when I get jumped by mobs.
-The attack animations and hitboxes make me narrowly miss the enemy if it's not perfectly on my elevation level. Which combined with my two previous points makes the endgame feel like getting waterboarded with concrete and glass shards.

EDIT:
After revisiting the game with a few more wriends, I still have issues with some aspects of the core gameplay. But the introduction of difficulty settings helped to solve enough of them to flip this review.

Dont get me wrong, the game is fun, fairly challenging, even triggering at some times...but the lack of updates and content is the real killer here on top of the devs asking for a labor of love vote in 2022 after adding literally ONE BIOME.

Core gameplay is not finished. Biomes that are being worked on (for almost 3 years now) and modders essentially fixing and adding content that virtually tripled my playtime.

I bought this game at full price, so the price now really isnt TOO terribly bad ($12) considering the state of the game. Just dont be disappointed in the end game...because there isnt one.

One major issue is the inability to teleport resources to the main base using portals. This forces players to construct bases in every biome, leading to constant attacks from annoying mobs. This lack of teleportation not only eliminates the fun factor but introduces a sense of routine and frustration. In my 43 hours of gameplay with a friend, we managed to defeat only the second boss out of the six or seven available, highlighting the slow progression in the game.

Moreover, the grinding aspect doesn't bring any new and distinctive content to the gameplay. The biomes remain unchanged from the beginning to the end, creating a monotonous experience. The vast and expansive map, while initially intriguing, becomes a tedious journey due to its emptiness. Exploring the world quickly loses its charm as all the mobs and landscapes start to feel repetitive.

On a positive note, the crafting system is well-executed and allows players to build impressive structures, which kept me engaged for an extended period. However, beyond crafting, the game lacks additional elements to keep players invested.

So they finally added a feature to allow all items through portals; this has made the game significantly less grindy and much more fun to play. 

They also added a feature to increase the yield of items you get when mining/harvesting/etc - this has made the game significantly less grindy and much more fun to play. 

With the recent (and upcoming) content there's plenty to see and do which is now much more accessible to people with less time on their hands (while also maintaining the previous grind-fest rates, if you so choose, to keep the Valheim puritans happy as well).

I still remember getting enough materials to finally build a ship, and sailing to sea. Man, that was an incredible experience. I also enjoy the combat, which is lackluster in most survival games. In Valheim, you can get really good at the combat, and push really hard into difficult biomes despite not having the properly tiered gear, which is amazing! The crafting and building are both top notch, as well as the aesthetic. Overall, I really enjoyed the game, and I've had a blast playing it with friends.

So where are the shortcomings?  Every new biome you enter simply ends up being the next ""level"" to the game, so you're forced to build a base there, grind out all of the latest tiers of gear and building pieces, then move on to the next biome. I'd much rather see a system where you can keep improving on your home base, but you can't teleport with your latest tier of metal, so you're stuck either sailing for hours at a time or just building a new base. This creates a situation where you create a ton of rushed, haphazardly built bases all across the map, and never putting a ton of effort into any of them, because they merely exist for crafting, rather than actually occupying. 

Further, since everything is a clear upgrade in the next biome, you don't have any true build variety, either in your character or bases. You can't build something early on, then continue to improve on it, and use it into the late game. You're simply kitting yourself out, then abandoning everything you put all that effort toward, and replacing it with the latest and greatest.

There are interesting armor sets to be found in multiple biomes, like the Fenris armor set that gives a damage buff to fist weapons and a movement speed buff. However, you only get a single fist weapon in the entire game, and since it shows up in the mid game, farming to build the fist weapons and the Fenris armor set is an absolute waste of time. You're far better off simply ignoring the armor set (that gives almost no armor at all), never farming for it or the fist weapons, killing the boss of that biome, and putting all that time to farm into simply progressing to the next biome.

I honestly wish that every new biome simply offered something different, rather than something better. For example, if one biome offered amazing ranged-oriented stuff, and its own building aesthetic, while another biome offered excellent farming tools and its own building aesthetic, while another offered excellent swords and its own building aesthetic.

On top of that, Valheim seems to offer massive progression in terms of the things you acquire rather than any real progression relating to the inherent power of your character. You actually have the same 25 hit points on your character from the start of the game all the way until the end, but you can eat better food that offers all of the extra hit points. So really, you end up merely relying on external stuff rather than your character.

The game is fun and certainly worth playing all the way until the end, but for true longevity, I think they need true character progression and the option to explore biomes to gain optional things, rather than the requirement to rapidly progress through each biome and gain power in the form the biome's gear offerings.",1613849746,1705933307,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

To start this game is fairly unforgiving, even on easy mode.  Don't overestimate yourself, or underestimate the enemy.  The game has an intended path for you to follow concerning which biome is next on your list to conquer, but the game doesn't exactly lead you there (i.e. I was in the plains before I found any swampland, let alone mountains).  Enemies from the harder biome will wreck you so fast it'll make Usain Bolt look like a turtle with a limp. 

The world is HUGE, and the game is grindy.  Getting resources can be a pain in the butt especially considering metals can't be brought through a teleporter, so you either have to run ALL the way back or build a forward base in that biome (or cheese it).  The grind is real in that game though.  

Now for my main hissy fit.  There just isn't enough interesting POVs to keep my tiny reptile brain pre-occupied.  Gathering resources can only last so long before you need a change of pace, and while there are a few interesting places to visit, it's mostly just random half broken buildings with a couple feathers and some rubies.  There needs to be more content, whether its more places to visit or more to craft/create with the random resources you find everywhere (preferably both).

I hesitantly give this a recommendation, despite my grievances against the game. I got it on sale so I recommend you do too.  It's decent, but feels a little empty overall.  I'll play until the final boss is dead, then probably won't touch it for a long while afterward.

I would love steam workshop and or umod support. I feel this would open up the community more and keep the game thriving. Was never a nexus or mod manager user and forcing other people to 3rd party mods.
That being said, my main issues have been everything water and save related. 
Before I set sail, I click save while on land, I set sail, and I get wrecked by a serpent for the first time. Water combat and mechanics are pretty lackluster Imo. Anyways, after that I go to load my save... Guess what? It was OVER WRITTEN BY AN AUTO SAVE? Like come on! I quit for a day and came back and slowly re-farmed the material to get my body back but it was the most tilting experience I've ever had in a single player game.
Overall though game is solid as heck. No complaints about progression and how unique and complete it feels to anything else I've played. Huge recommend. Just devs, personal note, please don't let your game die. I only know there's a few of you but giving it to the hands of the community (workshop) would be a huge clutch.

I have two portals running- one leads to the other side of the bay and the other Portal is connected to a place in the west where i defeated the Elder.

Looking forward to conquer all the other bosses!
That is quite unusual for me because i normally dislike boss fights.
I disliked third person and pixel games too and was also growing tired of survival mechanics...

Combat is basic and smooth.  Dodging and blocking is responsive and fun.  All combat is based on player skill, but there are skill levels that can affect your performance as well.

Materials for building and crafting are simple and straight forward.  Late in the game crafting materials remain pretty basic with new materials rarely being added in with old materials remaining relevant.

Building uses simple parts to make complex structures.  The building model uses structural integrity, so without support buildings fall down.  And trolls smash. . . 

There are some good options for customizing difficulty, but bosses still remain a real problem if playing solo.  Mods are also  supported.

I enjoy the game, ive had a lot of fun solo and playing with friends.  After a while i was overwhelmed with constant deaths.  The deaths cost me a lot of levels in my skills, but besides that the bosses were hard walls on solo play.  Im not sure im a fan of losing skills and inventory.

Game overall is well-done. There are some annoying parts, but most of the game is pretty good despite that.
Be prepared to die a lot of times if this is one of your first survival sandbox experiences.
Great for playing with friends, as the online experience feels natural and fully-integrated with the rest of the game. You can share worlds by turning them into servers pretty easily, which is great for discovering other people's worlds and seeing different ways people survive. All of this, and it is still only in Early Access, which is pretty surprising.

I would recommend checking some tutorials and wikis on the game before starting since it is a big learning curve at first, but you get the hang of it. The crow is a very good idea to guide the player, but after a while, it becomes kind of annoying and it isn't always there when you need it, so the wikis and tutorials can help a lot.",1705790841,1705790841,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

	Have you ever found yourself looking at the steam store and wondering what to buy next and a game catches your eye? So you look at the reviews just to find that some of them are all jokes and have very little to do with the game, and don’t tell you if it is worth buying. Well, this is where to look. In short Valheim is worth it for its history and mythology, its core elements,  and multiplayer and role playing. I have over two hundred hours on the game  and this is why you should buy Valheim.

	Valheim is a good purchase for many reasons, the first of which is because of its lore and Mythology. Not to sound like Matpat, but Valheim has great lore and mythology. It has rune stones that tell stories of people sent to the tenth realm, Valheim, by Valkyries of Odin; these runes also talk about Valheim’s creatures. You are sent there because of Odin’s enemies growing stronger. These enemies were sent to Valheim long ago. Valheim also follows the mythology well because they talk about things in Norse mythology including Munin, Hugin, Dwarves (Dark Elves), Yggdrasil (The GIant Ash Tree), Odin, and Thor. This all reveals that Valheim has good lore and follows  Norse Mythology.

            Valheim is also worth your money because of its core elements even with the grinding required, building, cooking, fighting, and crafting. It does a good job giving the player lots of options of how to build, and has a lot of variety in what you can build. For example a farm, house,fortress, dock , storage room, and portal room. It also has lots of foods with different effects and a good stamina and health system. It has pretty decent fighting with lots of weapons and a skill system of which you lose 10% of your skills on death. Its crafting system is vast-ranging from a cup for mead to mage staffs, and swords. Overall, Valheim has great core mechanics.

  	Valheim has amazing multiplayer and roleplaying aspects. Valheim can hold up to ten players in a world. While the game can be thoroughly enjoyed in single player too. Valheim is much more agreeable in multiplayer. Multiplayer leads to unique opportunities for role playing , and makes the game easier to tackle. You can make stories and adventures, build castles together, and slay dragons together! (Not only metaphorically) Valheim gives a group the ability  for people to have an amazing time together and makes the game replayable. This all goes to show that Valheim has wonderful multiplayer aspects.
	
	Overall Valheim is more than worth your money. It is simply amazing how well Valheim sticks to Norse mythology, the only main difference is ten realms instead of nine. It has breathtaking core mechanics, spectacular building, crafting, cooking, and fighting. For the cherry on top it has splendid multiplayer and role playing capabilities. In all, Valheim is more than worth your money, the only downside is you might get addicted. I urge you to buy and play Valheim today!

I'm a sucker for a game that lets me feel like I earned my place at the top of the food chain and this game is a constant reminder that your place at the top is earned every minute of play, it is not permanent. If you become lazy in your gameplay, you will suffer. The creatures of Valheim can smell your incompetence and your complacency. Go grab some wood in the middle of the night without eating first and tell me how well it goes. Usually not well.
Graphics are unique and not the ""Visual sandpaper for my fragile eyes"" kind of unique, but the ""This looks like a PS2 game with more depth"" unique. I like the style and I feel the gameplay works with the art style 99% of the time.
I'm sure it's fixed with mods, but I feel that my setup should be able to play this game with ease, but my fans are always reminding me that this game is taxing on my system. I run a 3080 laptop gpu, i7-11800H, with 32GB of RAM crammed into a laptop with a nice display if you are wondering if your system can handle this game (it should).

Is this game worth the money? I give it a hard yes. If you look at other reviews and notice the community stating that the game is in Early Access Hell you will think the game is not fun for the cash dropped on it, but I think the game, even in its current state, is worth the cash you will drop on it. Full price, on sale, as a gift from your cool friend who is into vikings too much, if you want it, just experience it.

I know it's still in early access, so, even though I could judge it a lot harsher, I'll focus on what has been implemented, rather than what it's lacking, and, it is lacking in plenty of areas.

One last thing before I go through the list, I know there are a lot of mods for this game, but, I think it would be unfair to rate it based on what modders did, or, on what the game will/could be.

This being said, here we go:

[b]The bad:[/b]
- This is barely a survival game. Sure...it has elements of the survival genre, but: You can't die of starvation/thirst, can't get sick, the only times the environment can directly kill you is if you're swimming without stamina, if you're out during a blizzard, or, if you jump into a fire. Maybe playing with friends is what killed it for me, but I did not feel like I was playing  survival game.
- The magic system f*****g sucks! Not only are the spells boring (look and variety), but they don't have any synergy and you unlock magic RIGHT BEFORE you fight the final boss. With taking it slow, exploring and trying out mechanics and what the game has to offer, I unlocked magic at roughly the ~215 hour mark.  So basically, right before you fight the final boss, the game is like: ""Hey! Do you want to completely change the fighting style you've been accustomed to and have been using?"" Once you unlock magic, there's pretty much nothing else you can do, except for fighting the final boss or farm/gather the final ingredients to upgrade your magic items. 
- Not all ""classes"" are viable. Except for the tank, that gets armor in every biome and the mage, that gets unlocked in the last biome, anything that relies on medium armor stops getting upgrades (armor-wise) after the mountain biome. That left the people I played with terrified of Deathsquitos, since pretty much anything could one/two shot them.
- Taming system sucks (less than the magic system). The only thing taming is good for is getting the resources off of the animals without having to hunt them. The Lox might be a bit of an exception, but, the moment you go to the next biome, any pet becomes next to useless.
- Crafting system becomes cluttered after unlocking everything the the first 3-4 biomes. By ""end game"", I actually started dreading crafting due to through how many items I needed to scroll before reaching what I needed.
- Lag. I've rarely had it, but the people I played with complained about it, despite having solid hardware that surpasses the ""Recommended"" resources. My internet plan gives me 1.000 Mbp / s and I'm using a Legion Pro 5, o I know I wasn't the issue either.
- Farming Simulator. I mean, unless you're joining the game with friends and you're able to split tasks, get ready to spend most of your time on Cooking/Farming/Gathering/Hunting.

[b]The good:[/b]
+ Great scenery. Despite its simplistic graphics, you would honestly miss out if you wouldn't stop every now-and-then and take in your surroundings.
+ Awesome weather effects. ESPECIALLY if you're out sailing during a storm.
+ Biomes  are well defined. You can see the difference in atmosphere when entering one biome vs another. Sometimes it creeps up on you, sometimes it hits you like a shovel in the face.
+ Sound localization. It's honestly, one of the best I've seen.
+ Base building. Despite not being incredibly varied, you can really make some great buildings/bases with a bit of imagination. The best thing about it though, is how much you can make your base look like an actual village....it's, honestly...wow...just...wow.
+ Combat. No target locking, great hitboxes + you can use the environment (even the weather) to your advantage.
+ Resources in all biomes get used throughout the game, resources rarely become obsolete (except for flint and what bosses drop)
+ Distinct looking armor. Be it from biome to biome, or one ""class"" from the other.
+ Weapon diversity. They're basically categorized into Slashing/Piercing/Blunt/Ethereal, but each weapon that belongs to  class is clearly distinct and invites a different play style.

TL;DR: The game is cool when played with friends, but there are a number of poorly designed elements, that waste so much of your time, and, honestly, considering how much time you need in this game to do anything because of this, if you're not going in with other people, I'd advise you to try something else. 

I'll keep playing this game and will be updating the review based on changes that happen, since I have a thing for completing the games I start anyway.",1705710320,1705710320,False,2,0,0.513731062412261963,0,True,False,True

In short: The bosses seem to be balanced around 5 players in mind. They don't scale to the number of players nearby or in the server, making bosses like Yagluth, the 5th boss, WAY too tanky. Combine this with their attacks aggro'ing random add's that are immune to the bosses attacks and the fact that you have to spend about 20 minutes to beat the boss if things go well and this culminates in an awful experience around the early-mid game transition.

But I invested in an early access, so I'm entitled to ask for actual development.
You got my hopes high (even an animated trailer!), and dragged those through the dirt.

Edit: with how much money you guys have made, you'd think you'd pull through the Early Access promise after all this time. Content dropped: minimal

Before this game:
_i had a company, an enterprise
_i had a wife and children
_i had my house and my car and my bike
_i used to workout 20 hours a day
After this game:
_i killed my wife for insurance money to buy a better pc
_sold my children to buy this game for my friends ,not to play alone
_my assistant kicked me out of my job
_i burned my vehicles to stay warm in the winter

Now I am HOMELESS ....... D:

BUT WHO CARES ABOUT REAL LIFE :D 
I have VALHEIM 
I have tons of castles, longhouses , coins , lands ,hommies  and most of all PIGSs
and when i get back to my tent (next to big trash bins in WallStreet , third tent on the row, beween Dirty Rolland' illegal tattoo show tent and John the cutthroat's) I am happy that i will get to play valheim again. 

So if you want to have a family, a job ,house , etx and LIVE the life of a normal CEO, don't buy this game.
BUT IF you want to ENJOY the life (virtual life) to the fullest like a real VIKING Who makes sausages out of the dead corpses of his fallen viking fellows ,
Valheim is just for u :D

Prepare that there is quite huge change you need to uninstall and install after every update, because basically every update can broke the installation. Also, don't think about modding, as every update breaks all major mods.

Game itself could be good, but there are too many problems.

After the H&H update the food system has been totally broken. I.e. foods are divided to stamina, health or eitr foods. The reasoning for this was that you can eat stamina foods when exploring, health foods before fights, etc. Unfortunately the game mechanics make one need stamina always. I.e. without stamina foods you cannot hit enemies. One other argument was to in old system players only ate best foods. That hasn't changed at all. Best foods have just changed.

Most not entry level enemies are horrible sponges that you need to hit few dozen times to kill em. And they rarely come alone. And the engine often makes everything harder to you than it should (see later comment about visibility.)

Most enjoyable biomes are first two, meadows and black forest. After that the game become slog. Apparently game is developed without proper plan, as enemy stats are rebalanced everytime new biome is published, or otherwise larger update is published. (Anyone remember one hit one kill deathsquitos? Currently I actually miss those.)

Developers don't seem to understand the difference between difficult and tedious. Every major update has added more grinding to game, which makes it boring. This is easily seen in the fact that same progression is seen in every aspect of the game. E.g. workbench needs to be upgraded N times. Then forge needs to upgraded N times. Then Black forge needs to upgraded N times. Also artisan table needs to be upgraded N times (in the future). Food preparing cauldron needs to upgraded N times. That wouldn't be such issues if that wasn't cumulative. To max upper tier crafting tools one needs to upgrade lower tier tools to max. Also, be prepared to start from zero when moving to new biome. Old stuff doesn't disappear, but often is too far to practically usable. Teleports make this little easier to stand, but one cannot teleport with certain items, most importantly ores. So either take a multiple long and dangerous walks or sea voyages, or forget better equipments. 

Also, the game development is super slow. Thankfully now there are multiple developers, but that hasn't been visible in development speed. Most updates offer cosmetic changes and break all mods, or even the base game.

Worst thing is that sometimes the the game just breaks, even without any updates. Seems unity is really poor engine.

One example of OLD problem with game is that visibility between camera and character is not cleared, which often causes player not to see what's in front of character, which too often makes fighting just random button mashing while hoping for best (esp. forests are full of low branches). Best way to lose 5% of your skills is to die because you couldn't see where to hit/shoot because there was a tree behind the character. That is kind of problem which should have been ironed out before going early access. Only reason to leave it game is to artificially make the came harder.

I you like grinding repetitive tasks then this may be your game. Or if you play with friend, so you can share the repetition.

Best when played with friends on own dedicated server. But then again frequent (cosmetic and unnecessary) updates will break the game multiple times. Personally I'm really happy I managed to play this game through couple of times before H&H update made is worse.",1705521061,1705523280,False,8,0,0.524733483791351318,0,True,False,True

Turn on double resource rate to get a more enjoyable and manageable experience. One of the [strike]best [/strike]survival games, if you like building get this game.
The main issues are: grinding, boss battles, boating, de-sync. and combat/punishment.

I have just gone through a rush of this game and V Rising and both do things wrong and right that I wish they could just combine the right to make a perfect game. If you like combat probably don't get into this game for it. If you like building it is probably the best building system out there. I have friends who have literally put 40 hours into a server just building. I personally do not play this game for the building I play it for the progression and exploration.

The exploration is peak. It's why I play the game. There is so much to find explore and loot. There are dungeons in about every biome. Each with their own challenges and loot. Finding new land to uncover more dungeons and enemies is a joy and great. Each biome is so unique and brings their own challenges and fear. 

The enemy variety is exactly what a survival game needs. Each with their own strategies, attacks, strength and weaknesses. The progression system helps this by changing what your afraid of. Once you were scared of trolls, now you can just block your attacks. Perfection. 

Music is up there. Really fits the atmosphere and is great background noise while playing.

The repair system is something every game needs. You don't have to keep grinding for resources after you make something. You just need to click a hammer icon and that's it! Other survival games should take note.

Pros TLDR: Music is solid, exploration solid, durability/repair system, and enemy variety are great.

Now my gripes:
The grind is not fun... Every survival game has them but Valhiems are awful when they are awful. Unfortunately the worst one is right away. Double resource rate doesn't even solve it. The bronze age is awful because of copper. While minning copper you get stone. Sometimes when mining you don't get any copper when it breaks a chunk. This makes it extremely tedious! Then your boat isn't big enough to carry a whole lot. Additionally, you usually don't have the bigger weight capacity so you just can't get as much. Awful. Has made me want to stop playing every time. You also need tin. This is so much easier to get and you get so much more. Then when you bring it all back to base it's a 2:1 ratio for converting to bronze. You think it would be 2 tin to 1 copper. NOPE it's the other way around. Awful. It's not fun and causes bronze to be the longest age in the game. After all this bronze tools/armor feel like they cost so much to make!!! It needs to be reworked. I believe just swapping the 2:1 ratio will solve this issue or at least help. Silver is rough.

Until you have to GRIND FOR MORE later on!!! For plains gear you use iron again! So you usually have to go get more! This is an issue because you can't teleport metal. Instead you have to use a boat. Boating freaking sucks!!! Mistlands you need more iron!!!

The boating system is literally press w and then turn occasionally to adjust for terrain or wind. It's unengaging, slow, and so boring. Even with getting the moder buff, it can literally take a full hour to get back in some cases. It's boring in single player and multiplayer that you literally just pull out your phone while playing because there is nothing to do. Multiplayer it's worse cause only one person actually controls the boat. Here's the worst part... the developers want you to use their boating system... The community has been divided on this issue. The developers are persistent in not teleportation metal. The reason for this is you miss a huge part of exploration and utilizing a whole game system. But boating freaking sucks! I agree with the devs but backtracking is not fun.

So how to solve these issues because they do overlap. Me and my friends have discussed this a lot and have come up with two solutions. Ore progression system and boat minigames. Ore progression is basically, once you beat boss, you can teleport metal. Defeated bonemass? You can now teleport copper and tin. It still incentives exploration to new biomes just not old/completed ones. Boat minigames could be, paddle at the right time for a boost, regardless if your steering or not. These should solve the back tracking issue, and the boating issue.

But we're not done with complaints! Combat/boss battles/dying are pretty rough. The later you get the better but it's around the plains when it gets better. First off combat is simple. This is good. I like this. The light armor heavy armor system is not as good. Heavy armor slows you down too much. It should be like 3-2.5% movement reduction per piece, not 5% each. Dying is bad because you lose everything. This is normal for survival games but V Rising did a good job solving this for it's gameplay. I think valhiem should have you drop everything but leave like the helmet and cape. Why? Because the mountains suck. With freezing, and enemy damage and even fall damage. Getting your loot back is tedious especially last half of the game. The extra armor and cape would go a long way. Yes you can modify this but the developers want death to be punishing and I think a compromise would fix this issue. Also the levels lost on death are fine but I think the timeframe of no skill drain should be increased by like 1.5x.

This is a mixed issue... The boss battles. The scope for all of them are good. But some work way better than others.

Deer boy, yagluth, bonemass, are the best. The others are rough. Elder needs like one more attack move and is the least fun/engaging to fight. Moder needs like two more attacks and fixed ai. In multiplayer it doesn't know what to do so just sits there while being pummeled by arrows. Yagluth is good except for it needs to be less resistant to other weapons besides silver. The Queen needs to be nerfed in singleplayer. Either with a health decrease or less minions spawning. Not fun solo. Deer boy... is perfect don't change them.

The Bad TLDR: Ore progression needs work (bronze especially), boating is not fun or engaging (why did they not do the ocean update...), dying is a bit too punishing, bosses need tweaks or AI fixes.

Mistlands has ruined this game for me. You need to grind for so much, there isn't a guarantee of black core, seal breakers. Abandoned structures are annoying and don't guarantee a extractors or soft tissue. The terrain is good for stopping you from adventuring into the mistlands but the wisp does not reveal enough. Why does extractors cause roots to become diminished. Why do you need 15 black cores for the feather cape when they aren't guaranteed in mines. Why give the feather cape when your done with exploration in the mistlands. So many strange decisions that ruin the flow of the game and just add so much grind. For context you need to get 3 items in plains, mistlands you need 5: black core, soft tissue, extractor, sap, sealbreakers. Make crafting costs cheaper. Guarantee cores and seal breakers. Make wisp area bigger. The mistlands just isn't fun and is why I can't recommend valhiem now. 

Boating needs tweaking, mistlands needs fixing, grind needs tweaking, punishment needs tweaking, metal needs tweaking.",1613858391,1705468472,False,0,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True

You and your buddy postulate for 30 min on how you're gonna get your boat back, after losing all your good stuff. finally deciding to build another boat, sail across the ocean again, build a portal, get your boat and stuff back, portal back to the main base, and grow, slowly becoming a force to be reckoned with.

[list]
[*]this game requires such a massive resource grind that the lack of beasts of burden, ridiculously high mob spawning rate, and sometimes massive distances between biomes create a really tedious travel experience [i]especially[/i] when doing corpse runs.
[*]stamina seems to regen at a flat rate rather than a percentage of your max stamina, and the recovery rate is slooooow, and doesn't seem to recharge any faster from meals. the flow of combat is ruined if you bottom out or get caught by an enemy during or after a long sprint, and against some enemies having no stamina is essentially a death sentence. stamina regen needs a serious rework if they're trying to go for the soulslike-style of combat they seem to want
[*]raids by default happen way too often to the point of feeling like a chore. especially on a multiplayer server, and especially once trolls start joining raids, they become borderline unfair without resorting to popular cheese tactics like invincible terrain walls, and I consider needing to work around a game's mechanics instead of with them to be a major flaw in the overall design.
[*]building and farming requiring stamina doesn't make much sense to me. I don't see it ever becoming a tactical choice of any kind, just an artificial way to slow down your experience as you wait for your stamina to recharge at a snail's pace.
[/list]
that being said, there's lots to love as well such as varied weapon movesets (even if enemies have basically 1 or 2 attacks each), a really intuitive building system that lets you make some amazing structures, and cooking that actually feels like different foods serve different purposes.
overall, the game is tons of fun and I love so much of it, I think it would be a near-perfect survival game with just a few changes. add oxen or let tamed wolves or lox pull carts, add a way to travel with livestock via boat, make raids only happen when players are in a base for a certain amount of time maybe as a way of shaking things up, separate raids into waves maybe with a troll (etc) joining at the very end as a boss.

I'm a fan of Oblivion, Skyrim, but also throwing in the crafting, mining, farming, foraging explosion from the last 12 years.  Also a big fan of coop games.

The pros of this game first.  I think the best is the multiplayer mode.  It is so much fun to play with your friends.  Just pray you don't disconnect while riding a boat, or you're going to drown.   The combat is really fun and when you hit things it feels really good.  Even shooting arrows feels awesome when you sneak up on enemies.  The cooking system is fine, just make sure you have food and your stamina will go up.  This is a complaint it seems, but there are foraging opportunities and eventually you will have so much meat it doesn't matter.  Building stuff is also really good.  I was able to make a pretty cool log cabin mansion.  The gameplay is just so much fun.

The cons of this game next.  Points of interest are boring.  Very little variety in what you actually find in this giant world.  Same with enemies.  About 3 per biome.  The music starts out nice, but it gets old very fast.  There is one song per biome.    Do not go out at night.  Enemies will spawn and make your life hell.   Gathering resources is a time drain.   You can bring metal items through portals, but you cannot bring metal ore through portals.  Thank you for allowing us to turn this off.  This is nothing short of a time waster because there isn't much else to really do in the game.  I go back to my first point in the cons.  There is actually not much to do in this game, so it feels like the devs lengthen it with the metal gathering.  There are no quests, significant NPCs, points of interest.  The game loop is:  Get metal, make stuff, beat boss.  Get better metal, make stuff, beat boss.   While you might say ""that's all games,"" well yeah.  In this game, that is truly the only thing.  You have a large world to explore, but there isn't much in it. The devs have made it so you can bring ore through the portals so I like that aspect.  Another complaint is that since this game has gone HUGE in early access the updates have been very spaced out.    They've sold like 1 million copies and this is STILL in early access.

Anyway, this game is so much fun.  It is still VERY early access and there are a lot glaring flaws to me regarding a complete game.  I recommend it when it is on sale and buy it with your friends.  Don't expect much else other than running around, gathering resources, building stuff, and beating bosses.  The mod community I understand is creating bigger worlds with stuff in it.  So keep an eye out for that.  Problem is, this ends up like a Bethesda game that relies on everyone else to make it better.",1705415624,1705415624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all huge props to the devs,from graphics to gameplay everything is perfect overall but some minor things to be taken care of, what I mean by that is the grind system is hard (ik this is a survival game but please make resources easier to obtain) and increase the spawn rate of wildlife animals. For deers I have no problem in findin them but boars take a huge time and only spawn in meadows which costs me a lot of time to just get few leather.

It's also proficient in sucking out the fun of everything that you *hope* is going to be fun.

Let me give you a ""for instance"":

• There are these huge ox/buffalo type creatures that you can tame so you can ride. You'd expect to be able to shoot arrows while riding, for it to carry cargo or at least attack on command. Nope, you can only run with it. Taking it anywhere beyond the continent on which it was tamed is a herculean task involving bad collision with boats and praying that nothing catches its aggro. There also a skill attached to riding, somehow shoehorning even more grind.

• There are wolves you can tame, which we went through the lengths to get an elite 2-star one, only for it to be destroyed by enemies beyond the region native to the wolf. There are no upgrades you can give them and they also have the exact same trouble to get across the sea.

• Sea? There are boats in this game and you are going to spend a lot of time travelling in them, and for all this time, all you can do is either row extremely slowly or pray that the wind carries your sails. There is no more mechanics beyond fighting the occasional sea serpent, which is just spamming ranged attacks from the deck. It's a glorified cargo cart.

• Speaking of which, there is a weight mechanic in the game which affect the carts. If you, god forbid, try to use it for the intended purpose of carrying huge weights, it will barely move. Moving it around without rolling it over is a whole 'nother story as well.

This all happens in the [b]default, intended experience[/b]. I'd forgive all of these flaws if there were regular updates, but there are [b]not[/b]. Every single problem you face may be resolved by an active modding community, having you spend time synching your group up for even the most basic quality of life changes such as allowing multiple people to access the same chest, using items directly from nearby storage to craft or a button to quickly stack everything non-favourited into nearby chests. You can play this in a Rust-like manner, but really, just play Rust for that, at least it gets updated.

This game is absolutely a joy to play with or without friends. The sheer power you have with being able to shape the land and build your own structures adds a lot of depth that wouldn't be there if this were a standard ""hub world kill bosses take loot"" kind of game.

Now, if building and survival gameplay isn't necessarily your favorite thing in the world, or wouldn't entertain you by itself, then the bossing and combat seems and feels relatively simple. There aren't that many mechanics or deep tech to delve into, nor are there many bosses (5 in current version as of this review, 9 slated in total for final release as of this review), but the fighting is enjoyable enough to keep you busy while progressing through the equipment tiers.

Gameplay progression feels fine for a game of this scope at least from where I am in terms of progression, Only gripes is that it feels less like a slope upwards of progressing your gear, and moreso very large spikes in certain areas, which may either feel incredibly good or sluggish if having to anticipate and dig through an insane amount of rocks just for the middling amount of copper you get while on a mining trip.

Graphically, the game's texturing and polygons aren't extremely detailed, but is shaped by excellent lighting and shadows to create a pleasant and stylized feel, with wind strands streaking through the air and the swaying of branches and leaves to create a truly beautiful, breathing world with the graphical limitations self-imposed by the devs with the style of choice. The textures may be a sore spot for someone looking for extreme fidelity out of their souped up graphics cards, but this game can and probably will run on a potato PC just fine.

Overall, it is a great feeling survival game in Early Access, with all the potential being there, and plays currently like a simply good video game. The focus on PvE may push some away from enjoying it if they're looking for a PvP focused experience, but it feels great as a comfortable pick up and play game. I certainly hope there will be a lot more coming within Early Access and this game can be fully realized to all its potential.

Oh, and it's a 1GB game.

EDIT: (1/15/2024)

In the mist I crouched and walked stealthily, being careful not to scare the game I hunted. I needed food and deer skins to survive. Then something happened. With mouth agape, I stood up and looked but couldn't believe my eyes.

Towering over the trees and blackened ruins of a stone tower was a giant blue-skinned googly-eyed bald man just standing there, looking at me. He was just LOOKING at me and I, in my horror, was just looking at him. Then after a pregnant pause, I heard his thunderous footsteps as he lumbered and loped towards me. At first I thought it was my heart racing in my chest. No such luck. The biggest, scariest, Sesame Street muppet of all time had marked me as his quarry, his next victim. I looked at my pitiful flint-tipped spear and knew I had no chance, no strength or might to oppose this creature, my new nemesis.

So I ran. I ran and ran until the only sound was my own feeble footsteps splashing in shallow water and the croaking of angry little frog men.

Game is VERY friendly to groups. Fun, cooperative, and rewarding.

Game is NOT friendly to solo play. Broken, frustrating, fundamentally designed to make you miserable.

Valheim's procedural algorithm is created to make everything as miserable as possible for you. With friends and backup the gameplay loop is MUCH more bearable and enjoyable. However, solo, the game is a gruelling, messy, janky, unforgiving mess.

Powerful mobs will spawn directly on top of you during menial tasks. Multiple mobs are more overpowered than bosses and spawn on a regular basis in the worst spots at the worst times. Be prepared to regularly fight for your life against generic mobs for 10-20 minutes just to get back to mining and collecting materials. 

Carrying capacity is incredibly low and base server settings do not allow you to carry precious good through portals. Keep in mind the game world is absolutely MASSIVE. Valheim believes the intended way to play is to Run, Walk, Swim, and Sail for literal hours at a time back and forth for 2 dozen precious metals, rinse, and repeat. And did I mention that building new equipment and upgrading them requires HUNDREDS of precious metals?

Valheim is NOT a casual game which is evident just by reading the comments - Players bragging about 2000+ hr playtimes, not because they really enjoy the game, but because that is what you can look forward to if you want to play the game as intended. Hours upon hours of running and sailing aimlessly, dying, and spending even more hours trying to return to your body to get your equipment back.

There is a stark difference between rewardingly difficult games, and whatever this is. Valheim will test the absolute limits of your patience in all the worst ways - Through unbalanced combat, punishing exploration & traversal, and a bizarre hate for single players. 

If you have a desire to spend money on this game, make sure you have a crew of friends to play with the get the most out of it. If not, I highly recommend you spend your money on any other survival game out there. Try out Sons of the Forest!",1705297312,1705297312,False,2,2,0.427641361951828003,0,True,False,True

Other menus are kept attached to other items that fulfill various tasks, and they also just keep it simple.  That alone makes it my favorite.  Add in the beautiful visuals and genuinely addictive and intuitive build system, and the game doesn't have to do anything to pull you a certain way.  It just naturally makes you want to explore.

The building system is underwhelming and uninteresting, with prerequisites for crafting (required roofing for utilizing already built workshops) resulting in the player never naturally building a base and thus haphazard uninspired base building occurs. From the building choices I observed, the player is given limited building pieces to construct their base, dissuading the player from constructing an aesthetically pleasing or utilitarian abode unless they actively work against the game's current interface.

Grinding is also prevalent within the game, with the player having to constantly collect multiple of the same material for small, incremental progression rivaling the grinding of mobile gaming.  For example, to craft the starting tool, the player is forced to wander across the landscape to find several objects that lie on the ground to craft a starting ax. The time it takes to find the starting materials just to get into the game is absurd, as they are spawned widely across the staring area and the game needs the player to pick up a total of around 5 of each material, resulting in the player wasting around 5 minutes of their time to craft the starting tool. Furthermore, optimized collection of materials with tools is still atrocious. For example, collection of wood with an ax required the player to stare at a tree for around 3 minutes and click the left mouse button. Eventually, the tree will split into two smaller logs which require an additional 1 minute of chopping for each log before retrieving materials. Thus, the player is forced to grind with tools for minimal materials even after devoting significant time to retrieving the materials required for crafting and upgrading such tools. 
The worst materials are animal specific drops. I was often waiting for boars to drop certain fabrics required for almost all starting technology and technological upgrades. These boars not only take a while to be found, they spawn randomly across the biome with painfully slow re-spawn rates, resulting in players spending most of their time ""gaming"" by walking across the landscape and hoping to maybe observe a boar or two. While I am new to the game, future technology and building seems to replace the tedious grind of early game animals and materials with a more tedious grind of rarer animals and materials, giving no significant sense of progression.

Technological progression is also poorly implemented into the game at its current state. There are different technological grades of materials that are unlocked as you discover more resources. For example, a flint ax replaces a stone ax. But, the game also gives you options to upgrade your current, inferior technology if the player has certain resources. What makes this system confusing is that the refining of inferior technology and creation of better technology are both locked behind the same buildings required for progression. Thus, the false sense of choice in progression is an area of redundant game design that only serves to confuse the player and waste resources that could be better spent in newer technologies. 
The upgrading of materials also mimics similar design to that of mobile gaming, where minor stat changes are accompanied by progressively more tedious and difficult grinding to unlock the next technological building. Upgraded technology never significantly improves the base tools stats, neither does upgraded technology introduce new, interesting mechanics to a tool. 
Additionally, technological progression itself requires more ugly buildings to house all the technological buildings in the same space. Furthermore, the technological buildings each force the player to grind for more of the same resources, artificially extending game play with boring, ""fetch quest"" assignments.  

Skill progression did interest me, until it became blatantly clear it was another grinding ordeal with diminished returns for progressively more tedious actions. In essence, the player is rewarded for completely a repetitive task (like cutting or running) by improvements to the in-game character's stats (like damage-per-second or stamina). The game is then able to punish the player for dying by removing progression in skills. The problem with this system is that a player must also grind these skills, along with the obvious grinding of materials, for a play-style outside of ranged abuse of the game's AI. Furthermore, the player is forced to slow their progression in material collection to preserve their current skills, or slow their progression in skills by collecting materials and potentially dying. Both systems require immense time investment, resulting in a painfully boring elongation of already stretched game-play. This dissuades the player from exploring and adds another artificial obstacle for player progression and enjoyment. 

Finally, combat is awful. Click left, abuse idiotic AI, and grind for better gear. 
There is very little depth to combat, as each normal encounter on the map involves a two hit KO to any opposing animal. The combat itself involves a brief animation followed by a randomized range of damage applied to the creature if you hit the opponent. No depth, very little variation, and each weapon is locked behind grinding progression of a separate skill. The designed opponents, besides the bosses, have no good attacks that you can choreograph and counter, and the combat does not motivate the player to refine his/her skill in the game. The combat essentially operates as progress check for the player's current gear, with the player unable to interact with new or novel areas until they did enough grinding and mindless wandering around the previous area. 

The game lacks depth, does not respect the player's time, artificially limits enjoyment with obtuse mechanics and game design, and is difficult to enjoy as a single player experience. I would not recommend Valheim, but if you enjoy casual survival games, you might be able to make this work with friends.",1705261256,1705261256,False,3,0,0.462442696094512939,2,True,False,True

Two years later we've returned, and in greater numbers. With a whole new biome  to conquer in the mistlands, and the ashlands just around the corner, we are all having a great time!

The survival aspects of the game strike a great balance between difficult and forgiving by not forcing you to constantly eat unless you expect to be in combat. The stamina system can be a bit annoying but is meaningful to keep combat challenging.

I still recommend mods like Valheim+ in order to tweak some of the settings to your liking (automating resource production to minimize tedium, or improving skill gain for little used actions like swimming or sneaking)

Building is my personal favorite part of any game like this, and while the need for structural supports can be frustrating, I believe it helps you to be more creative and think more like an actual designer than just slapping together some huts. I do wish for some additional pieces/options in the building mode to allow for even more creative builds!

When the game was released in 2021, we were all quite excited, playing non-stop and defeating almost every boss until we reached a certain point where we decided to pause and await the next significant update. Now, here we are in 2024, and the game remains essentially unchanged from where we left it. It seems like the developers are focused more on monetization than providing substantial updates, and it's becoming apparent that they may be running out of ideas.

Also, the balancing is great, and there are a number of options to increase or decrease the difficulty on different aspects of the game independently of each other - so if you just want tougher or easier monsters, no problem.

Valheim is a challenging, highly punishing, time-consuming game that highly relies own players' own intrinsic reward to provide satisfaction. The game at its current stage is still very rough, and I would advise suspecting its ""overwhelmingly positive"" review as they might come from true enthusiasts of such genre but not applicable to other casual players, much like the Souls series.

[olist]
[*]Designated Difficulty
The intended default difficulty of this game is highly unforgiving and punishing, which shows on aspects including combat, exploration, resource management and death penalty. 
The combat is methodical like Souls, where micromanaging stamina and distancing is crucial. However, the game is plagued with slow stamina regen and damage sponge enemies, meanwhile even the slightest uneven terrain would make you unable to hit your enemy. In mid-late game, it became extremely tedious to fight even just a single enemies, which in reality they often come in packs. 

Depend on the player, the exploration of Valheim's world may either be ""spiritual experience like meditation"" or ""a boring field trip on an unnecessarily large empty world"". There are little to no reward for exploration other than fining dungeons for key resources for progression. Running and jumping around consumes stamina rapidly, yet even the tiniest elevation requires jumping to get on. The world of Valheim is broken into multiple islands separated by oceans. It is inevitable to visit multiple islands in order to complete the game. However sailing is rather annoying before end-game as players have to rely on the unpredictable wind direction to sail. All they can do is wait an unclear time for the wind to match their destination.
Resource management, mainly gathering, is extremely demanding. Lumbering, Mining, Hunting and Dungeon Crawling has to repeated for a ridiculous amount of times. Combined with slow stamina regen, strict weight restriction, bad world generation and long enemy aggro distance, most of the play time would be spent fetching stuff across the lands and running away from tedious fights.

Dying in Valheim is a huge pain in the ass. Similarly to survival games like Minecraft, you will lose all your inventory upon death and get a chance to retrieve them if you could manage to revisit your death spot. But dying in Valheim is much worse than just that. Not only you lose hard-earned skill points, your loss equipment are often results of enormous resource grinding, especially when you are in the later game. However, your enemies will not despawn upon your death, so you now have to deal with the enemies that already poses a death-threat, using previously replaced lower tier equipment. If you are unlucky enough to die on the seas, you will lose tens of hours of grinding, irretrievable by any means.

[*]Bad UI Design and Information Presentation
The UI of Valheim has its own aesthetics, but overall it is just incredibly inconvenience and will hurt your eyes. The texts are small but the panels are clumsy, and all options are squeezed together like a tightly packed can of tuna. 
The game also doesn't tell you enough what you need to do for progression. One might argue this is ""intended to promote exploration"", which could've been an okay idea if the world weren't so dull and empty, and traversing wasn't as hindered as swimming in a pool of tar. Most of the time, you are off to wander the empty world trying to figure out ""where do I get this material""
, ""what is this material for"", ""where is the next boss"", ""what does this key item do"", all while scratching your head in frustration and confusion and exhaustion, because none of the items have informative description and the random world gen decided to not spawn key structures required for progression.

[*]Demanding Resource Management
The vast reviews talking about woodcutting is not just a joke, but more like a ""haha Im fine"" moment with intense internal screaming. The amount of resources required for doing literally anything in this game is ridiculous. Even if you played with a ""semi-creative mode"" that removes costs for building structures second time onward, you would still need hella lot of resource for crafting. And by the mean time, useless drops clumps up your storage like crazy, because somehow the game doesn't have a way to properly dispose them other than throwing them far away from your base, or into the ocean, or on the roof where you won't pick up accidentally. 

[*]Lack of Sense of Progression
In Valheim, there are no permanent powerups unlocked as you progress. The only way to get stronger is through intense grinding for equipments and skills, which both will be lost during death. And worse, skills only provides unnoticeable minor improvements, and better equipments from 10 hours or grinding only provide like a laughable 10-20% increase in power/defense. 

[*]Shallow Combat System
As aforementioned the game has a souls-like combat that plays around stamina management, but it severely lacks depth and varieties. Different monsters have similar movesets, just different attributes like HP, Def and Atk. So is player movement, using different weapon only brings a small deviation in attack animation, and unlocking new weapons only brings stats improvement. Due to its grind-heavy nature, the game forces you to fight the same enemies over and over again, which further worsened in the end game when they come in unavoidable hordes with ridiculous HP and Atk. The (current) final boss of the game is the ultimate sh1tshow of all of these issues combined, and is almost artistic in a way that it builds up so many frustration to a point I reached nirvana clarity after defeating it.

[/olist]

In conclusion, I would say the game is highly overrated, and will not recommend it unless you are the very specific kind of players it is tailored and targeted towards.",1705230006,1705230176,False,1,1,0.448735624551773071,1,True,False,True

The hitboxes in this game are absolute shit and haven't been fixed since it's release, and their discord server won't let you post without giving them your phone number for whatever the fuck reason. I can't recommend this to anyone until they fix them. It's so bad, and so well known, there WAS a mod that specifically fixed this issue, but apparently the latest patch broke it again... If you read other bad reviews for the game, they also mention this issue..

Aside from this game breaking issue, especially with the latest content in the mistlands, where everything's sharp peaks, deep valleys, huge slopes, and dungeons with stairs or sloped walls, it's a fun game. Hence the 700 hours or so I've played... But as of the Mistlands patch? Nah.. Save your money till they fix it, but don't hold your breath... It's been like this since day 1. It was never this bad though until they threw it in your face with the mistlands expansion.

1/14/2024.    Went back to play online with a buddy of mine.... Yep, the game is still ass and I regret wasting the free bandwith to install it.

The hitboxes are still absolute dogshit. Also, apparently now things can spawn directly behind you while you're traveling through an open field that WAS previously completely empty.

Also there is no lock on so you are likely to miss some swings. The enemy pathfinding seems to be broken or just poorly made because the enemy will run at you, take a swing then run away then run away some more then use their ranged attack so you are playing catch with your enemies. If you happen to be in a group of them say for example five 3 are running away 1 is taking a swing and the last one is using range attack. Building is like Rust but bad, the building block snapping is poorly made. The structures have decay but you don't have anything to prevent it so you just have to repair it. This is annoying because the game encourages you to build base in every goddamned biome in this game because the resources you mine in them cannot be taken through a portal. And the resources and their rates I had to increase the rate to 3x because I played 4 man coop. Let's take the Bronze tier as an example . You need 15 Bronze bars for a full set of Bronze armor 1 bronze bar is made from 2 copper bars and 1 tin bar so for the full set of Bronze armor you have to mine 30 copper and 15 tin that is 45 ores you can't take through the portal and now we have to multiply it by 4. And that is not all because we have to make weapons and upgrades as well. If you want everything from the bronze tier it makes 292 Bronze bars according to the wiki. The best part about this is that it gets much worse. For the next tier we have Iron and the full set costs 60 iron to make. So this is just a massive waste of time. Dungeons are boring, you fight like 3 skeletons in a hallway. Swamp is by far the worst biome in this game. The leeches in water are a pain to hit because of the hitboxes and because they are under you (could be fixed by lock on) (if you steal something at least steal the whole thing not just half of it). The map is needlessly big. This is not an exploration game, you just find biomes that are the same with the same structures and enemies every time. The bosses have like 2 attacks they spam and are quite underwhelming but the buffs you get from them are nice and useful. In conclusion, massive waste of time because of grinding, annoying teleportation rules, half-assed souls like combat, carry weight, poor cart mechanics and other experiences I’ll rather forget. Buy it on sale if you really want it. Play it with friends so you can grind your life away in the african cobalt mines together.

N.H.D ACCESSIBILITY Team and NHN Game Testing Core,
This game passed with flying colors.

As always  comments are turned off  to prevent trolls. 
I only allow devs to comment as long as they don't troll or disrespect that gamers rights.
: review will be updated as I play: But I noticed a few things.

Warning:  save file system some times bugs out... including cloud steam save.
its random and not easily replicated: large build server stability is a big issue

1. Absolutely love this game.
I Discovered the console menu( dev commands and debug menu)
( which does need a few updates like)
(host a server option)
(updated console dev menu using pictures and predictive text command shown in the actual chat box not below,
so for example spawn will show all options in chat box.)
( controller improvements for dev mode: so you can activate it via a menu and controller button)
(have the items updated to modern names)
(Have the new items in there)
(updated ulmited stamina / no food)
( set weight limit)

BUT there are a few things that will help streamers.

2. Night is still way too dark and Torches only make it worse: 
this game needs a night and day brightness setting. 
(this will also help photo-phobics who play) 

3: while controller systems were updated:
Build / placement/ destruction is still way too choppy( i kept destroying stuff i didn't want to)

4: tools:
A beginner wooden shovel for digging and flattening land is a basic tool and need to be a thing.
Upgraded version of tools like the hammer, hoe, cultivator( allows planting of the seed bushes).
(The hoe and cultivator AOE does need a squared off, rounded off, large small and medium option) 
they also need to upgrade that hoe so it can make Land adjustments like rock caves, caves, pools of water.
stone land bases.

5. They did not improve the very harsh things in the beginning of the game
(or in general) :
The low health/ stamina( having to eat every 10- 30 minutes: not cool)
The constant bag/ tool drops( have a setting to adjust it to players style)
the constant enemy attacks at the start of game or while building
(there should be a start game ward em off item{ (have a starter quest to help with this in the starting area, enemies can't brake these.( use norse god of animals and god of harmony statues)
Item movement ( have certain items movable once built {example: workbenchs. and upgrades)
workstation upgrades( the range to connect them is 2 short for  decorators who decorate or make large space.)
taming and animal farming need big energy improvements.

6. Dropped backpacks need a distance indicator and light beacon.
visible from any where: Still not a thing: hate always having to check the map.

7: setting improvements are needed: (love some of the improvements)
night/day/storm settings brightness settings( set each one individually)
turn on and off more visuals (for example I don't need to see grass move, with wind currents on)

8/ 8.5:
 lastly you do need a cardinal directions in game.
Some people do like to completely customize the build map
it would be nice if the camera did actually move under water for those who found a way
to build under the water.( i personally don't put building there but i do terraform the land.)
It would also be nice if the terraform heights were uniform throughout the seed, minimum and max height 
( i for example am building a land mass in the middle of a lake}
tearing down and replacing every land mass in my seed)

But over all this game is Friggen sweet:
when its not overloading graphic cards or crashing.
Or taking  an hour to collect stuff or place a house base:
Or night time isn't causing tremendous eye straine and migraines

Now i found the play as a god menu.
( I love this because it it allow me to log more hours in solo game)
( it also allows me to have Preventive ASD Seizure moments taking care of)
it would be nice if you upgraded this in sum way to make it easier to access:
also had an official page with a complete and correct list of commands.
and have one for multi player with the host in control.

you do need to make improvements to the map seed generation
for those who like to do Lots of custom massive buildings.
and don't want dev mode on.

I know quite a few players who like stone iron and marble buildings and would like
seeds riddled with marble stone  and iron. but they also like completely level land to build on from the lowest point
to max height in game. they also hate the sailing aspect and would prefer to stay on one massive island with many zones for end game and story mode.

You awaken in a realm of rain and darkness, scantly clad in a loincloth that is, by the time the Valkyrie dumps you on the waiting dirt, no doubt inundated with rainwater and espoused effluent from being flown over an unknown land in the claws of a warrior's angel.
Get used to that loincloth folks, You'll find yourself wearing it far more often than you care to admit in a public forum such as a steam review.
Valheim is a curious game to look at from the store page, and I didn't initially buy it when I first saw it. This game is correctly advertised for sure, it is a Survival game, It is an epic building sandbox, It is a satisfying Monster basher, It is Norse themed. So why wasn't I interested?
Valheim is packaged up and displayed in such a way it makes you THINK its just another survival game, such as Rust, or Day Z (Worth noting, I have played neither.) but with the option to forgo teaming up with your fellow peasants and go crawl through dungeons by yourself the old fashioned way, but it had the feel it would be missing something vital by doing so. So i pondered and pondered if it was worth getting.

I hold my tankard of mead up to you Iron Gate, not only did you blow my expectations so far out of the water the word ""overkill"" in the dictionary now has a picture of my bewildered mug under it. 

Valheim takes the elements of survival we are all used to, Wood chopping, firemaking, basebuilding stone digging etc and makes you work to the knuckles in such a way that is unbelievably rewarding. I got this game 3 months ago and didnt even shut it down until i hit the end of the current content. It is unbelievably addictive, and satisfying. Items that you once coveted in the early game become as common as currency later on and you look into your chest full of surtling cores and feel like you really did make Surtur your Bit-

The game's aesthetic is gorgeous, it is minimalistic yet charming, and with the right know-how it really doesn't matter when your building your mighty mead hall. The mechanics make the world feel dynamic, and the game encourages you to spread your sails and set up outposts, although in time these outposts become little more than hubs for resources as your home moves to the next biome. This almost clinical state of affairs really does show in the late game, when you find yourself trapesing across the blackforest, ignoring the hoard of greybeards following you like fan girls flocking behind that dude from JLS, because your one damn bit of copper short of making the final upgrade for a crafting station that's several chapters beyond on the progression tree.

But that is also what makes the gameplay of Valheim so appealing. What was once challenging becomes trivial with hard work. You earn your place in this world through blood, sweat, and many corpseruns in that loincloth. The game never stops giving you challenges and surprises that knock you sideways, but with clever thinking and learned skills you can triumph.

Note the word, Can.
Because Valheim is a vindictive Bast-

To use an oceanic analogy, as you spend alot of time sailing in this game (also, really enjoyable, takes skill, and has nice music.). It is like flicking a prawn at someone and them pimpslapping you in return with a giant sea serpent. Not only are you bamboozled because where the hell did that sea serpent come from but you stare at your screen going, what the hell just happened?
That is the sensation Valheim will give you, quite often. The difficulty curve is harder to scale than a cliff on a pogostick. It wasnt until the mistlands I learned you get parry bonuses, Thats the last developed biome by the way.

I would recommend this game to anyone. It is endearing, charming and hard. It makes you really feel like the Allfather is testing the very best in this realm. Word of advice? Bag the Crystal Battleaxe. That thing is Gorgeous and I used it all the way through. 

I really look forward to where Iron gate go in this game. If i could recommend anything to them it would be maybe the inclusion of more furniture options, as my mighty mead hall has the same things in every room and it feel a little empty.

Keep up the good work Lads!

This game is a joy, I usually don't enjoy the grind this genre usually comes with, however, something about Valheim is just SO satisfying
The building is really fun and I've lost many days between me and my friends building our village and numerous outposts
The combat is reasonably simple, however, when you first encounter the next biome it is scary, those monsters can and WILL kill you if you let your guard down just for a second, once you move to the next area and you're geared up the previous is no longer a threat

It's a hell of a game with a tonne of content to discover, vast lands to explore, many monsters to kill and of course, build and expand you viking village.

I'll be putting much more time into Valheim before it's done and I look forward to every second.

It's also the most polished game I have played in a very, very long time. I have encountered no bugs, no crashes, no weirdness, it is as polished as games should be and the developers should be proud that they've put out such a well made product.

They clearly care about the game and it is a labour of love. Passion, care and attention to detail are things that this game has in spades, if you're on the fence about this one and you enjoy other survival games this one is a no brainer, pick it up and enjoy your new viking life

Skall!

Edit: A few hundred hours later and a new world aimed at preparing for the Ashlands.

It's still a fantastic game, the Mistlands was terrifying, beautiful and gross all at the same time, (I'm looking at you, Ticks). The new gear and addition of a new combat style added some great variety to the game and the world modifiers allow me to play as I please, reducing the grind a little and allowing me to portal metals.

There's something for the hardcore and the more casual builder players. 
Also, the game is huge and expands massively as you get further and unlock new materials and crafting stations.

Valheim forces you to explore all around the world and makes it easy and enjoyable with boats and a nice map.
Enemies can't be taken for granted, you can't just spam attacks and while the combat is much more simple than something like a souls-like, the amount of weapon types, the parrying and the stamina makes the combat satisfying and allows for multiple playstyles. 

The building system is generous and even super simple houses are super fun to build! There's a grid but you are not forced to stick to it and the game allows for 26° and 45° angles. 
[u]BUILDERS BEWARE[/u] Monsters and especially raids, will f*ck up your base. Monsters when not able to target you, will aim for player built structures and tamed creatures, leaving you with all the items on the ground. While the first raids are easily defeated. A troll can make quick work of any wooden structure, ruining your day.

It has a gorgeous minimalist art style complemented with modern lighting, and a Terraria-esque progression system that compels the player to explore their world and all the differing biomes and landscapes it has to offer. Considering that this game was developed by 5 people, I am blown away by the amount of content there is to sink your teeth into. The stakes are high, the combat is engaging, and preparation is key. The game's survival mechanics encourage the player to develop their infrastructure and plan their journeys carefully. If the gameplay loop of gather -> build -> craft -> explore -> fight appeals to you, and you're the type of person who enjoys feeling the rewards of their preparation, then I would recommend this game.

[h2] Pros: [/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Food:[/b] The most engaging food mechanic I've encountered. Food doesn't exist solely to fill a hunger meter or heal the player, it is the primary means of progression in terms of upgrading the player's key stats: health and stamina. Consuming food provides substantial buffs to these values, and makes food a central focus of the games progression system. It encourages players to search for new food opportunities and cook a healthy variety of meals, rather than acquiring a surplus of one food item and forgetting about the entire mechanic.
[*] [b]Building:[/b] The building system in Valheim is much more flexible than meets the eye, and introduces interesting challenges that are not present in other games. For instance, structural stability is a crucial consideration a builder must make, as it prevents them from building too high or too far without the proper considerations for structural support, including the strength of the material used. Smoke ventilation is also crucial, and therefore chimneys are not aesthetic choices but mandatory for the proper functioning of a shelter. Working around these mechanics provides a unique challenge and sense of reward.
[*] [b]Exploration:[/b] Exploring the diverse world of Valheim is a rewarding experience, allowing the player to immerse themselves in the game's beautiful art style and fantastic soundtrack. It's exciting to find dungeons scattered throughout the world and discover the unique resources and enemies each biome has to offer. [i]Sailing[/i] is present in this game, and acts as the superior form of long-distance travel. This leads me to my next point..
[*] [b]Oceans:[/b] The oceans in this game are fun to sail for two reasons: water and weather mechanics. Weather is a consideration players must make before setting sail, for the seas produce towering waves and monstrous creatures that will seek your end. It is both humbling and hilarious to be thrashed about on the seas with your friends while trying to make it to safe land before shattering among the rocks.
[*] [b]Combat:[/b] While not the most complex combat system, Valheim offers a fun challenge that requires carefully timed inputs and preparation. There is substantial enemy variety, and simple button mashing is sure to get you killed. Boss fights are also exciting with unique mechanics and grand scale battle. Valheim's RPG skill system complements combat well, as you can tangibly feel your character improve as their skill increases.
[*] [b]Enemy AI:[/b] Surprisingly, the AI is intelligent enough to be a real nuisance sometimes. Their pathing works quite well and is difficult to cheese, while their sense of self preservation is both amusing and effective. Enemies respond to a players behavior, if a player behaves like prey, the enemies will be emboldened, if the player instead behaves with the intent to kill, the AI will behave more cautiously and even retreat from a fight if the player shows enough confidence. Some players might find this irritating, I find it hilarious and sensible.
[*] [b]Multiplayer:[/b] It goes without saying that this game is best experienced with friends. The multiplayer works quite well, and the process of building your base and exploring new lands is most rewarding when others benefit.
[/list]

[h2]Cons:[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]Lack of ocean content[/b]: Although the oceans are fun to explore on a mechanical level, the game would supremely benefit from the addition of more content to the oceans. For example, enemy ships that track you down and attempt to sink you and your crew, more sea monsters to fear and hunt, and deeper ship customization. I imagine the tension that would be felt hauling a large shipment of ore while being chased by a fleet of raiders would add more excitement to the game.
[*] [b]Could use more furniture variety:[/b] While the amount of furniture already in the game is sufficient, as someone who draws most of their enjoyment from building, more options would provide a great deal of incentive. It is hard to list this as a true con however, as it is more of a personal preference.
[*] [b]Needs faster modes of travel on land:[/b] Unfortunately, the fastest way to travel over land is by foot. I believe the game would be improved significantly with the introduction of mounts and animal drawn carriages.
[/list]

Overall, Valheim is a survival game made with love and care. Anyone who enjoys carving out a place for themselves in a harsh land, adventure, and discovery will enjoy this game.

I traveled to the mountains (where it's pointless to build a base since wolves and/or drakes will demolish it) since i needed [b]MORE[/b] silver to make armor (20 silver per piece? are you fucking with me?) but, uh oh!, you'll freeze to death, so had i to wait around while the fucking frost mead was being made, but uh oh! wolves kill you in 2 bites, and they spawn in groups of 3, they also run faster than you.

But anyway, I get to the mountain, make myself a wolf cape so no more mead, nice. I then encountered a stone golem, that tried to fight a drake, but the stone golem cant hit the drake, and the drake only deals frost damage, which the golem is immune to... So i had to run around, avoiding both a stone golem (1 hit kill), the drake, wolves, while absolutely nothing else of note happens, wasting my time, food, arrows, for some miserable pieces of silver, but uh oh!, the golem kills me. 

Now wait, i can't get my stuff back cause i'll freeze to death!, so i have to take my ship, go home, make mead, take my ship and go back, try not to die on the way to 1 of the millions of wolves that just run around. But then when i get there, my tombstone is gone! isn't that just so much fun? 40h worth of gear, including the fucking wishbone, just gone. I just don't want to keep playing this game anymore honestly. Start over? 40 hours again? no thanks.

Unless you have extra people to just beat things with brute force, or start to lower the difficulty (which is [i][b]not the intended way to play!![/b][/i] according to the devs themselves) this is a frustrating timesink. Everything takes such an annoying amount of grinding from the swamp onwards, the iron recipes take dozens each, you need like 300 stone to make a somewhat decent building.
It's always more iron more wood more stone more iron more wood more stone. Maybe that's why everyone has like 600h in the game or something.",1704383533,1704999713,False,4,0,0.424712628126144409,0,True,False,True

There is some odd design choices to get used to early on (Such as middle mouse button being block and middle mouse + space being dodge) but it's a great time overall. This is a very pretty looking game with lots of great atmosphere and ambiance. The music is very fitting for this kind of game as well.

The mechanics give a great sense of progression. I didn't think I would enjoy my various skills (like running, weapons, wood cutting etc.) to be leveled with xp, but I very quickly found it to be fun and rewarding. There is also a very great sense of wonder and curiosity to the game. I wanted to learn what things I could find and make to either improve myself or my base. There was also plenty of times while playing this game when I would think ""What the hell is that?!"" and then very quickly figure out what ""that"" was one way or another lol.

I haven't fully explored or beaten this game yet. So maybe the mid to late game gets brutal (If so I'll update this review later). This game seems to follow a rough defeat the bosses design path that Terria has. I've only beaten the second boss, but I wanted to write down the story about how I got to the location of the second boss.

A friend and I were playing the game when we stumbled across a burial chamber that had some parts we needed. We went exploring and took down every skeleton we came across. Then we found a rune that pointed us to the second boss. We looked on the map and saw it was farther than anywhere we explored. The next day we tried walking towards this boss location but found an issue. There was a large ocean between us and where the boss spawned. We would need to build a proper boat and sail across the sea. But it was going to be a long journey. Luckily from the burial chamber we found parts to build a portal that could link two spots together. I built the first portal in our home base, then we packed all of our materials and headed to the coast. We were worried that something might go wrong and this might mean we loose all of our gear. But that day had to be the day we were sailing, the wind was perfectly pointing north in the direction we needed to go. I set up a temporary workstation and built the Karve boat. Within seconds the boat start leaving, so my friend and I panicked and got in. I took the piloting seat and discovered how to un-hoist the sails and the ships starting pulling fast ahead. A few minutes later we spotted the land we were headed towards. I slowed the boat down and then beached the boat. My friend and I set up a temporary base and set up the second portal to return back to the base. Just over the hill was the shrine to summon the second boss.

This may not sound like a lot, and this might just be my lack of survival crafting game playtime showing, but honestly this experience in Valheim was pretty amazing. The perfect sequence of events and mechanics made it so we had to adventure into literally the unknown and find a creative solution to our problem.

So, yeah, overall I would highly reccomend this game. But due note this is a kind of ""slow burn"" game. This is the kind of game to either play solo or with a couple of friends for a few hours to just kinda explore, build, improve and have fun in.",1704953609,1704953609,True,1,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,True

Two years later, game updates have significantly improved Valheim.  It's still more ""brutal"" than the average Minecraft enjoyer might like, but seems more fun than the usual PvEvP games of craft & survive (games I don't play). Still needs major QoL updates, as below.

1st update, 1 year after EA release:
Install the 3rd party software named BepInEx, then go to NexusMods, and download a dozen or more QoL mods and Valheim becomes playable at the enjoyment level of most standard crafting/survival games and eliminating all the unnecessary grinding (which is everything).
Music is still the #1 best part of this game.


My review comes from the point of view of someone who doesn't play hardcore crafting/survival games; only Minecraft and Starbound, since their respective betas, and No Man's Sky FWIW. I didn't jump on the bandwagon nor buy into the hyperbole/hype when it released in Early Access 2 years ago. There's a fun game here, but it's still marred by unnecessary design decisions that actively frustrate. Difficult to recommend honestly. Seems like it wants to appeal to Dark Souls fans who want a crafting-survival game, but may think Minecraft is too ""kiddie"" for their fragile image.



Original detailed review, updated:
Valheim is standard, run-of-the-mill survival game #589,431. But this time it's Norse mythology themed ohboysouniqueinsertprimitivecavemangruntshereorsomething. Seems it got popular on Twitch as this week's meme/fad game (everyone stream this because everyone else is), but I wouldn't know except for the Steam reviews making that obvious.
It's better than last month's survival game #589,430 (zombies!) and next month's survival game #589,432 (zombies again?) will be better.


PROS
* The music is delightful! The acoustic guitar is recorded played on the real instrument; you can hear the string scratches when the musician plays at times.
* The simple combat is satisfyingly more crunchy than Minecraft's.
* Loot that drops has the friendly magnetic pick-up effect, so you don't have to individually click on items to get them. (It only picks up when you walk right over an object though.)
* Status effects interact smartly -- if you're wet & have 2 minutes to dry off, standing by a fire rapidly lowers the timer instead of ""poof you're instantly dry"". Deer can smell you approach if they're downwind.
* Options to turn off bloom, field of view blur distortion, chromatic aberration, and screen shaking; thank effing Odin for that!
* It's a completely functional game released in Early Access with a roadmap and only $20.
* Can host your own server for friends-only, old-school style. Likewise there's a server browser.
* Gamepad support, native. Gamepad button prompts recognize Xbox, PS, and Nintendo controller differences.


NEUTRAL
* Game doesn't explain how to do anything -- for survival purists & experimentalists that's great, for folks who want to relax & play a game, not so much.
(Some things flat-out aren't intuitive, like using W & S to unfurl & furl the sail of the raft when you're expecting to point your cursor & press E like every other interactable in the game, and without a button prompt.)
* Building mechanics are serviceable but nothing outstanding. Snapping is nice. The unique building style will be foreign to Minecraft-alike builders, especially the need for supports & the roofing forcing realism.
* You gain health from killing things?  Also isn't explained.
* Graphical, LOD, pop-in, stutters, and despawn glitches [strike]will likely be ironed out since this is only the first-week Early Access but[/strike] are ((still, 2 years later)) present & distracting.
* The medium-poly models and pixelated ""PS1 graphics fad"" textures will put off elitist Gamers who expect ""realistic"" graphics in every modern game, or who saw screenshots that look higher fidelity from afar and didn't look closely at the foreground. Those Gamers will rush off to find an ""HD"" mod and a Reshade to over-oversaturate the game, but they would anyway. The aesthetic is done well here if you appreciate this art style (I do).


CONS
* YOU LOSE SKILL PROGRESS WHEN YOU DIE! This is the ""brutal"" thing from the store description ""A brutal exploration and survival game...""
* Gathering resources is slow going. Valheim does not respect the player's time. Absolutely everything in this game is a massive grind / time sink.
* No paper doll to equip gear, so gear is another item in your small inventory grid which you click on to equip & unequip.
* Game design decisions are sometimes intentionally, frustratingly unfriendly (see 'lack of paper doll for gear' comment above, and earlier mention of raft sail's deployment being 2 extra, unnecessary buttons even though the game established a prime interact button which would be expected to be used; and doesn't show the button prompts for these new, foreign button interactions) such as roll dodging being a 3 (yes 3!) button combo press, instead of simply double-tapping a direction. You've heard the phrase ""change for change's sake""? Valhiem devs designed ""difficult for difficult's sake"" -- or plainly stated another way: intentionally designed to be unfriendly to the player. It's not even, as the game's store description would allude to, ""brutal"" as it's simply anti-player.
* Cooking food is on a timer, just short enough to have to interact with it so it won't get burned into coal that you can't do anything else but stare at it.
* Ancient individual skill leveling mechanics that even the Elder Scrolls series & World of Warcraft dropped over a decade ago: each action (run, jump, swim, punch, block, wood chopping...) has an XP bar. Want to level anything up? Grind out your literal gameplay time doing it. Want to level up blocking attacks? Aggro a mob, then put a weight on your RMB so you block every attack for an hour. Assume leveling running you can stick yourself in a corner and depress W with autorun on, or use a weighted drinking bird toy to repeatedly tap spacebar to level jumping like it was Ultima 8 circa 1994.
This method of individual skill XP bars servers to artificially gate your progress, slower than a simple single character leveling stat.
* Frequent bug where you can't pick anything up. Have to save then logout to the main menu, then reload the save to fix. (From what I've heard, that's been present since the beginning, 2 years ago now.)
* Gamepad button prompts are not present in all menus/situations. On top of that, I found often the PS5 button prompts show the Xbox ones in menus (obviously 'X' on each controller type is placed different & don't correspond.)
* No gameplay tweaks available. (...ergo the need for QoL mods to enjoy the game; not having to manually refuel all fire sources, increase drop rates, etc etc.  The updated/second ValheimPlus mod lets you configure several dozen options to your liking that the base game should have had allowed you to do natively, like Atlas does for example.)
* The expected basic hunger mechanic is even worse than other games by limiting what foodstuffs you can eat to a single item of 3 until that one wears off, then you can't consume another of that type. Apparently Valheim doesn't use a hunger meter but the machismo Vikings have a taste buds meter. (At least you don't die of starvation in this game. But if you don't eat 3 different foodstuffs at all times, you'll have the stamina of a baby.)",1613430820,1704944491,False,1,2,0.397293955087661743,0,True,False,True

Very fun game, alone or with friends, with many hours of content even if you go straight for progressing through the bosses. Robust enough building system that I can spend hours creating a small walled-in village for my friends to live in (and not get bored with it). Good survival mechanics that aren't so unforgiving that they become overly frustrating. And you get to feel like a powerful fantasy viking that slays giant monsters and mounts their heads over your mead hall.

Features I really like:
- Really clear tech progression that touches nearly every game aspect, and doesn't have useless steps.
- Lots of build possibilities.
- Skills progress as you use them.
- Food is important for the stats, but you won't starve if you don't have anything to eat.
- Large world to explore, with a lot of variety between biomes, including visuals, resources and enemies.
- Good overall visual style, but stylized in a way that's easy on hard drive space.
- You get all materials back when you destroy structures.
- Variety of weapons with pros and cons.
- Sailing.
- More than 4 or 5 people can play together at once.

Areas that could be improved:
- I wish there was more aesthetic variety in construction, like paint or stains.
- A way to recycle or destroy old armor/weapons/tools would be very useful.",1704908770,1704908770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Prior to this, it would take several hours of playing for several days straight to gear up several people. Now it only takes a few hours. World modifiers have made this game less of a masochistic slog and a lot more enjoyable to play with friends. 

If you're worried you'll miss out on base game hours and hours of grinding, don't worry, even with 3x drop it still took 4 friends and I about 10 hours to get us all geared up with silver once we hit the mountains.

It's filled with amazing fights, relaxing scenery and resource collections, solid building and runescape level of character grind.

The plains boss is a huge difficulty spike and the mistlands while extremely cool with visuals and artstyle is insanely diffult to traverse and very easy to die in.

Visuals: In my opinion, they could make much better visuals, just look at wall textures and it will resemble to you those from the original Doom game. Speaking about the requirements of the game, i would expect something more. 

Gameplay: Kill boss, get skill, get new tech, repeat. Boring as hell after 30 minutes of playing. 

Audio: Really bad, music is bad either. 

Environment: quite nice bioms, really nice sunsets. 

Mobs: they are mainly all the same. One type of goblin, troll, that's it. 

If you are looking for something like Conan exile or V: rising, it's not the game you are looking for.

The game is inherently flawed from top to bottom in a vast number of ways:
- Valheim gives you solutions to biomes by way of resistance meads, but allows you to make them seemingly when you can obtain the ingredients needed reliably -- in other words: when they're obsolete.

- Valheim suffers incredibly by giving the player a bunch of different items of varying, arbitrary stack limits at certain points of progression, where the purpose (or purposes) of said items are unknown until you get all of the pieces needed to make it. I still have no idea what the point of entrails are, but I have three stacks of them next to my honey chest.

- Valheim has great base building features, all of it absolutely marred by time you kill Bonemass and your base is obliterated by flying drakes that will three shot you in your own home, and then kill your precious bees. Why do they do this? Because you wanted your base to look pretty, and not a grey VIKING DOME of stone that would absolutely keep your three stacks of entrails safe. (Still have no idea what they do)

- About 25 hours in, me and my boys had decided that Unrestricted Portals was probably a smart idea given that Bonemass was in Africa, and we were in Canada. That's a pretty large distance, and to transport 15 stacks of iron (even with carts, and belts) via boats given to us at the time (kurve), it would take multiple trips, and that's just some phone game levels of disrespecting a player's time.

- Dying in the mountains shows a horrible flaw with the game in that even with full food buffs, damage scaling makes no sense. Something is either too damaging, or too weak to make you even feel it, not even worth a screen shake like it does. If a stone golem decides to destroy rocks above you while you try to explore a stone stairwell with a chest in it, well, goodbye gear. Why? Because the stone golem is now in that hole - with your gear - and you are now naked. You will either die trying to get your gear, or die of the cold if the body is too far up the mountain.

- Exploration is inherently flawed. The bones are good, I liked wandering around early game, finding stuff. But the lack of variety in dungeons, their enemies, and their rewards (no super rare gear other than the skeleton shield? That was cool, why not more of that?) After you've seen what the game has to offer in the forest biome, you realise that every biome is basically a different hue of the same thing, but with more needless busywork attached to it.

- Needless busywork. Everything is a chore. The game feels like it's going to ask me to spend Viking Coin to speed up fermenters, or repair my whole base (which should be a thing, mass repair should be a base feature, not a mod), or skip raids.

- Lack of enemy diversity. Early game all you see are Greylings, and different Greydwarfs. They will travel 500km in the rain to come throw a rock at you. That will be your early game for at least eight hours. When you get to the swamp? Drauger archers. When you get to the mountains? Wolves. When you get to the plains? Mosquitos. There's always a really oppressively overtuned, annoying enemy that's everywhere. Because the dev team is made of sadists.

All-in-all, I really wanted to like Valheim. Early game it had me, I enjoyed myself. Then I started progressing, and the game became asking ""why is this like this?"" The game's difficulty is fine - it's the design and gameplay loop that's masochistic to suffer through.

TL;DR - Terraria is the best survival game there is, full stop.",1704838744,1704838744,False,8,4,0.50866466760635376,9,True,False,True

Progression is slow, and difficulty doesn't keep up until it suddenly does and then it is super hard again...only to slowly become too easy again. Resources are hard to come by, and then suddenly abundant, and then progression catches up again and new resources are scarce and hard to acquire but necessary for survival. It ebbs and flows like this in many ways, frustration followed by boredom and perhaps a little depression. These waves are randomly peppered with moments of joy and peace. A felled tree caused another tree to fall towards me like a giant baseball bat, and was saved by another tree I was close enough to get behind. It was an indescribably thrilling moment unrivaled in my gaming lifetime. Entering the unexpected violence of the Ocean Biome was equally thrilling...and terrifying. 
However, I do have two criticisms. The first is minor: The deer are annoyingly noisy. You can't overhunt them into extinction either, which was disappointing. At least so far, I'll keep trying. 
The second is more serious. There's not much variety. As far as I can tell there are only 6 biomes maybe, each of them have maybe 5 different mobs and 7 or 8 different resources. I know it's still in early access, and they are adding 2 more biomes, eventually. Hopefully they'll pad the existing biomes in time?

One of the aspects I enjoy most about open world survival is the struggle to survive in early game. Typically once I am set up and powerful enough that the challenge of survival is removed I get bored of it.
Valheim certainly does not remove the struggle to survive. But perhaps shifts this a little too far in the opposite direction.
***Small Spoilers ahead.***
* Biomes - You never feel comfortable in this game. Each Biome brings new challenges that are deadly. The tech tree is clearly laid and and progression through the tree is well defined. The same cannot be said for the Biomes and which you should visit in correct order. You are free to explore but visiting the wrong biome will result in your swift death. The map is laid out in a circular fashion and the further out you go from spawn the more difficult biomes you encounter. Though, it is quite easy to locate Biomes you have no business being in early game, such as swamp, or plains biomes. I do find progression through the tech tree and equipment feels a little cheated when you kit yourself out with all iron gear, visit the wrong biome and get one shot. 
* Teleporters - With such a giant map, Teleporters are a welcome in game device to travel great distances. Though the design choice to not allow ore to be transported through teleporters is clearly designed to force the building of outposts, I find this design choice is solely forced on the player to lengthen the games hours count forcing the player to load up ships for ferrying ore vast distances. This can become tedious. Also, with how easy it is to die in this game, dropping all of your equipment forcing you to travel back to that spot to collect it, but without the ability to teleport ore means you can't teleport the material to build another ship and sale from that closer base you were forced to build. Leading to constructing a ship from your main base, and sailing it perhaps 30 minutes to attempt to collect your gear, fail, and you repeat the process. It is easy to have several ships in one place, and hours spent frustrated. Do not buy this game if your prefer one main base to operate from, or at the least, mod the game to allow ore to be teleported.
* Experience Levels - The levelling system in the game is nearly invisible and based on the skill you use most levelling up. But, I didn't find any meaningful progression through levels and no extra abilities were unlocked by gaining a level. To me the level system was largely pointless.
* Stamina/Health - Having stamina and health in the game the way it is set up, based on what food you eat and only temporarily boosted negates much of the levelling up and progression through the game. Your character does not get tougher the longer you play. The very first moments of the game your character is just as tough as in the 100th hour, based on what food they eat. Truly the only progression in this game is the gear you wear and carry. The food you eat decides the balance between hit points and stamina and it is always a balance you need to manage. Swimming I find ridiculous as your character is lucky to survive swimming across a small channel, and will commence drowning the instant they run out of stamina. Running also drains stamina leading to some harrowing battles with large enemies, as you try and balance health and stamina drain.
* Conclusion - I find Valheim hits the mark in some respects but misses in others. Players that talk about grinding would do well to avoid this one as the game is designed for the grind. The design choice to not allow ore to be teleported leads to many additional hours of grinding for grind's sake. I tend to have a lot of patience in games for grinding, but even my patience was stretched thin with this title. I found with little direction on which biome to visit next lead to some frustrating instant deaths followed by grinding to get back there and reclaim my gear. Overall, I am on the fence whether to recommend this game. If you don't mind grinding then go for it, if pointless repetition is going to turn you off I'd say avoid it, or mod the game. In the end I am not recommending this game as there is too much grinding to it, even for me.",1704747696,1704747696,False,3,1,0.516343891620635986,0,True,False,True

It's great! I DEFINITELY recommend it if you love survival games. It's a mixture of Dark Souls, Minecraft and Vikings. Had a LOT of fun and STILL having it playing it with friends (doing a 3rd run currently, we come back to this every few months since release). Netcode is good. No issues with desyncs so far.

Compared to most open world survival games it feels like every hunt and every exploration has a purpose.
Building and Upgrading your camp is super fun and makes you feel rewarrding. And so 
does the kind of mysterious world and that for every piece of information collected and bringing mechanics together feels just great.

On the other hand, this can be frustrating as hell.
This one is supposed to be difficult. Thats certain.
But it is a bit on the punishing side at times.

Also it will not get easier in later stages to aquire certain materials.
The enemys might be less strong later on with gear upgraded, but the paths stay the same.
And they will get even longer since after you have depleted all the ressources in your close environment you have to go further every single time.
This can lead to time consuming expiditions just to get some pieces of ressource that you had activly needed 20 hours ago.
Alos there is no automation. Everything has to be done by players.

The cool thing though, you can play with 10 people out of the box and even more with setting up your own dedicated server and a few tweaks. This opens up a type of progression where the guys with lots of time to spare could go in and fulfill their urge while others could go in and play at their own pace all while milestones and bossfights could be done together.

I hope this receives some QoL updates with the probably final update with the Ashlands Biome.
Until then, its a supor cool game but has a bit of struggle and grind to it as well.

Sincerely Yours

I am at the swamp stage which I reckon is where most people quit the game because of how tedious and annoying it gets. There are so many small little nitty gritty things that tear you apart psychologically in this game, one drop after the other until you've had enough.

Here is a list:

* You constantly run out of stamina all the time. Stamina is spent when you are running, jumping, fighting, building and even sneaking. After just a few swings with your mace you will run out of stamina when fighting mobs, which basically turns your character into glue for a short moment.

There are a lot of mobs that spawn everywhere in this game as well, and you have to walk away from these mobs since you can't run when your stamina is depleted, which makes it so that you get hit from the back while trying to escape.

This happens all the time and it's so annoying to the point where I just wanna quit the game. In order to fix this you have to download third party mods which is kinda sketchy. Just make it an option to turn off stamina in-game.



* The AI in this game is weird. Most mobs seems to be following a pattern of hitting you once then running away from you in an 8 pattern circle and then hitting you once again. The boss fights are not very exciting either. The bosses that I have fought mostly just stand still and walk around a little bit whilst shooting things at you, except for Eikthyr.



* Monsters keep interupting you as you fight bosses. I was fighting The Elder and half of the fight was me and my friend trying to deal with random mobs coming out of nowhere.



* It feels like you're being punished for progressing in the game. I have finally acquired a full set of iron armour after long hours of grinding and now I get slapped with a -5% movement speed for every armour piece except for the helmet, along with my iron axe which gives me an additional -5% movement speed. In total I have now -15% movement speed in combination with the horrible stamina system.



* Your baseline HP is set at 25. You would think that you could gain some HP points if you leveled up or defeated some bosses but no, you have to be constantly eating if you want your HP to be higher than this. Maybe it's just me but I find it pretty annoying.

I know it's a survival game and all but it'd be way nicer if my baseline HP could be a little bit higher. It would be better if they made food a nice and helpful addition instead of making it mandatory to eat 3 different meat variants every 15 minutes.



* Troll raids destroying your base defenses as if your walls was made out of nothing but paper. It doesn't matter if you are using wood materials or stone materials, it's all made out of paper to the giant trolls. The only way to circumvent your base being smashed is by using a tool to raise the ground in order to make the AI obsolete.



* Way too few inventory slots and too little max weight allowed. My inventory gets filled up in no time, and at least 1/3 of the space is already taken up by all the gear that I need to survive the swamp biome.

Your max weight is 450kg, and 1 iron ore weighs 10kg. Around 100kg will be taken up from before because of all your gear so you can only bring home about 35 iron ores and then you need to travel back again. Keep in mind that traveling is very time consuming in this game, it starts becoming as boring as watching paint dry after your first 20 hours.



* When you die you drop all your items which is completely fine with me, but the problem is that the mobs and even bosses that kill you stay on your corpse instead of despawning. I have been exposed to situations where i have died over 5 times when trying to retrieve my items.



* You need to place a workbench in order to build and do anything at all. You can't even place a simple campfire without having placed a workbench first. It's such a small little thing but it gets rather annoying when you have to deal with this feature whilst out on your adventures. Just let me build.


Overall it feels like the whole world is against you in this game and not in a good way. The developers have put certain features in Valheim supposedly to make this game more difficult, but they are just making the game more annoying. I very much enjoy overcoming difficult games but there is nothing to overcome here, the game design itself is rigged against you.

You would think that the game developers could fix their game and come with regular updates to add more content, especially when you consider the fact that they've sold millions of copies and made many many millions of dollars, but no. Valheim feels very much like an unfinished product, and how long will they have this game in early access? 5 years? 10 years?

Maybe this game is just not for me, but then again this is one of my favorite game genres so I should like it, and to some extent I do, but it feels like I am being fucked over by the game it self over and over again.",1704641022,1704652996,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, once you get into the ""meat"" of it all, Valheim becomes one of the most ruthless types of games out there. The art style will deceive you, and you'll find yourself wandering around at first like pff this is easy. You're wrong, very very wrong. From little tree men to the trolls, to draugr (zombies). Once you set off from the meadows, you will encounter more and more dangerous creatures than you did before. Whether you're a new or existing player, there is an affect that Valheim will instill upon you. Inspired by Norse Mythology, they take a little bit of those myths and combine them with their own innovations and ideas, making for a game that won't just make you sit in awe of it's beauty, but fear the dangers from every corner and every sound from the environment that even begins to seem like another being is near you.

For those who cannot handle battle intensive games, you can still get something from this game. You can build bases, you can fish, you can do all the survivaly things and buildy things you could imagine. They recently updated it with the ability to lower the difficulty for those like myself who have a harder time reacting to things. I'm very awful at parrying enemies, so I use a larger shield. I also do use the lower difficulty settings, or even turn it all off if I just want to focus on building stuff. There's all kinds of ways to enjoy this game. Whether that's the battling monsters, or the building, fishing, and very chill moments of Valheim. What ever you decide to do in Valheim, you will most likely be drawn in by its beauty and sense of nostalgic it brings from the art style they chose to go with. It's one of the most unique styles out there, and in my opinion one of the best. 

So if you have been debating on getting this game, just get it, adjust the settings however you want, and try to explore and see the world of Valheim for yourself. You'll most likely enjoy it as I do, and I'm not a very battle intensive person when it comes to games. So just give it a shot. Nevermind the difficulty you might of heard from some people, with the new settings for adjustments, anyone can play and enjoy this game. As an avid lover of Norse Mythology too, I find myself immersed in a magical and mysterious world that has yet to reveal more secrets as time goes on.",1704641880,1704641880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is fun to play with several motivated friends for some time but usually the motivation does not last long. At some point you realize how sketchy the game still is. Starting with the tiny number of different building blocks to the variation of monsters to the game mechanics and the gameplay in general. So classifying this game as early access is a good choice. But from what I can say this game has not changed significantly in the last three years and probably will not change in the next three.

I paid about twelve bucks and it wasn' t even worth that.  It is a shame too, cause the game has potential, it is just crappily written and whoever beta tested it must have had their eyes CLOSED.  It is a real shame cause it could have been a good game.  Instead they rushed it out...I mean auto targeting and decent building abilities would have improved it enough to make it playable.  The development team needs to play Grounded, Stray Blade and Smalland and get some pointers on targeting and building and try to fix it...but I don't know if it is even possible.  Good concept but rotten, rotten execution.  I rarely pan a game but this one gets the skillet:).

OK...after about 350 more hours (I always give even the worst games in beta at least 500 hours before deleting it entirely) I have an update on my review.  IF you turn the mouse to its highest reaction time, you can target a bit more effectively but still cannot isolate an individual out of a group or concentrate on a particular foe.  The game has potential but the fact that you have to build a worktable to do anything and not just a worktable but one with a roof and walls makes building a quickie place to respawn while exploring very annoying.  A base camp is needed every day's walk...one with workbench, walls, roof, bed, campfire, at least one chest to hold items while you are out exploring and items to resupply if you die so you can go get the rest of your stuff is best, especially for new players.  There should be at least two more full sets of quick spaces to facilitate weapons, food, etc without having to open the inventory would be nice.  The developers really need to play Grounded for basic ideas on camps and immediate inventory.  One thing that drives me nuts is ending up naked and weaponless if you die.  Practically, it makes no sense.  I mean really, when you die...do your clothes fall off?  Having studied basic history I am certain Vikings were sent into the afterlife with full armor and weapons so historically, one should keep their armor and weapon they had in hand at death when they respawn. 

 https://thevikingsway.com/viking-burial-rituals-and-funerary-practices/#aioseo-2-grave-goods-wealth-for-the-journey-beyond

This site describes some of the rituals and as it states, like most societies of that time, particularly those frequently known as conquerors weapons and armor were sent with the deceased into the afterlife.
The game can be addictive but it is a hard, arduous slough so far...so if you don't mind a lot of dying and running to get the basics back, it has possibilities.  I like Grounded a whole lot better for game play but this one has its upside as well.  One other suggestion would be an option to enlarge the map inset.  Not everyone who plays these games is 15 with perfect eyesight.  In a game with modifiers, they should think about the entire demographic...those over fifty too.  The game should pause action or at least have the option to pause action while the map and inventory are opened.  The more options available, the more expansive the game playing demographic and that means more sales, better game enjoyment and better reviews.",1703178088,1704626645,False,3,1,0.399841219186782837,0,True,False,True

I was amazed at the first 2 biomes and the various discoveries, the 3rd biome is okay not great, the 4th biome is interesting, and the 5th biome feels rushed: the creatures, resources and armors all feels unpolished and a bit out of place. It lacks a bit of coherency in my opinion and that's when the game starts to be repetitive without adding new mechanics. For example you get the core metal by just farming monsters while you needed to find the resources with special mechanics in the previous biomes. It was a chore to go through it because I started to feel bored/uninterested to the point where I didn't want to log in the game anymore. 
Everything I built suddenly felt a bit worthless and I had no desire to keep building on it. It left me with a bad feeling despite having enjoyed it so much up to this point.

Unfortunately, updates are very slow and communication from the team is not reassuring. The next biome does not seems to be coming anytime soon and there is no plan to rework this 5th biome as far as I'm aware.
Because the game was such a success commercially, I expected the studio to hire developers and turn a good game into a true gem, instead of doing the bare minimum.

Edit: the 6th biome is out and there is new mechanics, however it reuse some assets from previous biomes / NPC and don't have a strong feeling of novelty. The progression is getting repetitive I think. Maybe 4 biomes were enough, if they were a bit more varied?",1663764670,1704618634,False,3,0,0.504201710224151611,0,True,False,True

-First person POV via scroll
-Add more animals to hunt and to tame as pets!
-Make taming easier! It's quite tedious and doesn't work too well

Combat is pretty bare bones and your character cannot aim up or down for some reason, meaning you must always fight on level ground in order to hit an enemy; however, enemies can hit you at an angle so you are at a disadvantage. I don't think it would be insanely difficult for your character to actually swing where your cursor is... but here we are. 

Combat is largely one dimensional with the core loop being, parry -> attack -> repeat. There are no incentives to fight in any other way and towards the higher enemy types this pattern is mandatory to kill enemies quickly. All weapons have a simple 2 or 3 attack animation cycle that repeats over and over, there is no switching this up aside from a ""heavy"" attack which is usually just a forward lunge. There are no real unique flavors to the weapons as they all amount to the same cycle of parry -> attack -> repeat. It would be nice if the weapons actually had character and dramatically changed the way you fought. Different move sets with actual impact like knocking enemies prone, into one another, or up into the air. They could apply different status effects like bleeding, vulnerable to certain types of damage, slowing enemy attack speed, or weakening enemy strikes.

Crafting gear, and upgrading it, in this game is incredibly grind focused with later gear sets requiring absurd amounts of materials. This seems to be tuned in a way just to pad the runtime of the game but that just forces you to repeat the dull exploration and combat cycles over and over. There are two types of armor in the game, heavy and light. Heavy armor reduces movement speed but offers a higher value of protection while light armor does not impede movement. There is essentially no late game light armor, so if you decide to run a light armor character you will inevitably get one shot by any enemy beyond a certain point in the game.

I think this game has a lot of potential but the number of systems that have been added, and lack of depth in them, hinders the game more than it helps it. If the developers focused more on making the world an interesting place, with combat that was more rewarding, and balanced weapons/armors for more diverse play styles I would recommend this game. However as it stands, I can't play more than 10 or 15 hours without getting bored of the underdeveloped systems present in the game today.",1671685446,1704612845,False,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Combat: You progress your damage/armor through gear. Food buffs HP and stamina the way leveling traditionally would. Weapons confer situational pros and cons that you can min-max to fight different enemies or suit different styles of combat. 

Building: You are heavily limited, but this grounds your creations in the world of vikings. The more fancy a thing is, the more likely its ingredients result from performing some difficult task in the game, The experience of progressing from wilderness to civilization must be felt to be understood.

Progression: You enter an environment which wants to kill you, but which offers you resources that can be used to grow stronger. You kill enemies and extract resources in order to build a supply of gear. You then kill a boss and start the progression over with a new region. Each time, your contributions from the last iteration remain relevant to the current one, creating a sense of progress that does not go away. Even your inferior gear becomes relevant when you die and respawn at your bed with only your second-strongest gear.

 - The first 50 hours can be genuinely challenging in the best way (for the most part)
 - it's only been getting better since release

Cons:
 - Early game death recovery can be frustrating
 - Losing levels upon death 
 - multiplayer lag when there is a LOT of building (more of a situational problem once you go nuts with building)
 - the mist

I really really wanted to like this game, but advancing your construction methods requires killing bosses and raiding dungeons for materials that you can only get there.  Even making structures out of stone is gated behind acquiring a bunch of iron to make the workbench upgrade you need, meaning you have to kill 2 bosses, and find iron in swamp dungeons, guarded by draugr that will 2 shot you in fully upgraded bronze armor.  You can't get it anywhere else.  It's heavy, and you can't take it through portals.  All the swamps I've found are only accessible by boat.  Guess what.  If you die in a dungeon you took a boat to get to, to get back you need to build another boat.  It is exceedingly frustrating.

After a bit of venting to the community it was brought to my attention that I was making a critical gameplay error.  I had been using foods that gave large bonuses to stamina but only small bonuses to health, and in doing so I inadvertently subjected myself to the Dark Souls experience.  I had great mobility in combat at the cost of immediate, often fatal, punishment for less than perfect execution.

Good stuff:
Not frustrating survival game - PvP is optional (turned off by default), destroyed buildings return 100% of resources used, no resources needed to repair tools or buildings.
PvE raids are sporadic and pretty short, what type of raid occurs is based on next boss you fight and they usually happen where you are at in the moment of a raid, no surprises when you get back home and you see a bunch of mobs chewing on your buildings. Each one gets a little harder but that's only because of types of mobs that attack you.
Amazing fight mechanic - no mindless spamming quick attack and watching health bar go down, gotta learn them patterns and block attacks, standard mobs also have patterns you can learn but are easy to deal with, except trolls, trolls are a big fun blue boys that want to party with you in Black Forrest whenever you least expect it.
Health system that requires you to eat food to have more health and stamina
Pretty neat building system
As for multiplayer I highly suggest using Dedicated server tool (located in steam tools library), you might need to find a guide on how to set it up properly but it's well worth it instead of hosting a game directly from the menus.

This game is not just a journey; it's an emotional odyssey that unfurls the layers of your inner Viking.

As you step onto the rugged shores of Valheim, the untamed beauty of the landscapes mirrors the spirit of the Norsemen. The sun-kissed meadows and towering snow-capped mountains create a living, breathing canvas that beckons you to explore, just as the Vikings once did. Each sunrise and sunset feels like a chapter in an epic saga, painted with hues that ignite a fiery passion within the player.

The moments of solitude, whether traversing dense forests or sailing turbulent seas, evoke a powerful connection to the Viking spirit. The haunting echoes of the wind, the rhythmic sound of oars slicing through water – they weave a symphony that resonates with the solitude of Viking warriors, stirring a sense of longing for a bygone era.

The cooperative aspect of Valheim amplifies the emotional depth. Building mighty longhouses and fortresses with fellow Vikings creates a sense of camaraderie that transcends the digital realm. It's not just about survival; it's about forging bonds that echo the brotherhood of warriors who sailed together into the unknown.

However, as the seasons change and you face formidable adversaries, a poignant realization sets in. The melancholy of seeing your creations tested and the somber undertone of the Norse world weighing on your soul become undeniable. The laughter shared in the mead halls turns bittersweet, for you know that every saga must come to an end.

As the final credits roll, a deep sense of loss settles in. The beautiful landscapes you once traversed, the bonds forged, and the battles fought become memories etched in the digital fabric of Valheim. It's a farewell to a world that became a home, leaving a void that echoes with the poignant whisper of the Viking spirits now at rest.

Valheim is not just a game; it's a heart-wrenching journey into the heart of Viking legacy, where emotions flow as freely as the rivers that once guided their longships. It's an ode to a time lost, leaving players with a sorrowful sense of longing for a place that never truly existed but will forever remain etched in their souls.",1704470629,1704470629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I can now confidently say that they are liars, 20-30 dollars aside, they made promises that there were big updates coming in 2021, it's now 2024. Allot of people made a decision to purchase this game based on future content, so unfortunately, good game or not, they are liars, do not trust a word they say.

-- Update-- It's been 5+ months, very little content has been added. I'm quite pissed with the current roll-out. We were promised 4 updates in the first year and we aren't going to get the first update until at least 8-9 months in.
They are a very small team that got very rich in a hurry. The have a history of abandoning games in the recent past as they are only a few people, and all but have given up on ""Satisfactory"" to develop Valheim which now has major delays in content patches.

These people are over promising and under delivering. So i will not recommend this game until they prove they are not liars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Really good game, game is VERY addicting, well worth 20-25 dollars. For early access, this game is better than most games are at full launch.

The grind has a well thought out pace to it, combat is simple enough, but not too simple. The exploration, gear improvement and base building is all well done, especially for a pre-released game. 

Good assortment of items to discover find and build, will keep you busy.

This is the best $20 I've spent on a game. Period.

Graphics— the subtle textures, mixed with exceptional lighting and atmosphere, draw out your curiousity and make you want to explore more and more and of this world.

Gameplay— combat is immensely satisfying, but also punishing if you are not careful. 

Sound— the background music is so calming, you could sleep to it. Or, spend hours and hours working on a base with no auditory issues. Plus, that sword sound effect is MINT. 

~~~~~ (minor spoilers ahead)
Wise words from a Norse adventurer:

1) Always put a portal down upon arriving somewhere new— especially if you traveled far and/or to somewhere dangerous. Trust me. 😭

2) Roll gives you some invincibility frames. This helps a lot when you have no arrow and want to combat a difficult enemy at close range, or escape a near-death experience.

3) If you die in a hard time get to spot, die again in a relatively close, but safe area. Then, grab that grave stone to get the ""Corpse Run"" buff which heals you like 5hp/tick and significantly decreases stamina usage. Lastly, zoom over to your original grave like Hermes. Zoooomm.

The game's progression is linear, measured in the strength of your equipment, and ability to gather new recourses and process them.

The game also offers much in terms of all survival game aspects, as theres plenty to be done for farming, cooking, building and making the world lovely.

The pacing is fantastic, played to a point where you almost start to feel overpowered, until you discover a new area, and get crushed again. Its incredibly addictive because of this, and i cant recommend it enough, as the addictive nature ensures that you will get the hours of content you paid for.

On the second side of the coin though, the game is difficult, with a learning curve like a hockey stick, and its not for those who cant push past that and get into the game. I personally recommend this game, but some simply might find it too infuriating to deal with the flaws. I myself have ragequit several times, though I've always come back. And if you are struggling, the difficulty is adjustable if necesarry

I also want to state that at the time of this review, valheim is still getting updates, and theres still lore that i am yet to read up on. The ashlands are under development, and Im sure more is to come.

In conclusion, I feel this game is worth the pricetag and rage, especially if played with friends. I want to recommend it to those who feel like a challenging survival game, riddled with bossfights and building. If you feel like a more relaxed game less about combat and more about leaning back and sighing contentedly, I say steer clear.",1674300711,1704445066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 If you want to get the FPS Framerate slider to move on 1 frame at a time in the settings menu, HOLD down the ""Right"" mouse button on the FPS slider Dot then press the cursor key left or right depending if you want to decrease or increase framerate, I spent ages trying to get it to go from 59 to 60 until I did this, Its probably common knowledge and I'm just an idiot lol, but hey it works.

 if you get sick of dying create two worlds to jump between to save the long journey back you can strip all clothes and items in the 2nd world drop them in a chest then leave naked when you arrive home jump back into the world you dropped your gear then pick them up and jump out, better still create a full crafting station in this world so you can jump in at any point anywhere on map store things , craft stuff and use it as a jump when about to die to health up. yeah its cheating but ffck it, games hard especially when you die out at sea with the best equipment and it only took you 33 attempts to get them back already then died again just because your cat walked across your ffing keyboard at the moment you HAD TO press Dodge/Roll",1613061977,1704376608,True,0,0,0.487628340721130371,0,True,False,True

I want to preface by saying I've played and been burned out of survival-crafting games for a long time, I played ARK back when it first released and was one of the suckers who bought DLC in the early access. I was terrified that this game would be like that and was reluctant to buy it despite having friends to play it with and if you find yourself in the same boat I really suggest you don't worry about whether or not it's like the other survival-crafting games you've played before - it's not.

Combat in this is fluid, very fun. It's similar to the combat you'd see in Fromsoft in a way with blocking, rolling, I-frames, different weapon types. Crafting is fun, doesn't take a ton of time, and you're encouraged not to just make boxes while in other games you're forced to for the sake of conserving materials. Hunting, foraging, all that is fun because it focuses on the combat system unless you're purposefully just picking berries and getting lucky enough not to be attacked by greylings - little dwarf monster things.

The graphics are probably the most interesting thing. They're similar to something you'd see in a late PS1 or early PS2 era game but polished heavily. The shading and style of everything is really nice and honestly helps the game a lot. It also means you don't need a god rig to run it despite the game having a lot of moving flora and lighting effects at the highest settings. It's gorgeous without being taxing on your rig or being a massive tumor on your drive.

In short this game is a blast, especially with friends, but if you like RPG games and single player experiences more you'll find this more than a match for that style of gameplay too. It's amazing and if you're scrolling through the reviews deciding whether or not to get it, just snag it and launch it up. The game's under 3 gigs too despite the amount of content in it, so don't worry about not having space for it.",1704358679,1704358679,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The building system is fantastic, the combat is punishing but you learn how to play around the slow, deliberate attacks with time. The sailing is fun, the visuals are fantastic. So why the negative review?

[b]The Plains.[/b]

The enemies are fine. The biome itself is very pretty, the little points of interest you find are well-generated and fun combat encounters to deal with, where you need to carefully approach encounters to avoid getting swarmed and overwhelmed.

What's the issue with the Plains biome, then?

[b]You can't find the boss.[/b] The materials to summon the Plains' boss are annoyingly scarce (which is in stark contrast to all prior bosses), but you genuinely have to luck-out to find the boss location of the Plains' boss.

I genuinely spent ten hours and searched no less than six plains biomes, from small itty-bitty ones to sprawling massive ones. The Plains are cool, but they are not ten-hours-of-searching-cool.

In the end, I folded and found a map generator tool that lets you look up all of the Points of Interest on your map, including boss locations (linked here for the poor souls who end up like me: https://valheim-map.world/

I could forgive the loooooooong dev cycles, the massive grind for materials, the decision to hold-fast to the no-teleportation rules. I was having a lot of fun with the game up until the point I couldn't progress because the developers didn't care to make it easy to find a boss. To clarify, you will be tripping over the 'boss location stones' for all prior bosses while rooting around in each biomes' respective dungeons. I even found a boss location stone for the boss *after* Plains in the second dungeon I visited.


Without any alternative means other than external websites, this is an unforgivable progression blocker. Looking online, every suggestion is ""yeah, the search for the Plains' Boss sucks, either keep looking or just use a tool to look it up.""

Graphics:
Simple but very nice, lighting makes all the Difference.

UI:
Its serviceable, nothing more. But even in EA it has a “take all” and “move stacks” button, something D4 doesn’t have to this day..
More/better tooltips would help.

Movement:
Good enough and reminds me of WoW. Sad though that swimming is very limited and diving is not possible. A lot of blocking clutter while chasing mobs will break movement.

Building:
Felt very natural and simple to do. But since distances are far, bags are small, I am constantly forced to build new shelters. Which quite frankly sucked after the 4th time, even if only renovating an empty shelter. A Hearthstone would work wonders.

Crafting:
Here is where it started to bother me. Mats are not pulled from chests, you need to have all mats on character for crafting.. same for Building.

Exploration:
My biggest complaint with the game.. the environment is very beautiful and atmospheric but essentially unrewarding. 
Ruins and buildings usually contain 1 chest, containing worthless crap. You fight against several hard enemies (with the equipment at hand) to get nothing in return. Dungeons are hard, unrewarding and have no dungeon map.

Conclusion:
Constant backtracking for mats and management. Exploration is essentially unrewarding.
I like that I get all recipes for a mat, as soon I get it for the first time. But I feel there should be some rng, either when crafting or trough mods to the regular items, like gems that can drop from any mob, keep things interesting and bit fresh.

The combat is less punishing souls-like, there's a good variety of weapons, ranging from daggers to huge polearms which all have their own special attacks. The bosses are adequately challenging and fun to fight, and even the lesser creatures all have their own fighting styles and different moves that you can learn and exploit to get the upper hand.

The world is interesting and fun to explore, with a good variety of biomes (and there’s more on the way) that have a good density of points of interest sprinkled in them. There are many wild animals you can hunt and plants to harvest as you make your way around the map, so you’re always making some amount of progress even as you just wander around.

Building is very fun and has a good amount of challenge to it due to the somewhat realistic structural integrity system that doesn’t just let you build floating platforms.

Progression is well paced and feels very rewarding. The food system that dictates your max health and stamina is a little odd at first, but provides a fun extra challenge and an incentive to find and unlock better food to farm and cook as you make your way through the increasingly tougher biomes. A stable supply of high quality food and mead is just as important as getting the best armor and weapons.

Graphic fidelity is not very high, but the excellent art direction more than makes up for it, although the ability to further increase render distance for grass and trees without the use of mods would be appreciated. The textures are nice, the models are well designed and made with Blender, which is a big plus in my book :)

The sound design and the soundtrack are fantastic. Weapon blows feel impactful, creatures all sound distinct and there is beautiful unique music for every biome.

And on top of that, there’s tons of mods you can easily install that add and improve upon existing features, items, creatures, ect.

The art is pretty much on par with vanilla WoW. The Building pieces, while limited, can make some very satisfying builds. The world itself can be good looking until it isnt. 

The world generation needs some revamping, it's a thousand islands. Boring. In the future I would like to see a system implemented where we could make a custom map with sliders Instead of just a seed. Also, maybe some more interesting landscaping like fjords, waterfalls, vast oceans, large biomes, larger ruins, NPCs?

The character creation is fine for what the game is, I guess some new hair styles and beards would suffice, probably tattoos and muscle slider would be nice.

my wife wants more decorations like furniture and totems
more walls

Better UI

I give the game a 9.4/10

I mean, sailing through misty fjords or going toe-to-toe with legendary creatures in thick forests? It's like the devs sprinkled magic pixels everywhere. The weather changing on the fly and the day-night cycle just adds this crazy level of realism that sucks you right into the Viking universe.

Now, let's talk teamwork. Valheim is all about it. Gathering resources, building epic longhouses, and taking down colossal bosses with your buddies? That's where the real magic happens. You'll be high-fiving your friends and screaming in victory as you carve out your Viking legacy together. It's an absolute blast.

Crafting is a game-changer too. Want a massive axe to crush enemies? You got it. Prefer to pick enemies off from a distance with a killer bow? Valheim's got your back. The game lets you go nuts with your gear, and trust me, it's addictively fun to experiment and see what works for your style.

Oh, and the music! The soundtrack is like the icing on the Viking cake. It's haunting, it's epic, and it'll stick with you even after you've put down your battle axe. It adds this whole other layer of atmosphere that's just downright awesome.

In a nutshell, Valheim isn't just a game; it's a masterpiece.  If you're after a game that transports you to a mythical Viking world, giving you endless hours of fun, Valheim is the real deal. Cheers to the devs for crafting this badass adventure – Skål!

Every problem you encounter has a short-term and long-term solution, both of which are predicated on the players prep-work. This game at several points will become VERY difficult, and really put your vikings might to his/her limit, however no challenge Valheim throws at you is impossible.

Ich würde das Spiel wirklich gerne mögen, und bis zum ersten Boss war es auch wirklich cool.

Aber anders als im ersten Teil, bekommt man für den zweiten Teil überhaupt keine Hinweise wo man hin muss. Auch dieses ist noch in Ordnung.

Dann war ich geschlagene anderthalb Stunden auf See. Mir ist das Grundprinzip des gegen den Wind Segeln bekannt. Funktioniert mit dem Floß aber nicht wirklich, weil das nicht genug Trägheit hat, um über die 90° hinweg zu steuern. Schlimmer noch, wenn man einmal drin hängt und auf dem Wasser hängt, kann man nicht wirklich umdrehen. Bei aller Liebe zum Realismus, aber wenigstens Umdrehen wäre toll gewesen. (klar im Nachhinein ist man immer schlauer, jetzt wären mir schon ein paar Mechaniken klar geworden, um die Reisen wenigstens um die Hälfte zu kürzen)

Als ich es dann nachts endlich in den Dunklen Wald geschafft hatte, wurde ich von einem freundlich Pack begrüßt (9 Zwerge Wichtel, was auch immer). Die haben mich dann ins Jenseits befördert. Das Spiel war natürlich so eingestellt, dass man alles verliert.

Jetzt müsste ich wieder alles sammeln (Klamotten, Waffen, Werkzeuge, Floß ...). Darauf hatte ich am Ende einfach keine Lust mehr.

Ich hoffe andere erwischt es hierbei nicht genauso, oder haben mehr Durchhaltevermögen. Aber für über eine Stunde Floßfahrt fehlt mir (ohne die Möglichkeit meine Sachen mitzunehmen - Naja, von Hand immer hin- und herschippern) mittlerweile die Zeit und Geduld.

--------- English Version -----------

I really wanted to like the game, and it was really cool until the first boss.

But unlike in the first part, you don't get any hints at all for the second part where you have to go. This one is also still okay.

Then I was at sea for an hour and a half. I'm familiar with the basic principle of sailing against the wind. But it doesn't really work with the raft because it doesn't have enough inertia to steer through 90°. Worse still, once you're in it and hanging on the water, you can't really turn around. For all my love of realism, at least turning around would have been great. (Of course, you're always smarter with hindsight, but now I would have realized a few mechanics to shorten the trips by at least half)

When I finally made it into the Dark Forest at night, I was greeted by a friendly pack (9 dwarven gnomes, whatever). They then sent me to the afterlife. Of course, the game was set up so that you lose everything.

Now I had to collect everything again (clothes, weapons, tools, raft ...). In the end, I just didn't feel like it anymore.

I hope others don't have the same problem or have more stamina. But I don't have the time or patience for a raft trip of over an hour (without the option of taking my things with me - well, I always have to sail back and forth by hand).",1704231354,1704231540,False,1,0,0.455635488033294678,0,True,False,True

After playing hundreds of hours of an enjoyable game, the Mistlands biome is still outright stupid. The most frustrating and unrewarding experience in the game. Navigation is horrible, and it seems that the newly generated world made the Mistlands even more fragmented. You always run out of stamina while trying to just get around becaouse you have to jump over lots of rocks that cannot be walked on. So when you end up with no stamina an enemy comes out of the mist, because even with the Wisp light you still cannot see more than 5m around you. If you die - recovering your itmes becomes almost impossible.

Once again, the Mistlands makes us uninstall the game and leaves a bad taste. To the developers - WHY? WHY do you do this? What's wrong with you?

Mistlands is just plain bad. The combination of terrain which is almost impossible to explore along with the fact that you can't see further than 2m away from you is horrible. It makes the entire exploring experience feel cumbersome and unrewarding. I honestly don't understand - who in their right mind would have considered this a good idea?

The best Game ive played in a very long time.

I can't even count how many times I died on a distant island in the middle of plains or mountains or a swamp with my teleport destroyed. I had to ask my friend for help a lot of times to recover my stuff. I almost gave up several times. And that's what was great about this game. 

It's the current state what's bothering me. Suddenly there's a save option and also a difficulty settings to make the game easier or even more challenging. I don't like that at all. I liked the fact that the experience was the same for everybody. Take it or leave it. 

Furthermore I found out that the save option is broken. I don't recommend using it. If you're lucky and find the right save there's a danger of losing your stuff. It just disappears. Teleports, upgrades, boats, even your corpse... And that is ultimately why I decided not to recommend the game. To progress in Valheim you have to invest a lot of time into it. To find stuff, mine it or transport it to your home location. Which is fine. But when some kind of bug makes you lose hours of your progress, that is really huge issue for me.

The devs have been very slow to update and not very transparent with the community and its in my opinion, deserving of some of the ire it is receiving. All in all its a great game even without the new content and with their lack of communication, BUT we still have to judge it for what it is. If i'm being honest whats there is definitely worth the cost, you will get plenty of hours for what u pay here and they are extremely enjoyable and atmospheric and u get to experience it all with your buddies.

Lets not forget also there are games out there like 7daystodie which have been in ""early access"" since the birth of jesus christ.. So maybe cut these guys a little more slack they have shown their talent in many ways and we should be grateful for the quality of the game that we have.

dont get me wrong i was mad when i got on it after 2 years only to see minor updates like hearth and home hearing they dropped the roadmap and i have also read a few comments that they have a bit of a power complex now with their success and have banned people for trivial reasons(no evidence in this regard take this with a grain of salt people have a habit of smearing out of spite when things like this happen). I was especially bothered when they admitted they completed this entire thing in just over 3 years.

But you know what ? its a damn good game and i still support it.

To the devs - I know you will never read this but in the hopes that you do i want you to know we love what you have created here and there are a lot of us that understand a lot of the criticisms aren't valid or constructive. Just be careful not to shut out the people with valid critiques because most of them just care about you and your product, i can guarantee 99% of us want to see this you and this game succeed and most of the animosity is a ""fearfulness""(PTSD) that comes form the early access genre and knowing what this game is capable of and being afraid for its future. but no matter what happens thanks for the great game and memories it is well worth the 20$ no matter where we go from here.

EDIT(1/2/2024): The updates have been coming in at very slow pace but that's to be expected Irongate is still the same small team even after the massive success of the game but it is a creative choice because they want to preserve their original vision and theme of the game and they feel adding on new members could cause deviation. I think that is a valid reason and even though im not enthused with the pace of release of new content i respect their decision and hope it works in their favor.",1613081811,1704191539,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,True

1. Got dropped into the world and told to please one set of gods by killing another set. Great.
2. Punched a dwarf to death. They will continue showing up for the remainder of my playtime, and continue to get punched.
3. Built some tools and got distracted for two hours clearcutting the edge of a forest and building a little house.
4. Went exploring, found a mountain.
5. Immediately froze to death trying to leave the mountain.
6. Running back to the mountain border to get my stuff, ambushed a pig. was promptly murdered by said pig.
7, Okay, avoiding the local wildlife, now I've got my stuff back. But now I discover there's a weight-based encumbrance system, and I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere.
8. after dropping a few trees worth of wood and hoofing it through the forest, punching dwarves along the way, I get home at last. I build a barn to store my stuff in.
9. Mother nature decides to send a wildlife killteam after me, I'm cornered in the barn. After a skirmish, my nemesis, the pigs, are locked inside. I found a rock that told me I can make them pets by throwing food at them, so I throw some berries in and leave them chewing on the walls.
10. Okay, I've got some stuff lying around, not counting the stuff in the barn with the still-murderous pigs. Time to gear up. I discover the joy of Bows, Arrows, Spears, and Shields. That means I'm ready to take on the first god, yes?
11. Apparently not. God won't show up unless I give him hunted stuff. Okay, hunting expedition. 
12. Alright, I've killed deer, pigs, and angry geckos. I've discovered the joy of cooking and tripled my health with the flesh of my fallen foes. I even found a pair of antlers, and this must be what God wants as payment for his cameo. it's time.
13. God is a giant deer, and he's angry. I discover the game has dodge-rolling, and proceed to repeatedly throw my spear at him. Despite him throwing lightning back, I prevail, more easily than I did against the pigs. Such is the power of MEAT.
14. I return home in glory. The pigs in the barn are domesticated, I got the ability to channel this god to run for a long time, and with the addition of the god's crafting materials, I go to see what I can now make.
15. I discover I can craft pants. I've done all of this, without pants.

Disclaimer: I have not finished the game completely; I'm 4/6 bosses through but have a pretty good handle on what to expect from here on.

6/10

Pros:
*The building system is fantastic for what it is.  The pieces look good and feel good snapping together.  Other bigger games really NEED to adopt this snap-system and simplistic design. 
*The variety in mobs and biomes.
*The variety in equipment/builds/play styles available.

Cons:
*The steep jump in difficulty from biome to biome is jarring.  You can get the best equipment for say, Biome #2 and will easily be killed by Biome #3 regular mobs.  This leads to a weird loop of:
    1) Enter Biome, find new resources
    2) Try to get best available gear with new resources, while running/screaming/avoiding mobs
    3) Have best gear, fight mobs normally and get ready for biome boss
    4) Clear biome boss, move to next biome and prepare to run/scream/avoid again.
*The bosses are lackluster BECAUSE they are easily cheesed.
*Dungeon mobs are also easily cheesed by doors/narrow passages.
*Bosses have WAY too much health.  
*Dodge needs to be it's own keybind and not ""crouch plus jump""

Moving Forward:

*I would rework the bosses to all have a ""dungeon arena"" rather than just an altar/spawn.  With the best gear possible for a boss, they should be a very reasonable ~5-10ish minute affair. 

*Similarly, gear balancing.  If you have the best available gear/food from the last biome, you should be able to navigate the next biome pretty comfortably, and maybe the 2nd harder with caution.

I assume as the game matures, it will be improved, so the score is not as harsh as it would be a finished product.  Like some other long-term-fixer-upper games, I have hope.",1704166240,1704166240,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It’s the kind of game that fully absorbs me for hours, and something I return to every time I manage to convince a friend to buy it.

During my first playthrough, I remember spending an absurd amount of time obtaining fully upgraded bronze armor. I felt invincible, only to be swiftly humbled by the “YOU DIED” screen. Sailing into the plains with overconfidence, thinking “the ugly bastards ain’t got nothing on me,” ended with a frantic effort to retrieve my gear amidst a barrage of little green goblins and mosquitoes.

While I’ve heard some critique the graphics, for me, they are unique and gorgeous. However, the real standout feature of Valheim is its atmosphere. The lighting, fog, darkness, stormy oceans, or bright midday sun creates an immersive atmosphere. Each biome presents its own unique charm, making exploration continually exciting, even after extensive time spent in them.

Building is detailed and farming, rewarding. Progression can feel slow at times, and difficulty spikes damning, but when you finally parry that abomination and defeat it, the satisfaction is immense.

Valheim epitomises the survival genre’s best elements. From sailing and exploring new biomes to discovering materials, building bases, cooking, defeating bosses, and more - every aspect feels rewarding.

It’s the type of game where one second you check to see that the bees are happy, and the next, you’re dodging the club above your head. I could not love this game any more.

Review: 
On the surface, this is Dark Souls meets Minecraft, but Vikings. And I'm all on board for that. HOWEVER, Dark Souls is one of the most balanced games I've ever played. And it has to be. Every enemy is beatable at level 1. In Valheim however, the enemies are not balanced. At all. They randomly spawn, so maybe you'll get a 2 enemy challenge, maybe you'll get 4 enemies and you'll be lucky to make it out. Or... 8 enemies and you cannot survive. Dark Souls isn't random. So your experience can vary drastically. I was not often lucky. 

I played a lot because I DO like challenge. The Dark Souls Series is one of my favorite series. But when I die in Darksouls I say ""Why did I fail to ______"" and in Valheim I say ""Why did the game ________"". Where Dark Souls hid the story and relied on the internet to collectively tell its story, Valheim relies on the internet to tell its mechanics. Sometimes you'll have to go sailing to find certain biomes. And I didn't know that. So I explored my island thinking that was the whole  game. When I did go sailing, I found a Biome that was extremely punishing. Turns out, it wasn't ""next"". And the enemies weren't defeatable, even with expert timing and leveled up weapons and shields. 

But EVEN THAT wouldn't matter, if you kept progress life to life. Try, die, try again. Except. Not Valheim, If Roguelike was what they were going for, they also failed at that. Because dying to the 8 enemy spawn once will cost you 5% of your skill. If you leveled up your spears to 50. You're a pretty good spear fighter. But when you wind up in the plains when you should be in the swamp (as I did), you get a roaming band of 5 enemies that your shield doesn't block. Also they throw stuff. And your first death drops you to 47.5 in spears. Die again and you're at 45. My third death took me to 42. And my fourth took me to 40. I lost so many levels on things because the game isn't balanced. 

PROS:
1) Early stages are very fun. 
2) The Building mechanics are great. I loved making structures.
3) Multiplayer is awesome for this type of game. Glad it's possible.
4) Setting and scale are huge and engaging. 

CONS:
1) Uses roguelike elements poorly. Your deaths don't let you keep your progress, and will penalize you for failure much more heavily than expected.
2) Uses procedural generation elements poorly. Unfair situations arise regularly. Map can be unfair.
3) Multiplayer can be straight up required if your RNG is bad enough. Ultimately I stopped because I met a challenge I couldn't take on alone, and didn't have anyone playing with me at the time.
4) The Crafting system is garbage. Which is odd considering the building system is great. Making a tool is awful. Making a house is fantastic. 
5) Travel by water is not a question of frustration, but HOW frustrating. 

It's so weird how I can want everything a game offers, but they do it so poorly that I dislike the game. My ""Base"" looked amazing with an area for pigs, and farmland and a surprisingly large Bee  hive area. A two story warehouse with throne room on the second floor. But... accidentally having a boss right next to an area that's too hard to survive means that boss can't be encountered alone. I want someone to make a good version of this game.

[b]short review[/b]
After dozens of over politically correct AAA games, it is so refreshing to see a game, which couldn't care less and is advertised by Scandinavian Death Metal.
It is in an early state, but still runs surprisingly bug-free and plays on Linux - upvote!

[b]long review[/b] Update 2024
It is a bit unfair comparing the game to Rust or 7d2d, since those two had years of development and are still unfinished products. This review might be subject to change, but in the current state, the following is worth a mention:
[list]
[*]First of all, it is not that forgiving as people claim: Dying, even though being already dead, has dire consequences. You loose a lot of skill points, which needs a good bit of grinding, especially on skills like blocking or swimming, you don't do that often. [i]Update: This has been mitigated by the introduction of the ""world modifiers"" in the settings. But you cannot turn it off completely.[/i]
[*]You don't die of hunger, like in 7d2d, but you are only on roughly 30 percent of your stats w/o eating. So in a sense the same, if not even more micro-management.
[*]You can progress to a certain extend until you have to fight a boss in order to unlock new skills. You don't have invisible walls, but very challenging opponents if you travel to the higher level biomes too early.
[*]The boss fights can be done in an honest fight or a more cheesy way. I like it being the players choice.
[*]The upgrade system of the work stations takes a lot of space and there is weather degradation on the outside.
[*]That being said, repairs of buildings and gear don't consume resources.
[*]Generally the building system is intuitive and splitting stacks of goods with a slider is a good idea.
[*]As with the work stations, storing items consumes way too much space, because the chests have limited slots for items and stacking them, you need floor plates to build a sort of rack.
[*]Fast travelling as in portals is a good idea in this particular game.
[*] Mistlands: Great biome, the Feather Cape is priceless, given how often I died from fall damage falling off my roof. Introducing this magic build that late in the game is kinda awkward though.
[/list]

[b]Current verdict[/b]
Currently not on par with 7d2d or Rust, but has its own charm. Bought it, because many friends have it and is surely fun in co-op, but you can go PvP, if you feel like. The boss fight progression makes it interesting on the first playthrough, but could potentially hamper replayability.

.EDIT.

01/01/2024

TLDR:
After coming back this game year after year. Playing through its content updates I still recommend Valheim as one of the ultimate and challenging survival/building games on the market. Best Viking game there is and we as players were blessed with its release those years ago. 


You set up the pace and way you play this game, there is never a feeling of rush apart from when swarmed by enemies. It's is a combination of challenging yet very chilled out and laid back game play. In the beginning there is a lot of preparations for bosses and biomes. The progress is stuck behind recipes you unlock on your way and I couldn't think of better guided and beginner friendly way for this type of game. You kinda feel lost and mesmerised at the beginning but you don't feel unwelcome in this world but rather observed and studied. Meadows,  Dark Forest and even Swamps are one of the best biomes I had pleasure exploring.

The building itself is so satisfying and I come to this game whenever I'm really stress with personal life to unwind, listen to some podcast or music and build away in creative mode.

The content slow at first but very meaningful and every one of big content drops expand the universe and add to its already strong foundation. 

The only thing that will require looking into in the future is Combat mechanics while they are not too frustrating and give the core gameplay loop a steady flow it requires a lot of polishing eventually. It gets the job done for now and it's not a big of an issue apart from maybe a little bit of mountains and mistlands. They pose the land elevation challenge which are not suited too well for current combat system. Can't really hit some one underneath or over my head with a sword/spear etc. Combat feels too directional in those instances and while you do have bows they are single target which are useless in close quarter/many mobs encounters. 


Hope for many many more years and content in the future. And I shall update this review when times come. Good luck Vikings and your Valheim worlds be full of happy bees.",1614216005,1704092680,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

The building system is great with many angular pieces to work with. (Although limited material types so far). It takes physics and material strengths into account, so you'll actually NEED to use support beams and such to build structures. The task of building a long, tall bridge took over an hour even with all of the materials on hand.

The combat is fun, intuitive and can demand skill at times. There are different weapon types for different situations, keeping you on your toes when you haven't come to an area fully equipped for it's enemies.

There is a skill system that rewards you for every task you do, similar to runescape's.

Menial tasks such as chopping down trees, mining & hunting are made fun with satisfying mechanics. You can fell a tree just to have it knock down 3 more and save you a few minutes! 

There is a food system, but you cannot starve. You simply become a meek little baby-armed man without consuming good, quality foods.

The art direction is very retro, reminds me of old WoW.

I hope they're almost finished their second one but to be honest even with 6 developers 3 years is plenty of time to make 3 high quality updates without issue. Besides that the only nitpicks I have is to make the environment feel much more populated as it's pretty barren with few animals and enemies. Make dual wielding a thing, and expand more on magic. Lastly expand on the ocean as soon as possible. It is the region that the players will explore and travel on the most, and right now its just extremely empty. Maybe add islands with treasure, underwater caves, flora and fauna. With those I think the developers can make the game so much more enjoyable as the ocean is more of a hassle than a location with today's features.

The combat is weighty, skill-based, and deep. With versatile options for every scenario, stealth mechanics that allow for minimal-engagement playstyles, strengths and weaknesses of different weapons and enemies, meaningful and engaging gear tiers... 

The overall experience is well intertwined within itself.

Probably not. While the game certainly has its charms, it may not appeal to everyone. However, if you have at least one friend willing to join you on this Viking adventure, it's definitely worth giving it a shot.

The gameplay loop follows a straightforward pattern: gather resources, utilize them to craft food, construct a base (though building can be a bit challenging), fashion weapons and equipment, and then upgrade everything to its maximum potential before taking on the bosses. While this progression may sound simple, executing it is easier said than done, especially considering the ruthlessness of the enemies you'll encounter. The combat, while acceptable, could use more diversity in my opinion.

My primary qualm with the game revolves around the grind. For the majority of my playthrough, I followed the intended path, but the relentless grind eventually wore me down. In the interest  of finishing the game in a fast manner I resorted to  cheating in equipment for the final boss. Despite this shortcut, the overall experience remained a blast.

Valheim truly shines when experienced with a friend or a group. The camaraderie and shared challenges elevate the gameplay to new heights, making the grind more bearable and the victories more rewarding (It can also make for some pretty funny moments).

We all liked and enjoyed the game and had a lot of fun.
However, as time passed we all abandoned it for not a specific reason, and the desire to continue just faded away.
Months later, I checked into it again, and I have to say I think I'm about to complete it this time, but in this playthrough I'm solo.
[h3]!Spoilers ahead![/h3]
I recently defeated Moder, the fourth boss of the game in the mountain biome and shortly after, I arrived at the plains.
While I did not complete Valheim yet, I think I gathered the most aspects of it, and I think I'm safe to write this.
I want to mention that this won't be a structured text, I just throw in my opinion. 
As you might have noticed, I do recommend Valheim.
The game is a lot of fun, and it maybe is one of my favourite games.
The building and crafting have a lot of variety, the exploring is fun, the sounddesign is amazing, the art style is kind of unique etc...
I lost a couple of hours building and exploring, so yeah, a definite recommendation from me.

However, I kinda want to point out things that annoy me while I play.
And oh boy, these are some pretty annoying things, let me tell ya.

The first thing and probably the worst aspect in this whole game is the stamina and everything it is related to.
By god (and I don't even believe in one) this stamina system is a creation of the most ugly, nasty and deepest pit of hell you could ever imagine.
Every time I run out of stamina while a group of high levelled enemies like draugr, or fucking wolves are basically jumping me, this stupid stamina bar won't recover. 
It may even get worse when you're in the swamp, or you have to fight while it's dark and your character is cold (or even both).
It gets even worse.
If you ever come in a situation where you are out of stamina, wet AND cold all together (most likely in the swamp) while also being chased by enemies that are twice as fast as you, (most likely in the mountains) it is certain to say that you will most likely not recover a tiny bit of your stamina because if you try to block something, the bit of that stamina will be wiped out immediately.
To be fair, there are a couple of ways to prevent this from happening, and you can also speed up your stamina recovery.
But even when you are well rested, not freezing and not wet, the stamina still feels too slow in my opinion.
So Iron Gate, please change that.

The following arguments are rather minor complaints that I like to be fixed or changed:

- Make the character attack where the player is pointing at: it's kind of like in the FromSoftware games (like 
   Dark Souls)
   In FromSoft games, the character hits there depending on whether the player is looking down or up.
   This is helpful if an enemy is higher up or below the player.
   I wish that they would implement this feature in Valheim because sometimes enemies won't get damaged just 
   because they are a little too high or down.
   Maybe implement some sort of target lock in too.

-  The spear animation and moveset: 
    I personally like to use a spear in videogames, however not in Valheim.
    Normally, a spear provides a longer distance from the opponent and has a longer reach than a sword for 
    example.
    In Valheim the spear does not have these characteristics and feels actually too short mainly because the 
    character holds it kind of weird.
    I would like a rework of the whole animation and moveset.

-  More normal armour:
    It feels like there are too few armour sets to craft.
    I think that the armour that are already in the games look pretty solid and some give nice buffs.
    But I feel like there are too few normal armour sets, there could be some more.

-  Flesh Ripper animation rework:
    It's the normal fists moveset like come on I was expecting a unique moveset 

I know that some of these might get changed or fixed and of course they will add new armour, I just want to point that out.",1704035877,1704035960,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

How to describe Valheim?  Smooth.

There is progression, but world is open -- You could just run around gathering and building, if you wanted.  

Running, jumping, building, crafting, combat... it all feels just right.   

Valheim somehow makes gathering resources fun.   

Crafting is easy: A text list, no longer than needed.

Taking 30 mins to sail from one area to the next because things can't go through portals kills this game and absolutely destroys the fun of the grind. If you don't love waiting actual hours mindlessly sailing or running from one base to another because the metal ingots you have can't be transported through the portals you've crafted and placed, you will hate this game like I do.

Also severely disappointed in how useless taming animals was. Wolves, so powerful wild become fragile and useless when tames. 

The beauty of the game, the relatively fun combat, dungeons and bosses, and the creative building can't outweigh how absolutely BORING this game is. I'd rather just play one of the thousands of other games that do it better.

However the developers have put so much effort into the environment and the crafting aspects that the time you devote passes quickly with much to see and do. After 90h I've only killed the first boss, albeit have probably over prepared my armour and weapons for the second boss. I've got a boar farm running with breeding animals, vegetable garden, cooking and fermentation tanks, and a bunch of safe 'home bases' behind solid wooden fences to hide away inside. 

The lack of high resolution character models allows for processing power to be devoted to the forests, weather systems, animals roaming around, light shining through fog, etc - creating what I find an immersive gameplay experience. 

The combination of goals to aim for re the bosses but your choice about how fast you get there means its easy to pick up and play when you have a spare 30 minutes or equally if you are devoting a couple of hours to it. The game works great on the Steam Deck (first gen) also, with at least 2-3h battery life with the graphic settings turned up as far as possible on that platform.

I've not tried the teamplay aspect to it yet, but from what I've seen it looks to work well.

It does not respect your time, in exploration, gathering resources or building and defending your base. Mining is the worst part of gathering resources, while I understand that metals are game changing resources, it takes hours to mine enough to really accomplish anything. Mind you, there isn't just one type of metal to acquire either, there are two main ones that each have their own difficulties in obtaining, both which take hours to explore and find and then hours to collect. The map seeds are way too big! These worlds are absolutely massive and it could take you probably 3+ hours to sails from one side to the other. Honestly playing without using the Valheim map generator website, that lets you see your entire map, or using the dev command to reveal the map, is no longer viable. If you don't wish to waste time, then you need to know where you are going. Base building is probably the best any sandbox game has ever done tbh. However the raid mechanics comepletey ruin this especially the new raid. I Mistlands they added a new raid for those who completed the plains boss, your base will now be attacked by giant bugs from the sky who will literally BOMBARD your base and blow everything up. Just like that the base you spent possibly hundreds of hours working on, is just gone. Sometimes you get the troll raids that will do exactly the same thing, they will pummel your walls and smash everything, and the only way to stop them is to cheese the AI. This means the game is broken imo. Don't buy this, I know it looks super cool and fun but it will just waste your time.

EDIT: I have since returned to this game but in a modded state. I found many of the mods change the gameplay enough to make it enjoyable. Along with the new world modifiers included in a recent update, gathering resources no longer has to take hours irl just to progress even a little. Mistlands is still absolutely horrendous but the rest of the game can be enjoyable with the right settings and right mods imo.",1616459323,1703965566,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Minecraft, Starbound, satisfactory, and now valhiem

I bought this a long time ago, but i waited until more of the game was complete before I tried it out. Started playing co-op on a world last weekend and now i cant stop playing.

Every survival game should take a page out of this game. 

In my opinion, a good game is a game that has good progression. Obvious goals to achieve and shows the player that there are far things in the future that they have to do, but also gives you a direction to work towards and a sense of increasing power the more you play. And thats what this game does with hardly any interaction with the player besides a tutorial bird that lets you know about things in the game when you do something new.

It looks beautiful, there is definitely challenges to overcome with boss fights and gathering of materials that steadily increases with difficulty, the crafting and upgrading is great, the land bioms are great with pleanty of stuff to find and explore...

The only con's i would give the game is the amount of time it takes to get resources with the default settings. The default settings are not good for solo players, or even 2 people. Put 2x resourses on and portal items or else you game is going to be very tedious considering you are going to be doing ALL the work over huge distances.

This is how every survival game should be made in my opinion. Collect resources to get stronger, to overcome the new area to beat the boss and then keep doing that as the difficulty keeps going up. 

Great game. I just hope the developers keep updating it and there is no conflict with unity's new game engine rules.

Starting from scratch again almost 3yrs later and over 10 million copies later. They've done nothing to the early game. This is still a good $10-$20 game. This game earned over 100 million. This game feels like an indie studio released it this year.

I really really wanted to enjoy this game but after 180 hours on my first world I am done and I didn't even get to mist lands yet. The only thing this massive empty game has going for it is the mods. I needed about 30 quality of life mods and a new game model, my god that's the dumbest looking player character I've seen since the 90's and the fact that I was using a high poly vrm model with full hair and body physics there is no excuse to have such a poorly made character. you could have downloaded a free one for fuck sake ANYTHING would have been better, so meanwhile I spent about since hour 2 of game play not experiencing the gear visual progression because I could not stand to look at the player model with 3 chromosomes for a second longer. 

The game Progression is so linear for solo players you literally have to do exactly the same thing every time with no variation or you cant progress, collect this for way too long, walk here that's too long, wait for this to finish for way too long,  kill boss by cheesing the bow and arrow because that's the only way its possible to kill the boss's or you die in one hit or at least take enough damage in one hit to make you run away, go to next area do so same thing with different names. 

when I first started a game I opened the map and the size made me so excited to find out whats out there... Whats out there is exactly the same fucking thing that is here already Karen! 8 zones sounds like a lot but when 2 of them are not even finished so completely empty and serve no purpose one is the ocean that has a whole of 1 fucking enemy.... really 1. OK.  that leaves 5 different types of areas that look exactly the same no matter where in the world you are, to fill the entire planet... Its got stuff there so I guess but the stuff 3 hours away is exactly the same as the stuff that's on the ground right next to you right now. so there is no point at all, might as well just be a single island. 34,000 copper nodes generated. you will mine all of 2 maybe. 

Can we just talk about the combat, HOLY GAWD DAM WTF REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE....... To who ever though that amount of knock back from either side during combat was a good idea, please fill your pockets with rocks and walk into the ocean, you single handedly ruined this game for me to the point I wont even play it as intended anymore. I like to play games with no guide and to work things out myself but by the time I finished mountains with max gear for that area I thought obviously plains was the next port of call, I went, got absolutely fucking steam rolled by a Lox or what ever the fuck its called. you cant run you just run into more things that have no stamina bar meanwhile you're on borrowed time because you got stamina to worry about, Jump up on a high rock to take refuge, 40 tone animal can walk up vertical walls without missing a step and then proceed to hit you for 70% health and knock you back 300 meters into a mosquito that hits your for 10000 billions points and yeets you too the next island, meanwhile if you want to attack them back go fuck yourself that's not going to happen you are too far away from the knock back of the last hit. Imagine getting stun locked by an enemy AI well that's every fucking creature in the end part of the game. For a game that focuses on melee combat its pathetically garbage for players that use melee weapons. 

Max armour for area, max weapons for area, max food for area, max potions for area, you're still dying in 2 hits on normal even if you block who cares your getting stunned for 2 seconds so 8 other enemies can show up and shove there weapons in your ass. Not being able to override an attack with a block is actually retarded for a game that rely soley on you timing your block to stay alive.

OMG THE STAMINA, what the actual, really come on dude, who thought that making someone not be able to move or attack right in the middle of combat was a good idea is a dipshit. ""Oh you just have to manage your stamina better"", you mean like eating the equivalent of 3 whole deer then taking 4 steps and swinging my arms 3 times means I'm so tired I might not even move when this enemy smashes my head in with a rock, I would rather stand here and DIE then exert one more ounce of effort. Have you ever, you know, see that thing, REALITY! I don't care how frigging ""tired"" you are if you are in the middle of combat you WILL find the energy to do SOMETHING about ANYTHING then just be more tired afterwards, your not going to stand there and just die, though at this point I wish who ever made these decisions just would.

Overall I feel this game is designed to waste as much of your time as possible, from the ridiculously and unnecessarily small inventory and chests systems, to the have to wait 30 seconds for every cook or craft to the obnoxious items weights and stack sizes to the obscenely long distances between places, All the way down to the fact that if you die, you're screwed.. good luck getting your stuff back the enemies that chased you across the map for 15 minutes are NEVER leaving your grave.

Now, if you're like me and don't have endless amount of time or penchant for masochism (I realized this after dying 3 times trying to recover items from my corpse in a dungeon) you can change your game settings  to casual / easy mode to make it a little less intense and unforgiving.

Here are a few things I want to highlight:

The building system is one of my favourite aspects of most survival games, and Valheim does it best. This game's building system is very versatile and its strong point. Some games of the same genre made me feel like there wasn't really a point to settling down and building a base (e.g. The Forest / Sons Of The Forest), but in Valheim, there absolutely is. You need different kinds of workbenches to craft certain items to progress in the game, and eventually beat the boss in the next biome, and you need a place to put them in, where they are safe from being destroyed in raids. This means walling off your base or building it in places not easily reachable by mobs is highly recommended. You can, however, cheese most types of raids by exploiting the terraforming tool to build walls out of dirt, that are completely indestructible. I've never employed this strategy, because I feel as though it ruins some of the fun. Everything you build also has a stability level. A structure that isn't supported well enough (e.g. by pillars connected to the ground) will break. Certain structures, like wood, that are exposed to the rain for extended periods of time will also lose up to 50% of their stability. Structures which haven't yet broken can be repaired at any time with the hammer.

The gameplay is pretty fun and challenging at times. For me, most of it consists of gathering resources for the next building project. Some of said resources can only be acquired in specific biomes and sometimes require sifting through dungeons. There are numerous types of dungeons spread across different biomes that differ in size, loot, and enemies you encounter within them. The resources you loot in dungeons will have to be brought back home to refine them. The map is quite sizeable and usually divided into islands by an ocean biome, so you will want to have other means of transportation than walking available, such as carts or boats. The easiest way of transportation is portals, but there are some restrictions on which materials you're allowed to carry through them. In my opinion, the game is infinitely more fun with friends, but it can be played in single-player as well. The damage and HP of enemies scales according to the amount of players on a map, and the difficulty settings can be customised.

There seems to be some controversy regarding Valheim's graphics. I think it is beautiful. Yes, the textures are pixelated, but the lighting makes it look gorgeous (and there are mods that replace the textures with higher resolution ones, if you so wish). It's a great vibe, especially combined with its relaxed ambient music, that changes depending on the biome you're in. Although the soundtrack does get a little bit repetitive after the 400 hours I've spent in the game. Also, everyone I've played this game with has praised how good the water looks. Especially the ocean during storms. This is a big plus point, since you will probably travel by boat very often.

I can highly recommend the game. You can get it for very cheap, and the value for money is insane. Ashlands, a new biome for Valheim, is currently in the works at the time of this review, and will presumably add a large amount of content to the game, completely for free.",1703786023,1703786023,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

He kept on nagging to take a look and because the game is well priced and said I will have a go. It was not long before I got addicted! To summarise the game imagine clash of clans but third person building your fortress while fighting Goblins, Trolls, Wolves, Yeti's, Dragons etc. Remember to make some Yummy food as that will HELP. In short it is a open world game that is very fun to explore solo or with friends on your own server with ADJUSTED settings (What!!!????). Don't forget to look up some mods that makes the game more exciting and quality of life. (If some of you are interested in settings of my servers and what mods, comment down below :)

And while it succeeds at being challenging, it's at the cost of the fun.

Building a base is hard, filled with questionnable design choices such as ""smoke from campfires can kill you if your house isn't open enough"" but at the same time wood simply doesn't burn, rain damages structures up to 50% of their health, stamina is a BITCH, ...

The game is fun when everything goes as you wish it does but unfortunately in the early game it's a very rare occurence, and while it does get better when you figure out how to obtain better gear, I still feel like this game punishes the player for enjoying it.

It's as if someone was slapping me in the face everytime I have mild fun, it's just unfair.

So yea I knew it would be hard but there are a lot of things that are either not fun or not making sense, and on top of that the map is GIGANTIC and takes ages to go through to find the slightest thing, and while I know it does get better with portals and such.. it's still a pain.

pros:
- the sound is amzing, mainly with rain and storms also the environment, the wind, the animals, etc
- the visuals are also quite beautiful, although not ""2021 graphics"", you can clearly see the character model is a bit bad, few polygons and all, but the landscapes, the sky, the weather etc are on point
- the crafting / building / gathering / cooking / upgrading etc and even the construction is really well made and well thought of
- the feeling of exploration and excitement is on point
- the weather and wind is also well thought, seeing the ocean going up and down with the tides and storms is also on point

cons:
- the combat, so far, is relatively easy once you understand how to kite or block in time

One can indulge in multiple urges: building a nice home and workshop, managing resources, fishing, exploring the land, beating difficult monsters. All that with moderate resource requirements, it runs well in old computers, which allows me to play multiplayer on LAN. I have re-started the game each time a new biome is released, and playing again is still quite good because there are different strategies to try, new architecture stiles, new terrain modifications to defeat bosses, etc.

Remembering that this is still a pre-release, there are some problems:

I find that multiplayer is still a bit buggy, with multiple unexplained missed connections. I can't make my Steam Deck to connect to a PC game in the same LAN, where other PCs can play on the same game without problems. 

Development has been slow, the game still doesn't have all the biomes that were planned. 

While exploring is encouraged by the game mechanics, there are few unique things to find other than more land biome combinations. I wish there were more surprises, treasures and unique items or beasts in the map.

Many small bugs like fish on the air, birds flying through water, floating items. etc.

The good parts of this game will keep you hooked. Exploring, crafting, building, O.K. combat, and sailing. Its very satisfying to build your way up and get to the largest boat and sail across ""oceans"", rivers, and up streams. It is also very punishing when you die very far from your ""camp"". Over all I had tons of fun playing with friends and getting into new areas through the power of teams work.

AAANNNDDD now the bad. Just like everyone else, I am also disappointed with the lack of content over the past two years. An early warning sign that this was going to happen was the dev team removing the road map not too long after launch. It is also fair to say that recent patches have comments disabled, most likely due to amount of people wanting/demanding content. A lot of players constantly asking where the promised content is, is not a bad thing, it shows that the community is still invested. BUT when the devs disable comments because the invested community wants meaningful updates on content... THAT looks bad. 

The way I see it, I spent $20, and got 257+ hours of enjoyment out of this game. I won. If the devs kill the game now and never fulfill their promises, they can only hurt themselves, tarnish their company name, and lose what trust the community has left. They can't take back the hours of fun I have had and the memories I have made with friends.

TLDR: For the low cost, its a lot of fun. Don't expect any more content, its probably never coming.

Years Later: Devs are still trash. Barely put out anything new/good. Old problems still exist, and Mods are beating the SHIT out of the Devs for improvements. Sad really, but sucks to suck.",1663602035,1703749934,False,7,0,0.543130993843078613,0,True,False,True

I wanted to post a positive review but I ran out of stamina...

Overwhelmingly positive? What's positive about this game? HIV test? Because this game is pure AIDS. This game has more stupid mechanics than a goddamn Lada factory.

The shattered expectations biome...

I was really excited about this game and was expecting to absolutely love it. But I hate it, there is not a single thing in this game that I like. Usually when I don't recommend a game, there is a specific reason and I might still like some aspects of the game. Valheim? There is not a single fucking thing that I like. Let me put it this way, when I was 6 my parents took me on a vacation and we went to a restaurant and I ordered fish. It was really good, but unfortunately, the next day I kept throwing up and had a really strong diarrhea for the next couple of days. Now that dinner cost like 10 euros. Even though I literally shit my pants because of it, I can still say, I had one hell of a tasty dinner. With Valheim, I spent 20 euros and there was not a single moment of joy. No tasty treat, just me and my destroyed anus. I'd return it but unfortunately I played more than 2 hours, and you can't really get to know this game in less than 2 hours. At first I was confused by some mechanics but I thought this was just the beginning of the game and everything will fall in its place and the game will be good...but the game just kept adding more bullshit. Let me break it down.

Nice try Minecraft...

Lets start with the visuals, the biomes and the weather are beautiful. The forests are really nice, the fog, the weather and sunsets are really pretty. But this game still has minecraft graphics. You can polish it with pretty lighting, sprinkle glitter all over it, this game still has minecraft graphics, that's not a good thing. But ok, on this scale I guess you have to sacrifice something, especially if you're an indie developer.

Gameplay? Slow, tedious, repetitive...

By far the biggest disappointment is combat. I have nothing against skill-based combat, nothing against stamina mechanics (Conan Exiles after the Age of War update has excellent stamina-based combat) but there is something about overdependence on stamina in this game that makes you want to kill yourself. It takes a couple of swings to run out of stamina, that's fine you should plan your attacks, but it takes SUPER INCREDIBLY LONG to actually recharge. I have never seen such a slow stamina recharge. This absolutely destroys the fluidity of combat and it feels like a turn-based RPG, except enemies keep swinging at you while you can barely move. Moreover, the enemies keep swarming you everywhere you go and it doesn't matter if you kill one wave, the next one comes like 10 seconds after that. WHY??? The combat is cumbersome, clunky to say the least and the garbage AI is not making it any better. Enemies mostly just spam you with attacks, rarely block and instead, when you manage to hit them they just start running around, and you have to chase them. Because of the dumb stamina mechanics, imagine you want to run to relocate, then you stop to attack and nothing happens. Why? You're out of stamina. Imagine you are losing the fight, so you decide to run, but there's a bunch of obstacles that you have to jump over in order to escape, you press jump, nothing happens. Why? Because You're out of stamina.

You might have noticed me dropping subtle hints that I'm not a big fan of stamina in the game. So let's talk about it some more. It's not just combat. You can't get up  slightly steep inclines without holding a sprint button, you can't jump without stamina, which, as I mentioned, runs out immediately. So basically, without stamina you just can't get around even minor obstacles. Imagine that when running away from battle, the AI will follow you for a very long time and you will run out of stamina after a few meters and if you find yourself underneath a hill? You're dead. Now imagine you are sliding off a slightly steep hill and into the water. You've used all of your stamina. If you are in water you have to swim, but if you don't have stamina, you start to lose health. So you slide into water which kills you, because you have no stamina and you can't get out, because you have no stamina.

The amount of stamina as well as health depend on what you've eaten. Now here is a mechanic that whoever came up with needs to stop making videogames and requalify as an electrician or something. In Valheim your base health and stamina are very low and you have eat food to get a temporary buff. After 20 minutes have passed, you either have to eat more food or go back to so little base health that even the weakest enemies kill you in a few hits. Now combine low stamina when not having eaten with the stamina regen and regen delay and you can barely move around. I think this is why I went 19 hours instead of 30 minutes before getting absolutely sick of this game. Also did I mention that you need to eat three different kinds of food to get a decent buff? Yeah, each of the three gives only one third to your ""full"" health and stamina. You can't stack effects of just one food, you need to eat three different kinds. So if you can only find one kind of food? Too bad, you can only eat that once every 15 minutes. Yes, 15 minutes, remember how I said the buff lasts 20 minutes? Well after 15 minutes the buff reduces by one half. So even though, technically the HUD says the food lasts you 20 minutes, it's actually 15. To say this mechanic is very stupid would be an understatement as this goes way beyond the level of mental retardation.

And basebuilding, my favorite part in RPG's and survival games. Valheim presents a more advanced system of building with a lot of freedom. However, the system is so chaotic and random, that you build a big house only to have random pieces of it lose health or just burst alltogether. Combine this with the necessity of being within the range of a workshop in order to build anything at all, and the relatively small range of the workshop, the game punishes you for trying to build something bigger. Also having to nail the right angle with laser accuracy to snap objects where you actually want them, completely ruin basebuilding.

Crafting...dear lord...so you need to refine ore, right? Ok, well the smelter doesn't have a UI or a menu. You need to load ore from one side, and coal from the other side. One coal is not enough to make one ignot, you need two. And the smelter has a maximum capacity of 10 ore and 20 coal, so you can make 10 ignots. So in order to make just 10 ignots you need to load up the smelter and then wait like an idiot, because it takes a long time but not long enough to do something else, also the ignots don't stay in the smelter, remember, I said it doesn't have a UI, so the ignots fall on the ground, if during that time you decided to venture on one of the painful journeys that the game offers, you would risk losing them.

For instance: you cannot teleport metals. That sounds fne until you realize that biomes can be 15-20 real world minutes of walking away and are the only place to get the metal. But you can just make the trip and gather all the ore you want right? WRONG becuase everything weighs a metric ton and you cannot even carry a full stack of ore, So you get a ship to move some of the items, only it can only hold 4 stacks. So you now can spend all that time sailing back only to realise you cant craft anything with it.

Lets talk about dying. If you die in the wrong area, prepare to spend the next 45 minutes to an hour TRYING to get it back. You drop all of your items when you die and loose skill points that you train by using your weapons and tools. Is that fair? Arguably you need a punishment when you die to prevent suicide runs to beat the game. The BS is when a enemy appears out of no where and two shots you with the best armor for the area. So you get to run and get your stuff, only to have to die to the freezing of the mountains or the poison of the Swamps. Wolves will spawn out of nowhere and charge off a cliff face to kill you. 

Yes, I understand you need to be punished for dying, but when everything can two-tap you if you accidently try to run up a small hill becuase you ran out of stamina. Not to menton a good majority of the enemies are faster than you when sprinting and have unlimited stamina.

Combats sticky, slow, lacking in any depth and often just is annoying. As said above, you better make sure any major fights happen on solid and level ground or the terrain may make your extremely specific hitbox wiff while the monster can hit you. Most monsters the tactic best suited is to just run in circles with a bow since running and attacking already drain your stamina bar that until later on which regens slowy. Any potions for that have a cooldown. It's not hard though, just mostly wrought with little annoyances that make it tedious and slow. You can't avoid it however, progressions locked behind boss fights which are ok but the combats lack of depth and rock paper scissors resistances make it pretty dull.

""Feel like sick monkey in piranha pool."" - Survival of Fittest

Valheim do have charm in it and the game work with co-op. It's workable sandbox game with liner progression, RPG element and its own unique. But very bare bone of everything and I mean it. You can spend lot of time worth its price because it force you to play that way.

I.... didn't hate Valhelm but I hate lot of thing that didn't translate well in Survival game are cram in this one. I do recommend to try it, but be prepare to waste a lot of your time since Valhaim grinding is garbage tier like MMO mobile without automode. THAT much.

Imagine playing Minecraft but you can carry only 32 iron and your sword need 64 to craft and 32 each to upgrade with 1 point of damage 4 times. Include armor, Iron deposit is 5-10min to travel back cuz no teleport allow with those ore.

Sandbox element is VERY limit. You don't have much to choose and those rain / roof mechanic force it more. You can try to be creative, but earth is limited.

Combat is ..... wonky. You feel OP and strong because of GEAR, not your 'player' skill. Much like those MMO mobile. While game allow to dodge, parry. It's still tie directly to gear and food buff. So you are not Viking try to reach Valhalla. But sick monkey pretend to be one. 
Weapon reach is short and slow. Stamina drain is huge. Monster run around toying with your office syndrome monkey. Some are just unfair to create FAKE challenge. No git gud or skill issue white knight magic can save your sorry dev a*s. but pure DEV issue again. It's complete lazy and childish design.

One thing I don't like but it work as game progression is design monster and biome with intent you have xxx buff with you. Instead of make it somehow hard but you can workaround or use those option to make it easier. Cuz its mean you have to grind for it - again. Waste your time to do a chore in game to actually progress.

Some said like it create realistic element... no, it's not. Realistic are not going along with RPG and lot of sandbox game mechanic with enemy advantage. If you said Valhaim is hard because you are sickly salary man try to survive in savanna then I'll agree with you.

Random event raid your base is another one that put ultimate cheap spawn from 7 Days to Die to shame due to combat / respawn mechanic. It's happen randomly (20% each 46 min.) and suddenly. Stronger with each boss killed. So you are force to active like Don't Starved all the time in this grinding MMO mobile - like game?

Remember that your power come from gear and food buff so if you die once, it's a slog death loop until it's stop. That not include some enemy destroy your chest or obliterate your farm. Good thing is destroyed item drop their material.... well, exclude you beloved farm/tame animal. And you only lose hard earn grinding skill once in a while :v

Also darkness is far more worst of all game out here. No brightness option, your torch is a matchstick. Other light is box of matchstick. Fog block everything like London smog. Okay, this is good point of Valhelm that light radius is VERY realistic ...... that don't translate well in game with heavy combat and RPG like this.

Dev force disadvantage on everything and I mean everything.

I .... like to say about good thing in Valhelm but I can't find strong point of it. Only unique point that each other game have so it's don't count. Everything else is working and bare bone. So.... Valhelm is ""Working sandbox game with co-op"" You have lot of thing to do, but not much deep each. You spend lot of time because it force you to grind. So it's worth a price if you want to spend your time to farm something and play with your friend or love doing slowly while solo it.

I highly recommend MOD Valheim for EXTREME FAR BETTER experience. That why I recommend it.",1703674592,1703675656,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I dont know how to state this rightously right, but the ""magic"" for this game, for me personally, is gone. almost 1,5 years and no update what so ever, even modders can do the things the dev promissed in like 5 minutes. Its bland, its boring and after 1,5 years only some new monsters and some flying particles? I think they took the money and ran away instead of working further towards creating one of the best Games out there. I can´t recommend It in this state sorry. 
PS: I know Ashlands is on the way but I don´t want to wait 12 Months for updates, I got my moneys worth out of this game and at the first time it was really magical. I even only played It with another friend of mine so the less players the more hardcore this game gets but If you got atleast two braincells you can organize and plan your adventures accordingly. 

At the moment all my friends I got to now weeks after in discord and several ""playthroughs"" - Boss Killing and the like, nobody is playing this game anymore I mean for what? For Farming health pots? For Farming Armor which is pointless after the new update? Maybe I come back when I got my Dr. Degree in 2030 and this game is out of EA. 

Hail Odin.

::Edit after 30 hours:: 2021

So we just scratched the survace on the first Part but now we´ve build a Village, crafted a massive amount of defense structures, build a ton of boats to roam the world and the different biomes and my friends and I can´t get enough of this game.

We are at the third Boss at the moment (there are five currently) and already saw the Icemountains and slayed some wolves and dragons there. We ""as casual gamers"" bought the Game on thursday and we all got family, work, things to do. But already just as I said, have over 30 hours in this game I think this will speak for Itself. 

There are well a LOT of hours more to come to explore, to clinge your anus because you are nearly dead or try running around a dozen of goblins just to get your corpse back and never set foot on this cursed Island again.

Truly an Inspiring game that I hope in the near future will release more and more content so we finally got a game on our hands with which we can grow and Its community together <3

::Original Review after some hours after release::

So I JUST played an hour and want to share my experience.

Started the Game and laughed on the animation... bla bla story bla bla ...30 fps with ultra settings okay... 
Changing everything and only play on 2k instead of 4k (I do not have the best gaming pc)

Now I got like 70 fps, perfect for me. I do my first steps and listen to the crow, I should search for stones and harvest wood.. Oh Berrys! yum yum... oh cool you can replenish HP with Food and you NEED to eat a variety of foods so you don´t get bored (not the typical Instant Ramen Student I see..) 

where is the stone? *Hits stone with fists* - Skill Level Up 1 unarmed. Wait what? You NEED to actually use the skills to improve in those fields? (Dungeon Siege <3) 

Okay so I found some stones near the beach and hit a tree with my fists (yes yes every minecraft veteran knows the deal)

Wait... you can build in this game TOO?! I build a workbench and from there I saw how much new recipes got into my book. Nah I don´t want to build here... running further into the forest... an abondened house? Wait... theres a door... okay seems pretty empty... a chest! Just a torch with some ""coins""? I wonder why I need coins later in this game are there traders?

Okay in this house the roof is broken but no problem with my new recipes, I build a campfire, a cooking station, found out that you can Sit to ""rest"" and gain HP and Stamina back. Wait... do I enjoy this game?...

Just a little bit more... Okay I got 1 hour and 30 Minutes left so I can still refund If I want to...

a boar! I attack him with my self made club from Wood & Stone, haha drop that juicy raw meat and give me that leather! Oh new recipes... Wait Shields are in this game too and I could dodge roll the incoming attacks If I want to? (Dark Souls fan bois) 

Okay time to step up my game... I need those trousers so I get a little bit more armor... Oh its nighttime... okay well I guess I head back to my cabin and build a sleeping spot... wait a moment I need to lit the fire in front of the entrance in case some wild animals want to sneek up on me.... 

I got a ""dream"" which told me that I saw the rivers flow upright and something bad is about to happen... some sort of God? just send out his animal forest squad to give me the creeps... So I need to defend my new home from those strange animals.. Done.... THIS IS MY HOOD!!! ah I lost a lot of HP wait... I still got the raw meat... I just need to cook It over the fire *PING* Oh I think its ready or Is it? .... oh wait.. nice now I got coal in my hands .... again .... okay thats It! (Ever played Monster Hunter and loved the cooking? you will do here too)

After I made myself a shield and a bow with some arrows I get confident and run into the forest... some sort of shamans are attacking me... okay thats why Its called the black forest... I barely survived and took myself into my warm cabin once again with freshly cooked meat and something that sparks my hearth with joy ... yes It feels like I play those games again that I already played as a kid and had SO much fun with... I´m speaking of a game that will give you vibes like: Dungeon Siege | Monster Hunter | Dark Souls | open world building Games | retro style graphics.

Of course that is only my first Hour into the game but at this point I will not refund It at all, just for this little hour were I forgot all of the trouble that is in the worlds right now... the dev deserved my money.

Each world you create is a ton of fun to slowly explore and map out, the progression is satisfying, and difficulty scaling is just right, with enemies from harder areas not just leveling up with your gear, but requiring you to use that gear more effectively.

Building is limited but you can still create beautiful structures if you are creative. The only problem with building is that raids limit what can practically be built. A cozy forest village will be a lot harder to keep intact than a stone castle built in a flat clearing.

Bossfights are fun and definitely test your mastery of combat. Combat itself is a pretty simple parry and punish system, but it feels good to do so. Each enemy has different parry timings, so you will have to learn how to handle each enemy differently.

Visuals are great, the low resolution textures combined with the extremely dynamic lighting system make a very distinct art style that works extremely well with the environments of the game.

Overall a ton of fun, even after many full playthroughs. As you learn more about the progression, you learn more ways to sequence break and progress faster on your next playthrough. For example [spoiler]Using trolls to break copper/tin deposits, venturing into frost caves and breaking doors to get iron, using a big hammer to dowse for silver[/spoiler].

Overall, I'm liking the game a lot. 

1. You will die, a fair bit. Happily all your stuff stays at your death spot, for apparently forever.  Unhappily, all your stuff stays at your death spot until you retrieve it, which can be challenging.  Or you can get the materials back together to make new stuff. 

2. Food is literally life/health.  You have a base 25 hit points.  That's ok in a safe area in the Meadows but not for much else.   You have 3 and only 3 food slots which you can fill with different types of food.  Food gives you both hitpoints (Health) and stamina.  Stamina is what lets you swing an axe, run or even swim.  no stamina, no doing anything except walking SLOOOOWLY.   Health and Stamina regen at a rate and to a level that depends on how long ago you last ate.  Eventually you can craft things that will help that. 

3. You Know Nothing.  The only way you learn about things you can craft or build, is by finding the related materials.  Literally, you pick up a piece of flint, now you know how to make a flint axe!  Same with basically everything. You get very minor tutoring at the beginning but not much.  I think you may start by knowing how to make a stone axe.  You then need some wood and stone to make a hammer.  The hammer is what lets you build stuff in the wild, and make the first crafting station.  Crafting stations let you craft good things like bows and armor etc. Note, you need a bed, covered by  a roof and claimed by you, in order to have it be a re spawn point.   Add a campfire and you can sleep the night there nicely too. 

4. The map is divided into different biomes.  Meadows, Swamp, Mountains etc.  Each biome has a different difficulty,  different enemies and most importantly, different materials.  Progression is based off of new materials, but also off of killing the Biome Boss which usually provides an item you need to get new materials in the next biome. 

5.  The play:  You gather materials, learn to craft new things or food or both, craft better stuff.  Venture into tougher biome to get better materials, die.  go back to get your stuff... die.   go back again, maybe get your stuff and run away or die and decide to make new stuff... Finally clear enough of the next biome to get to the better materials.  Make better stuff.  Find the boss area.  Summon the boss.  Kill the boss, get new item needed to get better materials in next biome, rinse and repeat.  (NOTE:  I have only just made it into the 3rd biome so the ""die.  go back to get your stuff... die. "" part is very much my experience. :D )

6. Building and fortification:  Reasonable options here and I highly recommend building a very defensible, forward base close to the next biome you are headed for.  So far I've been able to build in the Meadows (easiest biome), close to places like the Mountains or the Swamp etc.   

7. Except, perhaps the Meadows, Do what the game says, Don't travel at night if you can avoid it.  Everything comes out at night in considerably larger numbers to hunt you down in the dark. 

8. You will eventually be able to plant and grow things.  Apparently you can also raise some livestock though I've not been able to myself yet. 

9. Aside from the rather challenging critters in each biome, there are also Crypts and things which are basically small dungeons, which usually have special stuff you need or want.  

Ok, that should at least get you going reasonably well.   So far I highly recommend it. :-D",1703637565,1703637565,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The building in this game is amazing. I've never been a good builder in any game i play, like everything i build ends up looking like trash. but on valheim, even the worst builders can make a base that looks epic.
the progression system is amazing. grinding for resources is rewarding. no need to look up details on how to play the game every 5 minutes. combat is solid once you figure out how to do it. enough content to last hundreds of hours. im only 64 hours deep and have barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. awesome experience in both single and multiplayer. really theres nothing not to like about this game if im being honest with you.

lineal and soulless attemp of making a 3d terraria

there is no proper character personalitation and sometimes you are forced to use an specific weapon to deal enough damage so, even if you think that there are weapon choices, there are not. This is worst in MP where everybody wears the same armor and use the same weapon

lineal rpg progression in a sand box, nothing to say here...they should learn by playing dont starve or grounded..

you are mining and chopping...nothing else...the goal is to mine the new colored ore and wood with you new reskinned axe and pickaxe...amazing and not repetitive at all gameplay

it has stupid mechanics like reparing equipment for free but you need to craft a workbench with walls and roof...srly? you make it free but makes us do such tedious thing everytime????

And when your friend accidentally builds a ladder to nowhere because they misplaced a floorboard? Well, that's just Valheim saying, ""Who needs logic when you can have a stairway to the sky?""

Devs, on multiple occasions, have broken promises and scaled back their scope, all while ignoring requests for basic features such as QoL and Keybinds. 

Take the 2021 Roadmap for example, 4 Major updates by the end of 2021. We've gotten 2. In late 2023.

Devs, essentially, got a bunch of money and ironically slowed DOWN on development, seemingly investing zero profit back into their ""early access"" game.

I support Indie Devs, and I understand how difficult game development is, but for god's sake don't just start breaking promises and scaling back once your game gets successful. These actions have left a lot of players in the dust, and actually made a lot of the playerbase quit. 

An example of this is Modifiers. Highly requested, easy to add (I hope), and beneficial to the game. Modifiers weren't added until late 2023.
Until now, you had to deal with Portal Restrictions, mind numbing resource rates, and unforgiving gameplay, assuming you didn't want to mod.

This long delay absolutely butchered the target audience. People who didn't want to grind that long dropped the game, and people who didn't want the game to be so unforgiving also just dropped the game.

This game is labelled as ""early access"", making players expect a finished product in a reasonable amount of time. It's been 3 years, and with only 2 updates, ""early access"" has become downright misleading on this game. It's currently half baked, missing a lot of features a lot of other games have, but fanboys will say it's okay because the Devs ticked the ""early access"" box.

All of these decisions actually hurt the longevity of the game.


Even though this game had a lot of potential, most of it was crushed by the Dev's inability to follow through with a success. If you have 1+ friends, and have the ability to mod the game, I'd say give it a go. 

Otherwise, don't buy this game expecting content expansions within reasonable periods of time. Game may be fun for 1-2 playthroughs, but there's virtually no replayability aside from waiting for content drops.",1612544474,1703564286,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,True

 Edit: (few months later from initial review) After 600 hours of play personally, I'm starting to be concerned with the lack of content updates from the devs. I wouldn't say its a EA cash grab just yet but its becoming concerning 6 months almost into the year and content patch 1/6 hasn't even released.

The developers have made a ton of profit off sales and continue to sandbag development. Forget about Valheim for 5-10 years.

892970,154405935,76561198018857934,0,1,2574,0,2574,1703538319,"Dear hardcore fan of survival-craft games,

I suggest you don't spend your time on this game. As this game is highly overrated. Moreover, I strongly believe that it doesn't respect your, player's, time. The game might be bigger than sum of its components. However, this is not about Valheim. Here are 10 facts that I came across:
1) Combat is not fluid enough, hitboxes are very wacky, sometimes you can't hit enemies 1 centimeter above/below you. There are some types of enemies even designed to exploit that (hello ticks from Mistlands). Additionally you can complete the whole game with one type of weapon because all the enemies are basically bullet sponges and if you use wrong type of damage you still use the same tactics to kill an enemy, it will just take you much more time to do so. Rolls and blocks are not essential to the combat, they are quite inconvenient, waste a lot of stamina and you will be better off with hit and run anyway.
2) Movement in vanilla game is quite bad in some use cases, you will be climbing the hills a lot and that doesn't feel good since you don't have any mechanics that help you (grabbing the ledge, etc.). Eventually this becomes a Skyrim mountain goat simulator. Swimming is awful because enemies can hit you in you water, while you are totally helpless. You run out of stamina very fast and when you are out of stamin in the water you literally die. Beware that some locations are based around water inside them (Swamp, Mistlands). Stamina in the vanilla games feels like an obstacle to artificially extend the game time instead of a fun mechanic.
3) Building is okay but nothing outstanding, you can't terraform as much as you can in Minecraft but that's not an issue. Sticking structures can sometime be a problem because of height differences though. Your best bet is to look for another flatter place then. However, I don't find much pleasure or incentive to build in Valheim but maybe that's just me personally.
4) Survival aspect is once again okay, but can be a bit grindy at times but more on that below. I can't say that survival is the main mechanic of the game, it is just there to be there.
5) Crafting is very primitive, no complex pipelines for crafting advanced stuff, no multi-structure buildings, the formulae is very simple. You build a work station, you build addons to the work station, you build a work station for the next tier of items, you build addons, rinse and repeat. No ingenuity or planning required.
6) UI is very poor (in vanilla game, somewhat fixed in mods). You have very limited inventory space in your own inventory and chests, stack sizes are very small. Managing your inventory and chests is very annoying since even the most fundamental things like moving in stacks or sorting is missing. And that's not the only concern about the UI. I spent most of my time in a modded playthough and QoL changes are so massive that you remember vanilla UI as a nightmare.
7) Progression feels forced, you level up in multiple stats but you don't gain new skills/play styles/traits, you don't feel more powerful, instead you like hit 10% harder when you've leveled 10 levels in some skill, you don't even feel that you've progressed.
8) Automation is absent in vanilla game. Want to craft new armor? Good for you, just remeber to spend around an hour close to your refineries even if you already have all the necessary resources. And you will do it very often since the game is so GRINDY...
9) Grind is a synonym to this game, if you go vanilla route, prepare hundreds of hours to complete the game. You will encounter grind in every aspect of the game. Gathering resources - check, refining resources - check, moving resources - check, killing mobs - check, inventory management - check, running from point A to point B - check. But this is for the greater good of an epic adventure, right? Right?!
10) Adventure - You kill your first boss Eikthyr in an hour, that was quite fun and new, you go for your second boss - the Elder, you find new resource types, you prepare your gear, you search the dungeon for the mark to the boss spawner, you bring the sacrifice, boom... you got him, well done. And... you do the same for every other remaining boss in the game but it gets progressively more grindy. The formulae gets stale after the 3rd boss. The bosses themselves aren't unique, some just have fire effects, other frost effects, etc; boss fights are very easy to figure out and solve, no challenge here, 1-2 attack patterns and that's it, just quintessential 'hit them until they die'. Finding bosses is not exciting or story driven, you explore the same dungeons until you get lucky to find a hint to their locations. Dungeons are very similar even across different bosses. And finally, once you defeat the boss, the reward is just miserable compared to the grind you did to overcome them. 
What can I say to conclude? Yes, Valheim has some redeeming qualities, the graphics and aesthetics feel nice, you can sometimes encounter some beautiful scenery and take a screenshot, viking lore can be fun. Despite that, essentially, all the game mechanics are already present in other survival-craft games and each one of them is done better in most of them. Valheim is a kind of 'jack-of-all-trades but master of none', you get a lot of very shallow features to work with. I can't recommend this game to anyone who has already been exposed to the games like Rust, Minecraft, Terraria, Don't Starve, etc. as you will be spending 90% of your time in an endless loop of grind being constantly frustrated to have that sweet 10% of fun.

P.S. mod support is not top-tier in this game either, a lot of really useful mods are outdated, installing and managing mod versions across the client and server can be painful and I haven't seen any major game-overhaul Minecraft or Skyrim level mods, just small improvement.",1703544250,1703544250,False,4,0,0.403447121381759644,0,True,False,True

 It seems to try to capture some of the experiences we felt with games from 20-30+ years ago but provide some modern conveniences. 

There's both extremely easy and very challenging components to the game.  It has an interesting mix of challenge and ease both for single player and for specific amounts of players... where with single certain fights and situations can be harder, but overall the food and resource situation is much easier, where with 2 it's pretty balanced overall, but 3+ you have to have more specific farming or gathering folks to sustain a constant explore and conquer playstyle. 

One thing that was great from old school RPG's was the ability to just walk somewhere and die, where most games keep you sort of noobishly ""hemmed in"".  I like that you can RNG mountain super close to the starting point and unknowingly get one shot by a wolf on the edge and have to strategize sometimes how to even get your items back.  I also like the daunting oceans for the first times, not really sure how it's going to go.. and unsure what awaits when you do find land.

The music is quite good, not quite as insane as 7 days to die but really good and helps keep you enraptured in the game.  This game is easy to forget you need to stretch, drink water, eat food :D 

Overall I'd give this game a 9.5/10 because it does have some issues that can be improved on but overall it's absolutely worth the money.  Even with a basic base building functions available, you can create some incredibly cool bases :)

I had heard that at least the blocking would be changed with the new update but there was no noticeable upgrade and I was sorely disappointed.  And at some point you  just get tired of having to go find all your shit over and over again after dying.  I would give this game a 4/10 because it wasn't all bad. Just most of it.

Update:
giving another try since a lot has been added in the last few years.

Instead they said mid-December that yea your out of luck, chose an abundance of vacations/holidays in 2023, and kicked the can so they had a ""known body of work"" to tackle in 2024.  They are going to string the major content they've been working on all 2023 until late in Q2 2024 and then go on vacation again.  Then talk about the final biome release in Q3 2024 and have nothing new for next holiday season again.  They will then deliver the final content for the holidays in 2025.

Fog - Way to much fog that hangs around for way to long. This can bring gameplay to a screaming halt for up to 10 min. Boring.
Unclear tech tree. I gave up trying to figure out the tech tree. I just google it all now.
Stamina. Does this game understand that the Norsemen depicted had stamina beyond that of a morbidly obese 6 year old?

Likes - The idea of conquering each area, while wildly unbalanced at times, is a good idea and fun to play. Being able to go back and conquer once deadly enemies with ease is a nice way to show progression.
Co-op. Without this I would not have played as long as I have.
Setup options. The range is adequate and can sightly affect gameplay.

Music is also great but does not fit the viking theme.  

I would put this game in the same category as 7d2d in so far as to say that it has a good core game loop with many strange and badly informed game design choices that dont get fixed while the developers add small amounts of content instead. 

For now its not an ideal game, but its getting there and much like 7d2d the hope is that it will someday become a great and finished game. Obviously theres more chance of that happening with a new title like Valheim and less chance for its counterpart. Open world crafting can be really fun if given the attention from developer and player alike. 

Building is the best part of Valheim, and could be better with some tweaks. What the modding community has wrought hopefully will also lend its quality of life improvements to the ideas the developers implement in the future.",1674889693,1703393217,False,5,0,0.527747213840484619,0,True,False,True

Great game to play coop
Graphics are great
Bosses are challenging, and has good side quests

Cons
Very linear
Crafting Recipes are very expensive, especially in later game
Limited Trader resources/options

You want to be able to just run around and forage stuff without ever needing to piss, inexplicably, so you also don't need to worry about building a bathroom. Imagine Minecraft, but it had marginally reasonable demands of physics and a subjectively cooler base game surrounding it. No shade, but damn dude, I would much rather be running around and dunking on asshole monsters in this weird viking halfway-house world than hitting green dicks that explode.

Anyways, play the game, it absolutely rocks, I'm 40+ hours in an barely just learned how to tootle around on a fucking raft, and also just started getting into log cabin building. Also, I went to the library and got a baller book called ""The Family Cabin"" (not the horror thriller, just a big ol' coffee table book of cabins) that gave me some awesome building ideas, that's something I've never done, so that's pretty cool, gotten this involved in a game's building mechanics that I started in on real world examples, but then again one of my life goals is to live in a camper a billion miles from any other breathing human except for the times I have to go into town to get supplies then I go to the pub all bearded and grunt and nod when the waitress asks me if I'd like something to drink, honey, and I ask for a shot and a beer, and keep 'em coming then after I'm tapped, I go back to the trunk and go back into the wild places and live out my life.

But yeah, worth the bucks, definitely a must play unless you're a nerd then enjoy living in a completely rational world with no wonder or joy there Neil De Grasse Tyson.",1703358051,1703358051,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

You can parry, dodge, sneak attack, etc. Most of the game is very realistic, like building. You have to build pillars to support your roof if it is high enough, you have to make a fire and ventilate the smoke, you get debuffs if you are cold, wet, etc, and you get buffs for being rested and stuff like that. If you have a home, it will protect you from the rain and other outside things, but you must protect it. Depending on the bosses you have killed, different things will raid to your home. The bosses themselves are great, they are very different for one another so you need different stuff and strategies. The progression is good and bad imo. Going from the Swamp to the Mountains was a pain, trying to not freeze while getting hunted by wolves/drakes and treasure hunting for silver. Going from the meadows to black forest was great though. This game will take time to progress through, so don't expect getting through it in a week or two. Also, if you can, BRING FRIENDS! It is much more fun and chaotic. Overall, Valheim is a great game! Had some very great times in it, and looking forward to more! I would definitely recommend Valheim to people seeking a great survival game. I cannot remember if it costs anything, but if it does, IT IS WORTH IT! Hope my review gets more players to play this awesome game!",1703356302,1703356302,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

It is possible (I've cleared 2 maps starting each with new characters because of patches), but not much fun after awhile and too frustrating.  There is a HUGE difficulty increase when you get to swamp.  I find Bonemass on this new map since new patch I'm playing and all mobs from swamp are spawned and most are 2 stars.  Tired of having to use arrows and can't survive melee at all even with maxed out iron gear.  You have to kill Bonemass and once you clear Mountain and get silver gear, then can you have decent melee in the swamp.  Swamp should be the last boss, place sucks.

It's an absolute blast but in the calmest way possible.  You slowly pick up rocks and sticks, punching trees or picking up branches, make a safe spot... and then the game says nothing else to you.  Occasionally there's a raven that comes down and gives you tutorial hints and that's about it.  There *is* an overarching goal to eliminate a variety of 'Forsaken' (from Odin) creatures spread out through the world, but there's no real time or method constraint for eliminating them other than how you'll get there and if you can beat it with your gear  It has a calming atmosphere that's brimming with points of interest, familiar environments of the northern hemisphere, and a healthy dose of danger coupled with a real sense of surviving and the urge to explore.  You'll gradually breeze into the bronze age and take to the seas, process scrap iron, and meet monsters and men who act more like they're defending their home than trying to erase you from existence.

The game has several things really going for it even in early access;

-  The boat and ocean physics have no reason to slap this hard for an early access game.  I've never seen anything better.
-  Combat is straightforward, gear upgrading as well.  If you're not smart about what you're doing or when to run from a fight, you're gonna die.  Watch your stamina!
-  A robust food system that, again, has no reason to be as thought out as it is for being early access.  
-  It feels so open, pristine, thoughtful, and dangerous.  It's really got the *feeling* of being placed in a magical new land to explore almost as good as BotW did.  
-  The world is big, and each world unique, but they give you lots of means to get around including travel gates and ships you can build.  The first power you get will be a stamina boost to running/jumping as well, which is great for sprinting to a copper deposit and back during the day to avoid night creatures.
-  You can accurately describe it as ""Breath of the Minecraft-Souls"" and genuinely mean it in the best of ways for those games.

There *are* some points though that do make it through as a bit rough:

-  The research tree is 100% discovered by either picking up or using items for the first time, meaning that if you forget to harvest a tree type or don't make everything for your first base camp you're going to miss out on it with little warning.  Quite realistic, really, but in the gameplay sense there's little guidance to focus on this.  It should be in the back of your mind to use new tools and build new things as able.  

-  The cost of some items makes it incredibly disproportionate to your time/efforts when dying; if you take a ship somewhere and die you're not only out on your gear, but you also need to make a new ship to go to that old one and retrieve your body.  The game gives you unlimited stamina for a minute when you grab your body, which is nice to GTFO once you grab your stuff, but bronze and other materials can only be gathered with certain tools and items.  If you don't have spares back home, you may be starting from almost-scratch.

-  It has a wonky mouse button setup that's a bit weird to get used to, using the press of the middle scroll wheel to block and in construction an accidental right click will destroy what you were looking at (but refund the materials).  

Overall, however, this game strikes me as something special.  It's a cozy game that treats the pain of the world with reverence, but provides you the means to shelter from it and enact all sorts of building and travel fantasies of a medieval magical viking fantasy.  It'll hug you farming honey and berries for mead and that will help you with potions/food making the struggles of the world easier to handle... and it'll ramp it up as you go along.  I find myself almost in love with where this game seems to be heading and heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge and an adventure wrapped together in an exploration game.",1703304876,1703305602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A very cheap game, but a very rich experience.  Valheim is an amazing survival/building game with incredible music and atmosphere.  The game is soooo clearly made with love and passion by real gamers, its a breath of fresh air compared to the industry standards now a days.  No additional costs - but the devs just keep adding content to this amazing game.  New zones and endgame content being added in feels like straight charity to the Valheim community that got a great game on launch, and continue to get a better and better experience every update.  A HUGE POSITIVE of this game is also that it supports robust modding...and the mods for it are fantastic.  I recommend you use the R2Modman program to manage your mods.  There's almost nothing the mods can't fix, or enhance or tweak to your liking.  Especially for those who have already played through the base game once - try the mods!  It will add so much to your experience. (diablo style random loot and effects, new spells and entire new classes, mass farming and building improvements, little cosmetic changes, more bag space or more building pieces and so much more - it truly shows that people love this game and have put in so much work and creativity into the mods of the game they love).

However in recent months the company running it has lost my respect and seems to have lost its way. Game is decent value but not going to have an in depth future as things seem to me, unless the Developers pull their finger out and actually develop at a decent pace again - or you elect to play modded.

Valheim was a lucky discovery for me. Somehow they Team has created a game that ticks all my personal boxes! 
It has a lore based plot, but not one you have to stay slaved to if you just wish to explore and learn. You are not bound by an artificial time constraint. Play at whatever speed you feel comfortable with.

It scales the more checkpoints you do elect to pass (in the form of section Bosses defeated) the harder the games in built challenges scale. But only when you want them to.

Its visually a feast, while the resolution of the graphics is low for a modern game the combination of advanced effects make it visually stunning. I particularly enjoy the detailed physics shown in sailing the oceans and waters of the Worlds. My only grumble here is that they yet to have introduced any ability to dive under water, but I hope that will come in time.

Overall its hard to fault as the 6 MILLION (at time of review) or so downloads kinda indicated with no help from me!

As an early access game yes it does have a few things like the diving in water etc that I feel do detract from the otherwise amazingly immersive experiance. I hope in time they can at least double the resolution of the game to get the best of detail when zoomed tightly in. The main downcheck is after you have gotten the gist of how it plays its a little repetative, though this may be be design to encourage you to attempt the next Boss and thus unlock the next Tech Teir. I would like to see more rare objects and items to be discoverable by those that love the infinite explorabilty the games engine allows for.

But these are very minor niggles. For the very modest fee (at time of review) you'd be mad not to give Valheim a try. 

I am excited and looking forward to the next rounds of expansion and updates almost as much as just going out and raiding for more materials! Over all a very satisfying blend of challenge simple mechanics and excellent visuals. A must buy.",1617621510,1703293262,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First and foremost, the level of challenge in Valheim is nothing short of exhilarating. From fending off ferocious creatures to conquering daunting bosses, every step in this expansive world feels like a triumph. The game strikes a perfect balance between difficulty and enjoyment, making each victory all the more satisfying.

The Viking thematic is executed flawlessly, transporting players to a mythical realm where they can truly embrace their inner warrior. The attention to detail in the world design, character customization, and weapon crafting is commendable. Valheim has succeeded in creating a universe that feels both historically grounded and fantastically immersive.

Speaking of immersion, Valheim excels in pulling players into its rich tapestry of exploration and adventure. The dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and ever-changing landscapes contribute to an experience that feels alive and constantly evolving. Whether sailing treacherous seas or exploring dense forests, I found myself completely engrossed in the world of Valheim.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this game is its therapeutic quality. During challenging times, Valheim served as my digital sanctuary—a place where I could escape, unwind, and find solace. The calming ambiance, coupled with the joy of conquering in-game challenges, provided a much-needed reprieve, and I am genuinely grateful for the emotional refuge Valheim offered me.

The multiplayer aspect of Valheim is where the game truly shines. Sharing the Viking experience with friends has been an absolute blast. Building fortresses together, embarking on epic journeys, and facing off against formidable foes as a team created unforgettable moments that will be cherished for a long time.

In conclusion, I can't help but express my genuine admiration for Valheim. It has become more than just a game; it's a source of joy, camaraderie, and relaxation. I eagerly anticipate the prospect of more content in the future, as the developers have crafted a masterpiece that deserves to be expanded upon. Valheim has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on my gaming journey, and I can't recommend it enough to fellow adventurers seeking a truly exceptional experience.

NO, the most crucial part of the game after you kill the first boss, that is mining for copper and tin, cannot be done with the help of portals because they do not allow said materials to go through portals.

Picture The Sims, but with the added thrill of personally controlling your character's movements. Yes, it's true – you have the power to construct not just a house but even a castle in Valheim. The game offers a unique freedom in building that fosters incredible creativity. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Crafting is another exciting aspect, not to mention the added challenge of survival. Valheim stands in a league of its own, encompassing elements of survival, roleplaying, building, crafting, and combat.

And then the Mistlands update was released, and you guys dropped the ball, hard ! It is simply Not Fun !

In every biome the biggest danger is a creature, Troll, Oozer, Serpent, Golem, Berserker.. in the Mistlands you are fighting your stamina bar 90 % of the time. Stamina management is by far the most annoying thing about Valheim but in almost every biome, it's tolerable... In the Mistlands, it is Not ! 

This is due to the terrain being so hard to traverse. It is almost never flat. The Mistlands will have you jump constantly to climb the rocky terrain. And in turn, this makes one of Valheim most glaring issues ten times worse : Combat.

With the vast majority of weapons, you Cannot hit an enemy that is below or above you. In the Mistlands, this happens constantly. Add to that the behaviour of the ai, which sometimes makes it run around in circles instead of trying to fight you, and you end up with an overall frustrating experience.

This is not my only complaint. In no particular order, here are some of the problems with the Mistlands :

- the mist, remove it, it's a bad mechanic that ruins an otherwise beautiful biome. I get it you want mist in the mistlands, but take it from someone who has put over 1k hour in the game. I dread having to go in the mistlands because I know I'm gonna be struggling to just walk through the biome, simply because : I Cannot See ! The lantern you gave us is a joke, it barely clears the mist 5 meters around your character and doesn't even do it consistently.
- why are there 2 types of terrain, one of which cannot be cultivated (but can still be flattened with the hoe) 
- why are there so many 1 star seekers (not one other enemy in the game has such a large proportion of 1 stars)
- why do seekers resist all types of physical damage
- [strike]the boss sometimes spawns outside of its lair (saying ""sometimes"" is an understatement)[/strike] (fixed)
- the carapace armour looks awful, the bronze armour looks better than it
- no tower shield in the carapace tier 
- the roots are supposed to be roots of freakin Yggdrasil, why are they running after you harvest 10 cups of sap
- gjalls hit way too hard and absolutely destroy your buildings, forcing you to run outside every time they show up because you don't want to spend 15 minutes fixing your house
- the Eitr foods don't give enough hp and stamina
- too many giant skeletons spawn without a head
- not enough decorations

Now for things that need to change before the game goes 1.0 (I will keep adding things to this list as I keep playing because I know this game has insane potential)

- trophies and other useless loot still drop too often (which wouldn't be a problem if all of them could be used in a recipe)
- tons of basic building pieces are still missing at every tier
- the tar pits force you to absolutely destroy the landscape to harvest tar
- food shouldn't decay in half the time indicated on the tooltip
- the harpoon is useless, collecting serpent scales only works by jumping in the water at the same time you finish off the serpent

At least, that's what I would have said a couple of years ago.  This game's developers move at a glacier's pace; they make Mojang look fast by comparison.

Grinding through the stone age takes a bit of time, trying to get through the bronze age though is like watching paint dry, I don't mind running back to the black forest to get materials but upkeeping coal for smelting is a hassle because it depletes very quickly and the payoff for getting copper is not much. The food system is cool at first but overall redundant and tedious once you realize you'll be dealing with it for the rest of the game, your base health is 25, you'd figure that defeating a boss would raise your hp but it doesn't.

Secondly is dock building, trying to build a dock that reaches out into the water is a ridiculous time consuming process that takes for ever to accomplish because you can't build while swimming so you have to wait for a storm to take the tide back multiple times, run out go build, wait for it to lower, repeat, then your dock requires daily maintenance because the wood takes water damage. Why the need for a dock? because in the case your ship is to close to shore during a storm it will get slammed and beaten to where I have had to build 3 ships again because of this.

lastly would be the community, It's not what I would call toxic but there's this weird overly protective passive aggressive attitude towards anyone suggesting helpful changes, and it becomes a real turn off. 
Example: Gee dock building is really difficult I think they should implement a system to where it would be easier to accomplish.
Responses usually go something like this: Ever tried building a dock irl because that's pretty hard.
Example 2: Hey I think that when some defeats the first boss they should get a health and stamina increase, that way we aren't relying on food forever and food instead gives us passive buffs.
Response: Ever tried surviving without food irl because that's pretty hard.

I've never fought an undead skeleton irl but I'd imagine that would be pretty hard, I've never fought a troll irl but I'd imagine that would be pretty hard.

There are people suggesting really helpful, creative, and detailed ideas that could definitely help the game, then there are those so reluctant to change and I don't see the validity as to why that is when presented.

Overall the game is only fun at first but after awhile you feel like progression becomes more punishing than it does become rewarding and at certain points feels like it hits stagnation for long periods. I would probably recommend this game when/if it actually becomes more accessible for others. Other than that I would tell inquiring buyers you're not missing out on much.",1703136153,1703136153,False,36,2,0.632965743541717529,0,True,False,True

My friend and I were sitting on discord, trying to decide on a game to play together. As fans of FPS and Tactical Shooting games, we were looking at Six Days in Fallujah, and were very tempted to play that. Until, we found this game. We are not normally huge Survival Game fans, we're the kind of people to pick up a survival game and throw it to the side a couple days later because the progression was too slow. 

Luckily, we bit the bullet and decided to pick up Valheim. We are now 22 hours in, sailing the seas and creating one of the coolest villages ever. This games building mechanics are absolutely incredible. As someone who loves building in Minecraft, this game has an incredible amount of depth and possibilities when it comes to building structures. 

The combat, while slightly clunky, feels like a dumbed down version of Dark Souls combat, and it's a ton of fun.

I don't think this game would run well if the textures weren't potato just because the environment alone is so incredibly well done and would use up all your resources.  Pacing solo can get a bit tough and grindy, especially as some updates encourage a world restart.  It gets harder and harder solo - at some point I'm afraid it just won't be realistic.  You can still retrieve your stuff from previous worlds (your char is persistent) but building up your bases then finding and getting through the bosses again is time consuming.  This is ok though, the long-haul pacing is much appreciated.

Addition 12/2023 -  Absolutely love that they added difficulty options for servers.  My daughter has always wanted to play this but it was too hard for her.

The atmosphere and graphics are gorgeous and the building is mostly great.

As of now the worlds feel rather barren and the game is very frustrating in singleplayer,

Valheim plays best together with a friend, though currently the server infrastructure is lacking.

There are a couple of issues and a few things is heavily dislike, such as the leveldrain on death and the overpowered Corpse Run effect.
The ability to use one character on several worlds and cheating equipment without any consequences is also a point that might need some addressing at some point.

Valheim is a charming RPG with a lot to offer.

I have some hours in the game (although a lot was spent afk) and do enjoy it, but ONLY with extensive use of mods. I consider the game unplayable without mods and I can't recommend a game purely for the mods other people create for it. Even less so when the developers seem to consider their vision for the game the only acceptable one, dislike mod(der)s and break mods repeatedly for very minor bugfixes.

* Content development has come to a virtual halt after the initial commercial success. A very common phenomenon in the indie dev world, unfortunately.
* Walking Simulator: There's what I would call a medium amount of content stretched veeeery wide by forcing the player to walk around A LOT. Getting the necessary equipment of a tier needs a lot of resources and even if you change the config to get maximum resource yields, you will still make a lot of trips, because of weight and inventory and stack limits. Also, there are always resources you can only get in one biome, but need throughout the game, making you run between biomes, which takes several minutes each time. Pure busy-work, annoying, boring and honestly, insulting.
* Extremely railroaded: The world claims to be open, but actually, there's only one way to be played, the way the dev intended. It is basically impossible to do anything in a biome without ""completing"" the previous biome before.
* Because of the long travel times, you are more or less forced to create dozens of outposts along your travels, which quickly becomes very tedious and boring.
* Breaks mods that keep the game alive constantly with minor fixes that are probably there to simulate bigger development proceedings.
* Community management acts toxic, deleting helpful posts on how to revert game versions. (https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-downgrade-steam-games/)

Gameplay is not enjoyable without the use of mods and the developer seems hell-bent to both keep it that way and annoy modders as much as possible.

Annoying physics, not fun to play and very grindy. If you as much as touch a log laying on the ground, chances are you are gonna launch it up a slope, it will slowly roll back and kill you. Movement feels clunky, hitting an enemy on a slope is down to luck, enemies move erratically, making it impossible to anticipate things. I wouldn't mind and play this game as a crafting game, if that was possible. But while the developer made world options available, even on the easiest death setting, you still lose your inventory and some skills, Not offering a lossless death option, when you could have done so without additional effort, is maximum asshole behaviour.",1702441427,1703013037,False,3,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True
