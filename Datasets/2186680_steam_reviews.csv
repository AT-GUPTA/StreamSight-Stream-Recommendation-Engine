1. The main part of the game is played with you and your retinue. In this mode you'll explore planets, interact with NPC's and advance the story. You'll explore tons of planets and delve into hidden complexes, cities, void ships. etc. There are so many skills for your characters it's sometimes overwhelming but I like that is has that much depth. Each of your companions has a unique story and it was great to do their side quests and get to know them better. All your choices affect how they react to you and how the game plays out, which is so great. There are tons of weapons, armors, and items, enough that you can really make any build you want work (I highly recommend making a vanguard, giving him/her a melee weapon and then let them cut down heretics, xenos, and demon's to your hearts content). The other nice thing in this mode is that there is tons of lore scattered everywhere that you can use your skills to interact with and really get a good 40k flavor. 

2. The second part of the game is space combat. This is pretty fun (one of my favorite parts) and is very similar to 40k fleet game that came out a few years back. The only thing I wanted more here, was to be able to get a bigger ship. I was still able to take on and defeat everyone I came up against. Some of the space fights can be pretty challenging (especially those massive chaos ships) but figuring out my strat to take them down was really enjoyable. One complaint I have is that the extra sword class frigate you can unlock (through planet development) is a complete idiot. I really wanted to control it myself, by the end all it really did was soak up some dps for me and distract the enemy (which I suppose was still helpful). In your ship you'll fly around the sector and scan planets, find wonders and threats. I loved the little messages you'd get as you explore dangerous warp paths, and I fought so many demons of the warp I'm pretty sure 1000's of my crew got killed in the process. Still, the spaceship aspect is pretty fun. 

3. Third is colony development. This is a lot of fun and really adds the Rouge Trader flavor/galactic ruler feel to the game. You're decisions matter and this aspect can really help you out in raising your profit factor, unlocking new faction items and give some fun story elements to the game. I spent a lot of time going from planet to planet putting down insurrections, solving diplomatic problems and destroying raiding aliens. Also, you'll need to decide which factions you want to get in good with because you can't max them all (or at least it would take a ton of grinding to do it). A lot of my favorite story elements happened in this area, and it's something not to neglect. 

4. Final aspect is the ""choose your own adventure"" stories. Sometimes you'll get these little cut-sceen stories that all have really good art to them. By using you're skills you'll make skill checks dependent on the choices you make.  One of the absolute coolest moments for me was during one of these as you lead the assault on a forge world as the general. I felt like I was writing my own story. 

Overall I loved this game (over 100+ hours played on it). This is an excellent game and one of the best 40k games I've ever played. It makes me want to play the pen and paper role playing game for this. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, it's great!!",1708301621,1708921469,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But, by the mid and endgame, it get's really boring and frustrating. There are problems that I have with the game lorewise and how some of the characters just don't make sense but that's easy to look past when you're having fun. There are other problems in game that don't match the setting of the universe that are a little bit more glaring if you actual play the tabletop and read the books but, that's not something to discuss here. 

I will say I enjoyed the overall aesthetic, and the music. The voice acting was better than it was in WotR, and the art direction was solid. However, playing the game itself post act 3 just isn't fun. I love crpgs, games like Icewind Dale and Baldurs Gate 2 are some of my favorite games of all time, and I thought that leaving the tedium of the Pathfinder system behind would fix a lot of the gameplay issues. I was wrong, it get's to the point where the game feels sluggish, tedious and boring, and that isn't help by all the obvious cut content and bugs. If you're going to play this game, Toybox is a MUST. You can either install it through steam or the UMM, I would not even bother trying to play this game without Toybox.

[spoiler] I don't want to discuss the plot because I don't want to spoil anything, I will say I liked a lot of the characters though. The navigator, SoB, and the Eldar/Dark Eldar companions are cool. I am not a space fury fan so I didn't really care for the SM all that much. I don't know if I just wasn't paying attention or not but, I couldn't tell if he had passed the Primaris Rubicon or not, and if he hasn't I think that's a little strange. By now there aren't many Oldmarines left in the setting as they've been outmoded by the far superior Primaris. [/spoiler]

The main downside that might turn some people away: 

Leveling can be overwhelming when you start out due to the huge number of complicated feats/abilities and unfamiliar mechanics – and you level up after what feels like every other combat encounter. My recommendation is to just find some build for your characters online, and more-or-less follow that until you get familiar enough with it to start making your own choices.

As a huge Warhammer 40 k fan ( thanks to the great original Dawn of war and all its expansions ) , seeing a 40k Roleplaying game getting released was almost a no brainer. So now after my first playtrough of the game , with an effective playtime of 130-150 hours ( on difficulty daring the games acctual ""true"" normal as only on this diffuclty neither side gets ""cheats"" like increased hp etc and so on, difficultys are fairly good explained when choosing one in the menü ) i am writhing my review for this game . I almost never felt bored troughout my playtrough . This game has evrything one can desire , but i try to write the main positives and negatives out 

Pro : 
- A very deep interesting story with dozen of substorys , many of wich are connected to another. A true delight for all 40k lore fans wich will be happy here. The Story will give you the right feels and you really care about its characters and developments. the Universe is pictured perfectly , and the Artstyle is spot on. Its like Reading a very good book , you will be pinned to evry word , that you wont even notice the huge amount of time you invested in.
- Great Chracter Creation , lets you really feel into ""your"" Character.
- Meaningful Decisions and dialogues with acctual impact. Something a lot of RPG dont seem to get right. You will have to think about your decsions , there is rarely a defenitive ""right"" answer. And belive me most of your choices will matter ! 
- deep and complex combat and leveling system , once you learned it you learn to love it. a tons of different builds is possible thanks to the huge amounts of weapons , armor , items, skills. Altrough some things can be consideret quite more powerfull then others, it dosent make an other build bad. though this is a generall problem across all type of RPGs. 
- Interesting Enemys  and ecounters. A lot of Combat even with the same enemy types can feel quite different due to layout and enivroment. You will be often forced to reconsider your usually strategys to adapt to a different scenario. Makes you still think about what you do even if you feel fairly powerfull. Boss type encounters are even better as you often need to truely understand the enemy and its surroundings to win 
- A nice to have is space combat ! this game includes space combat encounters wich play out differently and are a welcome change. The Ship has even its own seperate leveling and item system
- Meaningful exploration , going out of you way to explore instead of going straith to locations of quests rewards you greatly. Besides Items and Resources, There is no ""meaningless"" areas in the game. At minimum you will get enviromental Storytelling at best your exploration will entail in whole quests. Exploration feels like it belongs into the game as a natural part of it.
- Great Replayability , thanks to the tons of ways the plot can entail , making simply different decisions will drasticly change the game. I for my part for example didnt recruit several of the games Companions as it would not fit my character. Next playtrough i could change that and experience their full storys , and quests. An other example would also be simply making different builds. An other thing could be , though i sadly couldnt try that out , playing the thing in CO OP mode ( cool that they even feature something like that )

Con:
- Bugs and other issiues of technical nature, sadly in todays gaming this seems to be pretty standart. Altrough my playtough was not affected , there seems to exists even issiues that hinder further progress wich would be a real pain. Most issues  i encountered were of graphical nature. Though it is safe to assume that the Devs are at work fixing the issiues. the game has even a build in bugreport tool. 
- At times confusing story , a huge universe like that of 40 k , with the tons of subplots the game has to offer, it can sometimes be hard to look trough, though all questions i had were answered sooner or later.
- some encounters have weired insane difficulty spikes , i am sure sooner or later certain encounters might get nerfed , but i safely can say that those will be rebalanced in the future
- a bit more voiceovers would have been nice , well at least the main storyline of the game should have been fullly voiced , right now it almost seem random wich dialogues have been voiced and wich not
- Space combat can recive some love , add a few more interesting encounters , and maybe a few bosses.
- The last third of the game could recive some love , while it is still great , it does not reach the awsomness of the first 2/3

Verdict : i should give it because of the issiues a 8/10 , but i will still give it a 10/10 simply because it an awsome game created with much love for the Warhammer 40K universe. Its a game i deeply enjoyed troughout and on evry level. Its rare these days to get such enjoyable experience from start to finish , and thus it is a game that truely deserves a 10/10 easpacially in todays gaming. the issiues plagueing the game are minor in comparasion to its great sides. 

So my recomendation to evryone who enjoys good roleplaying games ; this is a must have  , and though its my first CRPG so i cant say anything about the competition, as a game this is for me a huge succes.
These were some of the best 150 hours of gaming time i have invested in a long time and DLC is coming up for this game...

As much as I love the fantasy RPG titan, I can not oversee the release of Rogue Trader. A CRPG based in Warhammer 40k universe is something I was waiting for since I became a fan of CRPGs back in early 2000s.

Owlcat may not be as well known as Larian but is arguably one of the most prominent CRPG studios nowadays, given that inXile and Obsidian are now under Microsoft and seem to focus on more mainstream projects (God, I hope I am wrong).
In short, if you are a fan of 40k and of CRPGs, Rogue Trader is definitely a yes even despite some of its shortcomings.
Rogue Trader somehow reminds me of the original Fallout games, perhaps turn-based combat with guns plays major role, but also thorough attention to details, such as combat animations, especially different effects and death animations that vary depending on weapons used. Bolter fire explodes the unfortunate mutants from within, Plasma engulfs vile xenos in blazing blue explosions, and holy flamer burns the despicable heretics to a crisp.

Selecting equipment is also a treat. Equipping your characters is akin to making tabletop models, seeing every piece of wargear on the character.

These are not RPG mechanics per se, yet they add flavour so important to 40k.

Speaking of RPG mechanics, Rogue Trader also does not falter. After two playthroughs of Baldur’s Gate 3, I find Rogue Trader’s character development more complicated and enabling more character builds. Your soldier can be as easily a heavy support gunner, as a stern assault unit equally efficient in ranged and close combat. In contrast to Baldur’s Gate 3, Rogue trader has volumes of different weapons, so you won’t run out of combinations and will never be stuck to tried and tested guns you will stick to through the major part of the game. Oh, and respect is free and always available.

I also want to praise Owlcat’s faithful recreation of 40k universe, with all its deep lore, subtle aspects of Imperium, Inquisition, Adeptus Mechanicus and xenos factions. For those who are not very familiar with 40k lore the game offers in-dialogue tips that give a brief understanding of what’s what and who is who.

Aside from the game’s bread and butter questing and combat, there are some side activities you will have to entertain – space battles (simple but fun diversion from on foot combat) and colonies development, which enables your economic growth and provides resources to purchase new items. Although trade is a bit complicated compared to other games, it is pretty simple to understand.

There are some minor bugs I encountered in my playthrough, but none game breaking, nor even immersion breaking, hence so far I would rate them as non-existent.

One downfall is some poor design choices. You might have heard some negative reaction to the games third chapter, and it is mostly deserved. Without going into spoiler territory, a common RPG trope of removing all equipment and forcing you to use rusted garbage is not a thrilling concept. Although it makes you really hate the location, where the chapter takes place, and lore-wise you would have any other sentiment should you find yourself there.

[b]TL;DR[/b]

In my opinion this game is a no brainer for any fan of CRPGs and 40k. Rogue Trader definitively lacks level of polish that Baldur’s Gate 3 had, and financial limitations (cutscene animations, limited voiceovers) are apparent. Yet, these shortcomings did not impact my playthrough as I feared going into this game after BG3. This is the quality CRPG in 40k setting we waited for for so long, and in that aspect Owlcat delivered.",1708792569,1708792569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Longer Review
SO MUCH HEART and Big ambition but also.. SO Many BUGS and UI/UX is REAL bad. 
I love 40k period the end. So even with warts and all I came to love this game. 
Sadly I can't rate this game high. For people that are not super fans of Warhammer 40k this would be a buggy and no frills slog. Its broken, not well paced, unpolished, the traversal in your ship is God awful (Nurgle style), and just janky. The UI is real bad, the art is really average, and I COULD go on on and on. BUT if you are a 40k fan the story is awesome and this games aspires to be truly Epic and I applaud the studio for that. 
They got my money and I love that I helped out. I hope the next execution for Rogue Trader 2 is less buggy, new UI experience, and streamlined.

The prologue and the first two acts have tons of content, branching decisions, and is generally speaking one of the better RPG experiences I have had. The combat is decent, once you understand what affects turnorder and how to manipulate it combat becomes highly enjoyable, and the game feels decently challenging when playing on ""daring"" difficulty, which is basically the difficulty where the AI gets neither bonuses or penalties of any kind, and the same to your own party. 

BUT
When act 3 comes around, you get far less agency, there are less subplots, less dialogue options, and heads up, FAR less opportunities to gain the morality/standing points (dogmatic/iconoclast/heretic), if you want to get to rank 3 or higher in these, you need to deliberately avoid the other options in the earlier acts, as the only options available after that require you to be rank 3 or higher. That being said, they change very little, just a minor gripe.

The space combat is introduced in the worst way possible, with you having few tools, on the backfoot, and having no prior experience with the combat system they suddenly throw at you. It becomes very enjoyable once you get more ship parts and abilities, but by that time there are sadly few of these combats left. 

Act 4 is disappointingly short compared to the earlier ones, and act 5 is even shorter. The quality of the content present is fine, but it overall just feels like it ends way too abruptly. If you ignore the side missions and planets in act 5 (of which there aren't a whole lot), it is legitimately just 7 short combat encounters, where only one of them has any substantial story and dialogue attached. 

All of this being said, I would still recommend the game if only for its incredibly good first two acts. There is enough content in those two acts to put a lot of other full games to shame, but i sincerely hope they flesh out the later acts with more content, because at the moment they feel a bit lacking, where the majority of my enjoyment honestly came from seeing how my by then fully-built team crushed encounters in 1 turn.",1708705345,1708705345,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Murder a squad of chaos space marines before they even make a move
- Banish a greater daemon of Tzeench
- Contain a rampaging shard of C'tan
Trurly, a love letter to the chain of command.

Good stuff:
- Setting, including companions that represent various facets of the empire prety well.
- Visuals that go with the setting and presentation in general. Pretty game with nice music and lots of style to it.

Bad stuff
- Voidship combat more like dogshit combat. A tiresome minigame forced on you (some encounters are mandatory, and not really winnable without improving your voidship) with a parallel progression system that you advance by doing even more of the tiresome minigame. Either let me skip this garbage, or overlevel with resources from the part of the game that I actually enjoy.
- Needs more options to speed up/skip animations, especially for your own party if you're doing a shitton of buffing every turn. Also the key to speed up enemy animations is the same one you use to skip your own turn, which is slightly awkward.

Good or bad? You decide:
- The RPG system is complex but also comically easy to break in half. On normal difficulties you may get to a point where the challenge isn't ""can you win this fight"" but ""how can I win it before any enemies get to move"" pretty early.
- Story is good moment to moment, but when you zoom out it's kinda just throwing shit at the wall. You deal with about 4 different storylines that coexist, but didn't need each other in any way to be there. There is a logical progression in how you, the Rogue Trader, get from one to another but they don't actually form one cohesive arc when you start thinking about it.

There were bugs, but at the time we were almost at the finish line, Owlcat released a major patch that claims to deal with many of those, also rebalancing half of the abilities and gear. If you want a """"Finished product"""", i'd suggest to wait for a major patch 2. 

Only criticisms i have are:
1) in some locations because of poor level design choices, camera were constantly blocked by level surroundings. It would be nice in some patch in the future (or maybe the next game Owlcat makes) to make all the walls between the camera and player models translucent.
2) it would be nice to have more explanation tooltips. There are some, that tell you about parts of 40K lore, but for many dialogue options there is a painfull lack of context to the point you think that you ask a certain character a random question, but it turns out you lock yourself into a fight or an end of this questline. I know it sounds vague, but we failed i think 2 or 3 quest lines because it wasn't obvious this dialogue option will end conversation.
3) this game made me think that there is some truth to the claims that BG3 did raise unfair standarts to other devs. I came to this game expecting at least majority quest lines being fully voice overed and many dialogues to have extended dialogue cut scenes. Then i remembered Tyranny, or recent Torment, or Pillars of Eternity or many other great CRPGs, and maybe it is abit extra effort at the end of the day... but it would be much more fun experience if Ulfar had one or two cinematic animated fights.",1708684827,1708684827,True,2,0,0.445435583591461182,0,True,False,False

Having not tried any of Owlcat's prior products, and, given games on 40K tend to miss the mark entirely sadly, I was actually very impressed with this game in not following suit there. From [not-so-nice-word] aristocrats, to a Space Nun with Guns, dodgy Dark Eldar shenanigans, and even techno-religious suped up Honda Civics/Mechanicum (which are shown too in the trailer and pictures), what isn't there to praise the corpse Emperor for after all?

They have spent time to understand the Lore and it isn't presented in a way that is entirely overwhelming for someone new to the 40K universe. It has depth that 40K fans/nerds like myself would love but it presents plenty of guide, help, info, explanations to help understand key terms and bits of lore for those new. I have enjoyed the game play thoroughly, especially coming off the back of Baldur's Gate, and can say it stands up pretty great actually. I've enjoyed the levelling system and plethora of skills and abilities and this game really can be quite strategic and tactical for those who are wanting more of a challenge (but is equally fun for those wanting to cruise in the story on easier difficulties). The progression of abilities and gear/weapons was great to see, there are some cool weapons you get to use as the game progresses (but be patient using a pea shooter for a bit at the start) and pretty cool skill/ability/character synergies you can do if you're looking for something a bit more tactical. Reminds me a bit of XCOM combat and Baldurs gate combat-wise for a basic/loose reference for idea.

While I would like to see more voice acting implemented into the game, as there is quite a bit of reading that remains - like this review (though very well written - unlike this review), due to the recent major patch has implemented large chunks of voice acting in the prologue early game I am hopeful more voice acting will be added in time. I have also noticed many reviews have issues of bugs and problems and I honestly can say I have not experienced a single bug [yet], though I am well aware many are experiencing bugs, especially in the late game of which I have just begun, so I can't really speak to the degree of game play interruption on that front. However, there does seem to be a commitment to ironing out bugs which is great and QoL improvements as displayed in the recent major patch, so I am hopeful what bugs there are will be smoothed out and fixed in time, which is great since the overall game is pretty good.

Overall, and TLDR; I really would recommend this game. It is immersive, pretty, engaging, good writing/story/characters, with depth and range. If you liked BG3 or XCOM and have an interest in 40K, go for it. I would like to see more voice acting implemented, which I am hopeful of in time given the recent update.

The main problem is the gameplay. I am nearing the end of act 1 (I suspect), and I am still fighting basic boring 'bandits with guns' type of soldiers, even during a 'boss' fight. The RPG skill tree is the worst I have seen in a video game, where levelling feels like a chore, because most skills feel useless (apart from the navigator's ones). The whole gameplay loop feels like slop with a warhammer theme. What holds the game together is the warhammer lore, but the world is unappealing so far, the graphics and artistic direction completely outdated. If I find the courage to continue the game, I might change my review, but for the time being, it's too boring, it looks like a budget xcom.

When the game works, it is a fantastic RPG and Warhammer story to explore. However... most of my time has been spent with my computer going through Blue-screens-of-death because of one of these things. The game was auto saving, I had saved manually, or I was idle at the main menu. I originally thought this was an issue with my pc, but I found out that my pc had been almost bricked BECAUSE of this game's issues.

For those who want to know, here are my computer's specs which should be way more than capable of running the game:
- AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Six-Core Processor
- NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU
- 32 GB RAM

I really do hope that if others buy this game, the get lucky and not deal with any of the issues I have had or that many others I read have had. I also hope that the developers put effort into making the game playable for people like me, and not abandon it later in its lifespan

Edit: (In Regards to the ""massive"" February.19/2024 Update)
Supposedly Owlcat Games has fixed a ton of the crashing and softlock issues, and I was curious enough to redownload the game and see if this was the case. No. My computer completely crashed, forcing my PC to be restarted twice. Once loading an old save, and a second time when I made a new game and got to the combat tutorial. I see that others are playing the game and enjoying it, and I want to believe it's a problem with my computer, but my computer has been working with every other game I've played, old and new.

It nails the 40k setting really well. Maybe even better than GW. I can't recommend the 40k setting to everyone. 

It's a crunchy crpg. Most of the abilities require a base understanding of algebra to parse correctly. So I can't recommend it to people who care about understanding their character's build unless you really go into the deep end with it. And then I can't recommend it enough. 

It's an Owlcat game. That means you'll run into a lot of bugs. There have been several patches so it's less of an issue now and my experience the bugs haven't been game breaking more of the funny stuff.

The difficulty is wild. I have it set one up from normal and most combats are a breeze but then you run into a combat that you have to retry 5 times.

The multiplayer kinda sucks. The save games get rather large and the host has to transfer their save to the other players. So if someone has bad internet you're looking at a 5 minute initial load time and it really discourages you from save scumming. Also the other players have far less agency than the host. But my partner doesn't care about that and is loving playing a put upon seneschel and insane tech priest.

33 hours in and I'm loving this game.  I'm pleased with my character build and the customisation visually is excellent.  I'd been playing another now very famous and awarded RPG from 2023 but stopped to play this as I found just didn't really feel connected to the party.  Here the characters are terrific and the almost cartoon nature of their personas makes them much easier to access.  I'm playing on normal and have had to rerun a couple of battles multiple times to get through so challenging enough.

It delves into 40k like no other game does. Its dark, and over the top, there are no good guys. The game is complex so there are bugs, some will probably never get cleaned, so what; they are really nothing compared to the epicness that this game delivers!

I am just completing Act IV, and wasn´t sure what to expect according to previous reviews. To my surprise its actually been a blast and a solid continuation of what was built up in previous chapters. The story wraps up tremendously well, and the final combats are Epic in true Warhammer 40K spirit! 
At that stage of the game each character literally becomes a one man army, Argenta and Abelard can clear up scores of heretics in one turn (just stack ´´momentum´´ on repeat for non stop slaughter), whilst Heinrix can stack buffs and Cassia her debuffs to the point of effortlessly obilterating bosses by themselves. Ulfar is a tank, stacked with every possible ´´perplexed´´ mechanics, he renders big enemies into tame pets. Ulfar´s story also develops in a fun way.

Yes there are still some bugs lingering, occasionally a nuisance, but nothing game breaking as far as I have experienced, and nowhere near as bad as some reviews imply, so possibly the worst bugs have been fixed by now. I played in Normal difficulty with a balanced Dogmatic-Iconoclast Officer, the storyline has flowed fine so far. I personally think the rhythm of the game picks up nicely from Act 3, which is a suitably Nightmarish hell hole, true to the 40k lore. I can understand that this game has frustrated some, its complex and doesn't always spoon feed you the solutions, the levelling up requires some thought; so honestly the key is not to rush through it, and enjoy each new world you discover to unravel the intrigue, and smash some Heretics!",1708446207,1708448221,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will say, it could still use some improvements, but there are still signs that the game was released far too early, but there is clear improvement. It's enough for me to change my review, but I am excited to see more patches to fix the rest of the problems. 
An addition now that I've seen more of the game: the plot is excellent. Pacing could use some work but the characters are extremely good. In particular I would like to highlight a romance I will not spoiler but which is absolutely groundbreaking for this type of game. Highly recommend trying it out at least once for the experience but be aware that it is exactly what it looks like. You will recognize it when you see it.
Beneath the original review for context.

This hurts me a bit to write, because I was really hyped for this game. Unfortunately, right now it seems a tad disappointing. I have thankfully not encountered any of the game breaking bugs I have seen described in other reviews but there's  still questionable things happening that I am not sure are intentional, oversights, or actual bugs. For example, if you are in melee and therefore cannot use a ranged weapon, the hologram prediction will not allow you to predict damage for ranged even if you move the hologram out of meelee range. Bug? Oversight? Who knows, I don't. It's also badly optimized, my cooler should not run louder here then in bg3. 
Story wise what little I've seen for now is fine, I even really like the characters, but immersion is a problem. The only way to get lore information seems to be running around asking dumb questions that your character should already know the answers to. The claim that ""your every decision matters, even in character creation"" seems a bit high considering there's not even a reaction when someone holds me a monologue about what voidborn are when I am playing one. Seems like an obvious little consequence to include but either they didn't or the trigger is bugged. There was one line right at the beginning about the flaw I chose, which was great! Loved that moment, wish it wasn't the only one. 
Overall it's not terrible certainly but in its current state its not living up to my expectations. That is not to say that I think it will stay this way or that I am now mad and will never play it again, but I would personally advise against buying it currently and instead wait for at least the next patch. I do hope they will fix the more obvious bits because I would really like to love this game as much as I love wotr, but for that it will still need some boosts. I will happily change my review then.

I'll edit my review again once I play the game through a second time, but for now what time I can spare from actual important things is spent playing either games with obscene amounts of mods or playing cooperative games with my friends. I do hope that this game will have obscene amounts of mods some day, but I digress...

At its heart, Rogue Trader is a great game with a lot of potential. Apart from some bizarre difficulty spikes in the early game, I had a great time and I was really excited to see what the late-game has in store.

Unfortunately, what it has in store is frequent appearance of enemies that can one-shot your characters and kill even the tanks in 2-3 hits, enemies that stun lock characters, take extra turns, can one shot 2-3 of your characters per turn, and tank the entire party's focused fire unless you've stumbled upon one of the cheese builds necessary to even stand a chance in the late game.

At one point I installed a cheat engine to fix a glitch, and during Act 4 I've found myself relying more and more on the 'revive characters' cheat to the point where I was reviving characters 4-5 times before they even got a turn. My builds aren't 100% optimized, but this is hardly my first turn-based tactics rpg. There's no enjoyment in combat (the bulk of the game) for me anymore as I find I either have to look up a build guide and respec all my characters or just keep getting slaughtered at every turn.

This lasts through most of the climactic Act 4, though the short final act (Act 5) feels less oppressive. Once I got past Act 4 and started fighting [REDACTED], combat became engaging once more, up until the second-to-last fight which isn't very challenging at all. The ending was intriguing enough that I can definitely see myself replaying the game in the future to get a different ending, and the narrative throughout is very strong. However, I will most likely wait for balance patches or maybe an expansion before I bother with it.

I hope the modding scene for this game kicks off as it has a ton of potential and I love the colony management and space combat systems and am highly intrigued by the story, but it needs a balance overhaul, especially the second half, and I'd much rather play a community overhaul than an official one.

This... is a painful review for me to write. I adore this game. I adore it's characters, I adore it's writing, I adore the heart and soul that Owlcat have put into this game. But I can not, in good conscience, recommend this game in the state it is in.



Pros:

- Acts 1, 2, and to a lesser extent 3: The first half of this game is [b]fantastic.[/b] The writing, the characters, the pacing, the mystery and intrigue; it is all, fookin, fantastic. If Act 1, 2, and 3 were the entire game, this would be a wholehearted recommendation. I would enthusiastically recommend it over Wrath of The Righteous, Baldur's Gate 3, Wasteland 2, any CRPG I have previously played in recent times. The setting, combined with Owlcat's fantastic writing, makes for one of the most enjoyable CRPG's I have played in years. I could write an entire essay the size of this entire review dissecting the writing and characters within the first 3 chapters and I [b]still[/b] wouldn't be able to express everything I wanted, they are that well done.  However, if you have played Owlcat titles before, you know they have 5 acts, not 3.

- Performance/Stability: I run a relatively weak rig, a laptop with a laptop 1070 and i7-8750h, and I have had a reasonable experience running it in 4k FSR quality med-high settings with very few frame drops that were noticeable with a VRR display. If you have a semi-powerful rig, I would not worry about performance, and in the event you do have performance issues, it has a decent implementation of FSR. Unless you plan to run ultra with native 4k, I believe most people should get an enjoyable level of performance without having to sacrifice visual fidelity too extensively. I have not encountered a single CTD during my entire playtime.

- The characters: I touched on this a bit earlier, but it really deserves its own dedicated praise. Owlcat has, from day one, excelled at writing engaging, layered, ""realistic"" characters (excluding Greybor,) and this game is no different. Be it someone as notable as Abelard or someone as unimpactful a random couple you save, they are all written with heart and care that is unmatched by most games in today's age. I can not praise Owlcat and their ability to write amazing characters enough.

- The RT system: This is probably the facet of this game I was expecting to dislike the most, as I am not someone who really enjoys TTRPG combat/gameplay systems and mostly just toyboxed my way throught WOTR, so I was very pleasantly surprised when I discovered I very much enjoyed RT's gameplay systems. If you are familiar with the RT system this does not apply to you, but If you are not and you go in expecting ""WOTR but Warhammer,"" you are going to be disappointed. Instead, you should go into RT expecting a bastard love child of WOTR and Wasteland 2, or to a lesser extent Xcom; character building, attributes, skills, ect all function in a way more similar to WOTR, but combat plays out in a manner more similar to Wasteland 2/Xcom. It also uses a d100 system instead of a d20, although functionally it makes very difference in how you play the game and build your characters.  

- You get a Space Marine, and it's not a Smurf!

- [b]Abelard.[/b]



Now, onto the part I wish I did not have to write: The cons.

- Act 4 and 5: Act 4 and 5 are... well, simply put, broken beyond belief. Missing content (cries in Iconoclast,) broken triggers. broken dialogue (again, cries in Iconoclast,) quests that are flat out impossible to finish... it is not in an acceptable state for a paid product. I am someone who is relatively lenient when it comes to bugs within games, and these 2 accursed acts stretched my patience to a point where I am unable to motivate myself to finish even one playthrough. Don't mistake me, Owlcat has been working their asses off in an attempt to remedy the flood of issues within Act 4 and 5, but the simple fact is that releasing in this state is inexcusable. Without Toybox, I'm not even sure it would be possible for Iconoclast's to even finish the game. Let me emphasize this; of the three alignments within RT, I am not confident that one of those alignments can even finish the game over 2 months after release, and that is just my personal experience. Who is to say if Heretical and Dogmatic are not in the exact same position?  [b]That is not an acceptable state for a paid product, under any circumstances, and it is solely due to Act 4 and 5 and I can not recommend this game.[/b]

- Content drought as the game carries on: Tangentially related to the above criticism, the further you progress in the game, the sparser content becomes. Now, this is not to say that by Act 5 any and all side content is gone, but if you were to compare the amount of side content within Act 2 to the amount of side content within Act 4, the difference would be staggering.

- The Space Marine is a Space Wolf.

- You can not tell Abelard to smack people's nuts



TLDR; I love this game. I love the characters, the writing, how it utilizes the Warhammer setting, and even the RT system, and you can tell Owlcat absolutely loved this game as well, but I can not recommend it... as it stands. I mentioned earlier that Owlcat have been working their asses off, pushing out updates on a regular basis, and have been intently listening to the community feedback they have been recieving; but they are not there yet. Hopefully one day I will be able to revisit this review, and change it to a uncompromising recommendation, but until that day I am obligated to recommend against this game. 



Of course this is all intended to speak to the perspective of your average Joe; if you are especially into Warhammer, willing to put up with what is essentially a beta Act 4 and 5, or just really enjoyed WOTR/Kingmaker and have faith in Owlcat, than I would wholeheartedly recommend it. I personally do not regret my purchase in the slightest, and I genuinely believe that this has the potential to be an RPG that eclipses WOTR, Wasteland, Pillar's of Eternity, and Baldur's Gate 3 in my eyes. All I can do is hope that Owlcat allows this game to fulfill that potential.




Update as of 2/19/2024: Today, Owlcat released a very sizeable update, 1.1.28; included in the patch notes are multiple references to issues I personally encountered being fixed, including a large portion of those that compelled me to leave a negative review, along with additional side content being added to Act 4 and 5, my second largest critique outside of the numerous issues and bugs within those 2 acts. As I mentioned in my original review, Owlcat has been paying immense attention to the issues brought to light by the community, and have truly been trying to take all manners of feedback seriously. As such, due to a large portion of my original complaints being addressed, along with my faith in Owlcat, I no longer have any doubt's in my mind when it comes to recommending this game. Owlcat has shown that they are listening to their community, a large part of the issues within Act 4 and 5 have been remedied, and they have shown no sign of slowing down or unwillingness to do the work that is necessary to make this game as great as it has the potential to be.",1708307765,1708372496,True,0,0,0.525316417217254639,0,True,False,False

++++ The world and atmosphere of the Warhammer 40k is great.

++++ Has some great mechanics and a nice space battle ""minigames"". Travelling on the map and exploring feels nice and encounters are mostly interesting.

+++ Theres a lot of choices/dialog options in the game and they feel meaningful. It feels like almost every action you take has a consequence like a companion leaving/dying. You can also easily ""get rid"" of companions you dont like

++  The story is mostly interesting

+  The battle mostly feels good and fulfilling, very typical crpg experience (at least in the beginning of the game)

+ Music is ok but nothing great. Very few memorable tunes but it fits the world

+ The characters are mostly ok, but nothing memorable. The companions all have some unique talents and a style of playing, which is great.

The bad:
----  The leveling system is very bad. Getting a new level in an rpg game should be something that you always look forward to and which can completely, but not in this game. Instead, leveling up is tedious and feels like a bad chore, AND you need to do it for 6 characters ALL THE TIME. Often you get a new level after just one or two fights and new levels feel almost meaningless. This is partly because there are WAY too many mostly insignificant and boring skills you need to choose from and there are so many that you will be reading through dozens of skills for every character every time you level up.

In BG3 for example: Wow, this is a really interesting skill and i cant wait to try it in the next battle. In Rogue Trader: Theres nothing interesting to choose from, i guess ill just pick something and see what happens, no idea if it is usable at all

In general, there should be less levels and less but more meaningful and interesting skills and abilities
 
--- Loading times are very painful and there is A LOT of loading screens. It takes on my computer about 5-20s or even more to load an area and you will be moving between areas a lot. Even quicksave takes a a lot.

--- The base difficulty level is too easy, even the most difficult one is not particularly hard after you start giving extra turns to your characters that deal absurdly much dmg and oneshot any enemies after some setup. The space battles can be cheesed quite easily by using some op weapons The difficulty of battles is not balanced. Often you have to go through multiple very easy battles where you oneshot all enemies and then suddenly a super hard one, and then back to easy ones. The last boss is pretty easy too


-- Some of your characters will feel totally useless while some can kill an enemy with one 20k damage snipe from across the map multiple times a turn + do the same after you give them extra turns. Some skills, like anything related to extra turns is too wacky

-- There are a lot of bugs ranging from tiny insignificant to game breaking. 

-- Many of the usual things you will be doing are tedious partly because of the loading times. You always typically need to walk somewhere and switch between possibly multiple areas with long loading times until you get to the map and start travelling. You need to do this all the time. Even getting to the ""store"" to sell your wares and buy stuff is numbing. There are no quick buttons to take you anywhere.


In conclusion: The game has some great stuff and crpg fans will more or less enjoy it, especially if you are into Warhammer 40, But the game feels unfinished. If it had different leveling system with meningful skills, quicker loading times and more balanced combat it would be a great game.

Basically, the game is golden had it only
been the 2 chapters that were playable.

9.90€ each for the remaining chapters

So after finishing the game, i'll be still not recommending this game to other player for a lot of different reasons.
- even month after the release there are still countless bugs.
- the story in chapter 4 and 5 is mediocre at best
- the difficulty level is way too low. after mid-chapter 2 90% of the fights were finished in 1 round, some boss encounters required 2 or 3 rounds due to some mechanics making them invulnterable in one way or another. without those mechanics, 1 round on highest difficulty for hardest bosses is just waaay too easy.

________________________________________________________________
Initial review:

It's currently a buggy mess. A lot of skills just don't work or work incorrectly. I had to restart the campaign because my playthrough was bricked. While being on the second playthrough and finding out that my origin planet (death world's) talent doesn't work, i decided to just stop playing for now. I absolutely regeret buying the game. With all the previous ones i bought them only when they became available in the ""final"" version to avoid exactly such a situation of struggling with bugs. That's what I'll be doing from now on with future games from this company.

Edit1: just to be clear. I'm not saying not to buy it, just not to buy it yet, until all the bugs are fixed.
Edit2: Just logged in after the 1.0.1 update and a lot of things are still bugged. for example, dont pick death world for the origin if you decide to play. the ability still doesn't work.
Edit3: Tried it again with 1.0.78. Still absolute trash. 0 mechanics were fixed. They're still fixing the quests, which makes sense since those bugs just straight out brick your runs. Still, it's an absolute disgrace they're incapable to provide any mechanics fixes weeks after the release. Honestly, stay away, wait for like half a year, wait until it's on a huge sale 50%+. Done waste your money on that pile of g. which it definitely is right now. Just check out the bug-thread on reddit... it's longer than the whole storyline.
Edit4: It's mostly playable. Finishing the game before revising my review.

Their comrades in arms are legion: the Larian Studios and countless indie developers, the ever vigilant Obsidian Entertainment and the text-priests of the ZA/UM to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from FPS, sport games, service games  - and far far worse.


To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of well-wrtitten characters, for so much has been simplified, never to be remebered. Forget the promise of progression and non-linearity, for in the grim dark future there are only microtransactions. There is no fun amongst the stars, only an eternity of boredom and repetition, and the laughter of greedy CEOs.


But this game is good, you should buy this game!

First 2 acts are great, but during and certainly after, act 3 you'll start to see the bugs appearing.

Now, I've been lucky and not had anything major yet, but myriad small annoying bugs have suddenly shown up.
T-posing Servitors. Loot icon not showing up. Random enemies from a void battle showing over enemies in a tactical battle. Items won't go into cargo. Skills not synching to sound effects. One characters special skill just doesn't work and they can't shoot their pistol in CQC like everyone else.

Like I say, nothing major, but they point to the simple fact that past Act3 they haven't ironed everything out.
There is a big patch due anytime now and hopefully many of these bugs will be addressed and if so I'll update this review accordingly.

""This is the best CRPG I have played in years and it is by FAR the best 40k game I have ever played. Plus I have only had a few minor visual bugs and I started at launch! Thanks Owlcat, this shits amazing!"" 

This was my review after 50 hours prior to Act 3. Act 3 was a colossal heap of trash!!! Every single narrative decision is an industry trope that literally kills games. Take away player agency disallowing them to leave until the entire Act is over. Create artificial difficulty by taking away all the players resources. Turn your trusted friends into untrustworthy traitors because M Night Shamalamadingdong does it. Kill the player in conversation without a battle because you don't like their choices. Fridge allies if you don't jump through all the bad guys hoops. Only one way to succeed, absolutely no alternative routes, just reskins of the same battles or traps with maybe a few different NPCs or maybe one extra line of dialogue. Oh and the endless fkng battles with absolutely no point other than ""Hey Arenas are a fun trope huh?"" They weren't even difficult I killed the final Arena fight in 3 rounds, killed Dracon in 2 shots, hardest fight was getting jumped outside door to Opera. I could rant forever on how much the game goes off a cliff in Act 3 but I will stop here.

Whoever designed Acts 1-2 thank you from the bottom of my heart, this scratched a 40k itch that I REALLY needed. 9.5/10 on all fronts easily. Whoever designed Act 3 I hope you never work in the industry again you should NEVER be in charge of storyboards, battle sequences or set design again. Ever. I don't even care about the bugs, its a massive rpg launch, to be expected. The absolutely sadistic game design of Act 3 is just unacceptable. 2.5/10 only because I have hope the game will return to form in Act 4.

I will come back with my thought on Act 4 in a few days, if its bad I'm changing my recommendation.

Back. This was a tough one for me, Im going to leave my recommendation as positive because I love the story in Act 4 but the gameplay is just meh. The developers have decided that the only way you make an enemy interesting or more powerful is to give it more hitpoints. To the point of absurdity, this does not make the battles interesting or challenging it just makes them annoying slugfests. This is not at all helped by their ""multiple choices"" combats, meaning they create the illusion of choice but there really isnt one. Here is to hoping the end of the game is at least satisfying.

Final Thoughts: I do recommend this game, it is overall a positive experience though a lot of design choices are confusing. I would say the end of the game narrative is fine but mechanically was kinda lame. The final boss had 6500 hp and just made copies of himself... the wall of text ""recap"" at the end was also lame. Felt like a cop out, should have had at least some sort of animation or custom images etc. This is still the best Warhammer RPG experience available and I WILL play it again in the future.s",1703811725,1708252384,True,1,0,0.510273993015289307,0,True,False,False

The occasional jankiness like echoey audio on some maps, is fixed with a quick save/load. The combat is great on daring, giving enough of a challenge without being a huge grind. I would say that I have a bit of restartitis so by the time I reached chapter 3 and onward on a character I liked, the bugs seem to have been patched out. I honestly found the same thing with Wrath of the Righteous and had a great experience from day dot. The game is supposed to be challenging and true to a system, like the Owlcat Pathfinder games before it the learning curve is immense if you hadn't played PnP before, but that's a huge positive for me, I really enjoy learning a new system and how different talents interact. This is quickly becoming my favourite game in a long while, pretty much since WOTR. 

A few QOL tips: 
1. Save before spaceship battles, the game auto saves at the start of these battles and they are not linearly organised, you probably will have to come back to a few once your ship is geared up. Owlcat has a loading screen tool tip that encourages save scumming so use it to ""save"" yourself backtracking. 
2. Characters are not railroaded into a particular position. For example Cassia seems like a back line character when you first meet early but is in fact an awesome secondary tank with huge damage potential, I even switch her out with Abelard for plenty of fights. The same goes for the other characters, play around a bit and don't get stuck on their apparent roles. 
3. Don't ignore the empire building component it's how you get most of your money and resources to spend on things. 
4. Read, read, read. The abilities are complicated in how they interact.

However...

They do NOT make things clear in this game. You have to ""trial & error"" way too many functions, tools, etc before you figure out that you either did something entirely wrong, or that you took an extra couple of hours to do something that could have been achieved in a matter or minutes. For example, I could NOT, for the life of me, figure out why I couldn't get more warp energy in order to jump between systems. Another example, is the explanation of things like ""exploits."" Took me longer than it should have for me to figure out how to properly apply them to enemies. 

Missions can be INCREDIBLY difficult to figure out on your own. I understand there are hints and what not for you to figure things out; however, when there's missions that say, ""wait and see what happens,"" but nothing EVER happens, I'm then stuck. There's too many vague quests for wording, and explaining that you need to actually do this, to achieve this. I don't understand why some missions have indicators to help direct you to where need to go, and others do not. This never made sense to me. 

The issues I have primary issues with happen later on, such as when you go to Commoragh, finishing out Footfall quarantine, waiting for informants to bring you news, etc. I hope the Devs figure out these issues to make the game more user friendly, but I am not sure if this will be happening. I will revisit this game at a later day, and hopefully they will have things fleshed out.

Even though this game had early access, the game was rushed to purchase. I could have waited another six months for this game to go through another Beta test, and then be released having been properly tested by real players. I LOVE the Warhammer Universe, and this game does an amazing job with the lore, but the team needs to better understand how to build a game around the lore.

In short I can't add more than what almost everyone notes, the story and scope are mindblowingly great, but bugs aplenty spoil the fun. I really didn't expect to finally get a heavily, well written, story based game in this universe. It becomes more obvious as you progress, however, that the devs had to scale back their ambitions by a lot.

They still managed to complete the game in a presentable manner, but it is undeniable that things are missing, or incomplete. Some plot points and character developments have to be guessed more than experienced. The localisation in my case was atrocious, like google translate would have done a better job, and full of spelling mistakes.

Balancing of battles is mostly fine, I won't complain about too easy ones, as the underlying system is so complex, it seems impossible to make every fight equally challenging for everyone. But then there are at least two battles that I would call objectively unfairly stacked against the player. The whole system with the wounds and traumas unfortunately is also something that seemed to have been planned as more integral, but was abandoned half-way through development.

This is a textbook CRPG to the letter with elements of realm management and a space opera set very faithfully in W40k's Rogue Trade.
It has all the perks of a high-quality 2020s CRPG. It is very faithful to Rogue Trader RPG's mechanics and doesn't oversimplify anything. It even provides the player with all the formulas.

The most impressive thing about it is that it manages to present the ridiculous scale of everything in W40K AND STILL MAKE A WELL PUT CRPG IN IT!

Game Design: classic RPG with modern perks, space opera, realm management, tactical battles, adventures... all fit very well.

Writing: superb. It has mystery, intrigue, standard FRP/RPG game design adventure and campaign structure. The characters are very lore-friendly, distinctive, they make sense. The plot is completely sound. The dialogues are very good, The way exposition and plot develop.... all high quality.

Voice acting: phenomenal. The actors involved should get a medal.

Level Design: I've seen very little, but all of it is promising. Standard discovery, beautiful scenery, perks of interesting locations, immersiev atmosphere.... Prologue didn't have much in terms of choices - but that's alright 'cause they've got pacing to think of. All very, very promising.

Sound Design: superb. Extremely lore-friendly, too... which makes it way more impressive.

And there's a cooperative mode.

This is surprisingly good.
Practically on par with Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Baldur's Gate 3!
The production values are about 90% of BG3. And the feature list is about 80% of D:OS2.
It's just peak CRPG.
Especially if you're into W40k or would ilke to switch up from epic fantasy to something different!

If described as such, it would be okay, great even—if not for bloated, overdone writing (Owlcat did it again, eh...). I mean, many people enjoy the game for what it is, despite trying to cope with the numerous, often game-breaking bugs. I understand W40k fans especially—them being fond of complex implementations of their favoritething. I am happy for both groups.

Game's missing half of the elements that make up for a full-fledged classical RPG such as BG 1+2, Fallout: NV, Wizardry VII, River of Time, Tyranny, Gothics, Elexes, KOTORs, and stuff like that.

Shame on you, Owlcat, for being yet another company that takes wanton liberties with definitions, non-delivering upon them. You knew very well, what you were doing and what is lacking. Even your Pathfinders were barely sporting something else than the library's amount of texts, combat, builds, and quests that were respectfully complex, granted, but often involved nothing else than more talking or killing—and barely something about maps being interconnected through the assembly of quest items or several situations' outcomes from adjoined maps and sub-areas, secret doors and sections, discovering paths instead of just being presented them, various approaches to places depending on skills, items, exploration, or role play, changing architectonics, explorational puzzles, secret buttons and their combinations, pressure plate puzzles, quest items that need researching in both usage and discovering, lore-based piece-it-together-first treasure hunts, etc.

It's a shame the devs released this game early to capitalize on the Christmas holiday despite all these bugs. No way they 'didn't know'. It doesn't take much QA to find out all the broken quest-lines. 

You have fanboys saying the game is fine and you just need the toybox mod. What a joke. Toybox doesn't fix anything, it just allows you to tweak things AFTER things break. It doesn't prevent things from breaking. 

If you're reading this, you're probably wondering if you should buy now or wait. Just wait. Even with the promised patch, it probably won't be the silver bullet that solves everything. Just like their previous games, wait a year and then it'll be patched up.

I have completed 1.5 runs, my first being Heretical and my second one, I am halfway through, being Iconoclast. The game up to the end of Act 3 is well-written and engaging. You can tell the developers know their 40k lore inside and out, and being a huge Warhammer 40k fan, that is appreciated. As any fan will know, there are many Warhammer games, but few 'good' Warhammer games. 

Where this game falls apart is after Act 3. There are only two major quests in Act 4, with some sidequests that make it shorter than all the other acts before it. You can follow up on rumours if you piece together clues, but the rumour system is currently bugged, so without the Toybox mod, you cannot set the flags for some of the quests to work correctly. Act 5 took me 4.5 hours to complete on Daring during my first run and has many bugs with checks that mean, again, you have to use Toybox. I have a feeling that the later acts were not playtested or developed as much as they should have been.

As of patch .102 I can say that acts 1-3 have been a pleasure to play compared to my first run, but the bugs with rumours and several quests in acts 4-5 remain. I am of the opinion that a lot was cut from the last acts if you use the Toybox to access parts of the game that are half-done and usually inaccessible. Several areas were merged, and some parts of the story have been removed. I do not know why this is the case, but it is disappointing to see. 

If you are a Warhammer fan like I am, this is like a love letter to the fandom in a game format that you have been waiting for. Even if you have never tried a cRPG before, I strongly recommend getting this game at some point. If you are a cRPG fan, then I also recommend getting the game at some point. 

The part of me that is torn over this game is because I feel we only have 3/5 of a complete game. Even when the next patch comes out, even if all the bugs get fixed, acts 4 and 5 are too short. The secret companions you can get late in the game have no quests or even dialogue like the other ones you can get either, so for the current price Owlcat wants you to pay, you will have to choose if it is right for you. Many of the skills and talents do not work or are bugged as well. Currently, several quests late in the game are only doable with the Toybox mod; it is a must-have if you want to complete the game. 

I give this game a 6.5/10 because of the bugs and needing a mod to complete quests. Buy it on sale after it is patched unless you are a huge Warhammer or cRPG fan.",1708036190,1708044155,False,118,1,0.823003411293029785,10,True,False,False

Pros:
- The design and feel of Warhammer 40k is there and very well done
- The tone equally is very good.

Cons:
- Combat: while fun at first becomes dull very quickly, I found myself lowering the difficulty not because the game was too hard, but because the combat became filler fight after filler fight.
- Many parts of the game and flags for the game are still unplayable. 
- The romances are horribly written: They read like fan fiction sometimes. For example one of the correct options for romance is getting down on one knee and talking about how dazzling a character is. Who talks like this? And who would respond well to that after just being recruited? Another character's romance trigger option is to say they captivated you from the moments you laid eyes on them. But you just met this character 10 minutes ago. Another character will give you an item he received to send you, and the romance trigger option is ""wow, a first love token for me?"" Genuinely the romances feel like fan fiction, or that the main character is meant to be wearing a fedora.
- The main plotline: Similar to fan-fiction as well, the game tries to weave way too much factions and things into the game that often make no logical sense and what you get is a hodgepodge of ideas with very little cohesion.
- Companion diversity: While it is possible to write a well written story of companions all from the same faction, the lack of cohesion is not helped by the fact that 90% of the companions work for the Imperium. So what ends up happening is these important plot points where you're supposed to be interested about your companions input everyone has the same thing to say pretty much. And it ends up feeling old really fast, especially cause none of the Imperiuim companions can have their allegiance changed, actually your choices have very little effect on your companions on a fundamental level. They're all surface level choices that go no deeper then the options you see on your screen.
- The alignment system: Locking buffs and choices behind how many choices that you make that are Dogmatic, Iconoclast, or Heretic is really a poorly done system. What ends up happening is if you wanna go down one of those routes you pretty much have no agency and have to choose every choice for that alignment or you'll miss out on the max level buffs/dialogue options. Also the consequences for these alignments are very superficial as well, though I won't spoil anything. Basically having your alignment of Dogmatic/Iconoclast/Heretic as a hidden score is bad, especially because some of the dialogue options feel arbitrarly given point amounts, or an alignment. There's been a few Heretic options that feel like they should be Dogmatic options but the game seems to think Lawful Evil is always Dogmatic and Heretic is always Chaotic Evil, and everything else is Iconoclast.
- Player agency: You have very little player agency, you are railroaded down multiple decisions that will make no sense for a good portion of characters in the universe.
- Ultimately the game lacks soul: The game tries to remind you at every possible point that, hey this Warhammer 40k, or hey this is grimdark, but what ends up coming of that is a game that lacks the ability to stand on it's own to feet. It uses the franchise as a crutch rather than a launching off point and I ended up with an experience where I have very little moments from the game that were memorable in a good way.",1705207715,1708031668,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of this moment, I would say a mostly positive rating of 75% is probably mostly appropriate (as of this posting, February 2024). If lower than I think it deserves, we are all products of our times, and our times are full of disappointments in terms of game releases, so a brutally critical fanbase is to be expected and therefore a lower score than it probably deserves. This game is no Cyberpunk at launch, I'll just put it that way.

What I don't feel is appropriate is some of the content of the negative reviews. There are many bugs. Some of them are game breaking. But they are being addressed at a frankly surprising pace. Yes, they have quite a way to go, but progress is being made. My own experience involved an unequippable item I never equipped equipping itself anyway. That bug has been fixed. Was it longer than I wished? Yes. Was it done quicker than I could reasonably expect? Also yes.

This game has bugs. They are being addressed pretty seriously. Underneath them is a surprisingly fantastic game that is well worth the time of any fan of crpgs and 40k especially, the dedication to lore is very surprising. Definitely worth your interest at the very least. Should you wait? Maybe. Should you just pass? Absolutely not. This game is a rough but gleaming gem in need of love and polish, and it is getting the polish.

GW abandoned Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader. FFG did a number themselves with a barely edited set of rules, but it was still able to be an amazing TTRPG. Owlcat is trying to keep it alive in another medium and doing it justice. They deserve patients and time. Maybe wait if you don't want bugs. But revisit it later because its definitely worth it.

Good things:
- Lots of atmosphere, lots of lore, feels like you can impact the story. 
- The story is good, the characters and intrige feels just right for a Warhammer 40k, 
- The combat system is good, and 
- I think the ship battle is fine after you get used to how it functions.

So-so/bad things:
- There are bugs, but such is life with an Owlcat game. I didn't experience any game disrupting bugs, just weird small ones.
- While the combat system is great, I may have played on too low difficulty setting. By act 3 I was steamrolling every encounter, one shotting bosses and henchmen within 2 rounds sometimes.
- The loading screens are endless. I really really feel this is the weakest part of the game. Everytime you transition from one place to another, loading screen. Loading screen. Loading screen. Please, get rid of some of them!!!
- Navigating between star systems was not very well executed in my opinion. While it may reflect lore and the warp and stuff, I just didn't really care for all the many random encounters due to warp incident. It is also annoying that you can't trace a route a system to one some distance away if you got all green and safe routes. This part of the game could be optimized.

The voice acting is absent for almost 90% of the dialogues and even in some dialogues it comes and goes? Did the voice actor take a bathroom break or something..? The companions are...mediocre and SPOILER each of them fucks you over one way or another. And the game expects you to care about them, especially the Theodora which is there only in the first 15ish minutes. 

Graphics are fine, nothing more to add there.
Gameplay..well first 3 acts is amazing, the story telling, missions etc all great. But the act 4 and 5 were just...shit. Like they got bored and just made something up to keep you engaged. The boss fights (in act 4 and 5) were just terrible, i lowered the difficulty fo STORY just so i can get them down faster because they were so boooooring, not hard just boring. 

Leveling system i got to say am not a fan of. I found myself waiting for like 5 levels because i just didnt have the strenght to level all of them with that system, i personaly do not like it.

Bugs. The more you progress the more you see them. As i said before, first 3 acts are polished and good, but everything efter that is shit in every sense of the word.

The thing that i hate the most with this game is the travel. You get a quest on the other side of the galaxy and every jump has a chance for a random encounter, which is cool the first few hours of the game because its new. But later its just frustrating.

This is a very simple minded game hiding behind a thick veneer of stats, abilities and mechanics which are very simplistic. Many of which are simply never even touched in gameplay. You could be forgiven for thinking this was a deep RPG, if you just go on screen shots of character sheets and what have you. Dont be deceived, those complex looking screens are window dressing for mechanics that could just as easily have been presented on one or two lines in a text box. Owlcat seem to think showing players the variables theyre using in the code is equal to complex mechanics, but it really isnt unless the coded mechanics are complex themselves. 

Every combat for the first 6 hours is identical. Every chain of actions to win said combats are identical. Even starting from the first two combat encounters, 80-100% of all loot dropped will be vendor trash (Cargo). The only interesting looking loot items are pointless as you can win with the most basic weapons and zero other gear due to the excessive buffing and across the board one-shotting by your party and the enemies alike. Combat feels like a formality needed only to break up the walls of B grade story text.

The UI graphics and sound are good. 
3D graphics are basic for 2024. 
The characters are tropes. 
The settings have been done before (lots of times). 
Not to mention the game breaking bugs widely reported by people further through the game than me (I cant muster the will to play more after 6 hours as its far too boring).
This game is thoroughly disappointing, dont waste your time and money.",1707879740,1707879740,False,2,0,0.331688821315765381,0,True,False,False

I'll break everything down into pro / con:

1. Pro:   3D assets by the 1000s it seems.  Every inch of each level is detailed with all manner of doodad, gizmo, furniture, thing.  Con:  Some really awesome looking scenes that could be it's own story and I want to go in that shop, room, talk to those people.  So, not enough side quests that have nothing to do with anything aside from just being there to do, but half the story is already there by the stellar decorating and interesting looking set dressing.

2.  Pro:  The dialog is top notch.  I thought the ""text adventures"" were lazy at first, but they let you direct the story that isn't quite important enough to make a whole level out of, or act as the preamble to a action or narrative element.  The dialog reads well and fits the Warhammer verse perfectly.  Con:  All that great dialog requires 50 ""Continue..."" clicks to get through a conversation sometimes.  Petty, I know...

3.  Pro:  The voice acing of said dialog is another top shelf aspect of the game.  The emotion!  The inflections, sighs, chuckles, screams,  It's so good!  A pleasure to listen because the emotes in text match what the ears are hearing.  Con:  Only the main story beats are voiced.  So 50% of a conversation could be voiced and then it just stops for the rest.  When this first happened I thought my game had a bug and restarted my PC And the game obviously.  The voice acting is so good I wanted more.

4.  Pro:  The leveling system is pretty deep.  Without typing 40 pages explaining it.  You have quite a big arsenal of options on how to craft a pretty unique retinue and Rogue Trader.   Furthermore you can create team members that feed and consume from each other various things so that you can lay waste to your enemies by way of buffs and abilities that feel earned rather than an ""I win"" button you spam.  Con:  I bet I spent 200 of the 469 hours in this game learning the abilities and what does what and when X should be used and why Y is important  And to be honest I bet I still don't have it mastered, so some would see that as a pro.

 5.  Pro: the multitude of items, weapons, armor help steer your understanding of the depth of the leveling system.  You learn that ""Ring of Awesome"" if really suited for an officer and a soldier shouldn't use it, or that it offers no benefit to the soldier.  Con:  The multitude of inventory items can by overwhelming.  The sorting features reset between tab changes and I'd say that some of the sorting methods don't work.  So maybe just break everything down into tabs within tabs of the inventory.

 6.  Pro:  Traveling from system to system is a neat mechanic.  Navigator insight, scanning planets, interacting with planets or stations, even space combat I've come to enjoy quite a bit.  It's a chess like strategy mini game.  Con:  More space combat please.  It feels like there are only so many space battles and once you've fought them from a narrative position that's all.  Con2:  No fast travel.  It's a click fest to go from one end of the map to the other.

7.  Pro:  The rumors section seems to be a new play on ""side quests"" / ""uncovering mysteries"" / ""idle gossip and tea spilling"".  Con:   Rumors aren't treated like quests or contracts.  They just sit there with a question mark if unread and nothing if read.  So it's harder to know if you've done a thing or not.  As someone who tries to complete everything, this makes me itch.

8.  Pro:  The game is pretty long.   I'm going to guess between 50 and 100 hours of play time from start to finish.  After a few play throughs you fast forward through conversations / skip cinematics.  When learning the game I thought the final boss battle in Rykad was impossibly  hard.  I think I tried it 50+ times and failed over and over.  Learn the game, have a few ""OHHHHH!!!!!"" moments and now it's nothing when you know what's what.  Con:  What you do throughout the game matters.  You get the break down after you finish the game.  ""Bob, the guy you shared your lunch with ended up getting married and had 3 kids, but sadly a dump truck ran him over before his big promotion"".  ""Sister Holypants  took up pole dancing at the Heretic's Delight and shunned the Emperor after your one night stand.""  But most of the choices, checks, skill tests, don't seem to have much sway to the major narative one way or the other. The fact that I'm a heretic of the 10th degree or the Emperor's most devout doesn't do much other than add flavor.  No really real choices.  200 things to do in the game, you do them, game ends.  I'm not saying the game is static, but using Dragon Age Origins as a reference, things mattered more in DAO.

9.  Pro:  Pacing.  The first few chapters are great!  You're smiting heretics, getting rich, making critical decisions for  your various worlds, you're traveling the stars and scanning planets for fat lewtz.  Con:  Pacing.  Chapter 3 (3 or 4?)  happens and you're spending 12 hours of real time trying to get back to your life as a lottery winner of a Warrant of Trade.
And the last chapter of the game feels like ""Oh and we have to end the game... ummm...""
and ""The End!""  Chapter 3 isn't terrible, it's just Loooooonnnnnnnggggg, and you can't come back to it and finsih it later and do other stuff when you need a break, nope it's do this or else.

As others have said ""Bugs!!!""  I just accepted them and figured they'll get patched.

Other than that, the game is worth the $50  I've had a blast playing it.  I'm trying to finish up a few things I haven't done in previous games, and I look forward to any DLC that comes out.

+ great scenery, stunning art, beautiful music (i need more tracks like Scions of Lorgar)
+ good story
+ good design of combat encounters
+ good build variety and much less of useless talents/abilities comparing to pathfinder, not so many obscure mechanics
+ all archetypes are usefull (some stronger, but power level difference is not that big)
+ unlimited inventory
+ difficulty modifiers supressed until the end of act1, so you will not suffer on high difficulties at the start of the game like in Pathfinder

flaws to be fixed in patches:
- sometimes wrorng camera angles
- some moments lacking voice acting despite being important
- bugged quest triggers
- some wierdly high skillchecks
- minor bugs with talents, (especially wierd taunts and vanguard abilities)
- sorting in inverntory and talents lacking QoL (changes already announced)
- combat became easy once you understand officer buffs stacking and power of additional turns (nerfs incoming)
- special equipment range (for astartes, drukhari, aeldari). changes announced
- inefficient builds for mid-late game companions  and limited respec (changes announced)

issues hard to fix:
- minor issue, but story have BIG turn in act5, essentially switching main enemy almost out of nowhere. it's still good, but ending feels a bit strange
- voidship combat. it's much better side-mechanic that in previous game, but certainly not everyone will be a fan of it. On hard/unfair require very specific route of colony upgrades to even start engage in it  efficiently
- reputation and faction trade. not entirely transparent system, you dont know entire set of goods to decide your choice(since maxxing out everything legally is VERY hard, tedious and annoing) and there is no discretion in purpose among factions items.

Developed by Owlcat Games, this title brings forth a faithful adaptation of the source material while introducing players to the complex world of rogue traders and their ventures.

The game shines brightly in its mechanics, seamlessly blending strategic gameplay with immersive RPG elements. Players are thrust into the role of a rogue trader, tasked with commanding a ship and its crew through the treacherous expanse of space. From managing resources to engaging in tactical battles, every decision feels impactful and consequential, echoing the harsh realities of the 41st millennium.

True to the Warhammer 40k universe, Rogue Trader captures the essence of its source material with remarkable fidelity. The grim atmosphere, the intricate lore, and the relentless battles against the forces of chaos all contribute to an immersive experience for fans of the franchise. Owlcat Games deserves commendation for their dedication to staying true to the rich tapestry of Warhammer 40k.

However, Rogue Trader is not without its flaws. One of the most notable drawbacks is the muddy and undetailed graphics, which detract from the otherwise immersive experience. While the game mechanics are generally solid, there are instances where explanations fall short, leaving players grappling with unclear instructions. Additionally, the lack of voice acting in certain parts of the game detracts from its overall polish and immersion.

Perhaps the most significant issue plaguing Rogue Trader, and indeed many other Owlcat games, is the unfortunate prevalence of bugs and technical issues. As the game progresses beyond the confines of early access, players may find themselves mired in a sea of glitches and game-breaking bugs, diminishing the overall enjoyment and immersion.

In conclusion, Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader offers a promising foray into the vast expanse of the 41st millennium, delivering a rich and immersive experience for fans of the franchise. With its engaging mechanics, faithful adaptation of the source material, and captivating RPG elements, it stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the Warhammer 40k universe. However, the game is not without its flaws, including muddy graphics, occasional lapses in explanation, and the pervasive presence of bugs post-early access. Despite these shortcomings, Rogue Trader remains a compelling adventure for those willing to brave the depths of the grimdark future.",1707814955,1707814955,True,2,0,0.537790656089782715,0,True,False,False

After 100+ hours and a rollercoaster of emotions, I've finally beaten the story of ""Warhammer: Rogue Trader,"" and I'm left with conflicting thoughts that could spiral me in the clutches of the changer of ways with ease. Only faith in the emperor of the most dogmatic approach can let me recommend this game. But recommend it, I shall.
This game is a paradox, offering a deep dive into the life of a Rogue Trader, ready to chart your own way. this review is a tale of both adoration and frustration.

+++ The Highs +++
+ Narrative Brilliance +
The campaign and its conclusion are nothing short of perfection. The story captivates from start to finish, with a richness that beckons for another playthrough. Despite broken quests and clunky UI, there is a gem of a narrative to play through.
+  Grandiose Systems +
The game nails the feeling of being a true Rogue Trader, where wealth is more about influence and power than coin. It's a fresh take that I greatly appreciated and the sprawling scale of it is something to compliment. You go from bashing the heads of lowly rebels to negotiating and making diplomatic deals to commanding your starship into space battles and managing your colonies all in the same game, and they are all meaningful experiences that add to the aforementioned grandiose feeling. Well done.
+ Stunning Visuals and Environments +
Each of the hundreds of unique locations is a visual treat, brimming with detail and atmosphere. I wish I could go down to eye level on this game, the fixed camera doesn’t do it justice.
+ Engaging Combat and Strategy + 
Once you crack the combat system, it's incredibly satisfying to dominate battles through tactical genius.
+ Meaningful Connections + 
The relationships you build with your crew and the systems you interact with add a compelling depth to the game.
+ Varied Quests and Playthroughs + 
The quests are thematic and engaging, offering distinct experiences based on your choices. Whether you're playing it safe or going full heretical, the game feels different each time.

+++ The Lows +++
+ Difficulty Spikes From Hell + 
The game's difficulty can be as unpredictable as the Warp, forcing me to adjust settings just to keep my sanity intact.
(My rule of thumb was 3 unfair reloads = “story” difficulty for the first round of combat)
+ Overwhelming Complexity + 
Between leveling, gear selection, and inventory management, the game sometimes felt more like a chore than an adventure. The cheap non-existent icons and confusing (or just lacking) skill descriptions don’t help.
+ Clunky User Experience + 
Navigating the game's interfaces often felt like battling an ancient tech-priest's worst design, detracting from the overall experience.
+ Loot Logic That Breaks Immersion + 
For a game that excellently captures the essence of being above mere monetary concerns, having to sift through trash for loot felt disappointingly out of place.
+ Lack of Seamless Transitions + 
The jarring shifts between scenes, like going from planet to ship, unnecessarily broke the immersion.
+ Broken everything + 
The quest bugs are the worst because you never truly know if it is a legitimate quest state and you just lack context or if it's truly broken. It didn’t stop me from enjoying my 100+ hours with it, but I just had to get into a “war is hell” mentality and let go of my desire to have my beautiful quest log clean and finished.

+++ Final Verdict +++
""Warhammer: Rogue Trader"" is a game of contrasts and grandiose ambition. It masterfully captures the essence of the Warhammer 40k universe, offering an immersive experience of life as a Rogue Trader with a narrative depth that's rare in the gaming world. However, it's a journey marred by frustrating gameplay mechanics and design choices that can test your patience.
For fans of the 40k lore who dream of navigating the complex life of a Rogue Trader, this game offers a rich, thematic experience that's hard to find elsewhere. Be warned, though: for every moment of awe and victory, there's a potential frustration waiting around the corner. Despite its flaws, I recommend ""Warhammer: Rogue Trader"" to those willing to embrace its chaotic blend of brilliance and bafflement. It's a love-hate relationship, but for a 40k enthusiast, it's an odyssey worth undertaking and echoes the complex bureaucracy of the verse, it feels like this would be a game made by the administratum itself!",1707806319,1707806562,True,20,2,0.670028924942016602,0,True,False,False

The companions and main characters are all compelling and well written with depth and complexity. The WH40K universe is of course amazing and really shines in the game. The story is engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. The combat system is complex in a good way and incredibly fun for an old school tactical RPG fan like myself. 

Unfortunately chapters 4 and 5 are at a very early access level and clearly needed a year+ in order to be finished. There is so much cut content and story that two of the three conviction routes are literally impossible to max at this point without modding. There are vestiges of hastily rewritten stories left over in some of the dialogue. Some of the companion quests are still bugged to the point where they can't be completed. A few of the companion interactions after chapter 3 simply were not animated at all and clearly look unfinished. Attacks with hammers don't have animations and many of the psyker abilities are not animated. A TON of the abilities and passives have the exact same icon so it gets confusing. Several abilities and passives don't work on multiple companions. The hit and dodge percentages seem to mean nothing and the explanations are extremely convoluted, I had a character with 187% dodge (whatever that means) that started constantly getting hit with ranged attacks in chapter 5. Most of the abilities and much of the combat mechanic explanations read like they were literally written by a tech-priest from the Adeptus Mechanicus because they are needlessly wordy and verbose or have complex mathematical equations. Chapter 5 still has bugs that can stop you from progressing to the end of the game. Companions randomly have one way conversations with other companions that are not in your retinue or dead.

If you really want to play this then I recommend stopping after chapter 3 and not playing the last 2 chapters of the game until these major issues are rectified because it greatly soured the experience for me. I had a game breaking bug in chapter 5 that stopped my progress in one character and my other character couldn't complete their conviction route due to cut content.

Some of the writing in this game is seriously unreal and super cool, honestly better than a lot of Black Library content. 

It does lack a lot of voice acting (if you got into CRPGs from BG3 you'll be disappointed by the lack of QOL in that department) but if you accept that you're doing a lot of reading you'll have a great time.

Rogue Trader has a lot of the same high quality elements as the previous Owlcat games: it has a very strong story, it has excellently written companions with their own storylines, quests and characteristics; it has sufficiently varied loot and itemisation to make that element of the game interesting and fun; it has more gameplay than just the combat with some dialogue choices and the 'book events' which have become common in their games. It also has quite a complicated class and levelling system but it isn't as tough to understand as the Pathfinder games and it is less punishing as well given the number of levels/abilities you end up getting. I also believe that the viability of different classes and builds is quite high - none of them seem useless and whilst some seem stronger than others I think each class has a place and different builds within them are viable. 

Unfortunately the game also comes with the same issues as the previous Owlcat games: it has some bugs (I had 3 companion quests simply not register progression and become locked out in my playthrough); it has some missing tooltips and some of the combat log hasn't been translated from Russian yet. Rogue Trader also has the secondary combat system, in this case the space battles with your ship, which seem to invariably be terrible. It is no different in this game and the space battles are awkward to play and weirdly balanced, including some which are necessary to progress the main storyline. 

I also found that the combat element, which is the primary gameplay within Rogue Trader, was extremely breakable. Not only does the game allow for extra turns (which usually doesn't end well in turn based tactics battles) but it allows for stacking of stat buffing to an insane degree. This lends itself to fights ending before the enemy units get any actions whatsoever in a lot of cases or with some of the bigger bosses perhaps they get to act once or twice depending on your level of brokenness. 

Rogue Trader was absolutely enjoyable to play though and I liked the game length (approximately 100 hours for a playthrough doing almost all optional content). I would definitely recommend it for any cRPG enjoyers, although not as highly as the two Pathfinder games. It was fun to play but didn't prompt me to immediately want to replay it like Wrath of the Righteous or Baldur's Gate 3.

Many of the other reviews I have seen on this game have talked about a lot of things, but the main 2 that I saw was the story being to slow and the state of the game itself, this is what i want to talk about in my review. 

The story-
I am a hardcore warhammer fan, and the fact that there was a game like this made in the 40k universe was enough for me to enjoy, Yes I can see where some may say the story is slow, but for me I actually enjoy the story. Id say if you are a big 40k fan you should enjoy the story and characters.

The gameplay-
This is where I have to agree with people, the game is in a buggy state I will admit. I have not came across the bad glitches so far, but from what I hear I most likely will encounter them sooner or later. The big problem for me is the difficulty spikes, Sometimes there will be random difficulty spikes with certain encounter, I play mostly on normal except when I hit one of those difficulty spikes then I just switch to story and finish the encounter. 

Overall I love this game and I hope that the dev team fixes the issues with it in further patches, I enjoyed their pathfinder game and personally I can see this being a great game for the 40k universe.

Here's why:

This game has given me hope again: 

In an age of mostly bland stories and designs where writers and devs insult the average gamer's intelligence, this game, doesn't. The choices you can make range from insignificant and merely flavor, to truly game/story altering and even a few that can make you question the morality of your actions. The game design is top notch too, while I'm no dev or designer, I can say that as someone new to an OwlCat game and the WH40K universe in general the devs did a great job at making it both super easy for a noob like myself to jump into and intricate enough for a veteran/stats junkie to drool over. The glossary feature is awesome and helped me to understand deep lore that could have easily gone over my head had the devs not considered this for people new to the setting. 

As y'all can tell by my playtime, this game hooked me deep, the time logged as of this review was on JUST ONE CHARACTER! I like to go through game worlds with a fine toothed comb, and OwlCat made the effort to make sure OCD gamers like me got what they wanted and that to me shows the devs care about the gamer's experience.

For example without spoiling too much, fairly early into chapter 1 you find a mission that requires you to locate a member of the inquisition. Granted, you can press TAB to highlight items and loot, but if you were a new player, which you very likely might be by this point in the game wouldn't know that, you might spend much longer than is needed looking for a door that all along was right next to the entrance, blending in with the other walls. 

Other than this, I would definitely recommend the game.

And then you get to chapter 3. Now, I'm a person who has been reading Warhammer 40k books for years. Hardly a day goes by without me at least reading a chapter somewhere. And I gotta say, chapter 3 of this game makes me want to take a break from 40k period. I'm skimming this harder than I did even the worst of the Beast series. First, the extreme focus on the Eldar who are far and away the least interesting faction in 40k. Tyrannid Warriors have more relatable personalities than Eldar. Ork boyz have more dynamic motivations. Even the T'au are less contemptible. It makes it really difficult to continue caring when the Harlequin will not shut the fuck up with it's pseudo-rhyming babble, and they get more screen time than humanity! The beginning of the game you fight chaos cultists but after that it's literally just 80% Eldar.

Second, it really feels as if the writer for chapter 2 and chapter 3 are two different people trying to communicate through a pair of tin cans and a string. Nothing quite fits with the story up until this point. You're told a party member betrayed you but... no they didn't. And then things just... happen. Very predictable things that you can't do anything to avoid because apparently your character is a naive little baby that implicitly trusts every being capable of speech. And very unpredictable things that make absolutely no sense at all.

Add to that the heaping mound of bugs and glitches, the spotty, mediocre-at-best voice acting, the shallow dogmatic/iconoclast/heretic system, and the extremely limited variety of xenos you meet (the single genestealer encounter is pathetic), I'd wait until they improve it dramatically.",1703797219,1707596265,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

super in-depth world/lore

Its a owlcat game. it can be hard sometimes but its do able.
I never ran into a single game breaking bug for my entire play through.
the game does have some problems tho mostly in the form of the writing.
After act 3 and going into act 4 everything starts to turn downhill and seems very rushed.
I found numerous moments in reading where characters are referring to actions or events that never happened because i killed the character off or made them leave but events triggered like i had been friends with them the whole time. the bonus or hidden companions are pretty lackluster. You get the space marine for example which is easy to miss kinda near the end of the game. You never get to show him off to the people or have cool dialog about how a space marine is chilling with you. that was a huge bummer.. 
some plots seem to just abruptly end with no explanations. happens a few times. 
i found some items and gear where there stats would not apply to your characters.
aside from the writing the other biggest issue for me was the ability tree. Even on the hardest difficulty i found myself just picking random things.level up ended up becoming a hassle instead of something i looked forward too. so much trash thrown into it. too much buffing. to many things that required some turns to set up for it to work. almost no passives or pure increases at all. super tedious and boring. cant upgrade or get a bigger ship. that sucked. or have a fleet really. space battles could have been improved. almost no customization outside of your characters which was odd. i always felt like i had a lot of choice to customize things in other owlcat games. needs time to cook. but im glad we have more things in the 40k world. i hope to see a huge push for more 40k in the future.",1703006003,1707486462,True,0,0,0.537216842174530029,0,True,False,False

I've just been super into the lore but never really felt like I would actually enjoy anything other than that in the franchise except for maybe painting miniatures. Then Rogue Trader was announced and I was so excited. CRPGs are right up my alley and I've played both Pathfinders from Owlcat before and really enjoyed myself. 

And I was right to be excited. I LOVE Rogue Trader. The characters, the worlds, the lore, the random/horrifying mysteries that you'll find exploring the different systems that will never be answered for you...it all feels like Warhammer. Even down to the quests and the choices you make. This isn't your regular ""choices matter"" RPG where you've got your good guy/bad guy/funny guy options because that just isn't how this universe works. It's the grimdark, so the options that you're given reflect that and the consequences of those actions also reflect that. 

Another thing to keep in mind is what most people have mentioned...the bugs. At the time of writing this I've played about 73 hours and hadn't come across a game breaking bug the entire time. But now I'm in Act 4 and one of the companion quests is bugged in a way that means I can't finish the quest without Toolbox, which is a bit disheartening. If you're hesitant on purchasing the game I'd give it a little more time so that Owlcat can put out more patches and fixes before investing in the game because at its core the game is GREAT and it would be a shame if bugs (rightfully so) caused someone to set this down and never come back. But if you're really really REALLY into 40k, RPGs, lore, and making your own silly little guy, then I'd say get it now and experience the game.",1707420164,1707420164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is again one I wish Steam would allow us to give an option like "" Yes, but..."". I do wish this game success. Owlcat have made great CRPGs with Pathfinders. But like the latter, I'd recommend you wait a few months before purchasing it. 

Don't get me wrong, though. The game is fantastic. Great lore, great depth, an effin' good CRPG, and a very good turn-based battle system. But like many have said in reviews and in the forum of this game, it becomes a MESS from Act IV. Many quests/rumours are bugged to oblivion. For example,  you complete one but will get no rewards because the quest remains active. It's honestly a little frustrating since ACT I & II were great, Act III, while being divisive, was interesting in my opinion. 

I have no doubt the game will get fixed like the other Owlcat games were. But at the moment, the game definitely needs some more time in the oven.

Cons
1. Companions are idiots, why do I must look for every step of those morons... Everything that could hurt them, they will step into it. Why not let them just stop before the damn steam or electric circuit duno.
2. Description of skills, is basically shit, I mean yeah sure RPGs do have a lot of formulas and text, but do I really always must to look for my stat and then look for another stat and then manually calculate the output? At least it will make your brain work right? Wrong, dividing or any of arithmetic stuff just forces you to compare 5 numbers that are not written anywhere which will lead to a long time for level up. And additionally there are some perks talents call them how you want that have description like ""will deal bonus damage"", not specifying how much, 1 is also bonus damage, but having enemies with 60+ live or wounds as it described here (don't know what is wrong with HP)? 
3. A lot of UI issues, like when you open map then you open character and just want to close it by esc it will call pause menu, you may say that it just how it works, but no, esc do works to close the opened menu, but it will stop to work when you open one screen after another. Also if you miss the square where you need to drop an item the item will disappear, maybe it was just dropped but I didn't find it after. 
4. Animations also kinda shit, duno why but the frame rate of animations sometimes just don't match the frame rate of the scene, true during slow motion when you kill someone or any other time when there is a slow motion. 
5. Small but still strange, so we are living in 2024 and unlike their previous games which had no cut scenes in a sence where there is some kind of camera action and CLOSE picture didn't sufer from this issues. But here you will see cut scenes where voice actors are voice acting the sound is sounding but characters mouths stay shut, and I just can't take this serious, like watching dolls trying to make me believe they are talking. The game is top down turn based and there are a lot of this kind of games which also have character that don't use their mouth, but they also don't have cutscenes. 
6. Stereotypical weapons in sense that sniper rifle will have a disadvatage shooting target right ahead, this is just annoying. 
7. Not a minus for me, but those who hate XCOM for misses with chance 90% or 99% here is the same, as in previous game just save scum, I do when there is shot 80%+ cuz I got only 5 dudes to shoot and 1 miss is 20% of my total damage, enemy has, well usually from 8 to 20 dudes, they are pretty far away from each other which give you time to take care of the closest, but still. 
8. Point and click. If you are playing this kind of games often you know that there is a button to highlight the objects you can interact with. Here you have such button Left Alt but, it will not highlight loot, loot do displayed on map, but it sometimes take a while to understand what is there you need to loot. Just sometimes it is a small book around 50 books. It will also not highlight characters with whom you can speak. The only thin that it does highlight is lore object, investigating objects (basically the same as lore cuz it has the same symbol) and consoles. 
9. Fatigue, just like in pathfinder but worse. Now you will not be able to remove it with rest or by priest, you will need to return to your ship, and sometimes it's far away. How to get fatigue just fail any check of athletics, I failed the 95% one. 

There are pros though, I will place a negative review because of price and the cheap look the game have and overall inconvenience of playing, will change some time later when I will return to it, cuz right now it just throws problems in you.

Pros
1. Warhammer 40k, lore is good, I feel the immersion, until it will be broken by character lips. 
2. Gear, what you take that how you will look, usual thing for RPG but very unusual to see that in WH game so for me it is plus
3. Blood, great to have some sort of violence these days in game, the dudes are getting chopped in half so no problem here. 
4. Good battle handling. In terms of calculation of the turn itself it's pretty good. You can preview the order by clicking on the ground and then click the action you want to take and you will the effect of that action from the position that your character will stand on, great success. 
5. Quick leveling, for the time I've played I am LVL 10, which is much faster than in pathfinder, but I dunno the max level so may be it will become grindy later or LVLUps will become less frequent but for the time being it is fine. 
6. Decision making. Right now feels like everyone is a heretic, so the game offers you to decide fates, of course in terms of WH universe we all know that heresy is thing that must be punished. And I want to see if all people that I saved and all those that were killed due to heresy somehow reflect on the in-game universe, right now it's kind cliff hand every your decision, making you think that in future it will face consensuses. So it is plus for in advance, because it feels likes this. 

Surely there are more pros like story telling, level design, but it just good, nothing I can tell specifically, locations look unique and look good. 

Unfortunately we live in steam where we can only thumbs up thumbs down games, instead of 10 score system in this case I would place something like 6 tops. 6 would be because of love to WH 40K. 5 if it was just an RPG  in fantasy universe.

Wait for discounts, don't be a blind fan like me. 

So thumbs up for WH, just so that there will be more games in WH universe.",1707354044,1707354044,True,5,1,0.543351292610168457,1,True,False,False

I wont talk about the bugs because many players already did that, however even without them this game isnt balanced at all and just down right unplayable. Since Chapter 3 there are no fair fights, enemys have like over 300hp and very strong armor while you only have like 70hp to 90hp. The bosses since chapter 3 can just one hit every partymember besides Abelard and the space wolve who can stuck 2 shots, and thats if you even find the space wolfe as in the location where he is, he just isnt visible due to the enviroment and i can guarantee that you wont win this game without him. Every fight is unfair, enemys can one hit you basically or you cant make any real damage to them, and thats IF you hit them because allthough often you got maybe like 50% chance to hit and even at 95% you mostly miss, sometimes you can hit somebody if you got 0% to hit though. To give an example, in Chapter 4 you encounter some Eldar, this eldar got some Snipers which ot only have over 300hp in comparison to your characters 80hp but their rifles make 60dmg and they also have a permanent buff which doubles their damage to 120. So they can practically one shot all your characters and they never miss. I gave up at chapter 4 on a boss fight against the defiler. This boss not only has over 1200hp and a few goons but he also not only attacks once in a turn but after every of your characters turns, but he doesnt one shoot your characters oh no, he makes like 3 or 4 overpowered attacks in a row which kill your characters and he also have a permanent buff which allows him to regenerate 20% of his health, these are 240hp more than you could damage him, making him just about unbeatable, and you cant use medicits as they are a rarity to find and there isnt like a shop or anything where you can buy them or at least craft them. after like 50 hours of such mess of a gameplay i just gave up. And all of which i just mentioned happened at the easy mode so i dont know how you can beat this game at the highest difficulty.

Feels a really badly unbalanced though. Already in Chapter 2, my team had taken off and few battles were challenges. It felt like I was just doing narrative mode at normal difficulty. Why?

Every time I do something there's something to interrupt me- this one or that one wants to talk about this or that, usually less-than-interesting flavour text. Travelling big distances is so exhausting, I feel a need to take a real rest.

But that's not really a game-breaker, not yet. Because there's also combat.

There's so much of it it fells like you can't go 15 minutes without fighting someone. Heretics, xenos, pirates, rebels and a whole lot more will come to challenge you. There's a real problem with pacing here, and it's evident by how fast you level up. I feel like I barely started unveiling the plot and yet my party is already level 21. It sure feels fun to be powerful, but it quickly loses it's flavour when you have to fight so. Damn. Much.

The companions are another element that was done worse than say, Pathfinder: WOTR. I genuinely do not find any of them interesting. Maybe it's because it's still early game but if after 30 hours nothing interesting happens either with the plot or my companions something is clearly not right.

In the past I gave Rogue Trader a positive review. After spending a considerable amount of time (I think) with the game I can't really say I recommend it to anyone. I had far more fun with OwlCat previous titles than this one. I also feel like starting a third run of BG3 rather than finishing Rogue Trader.",1702452291,1707180981,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you don't want to wait, in its current state the combat is really fun and encourages you to get a grip on the class system. Its easy to break this combat in half, easier than even in Pathfinder since the lowered number of classes but heightened options per class means its much easier to figure out the underlying engine driving stat interactions and end up with the adventuring party equivalent of a Magic the Gathering infinite loop algorithm deck. 

The world writing and stories in this game are great and immersive. The companions are fine. Don't expect frequent conversations or slowly developing stories or relationships, each character gets one or two scenes per act at best. 

Dialogue options are some of the most interesting out of any cRPG. Given that you're dealing with a universe that's so grim-dark that it sometimes feels insecure of itself, it gives you some real over-the-top dialogue choices. Its also an RPG where playing a more stereotypical hero is refreshing, given that you're trying to be a hopeful champion among a swath of bloodthirsty zealots. Giving in and rolling with the absurd zealotry is just as fun. Haven't tried heretic options yet, but even if they're mid, you're still 2/3 on alignment quality. 

The ship combat is an unavoidable nuisance but you'll end up steam-rolling enemy encounters eventually. Try to  blitz torpedoes and get a colony event that gets you a powerful lance weapon early. 

Colony management is borderline vestigial compared to the other games, but you're not really here to play Kingmaker so its fine. 

The loading screens are endless while doing space exploration given that, unlike the Pathfinder games, loading into a map from the overworld doesn't load you into a character level but a ship level, which will sometimes then require you to navigate to a planet and load to a character level. It gets a bit tedious when you're catching up on any last tasks before the next act starts.

It's Balder's Gate in Warhammer 40k.   Or at least that's what it's trying to be.    Graphics are amazing, the scenery is very well done.    Lot's of lore and loot is very nice.    

Where it's lacking is...   there's some glitches that drive you kinda nuts but aren't game breaking, at least not yet (haven't finished game yet).    So far, you're kind of on rails, not very open world.   Reminds me of Inquisitor.  You choose a wold, you're plopped on a map and you fight your way to your goal.  Yes there's some side rooms and stuff to explore, but really you're in a box and it's obvious where the game is cornering you to complete the plot.     None of that bothers me as long as it's polished and you don't feel too boxed in.   What is kinda irritating is, unlike Balders Gate, there's lot's of dead-ends.  Like elevators that got down and there's just a box.   Or parts of the map you can see, but can't reach or explore.   And sometimes you're stuck in a part of the map cuz it's not obvious at all how to get out, but what is obvious is you can't go anywhere else.   Several map rooms like this in the beginning.  

   I imagine with a few patches down the road, guessing about a year down the line, this will be in the same boat as Cyberpunk once it got polished up.  

Why you should buy this game?   If you're a Warhammer 40k freak, this will be a good investment.   The story and lore in it are great.  The artwork is great.   And it is the closest RPG Isometric they've ever created in this genre.

The combat difficulty is apparently all over the place as there have been complaints about far too hard fights.

It is relatively difficult to name a 40K themed game spontaneously if you ask a player right away given the overall game impression being rather weak.

Unfortunately the story and characters don't quite live up to their previous two games but worst of all is the combat. The pathfinder games suffered from being obtuse and over complicated to the extend that I needed guides in order to make sure I didnt mess up my builds in order to make progress. Rogue Trader is the complete opposite. It is so easy to make builds that are disgustingly broken. Since shortly after getting the first few levels in Arch Militant with Argenta, combat encounters do not last more than a single turn. Argenta, with the help of two officers will just mop the floor with everyone. None of my other party members do anything. I just pass their turns, because why bother? 
The strangest thing is that it almost seems tuned to be this broken because in the few times where I have rolled low on initiative half my team can be killed in the first turn, so even if they fix the broken mechanics that enable Argenta I do not know how it would play well.

Your journey will mostly involve loyalist imperials, chaos cultists, chaos space marines, chaos daemons, pirates, craftworld aeldari and drukhari. Genestealers and Necrons are also briefly present. It'll be a nice ride through with plenty of choices, loot and class customisation as long as you don't mind that the ending is all but guaranteed to leave a bitter taste in your mouth.",1707153762,1707153762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its has many elements of a great game, particularly up until Act 4, but the other negative reviews are correct, the game becomes buggy, unbalanced and poorly written after Act 4. One feels cheated to have enjoyed the game so much and then have the bottom fall out of it after many hours.

Maybe they will finish the game but it would take a huge amount of work. So many abilities are broken, there are many inconsistencies in plot and dialogue. The endings to the companion quests are incomprehensible gibberish. It reminded me of how I finished essays when I realised I had run out of time in an exam.

After a certain point my characters achieved some weird singularity of abilities which meant that every single battle including the final one was won before the enemy or even most of my characters had a chance to take a non-reaction turn.

The story is great.  3rd Chapter starts out a a bit annoying since you lose all your gear, but the setting (Commorragh) was awesome.  4th and 5th Chapters were way too short, but the ending was super satisfying.  Genuinely made me feel like a super powerful Rogue Trader with the fate of the Koronus Expanse in my hands.

Game is still a bit buggy though, so save early and save often... and I would also highly recommend downloading the Toybox mod so you can fix things when they do break, and also so you can respec the companions, whose builds are all crap to start.   Toybox's setting for enabling remote companion dialogue is also a must, IMO, so you don't have to worry about missing out on dialogue when a companion isn't currently in your active party.

Despite the bugs, I really really enjoyed it though.  It allowed me to dip my toes a bit deeper into 40k lore, and have a great time doing it.

If you're a fan of classic cRPGs this game will be right up your alley too. You just might want to wait half a year so all the bugs get ironed out.

The same goes for skills, with a party of 6 you easily cover every skill in the game twice. The only choice for any real character customisation seems to be the belief system, which just goes one of three ways.

Character progression in this game feels more akin to a TRPG like XCOM rather than a large, sprawling CRPG. This makes every character of a certain class feel exactly the same in combat.

after that you feel less of a rouge trader and more like a merc group as you act less with your territory to the point that in the end you leave to some far away land and cant come back until you finish your job.

Pros:

- Great WH40k world building and art style
- Fantastic Music and Sound effects
- Very solid voice acting (unfortunately very little of the dialogue is voice acted tough) 
- Like most Owlcat games this one packs a lot of content for you in order to finish the campaign.

Cons:

- At the moment of this review I encountered quite a few bugs in my first playthrough
- Items also need to be balanced, for some reason at the beginning act 4/5 there are some trash mobs  that drop 1-handed swords that have the highest damage for melee weapons in the game. Or also some beggar in act 3 drops a laser Handgun that is pretty much the best gun in the game until the final encounter of the game.
- Tedious leveling, you gonna spend a lot of time in the leveling screen  with 50 levels and 6 companions in your active roster.

Warhammer 40.000: Rogue Trader (2023) represents a turn-based roleplaying game (RPG), developed and published by the company Owlcat Games. Further notable titles of the development studio are Pathfinder: Kingmaker (2018) and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (2021); both prior instalments were RPGs based on real-time with pause (RTWP) gameplay.

[i] Pros & cons: [/i]

++ You could play as a lackey blinded by the imperial doctrine. Or, you let the whispers of an ancient blade flood your mind, replacing your thoughts with a singular urge. To rule them all. Let the benefactor from the warp guide you on your ascension to ultimate dominance. Give in to your heretical ambitions, and support the ruinous powers wherever possible. A planet left to the incursion of chaos, the sacrifice of gullible allies who have outlived their purpose, every deed and gift in their name is welcomed by the dark gods. Serve them faithfully and in return they will grant you powers beyond your mortal boundaries!

++ The faithful visualization of the WH40K lore in combination with a well maintained balance between characterization, combat and mini-games make for an immersive RPG experience. The alignment system, based on dogmatic, iconoclast or heretical decisions, increases the replay value. Most side quests allow for multiple solutions and rely on character alignment or skill checks. A massive skill tree broadens the tactical depth, and provides the basis for unsanctified MIN/MAX builds.

+ The first implementation of a co-op multiplayer within an Owlcat game can be described as successful. Several sessions with my siblings / battle brothers, purging heretics and xenos alike with bolters, flamers and melta guns, bear witness to this.

o I would like the following for the successor AKA Rogue Trader 2: A companion from the Officio Assassinorum that must be kept in stasis, while not on the field, otherwise he will massacre your ship crew in a drug induced rampage. Classic invasion by tyranid forces foreshadowed by a genestealer incident. Good old ork raiding party featuring my favourite boyz from the Deathskullz clan with tons of dakka. And one hell of a boss fight against an ancient obliterator tainted by Volk-Sa’ra’ram; I still owe one of them a meltashot to the visor.

- A couple of bugs corrupted the holy binary code, e.g. area attacks are sometimes not registered, differences in height are not calculated correctly, and some co-op sessions are prematurely terminated. Owlcat’s tech priests have initiated counter protocols. The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all.

-- While the first and second acts are well developed and the third one constitutes a welcome change in pace, the quality of the fourth act drops like a base jumper without a parachute. Therefore, I consider the numerous comments made by other reviewers regarding a “front loaded game” as correct. And before you ask, the fifth and final act is short and to the point.

[i] Summary: [/i]

Due to the complex and long history of the WH40K fandom, spanning several decades, I would like to acknowledge the discipline and effort put into this project to successfully apply such intimidating source material.

For newcomers to the franchise, the game provides an excellent cross-section of the grim, dark future within the Imperium of Man. As a fan, with over 60 books in my personal black library, it feels like finding a long forgotten STC with schematics for pre-30K armaments.

Recommended for determined recruits and seasoned veterans, loyal to the Palatine Aquila, seeking a faithful adaptation of the sacred lore of the God-Emperor of Mankind. And remember inquisitor, innocence proves nothing!

I love the Lore, even if the number of lore words (Words in dialogues with definitions to help explain a concept specific to the Warhammer 40K universe) could be expanded upon a bit, as there were still a few elements that could have used an explanation (I reported the relevant words to Owlcat).

Combat, both space and ground, works great, and there's a nice difficulty curve from 'Oh gods we're doomed' to 'Oh hey, you're the big Boss ? SUFFER MY WRATH' that progresses relatively well through the story.

This is an excellent Warhammer 40,000 game, that manages to capture the feeling of the setting while trying to create an enjoyable CRPG experience. It's generally well-written, with an interesting plot. The incorporation of ship to ship battles worked well, and the tactical nature of combat generally works.

That said, it is let down by some glaring quality control issues. that make it feel more like an early access game. The combat balancing in act 4 onwards becomes haphazard, with less important fights being more difficult than boss fights.
There are lots of bugs. So many bugs.  UI bugs; bugs in turn-based combat; pathfinding bugs; NPCs and party characters getting stuck in scenery; quests would not trigger correctly; the journal wouldn't work correctly sometimes; dialogue scripting issues; achievement bugs; bugged-out or poorly scripted cut-scenes.

Pros:
Faithful rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 setting
Excellent writing in parts
Good story
Engaging ship battles

Sounds improbable but here it is!

After 158 hours, I finished my first playthrough and I'll immediately go for the next. Same I did with Pathfinder WotR, which I played 5 times in succession, so good was it.

Pro's:
 - Immersive atmosphere
 - Fitting and memorable Soundtrack
 - Interesting, likeable and trustworthy companions
 - Zero Wokeness
 - Non linear story full of surprises
 - Space combat! Yay
 - Same awesome game engine from WotR - moddable, solid and user friendly
 - Lots of sidequests and deep, fulfilling companion quests
 - Ungodly amount of available Lore, conveniently offered through popup-hypertext (this was my first 40k game and I loved reading about all the new-to-me things and continued reading in online wikis. I'm a new fan!)

Negatives:
 - The amount of ongoing, live torture in certain xeno regions was a bit too much for me. I would have liked it I had been given the option to free those poor souls (by making their torture contraptions attackable for example). Passing them without helping felt... wrong.
 - Some very minor bugs in later chapters that could be easily fixed by the best mod (Toy Box) or reloading.
 - Some late game space battles seemed so hard that I wasn't sure they were meant to be won at all

This is without a doubt the best PC CRPG in the recent time and far surpasses overhyped mass production games, which I mentioned at the start of the review.

If you enjoyed their previous Pathfinder 1e games, it is along the same vein, though the setting and rules themselves are very different. It is also designed around its turn-based combat too, so expect a lot less filler fights (thankfully) but encounters do take quite a bit longer to play through. 

As usual for Owlcat presentation and music is is gorgeous. Writing is competent, and it really evokes the look and feel of excessive GrimDark of 40k. Illusion of choice and reactivity is decent enough for a game of this size and you feel like you can approach situations different depending on your take of a Rogue Trader. 

As a TRPG player who enjoy the setting, I found this game fairly faithful and a lot of fun, though as always expect differences due to being a video game. There are almost no CRPGs in settings like 40k though, so if you are a fan of the setting then I can really recommend this. 

And now the cons: There are a lot of problems, and not just things that are cut due to over-ambition and time. While I had no technical problems, I ran into occasional quest scripting problems, a couple of bugged fights, and many instances where items or abilities don't do what they claim. Speaking of rules, this is extremely loosely based on the Dark Heresy/Rogue Trader TRPG. Bloodbowl is a more accurate adaptation of kindergarden soccer compared to this though. Character abilities and levelling and items are all hilariously unbalanced. It's all playable but the entire thing could do with another overhaul, and some general polishing pass all round. 

If you already like 40k CRPGs or Owlcat's previous efforts then grab this now.

I dived into some lore halfway through (the factions, lore, Emp, the heresy, and so forth), and have to say... This game seems to be quite faithful to the grimdark setting, where there are no shades of gray but it's all black with different labels.

The game itself is quite captivating, there are a lot of ""new"" mechanics for those coming from the Pathfinder games, but it's nothing impossible to grasp. Certain aspects are hard to notice (eg. daggers in offhand reduce enemy dodge), but it's all there if you look close enough.

The first playthrough took me ~118 hours, trying out everything I could, and it's been quite enjoyable, both story-wise and gameplay-wise (although it took a while to get used to space combat). The atmosphere, with its stunning world detail and background music, is probably what kept me hooked: it's futuristic-gothic settings come out as really fresh in comparison on the amount of high fantasy/cyberpunk games out there.

However, it's worth pointing out the game has its downsides, at least at the time of this writing:
 - it's easy to accidentally lock oneself out of a certain colony early in chapter 2, when the player has no idea colonies are even a thing ([spoiler]Foulstone[/spoiler]), and you won't notice until chapter 4, when such colony is needed to improve the other ones;
 - many rumors are bugged: they won't be marked as complete, or will be marked as failed. This has no big impact on the game itself, but it quite bugged me;
 - from chapter 4 onward the game isn't as polished as it should be: there are many noticeable bugs, some quests may not progress and so on. You'll need third party tools (toybox or Arcemi save editor) to be able to trigger some flags and progress ([spoiler]to make the door open in Argenta's quest, for instance[/spoiler]);
 - one last minor thing, although it only concerns those who may have played WotR (read at your own risk): [spoiler]it follows the same pacing for chapters 3 and 4. It's not a bad thing per se, but it really felt as a cliché.

I am still not done, and am forcing myself to finish.

The bugs and jittering sections where the characters are slipping through the framerates are bad enough, but other sections just feel so poorly thought out.

I get that hiring voice actors for the majority of the game is tough and expensive, I don't fault OwlCat for that. What bothers me is some of the choices they made knowing full well that their players are reading walls of text.

Why does act 3 have someone conversing only through cryptic poetry? Why are there walls of lore dumps or conversation options that don't really add any value to the overall game, lore, or story. It feels like some questions are present for the sake of being present. At some point, it's just such a wall of text that I get frustrated and start skipping conversations albeit having read everything prior to it.

At the same time, there are some choices that make even less sense to me. Depending on choices not made clear, you lose the possibility of recruiting a major character in act 3. I get it, it is part of the ""choices matter"" philosophy. But I don't think it's very fun knowing that I am locked out of an entire characters content for this playthrough, when the only saves I have are the 3 previous quicksaves one can make.

What I will say, I love the world, I love the music, and I love the sound design. This game finally made me break and get into WH. But by god, there are so many questionable decisions.

Worst of all, it feels like half of the game is spent in loading screens. It's a loading screen to go from looking at your star map to roaming your ship and then another cutscene to return to your starmap and another loading screen when transitioning to a system and then another loading screen to land on a planet. It adds up.

You could turn a blind eye to it but lack of character customization and overlaping roles make for a repetitive, boring gameplay that quickly becomes a chore.

Ship combat is even worse because now not only you are outnumbered but also outranged and out of 3 ship fights I had redo 2 of them because I got demolished by RNG. 

Giving credit where credit is due game gives justice WH40K universe but well done roleplay isn't enough for a good game.

Nice try with the battle mechanics but way too many options that don't always make sense.I tried to love it over 32 hours play but the CTD are just too much and it is now going to the ""Shit"" list until you get a few updates out.

Short summary at the end if you don’t want to read all of this. 

The Good:
•	Grimdark - The game does an excellent job of capturing the 40k universe and its grim darkness. Often even the “good” choices result in bad things happening, not always, but most the time your options come down to what you view as the least bad thing, or the worst if that’s your cup of tea. 
•	Compaions are Great! - Companions are unique and have interesting stories, I honestly wish they had done a little more with the companions as it sometimes feels like you help complete a companion quest which should be a somewhat life changing even but they kinda just acknowledge it, say thank you and go right back to what they were doing. But it’s a small complaint for characters who I think were very well done. 
•	Void Combat ¬– This might be a hot take, but I enjoyed the void combat in this game. I won’t go into too much detail on this, but I’ll just say I never found myself dreading void combat while playing it was usually a “oh cool I get to do some more ship to ship combat.
•	Letting Other Characters Pass Checks – So one thing that I’ve never seen in another RPG, maybe its common and I’ve just been playing the wrong ones, but it’s nice that you don’t need to max out your own character’s persuasion stat to get different dialogue options. Essentially if you are in a conversation and one of the dialogue options calls for a persuasion check but you’re Rogue Trader isn’t very charismatic, it’s ok, because if you have a companion that does have a high persuasion stat, you get to use their stat for the check. And this is applied to all the various stat checks, demolition, tech-use, awareness, etc. 

The Meh:
•	Maybe a bit too much? – So, I never played any of Owlcats other games, so I think if you’re a veteran of their games this won’t be quite as daunting but for me when I first started playing, I felt so overwhelmed I almost gave up on the game (a couple of times). It mostly revolves around leveling your character up as there are so many options and I had no idea what to do, the recommendations they give you help a little bit, but they never explain why they are recommending them so you kind of just pick them and move on. It wasn’t until act 2/3 that I felt like a had a full grasp on all the games mechanics. Now once you figure it out its great and you start to experiment with all kinds of crazy combinations but at first its quite daunting.
•	The Story – I won’t go into a lot of detail here to avoid spoilers and maybe you’ll see it differently when you play it but while I enjoyed the story, I found it a bit jarring. Kind of along the lines of “you’re going here because the game is making/telling you to not because it makes a lot of logical sense.”
•	Be Ready to Read – Some will mind this and some won’t but most of the game is not voiced which means most of the dialogue will have to be read by yourself. The only things that are voiced are pretty much important main quests points and some companion dialogue. Again, this isn’t something that’s bad necessarily, but I think people should be aware before buying, you will spend a lot of time reading if you play this game. 

The Bad:

•	BUGS – Ok it must be addressed here, and many other reviews have pointed it out, this game should not have been released as is. There are so many bugs in this game and some of them are game breaking. I’ll be honest, I played the game with the toybox mod installed just because I couldn’t advance the game without it so I would recommend getting it set up if you wanna get through this game. The bug that annoyed me the most is one that happened pretty much every combat, if my characters were around cover and stepped out to take a shot most of the time, they wouldn’t lift their gun to shoot they would just step out a bullet or las shot would pop out of them, and they would step back behind cover. Same thing happened where my thunder hammer didn’t have an attack animation. 
•	SO…MUCH…POINTING! – A lot of combat will be spent applying buffs and debuffs to both friend and foe alike. Every time you buff or debuff a target an animation will play where your character points at whatever target is receiving the buff/debuff. This will always force your camera off your target and force you to watch the animation… EVERY TIME! You don’t mind it at first but by act 4 it gets old especially when you realize how many buffs/debuffs there are in the game. 
•	Lots of Loading Screens – The game hits you with a lot of loading screens, not a huge complaint but it got a little annoying after a while where I would go explore a system so I needed a loading screen to get into the system, I explore the 2 planets that are in the system, (which takes 30 seconds sometimes) and then leave the system which requires another loading screen. Then if you want to leave the ship control screen and go back to the bridge that’s another loading screen. 

TLDR – Rogue Trader brings the 40k feel to an RPG very well and combat is deep and varied but some questionable design choices and many, many, bugs are holding it back. As for recommendations, the price is a bit steep for a game that is unpolished, I still enjoyed it and had a ton of fun but that’s because I’m a huge 40k nerd that was able to look past the bugs. If you’re on the fence for this game, I’d wait until it gets more polished or goes on sale. If you’re sure you want to buy it in its current state, I can’t recommend getting the toybox mod enough, it literally saved my playthrough.

So, there is ""buggy"" and then there is ""Owlcat buggy"". The former is at this point basically the industry standard, the latter is releasing games for full price that should be either in Early Access our just outright still in alpha. According to a lot of people the games major problems only start showing past Act 2, but I managed to softlock combat about half a dozen times within the first 6 hours or so, to the point I had to make sure to quicksave in front of any door lest there be a fight inside that softlocks yet again. 

Three quest triggers didn't work and required reloading back to before I triggered quest progression the last time, including a VERY long stretch of multiple combats in a row earlier on that was absolute tedium to do twice. Ranged combat animations straight up do not work properly and characters will fire mind bullets out of their wrists or shoulders as their weapons hang limply from their hips. Stray shots can fly across the entire map and pull two extra enemy groups into your current combat, which is hilarious at first, until you end up in a 40 man slobberknocker where a single round takes upward 10 minutes.

Combat is a mess in general, and is the sort of thing that you either divine through trial and error, or by having google open on the side to clarify stuff. Tooltips help, but there are so many little interactions and effects that just are not clear. I often randomly have characters be allowed to execute multiple attacks a turn despite them having no active or passive effect that should allow them to do so. Some enemies will similary sometimes get 3 or even 4 attacks for no adequately explained reason. Line of sight is a mess and makes no sense half the time, especially across different elevations. The AI will gleefully shoot you across half the map while standing on a raised floor, yet your characters cannot do the same once they are up there themselves.

I admit to being a touch nervous about this when I heard it was in production, but prior to release I tried Owlcat's Pathfinder games and found them to be incredibly creative while also remaining loyal to the source material.

On release, all my fears were proven false. This game tells a story that manages to be both epic and personal scales.

-GAMEPLAY-
PROS
-I've been finding the gameplay itself really satisfying. I'm talking about fun map design, both in battles and in general. This is fulfilling some wishes I had to see a more open world XCOM style game.
-Some of the shooting is nice and punchy, with occasional slow-mo effects.
-Good implementation of multiple elevations.
-Plenty of weapon, class and skill variations to give each character a unique flavor on the battlefield.
-Visual representation in battle is great and the UI has might be the best I've ever seen in terms of how it provides information every key word used in text expandable when you hover your mouse over it or right click.
-The leveling system is satisfying, if a little heavy on the amount of abilities I have to sift through to find my ideal choices (not a bad complaint to have at all)
-I enjoy the use of NPC's both in and out of battle. I'm big on NPC allies accompanying occasional combat.

CONS
-I have a small gripe about how it is not feasible to have the characters walk from location to location instead of run on a mouse and keyboard, but, no matter.
-Sometimes line of sight on an enemy isn't there when it appears that it very much is.

-AESTHETIC-
PROS
-An acceptable level of character appearance customization, with equip-able gear that often appears visually on the character.
-As with the battle UI, the neon green used in movement selection and otherwise gives a nice sci-fi presentation.
-The artwork is decent.
-Layout of information and stats seem as succinct as possible given the amount of it that there is.
-The short cut scenes when the camera pans over areas to give a wide perspective can be nice. I particularly enjoyed one that overviews a shooting battle happening on the planet as you land, shots narrowly missing your ship as it finds its landing, and then the military forces stationed behind sandbags around your landing pad. It reminded me of the introductions to levels you landed at in the old original Ratchet & Clank games.

-STORY/DIALOGUE/NARRATIVE DESIGN-
PROS
-Variation of dialogue options are satisfying, giving the ability to express dialogues that align with a number of role-play styles.
-I've heard some people comment that the characters are lacking in depth, but given the duty-bound nature of most of them, I can overlook that, as it is thematically accurate for them not to be concerned with personal matters. If anything, I would be of the opinion that some of them might overshare occasionally, but even the characters themselves will backtrack a bit if they feel they are drifting from important matters.
-I'm role-playing a good hearted character, but some of the more cruel dialogue options I have seen are really hilarious. The sort of ""execute these peasants"" and ""speaking to you is below me"" type stuff makes me laugh. Definitely a lot of Tyrannical amusement to be had.
-I found the voice acting to be decent enough, and compared to some other games I've played in the same genre (-cough- Jagged Alliance 3) I was relieved. 

CONS
-One particular instance of a romance option with a companion felt awkwardly shoe-horned in. Probably the most shallow element of story I have come across so far. The dialogue event occurred to me only a short time after meeting the companion in the previous battle and was coming up with options like ""I have been enamored with you ever since we met"" and ""How about we take this to my chambers"" stuff. The introduction to this scene was something like ""this person is causing disturbance on deck, you should check out what they are up to"" as an attempt to make the romance vibe seem spontaneous or natural, but once I realized that that seemed to be the only point of the scene, I was like, ""NO, why would I care about this random woman I just met."" In any case, It wasn't a big deal.
-I'm not a big fan of voice actors putting on particular stereotypical accents that aren't close to their own natural accent. I think this is what was going on with the Idira companion, though it was still decent enough in spite of this. (Update on this point: as time went on, I have found myself much less concerned by this.)

OTHER
-A few instances had me desiring to reload after making some irreversible choices by mistake. Sometimes it's a bad dialogue option when the given choices are all things I'm not sure about, sometimes I wish to see the outcome of solving a puzzle I botched, in one case it was a the creation of a second custom character in which I messed up an element of their creation. 
With no way to remedy these things without reloading, I found myself realizing the hard way how sparse the auto-saves are.Therefore I find myself having to quick save often.
-I would prefer if all of the dialogue was voice acted, so I didn't have to read so much.
-I particularly like the Abelard companion so far. His character combined with his strong role in battle has made him feel the most fleshed out to me, and he probably feels the most like a friend to the Rogue Trader from the start.",1706619317,1706795756,True,1,0,0.508101820945739746,0,True,False,False

Underrated but not. Perhaps I am a heretic, but the truth is that this is one of the best CRPG games you can have the pleasure of experiencing - IF you can get around the bugs. My first impression was it crashing, which I was able to bypass via disabling particle lighting in the settings. From there I still encountered a plethora of minor bugs, harmless for the most part, but certainly evidence of a rushed release.

However the environmental details, asset textures, drawings and overall experience for me remains positive. This game is steeped in Warhammer 40,000 lore and it reflects in your choices and the world itself beautifully. This game is very similar to Owlcat's pathfinder series, both of which I've played and enjoyed to varying degrees, but this one definitely stands out to me. Not often do I actually care about the mobs I'm about to fight in a RPG, it's just a task. But here? I want to know more about the world, why these things are here, and what would happen if I resolved it my way. Usually to get a new novel item to equip my character with, many of which fundamentally alter the gameplay.

Things I think need work (descending by priority):
- Bug fixes
- Companion options. I'm in space, and I can't say I actually care for a single one of my crew mates. That emperor guy I never met though, he seems pretty cool.
- Ship building and fighting is super tedious, not fun, and can be pretty unfair.
- Game needs balancing in many areas. I probably shouldn't have been able to take down 3 chaos marines and some hulking chaos creature and 20 other guys before act 3. Navigator/ sniper/ officer duo can make the game incredibly easy at times. In fact when I got Cas, I was wondering if she would get weaker over time or if I was going to need to manually increase the difficulty to get a decent enough challenge. Well, spoiler alert navigator powers are OP. Games are meant to be won and meant to be broken, but within reason.
- Honestly would've liked to see more spirit in the societal NPC areas, to perhaps seee their role in civilization too.",1706765204,1706765204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is *extremely* buggy still; soft and hard locks will force you to reload saves, so frequent saving is an absolute necessity. It can honestly be quite frustrating, and more than once, I've walked away irritable after losing hours of progress because I forgot to save or the game crashed mid-save and corrupted the save – forcing me to reload an older one.

Additionally, the game isn't entirely voiced; only certain parts are. It's a pity that the voice actors weren't given the budget to record all the lines. While I didn't mind reading much of the game, it can get a bit exhausting, and the further I went, the more likely I was to skim otherwise interesting information to get on with things.

A few parts, like Act 3, feel much more rushed and are significantly less enjoyable than other parts of the game. The game also doesn't do a great job explaining certain parts, making it confusing to figure out where you need to go or what to do to accomplish specific tasks. If you're not up for the old ""click everything and go everywhere until you solve it"" style of play, you're likely to leave frustrated by some of the mechanics.

Overall, the game is a 6/10 for me. It's a generally enjoyable experience, okay story, and if you enjoy 40K already, you'll love playing as a Rogue Trader.

As someone who knows next to nothing about Warhammer, this game was really easy to get into and is able to ease you into the world quite well. The combat system is very reminiscent of Xcom and after playing the Owlcat pathfinder games it was very refreshing to play something similar yet completely different. The game really benefits around everything being turn-based, and thus, the environments and combat encounters are designed with more hard constraints in mind. Many will say that the leveling and ""feat"" system is bloated and confusing and it may seem like that at first, but if you actually read what things do there are clear ""good"" options and you can often easily choose what will make your character better at what you want them to do. Combat will eventually become unbalanced in your favor once you get a grasp of the system unless you're just not reading abilities, but some boss fights still have mechanics that will try to bring things in line. Game does start to falter in the later 2 acts in terms of story and the bulk of the content is exploring the map in part 2 and actually managing your rogue trader empire. There are also more bugs the later in the game you get, though at this point a large amount of the game breaking bugs have been patched out and I never experienced any myself, but your mileage may vary.

I am not big on RPGs but i think this one is very good. It tells you in detail how most mechanics and stats work and you can read up about nearly all mechanics making good decisions for builts etc which does not seem to be standart in the genre as i was told.

The combat had depth and a lot of options for the player, however you can get super overpowered really fast making the highest difficulty (unfair) trivial if you so wish but for most players this game can be a challenge and i think the combat was fun.

The story has its moments and was overall intresting and fun. So far i finished the game once with 128 hours and it feels like your choices matter and make noticable diffrences how the world and companions percive you and it influences events quite heavily.

Now to the bad:

1. The game has a lot of bugs. I havent run into many game breaking ones but it had frustrating ones.

2. Void combat SUCKS. Its so annoying and boring and while i was playing on unfair i lowered the void combat difficulty to lowest so i can play as aggressive as possible just to end them quicker.

3. While the game presented the look of Warhammer 40k pretty well the graphics are outdated by many years.

4. Only a few dialogs are voiced and not even all main companion interactions are voiced.

Only small gripe would be the battles.

If you are a CRPG fan, a WH40K fan, or loved old school RPGs like Matrix Cubed, Dark Sun 1+2, BG1-BG2, Icewind Dale, Fallout 1-2, etc... you will definitely know what you are in for.

It is not perfect at the time of this writing (1/31/24) but there have been great strides in bug fixes.

I went completely through and beat the game without any game ending bugs. The only glaring bug I ran into was a companion quest bug that didn't have anything to really do with beating the game (you get a similar/better item almost immediately after the quest anyway...)  Also apparently I am in the minority for the bug for this particular companion.

The writing is fantastic for the game and it just has soooooooo much complexity that you will want to make sure you [h1] REALLY [/h1] like complex RPGs as there is a ton to keep track of.

Game has colony management, space combat, tactical combat, also strategic combat (classes that don't really fight but open up strategies for the other characters), and lots side quests.

You can easily go through and beat the game relatively quickly, but if you take your time there is ton of random stuff to explore and side quests to do.

Game keeps getting better and better with patches and the devs seem to be very open to bug reports.

Make no mistake the game is definitely brutally hard. 

The difficulties go like this:
[list]
    [*]Story (super easy, massive PC buffs, NPC debuffs)
    [*]Normal (actually [b]EASY[/b] in other RPGs 
    [*]Daring (this is actually the normal difficulty which is the straight up RT TT ruleset, no buffs for PCs and no debuffs for NPCs, HOWEVER it is a very difficult and challenging system if you don't know how it works)
[/list]

There are 2 more difficulties after ""daring"" but you need to be a REALLLLL glutton for punishment if you want to try those as they are brutal.

There are many times in the game you will feel like you are doing really well only to come upon a BRUTALLY hard bossfight.

So do not fall into the trap of thinking you are OP as you will be put in your place several times.

When I did my first play through (did daring as I have played the TT quite a bit) the final boss fight literally came down to my absolute last chance shot and if I failed it- I was going to have to start the fight all over again. This was also when I really thought my setup was hot shit and could take out everything with no problem, but some bosses really are ridiculously hard.

Definitely cannot wait to see what DLC adds to the game and I am already doing another play through.

Highly recommend!

The launch was quite literally broken but with almost two months of patching from the devs, I'm happy to report that all game-breaking bugs that affected my first campaign appear to be fixed and I just finished a complete run of the game.  Still polish issues and some UI bugs but the game is easily good enough to endure those.  I appreciate all the hard work that went in to fixing the game so quickly, and shame on the managers at Owlcat for not giving you more time BEFORE release.  

With that said, there's so much I loved about this game.   It now sits as my favorite Warhammer game even outdoing games like Warhammer 2 Total War and Battlefleet Gothic.  It feels like a proper adventure what feels like so many parts of the Warhammer 40k universe.  We dealt with pirates smugglers, Chaos and different Xenos, many of the different powers in the Imperium.  It took around 90 hours to complete my campaign and it feels like I really got a meaty serving of the all the setting has to offer. 

As far as the gameplay itself, the bread and butter is a mixture of turn based combat, going around the world looting everything not nailed down, and conversations with various companions and characters.  As you level up you'll of course gain new skills, combat abilities, and entirely new classes to do all these things better.  You'll also gain points towards three different ideologies based on your choices, Heretic (nuff said), Iconoclast (be good... less evil?), or Dogmatic (for the EMPRAH!).  It's enough all together to make me want to jump back in immediately after spending ages in this game.   

Slap on top of that a well written story of intrigue and heresy, a good cast of characters, and a beautifully crafted world, you have a classic on your hands.  I really do feel it's that good.

This game is probably the best 40k game ever made so far, and sadly it is not finished.

From Act 4 and on it is full of broken quests, crashing dialogue and lots of minor narrative and graphical errors.
That this happens 80-90 hours into the game makes it less of an immediate concern, but this game should not have been released in this state. It is like walking off a cliff entering Act 4 and it is very unexpected as everything so far had been good.

The tragic bit about this is that this is triumph of a 40k game. Amazing attention to accuracy and lore, meaningful and impactful choices, varied gameplay and great story. Simply the best game so far in the 40k verse, that stumbles on the finishing line. I really hope this gets fixed.

[b]As it is I feel like I've wasted 130 hours playing a game that was not finished, had bugs making narrative choices for me, prevented me from completing quests only to ""fail"" them for me in later updates, or finishing quests in one way only to read in the log that actually it happened the other way. In a roleplaying game this should just not happen.
Why was this released in this state?[/b]

[i]*Update 1.0.88, the problems still remain.
After checking several Act 4 quests and finding them still uncompletable I gave up.
Will have to wait longer to continue playing this game.

*Update 1.0.93. This fixed one of the bugged quests, by simply failing it for you and thereby removing the issue. But the other quest I checked out was still as bugged and uncompletable as it was.

*Update 1.0.102. It seems the quests that were broken, the ones I was afflicted with at least, are either now completable or they have been tagged failed. Which is one way of fixing the issue I guess.
However now they have reset large parts of the talents for your characters which will not affect new players, but for someone that had taken a break while they waited for the game to get fixed I will now have to spend an hour or so releveling all my characters. I do not understand how this game could have been released in this state.

Act 4 is completely unfininshed. 
Bugs such as:
- Quests not being completeted after all requirements are met
- Objective waypoints unclickable
- Trohpy weapons doing 0 damage
- Endgame psycher powers you built your character for not working at all while spending ap.
- Voidship drifting and not going where the UI tells you it will go making you lose fights.
- Losing entirety of profit factor which you use to buy items because you have a shortage of ""people"", which wasn't explained at any part of the game that you need them.
- All the while people are sitting in your ships cargo space and you cannot move them.

Horrible, horrible UI and gameplay mechanics:
- No filtering or searching the inventory. Right now it takes 3-4 minutes every time I try to swap a couple of items.
- None of the AOE and burst abilites are usable from the high ground (aimed to the lower ground) even though single shots are. 
- Not able to rotate tactics areas, you have to move twice or thrice to random points to place them underneath yourself.
- Global colony resource requirements not explained or visible.
- You cannot see if there's a new encounter or planet to visit in another system without hovering over 20 systems or reading through 20 rumors.
- Most of the lore checks when successful gives ""information"" like ""This dead body is shredded."", ""There is a scrape on the edge of this vent."" without any branching or outcome.

And last but not least, just like every other Owlcat game, every second click leads you to a black screen or the loading screen.

Do you need to visit captain's quarters in your own ship?
Loading screen.
Do you need to go back to the deck?
Loading screen.
Do you want to see the map to move your ship? 
Loading screen.
Do you want to get into the system you just moved your ship onto?
Loading screen.
Oh by the way this companion wants to talk to you in private in the captain's quarters.
Loading screen.
Get out of the captain's quarters.
Loading screen.
Do you want to get into the planet in that system?
Loading screen.
Then you need to go through 2 more loading screens to go to the section of the planet you need to go to, 2 more to get back to your ship, and 2 more to get into your ship and leave the system. It completely breaks immersion.

I am honestly playing this game because the lack of number of story driven RPGs on the market and I hoped it would get better and be patched as I play it. It went worse and worse without patches to make it right.

The gameplay can be a little wonky, especially in the later parts, and fleshing out every character with abilities and talents can sometimes feel like a bit of a chore.

Nothing beats the kind of cinematic showdowns where your party is facing off against Forgefiends, Greater Daemons, heretic Astartes or cunning xenos with a team of genuinely interesting characters, none of which ever felt like a 2D cardboard cutout (which is quite easy to manage in this setting). For seasoned vets of the setting, the characters showcase surprising depth and for newbies, Rogue Trader does a fantastic job of walking you through a setting that must surely feel daunting or impenetrable at first glance.

And here we are! We can do whatever the f we want!
The Great Emperor blessed Owlcat to create this work of art in the most grim dark universe everyone loves.

It's a mixture of very complicated X-Com and classical Baldur's Gate. Let's break it down.

Starting with Heresy:
- Game is tremendeously unbalanced and overcomplicated. Again, as every Owlcat's game, the RPG and development system is don't know when to stop. Bazillions of skills and skill combinations lead to either completely useless characters or too overpowered. For example, I oneshotted final boss on ""Unfair"" difficulty and basically used only two characters second half of the game, when others were completely useless and was in team merely for lore and story progression.
- Convictions (aka alignments), which affect the story, or should affect story really hard, pretty much invisible and underdeveloped, especially at the late stages of game. I walked with huge Dark Apostle and made innocent face on all Heresy accusations till the very end, the only consequence I saw was a departure of a few companions.
- Perfomance, goddamit, Owlcat! FFS! Visual quality of a mobile game strain 4090 more than most modern AAA games. Not the first time! Pathfinder was suffering of this too.
- Game is pretty raw. I hope they will tune it up, both technically and story-wise. Bugs present, but not gamebreaking. Story holes are more striking. 
- Final chapter feels extremely unfinished. No matter what you did before or who you have become, it's a very straight and fast conclusion.

And the glory blessings of Exalted One:
+ Visually atmosphere is very Warhammer'ish. They hit the spot.
+ Story is the same as in Pathfinder, but it's not bad nontheless.
+ Characters are vivid, interesting and fitting.
+ You get the most unlikable motley crew and visit the most unexpected places that no mortal would even dream, could (or want) to visit.
+ Devs didn't add the HOMM this time, but they have added a very simple version of ""Battlefleet Gothic: Armada"" though too.
+ Lore is brought very carefully and gradually, and probably very ""edible"" for non-warhammer geeks. But for the geeks, it's a candy.
+ It is Warhammer 40K, mofos!!!!!!!

Summing it up, it's a much shorter, but very lovingly made CRPG game. So grab your Warrant of Trade, hop on your voidship, gather your crazy retinue and forge your heritage and destiny however you want (to a certain extent), you're one of the few in Emperium who could even dare.

That's the gist of it, don't care about your objections. ""I'm a Navigatior, not a servitor!""

It has its quirks, but generally offers solid experience, and anyone who enjoyed the old school Forgotten Realms games (Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale etc.) should find themselves at home with this title.

Pros:
- Faithful to the 40k lore and setting
- Drop-down lore bits' explanations in dialogues for peeps unfamiliar with 40k
- Great story writing
- Distinct archetypes to choose from during character creation
- Complex character development system
- Astonishing setting-appropriate music
- Good enemy variety
- Many things to do
- Rather simple yet fun void combat

Cons
- Occasional bug here and there
- No cutscenes
- Rudimentary visual character creator
- Somewhat common archetype overlap between companions
- Battles can become tedious for players not that into min-maxing their tactics
- The number of perks you can choose for your characters can be overwhelming thus making the optimisation of your retinue's composition a long and frustrating process
- Some colony management choices either make no sense or have the same outcomes regardless of the option taken

All in all, Rogue Trader is more than decent: it has a great story, respect for the setting, and many mechanisms to engage the player. However, I think it suffers a bit from perks- and rule bloat, which in turn can impact the experience of some players. I'd give it a 7,5/ 10

Lorewise this is in line so I'll allow it.

The dialogue and choices are massive. Warhammer Lore is intact.
The combat and maps are OK. The tech trees are confusing, I managed to figure it out but throwing a list of 50 options at the player at once will drive some away.
The romance feels like something you have to work towards.

You fly around in a ship and have encounters. Some of these were text based adventures, I was a bit disappointed at first but then I ended up enjoying them a lot. Not every planetary landing has to be this massive combat section, actually some of the non-combat parts are my favorite areas.

One thing though is you can restat but your origins remain the same. I had to start a new game since I did not like my character's voice.

So far no major issues but I am only 40 hours in so I feel like I got my money's worth already.

EDIT: Act 1 and 2 are great. Act 3 is where the bugs start. Act 4 is like rolling dice to see if the triggers actually worked for the story. Act 5 is also iffy sometimes combat hardlocks or someone gets stuck in a loop.

Use Manual saves. Up to 10-20 at a time before and after each combat. Name them 1 to 20.

I beat the game in 99.3 hours despite all that I had a fantastic time. I'm a fast reader so 100 hours would be a more appropriate time if you do all the sidequests. Take your time. They are patching the game.

very buggy gameplay, walking into rooms but unable to walk out having to restart entire missions or games.
smoke grenades will stun you causing you to not be able to move for several turns, i could see reduced movement, visions and accuracy inside the smoke but not an entire stun effect.

- Only buy if you
    -- don't mind reading (a lot) in a game
    -- give story a higher priority than grafics
    -- can deal with  complex mechanics (level asscension might take 10-15min if you read al the options)
- Give it a bit of time to receive the polish it still needs 
- Probably don't consider the easier dificulties. On normal late game battles ended up as onesided slaughters with my sororitas murdering half the enemies before they even got a turn.
- Install on SSD, the loading screens will drive you crazy
- At ~ 150h of game for a single play through (with all the detours I could find) and a single crash, this is still a lot of value for your money

[hr][/hr]

On the whole I very much enjoyed the game and more than once I had to smile at the ideas and passion that obviously went into creating this game.

[h2]+++ plot +++[/h2]

I love the extensive plot, even though it is primarily conveyed in writing (think tome rather than novella). 
The fifth act felt a bit tacked on, but I presume this is due to production deadlines preventing a more smooth integration. 
In serveral instances I came accross minor plot lines or rumors that were either buggy or unfinished, which is a shame but will hopefully be addressed in future patches.
Likewise the final outlook on the aftermath of the storyline contained a few characters which I had (had) executed, which should be trivial to amend.
All that should not distract from a overall well written plot which intergrates smoothly into the wider 40k lore (pre Guiliman et al) which is to my mind quite the feat.
On top of that they managed to find ways for talky characters to work (most of the time) - not a given in 40k by any means.

[h2]+++ grafics +++[/h2]

They mostly do their job. It's not overly pretty, but it runs on my fairly old machine.
Only nitpicks are the occasional cutscene which renders part of a wall/ceiling/pillar rather than the action due to unfortuante angle selection.

[h2]+++ mechanics +++[/h2]

They kept close to the pen and paper in style and overall complexity. I feel this is a double edged sword. I delayed selecting character advancements once or twice because I did not feel like taking the time to read through all the options. On the other hand this allows to create fairly complex characters which interact in interesting way.
One interessing approach was the use of pen&paperlike descriptive sequences for situations that would obviously require an entirely different game design. [spoiler] For instance being hunted through the streets of Commorragh by a harpy and taking it out in single combat would never be as powerful if rendered in engine [/spoiler]

Further highlights for me were:
- non combat skills are meaningful
- sniper rifles actually feel a bit snipy
- ship combat runs well, despite its fairly minor complexity

The low points to my mind:
- the (few) attempts at stealth don't work well. 
- the space marine, partly because of bugs (charge does not seem to work right, can't get his bulk through some combat areas), but mostly because he felt a bit short changed in his enhancements

[h2]+++ misc +++[/h2]

The one major pain point for me were loading screens on the order of 30+ secs for changes between areas. This gets especially obnoxios when you need to go back and fourth between two areas to solve a quest. 
[spoiler] The single worst instance of this is the trial in Commorragh where the actions switches between the main character's hallucinations and the releaty of the archon's court. (Short) Loading screens [b]between sentences[/b] in a dialog cut scene!!!![/spoiler] 
I expect that this issue could be ameliorated with optimizations to allow shorter loading screens. Revision of maps or quests might help as well. As it is act II can get tedious because of this, but thankfully later chapters are better structured.

While I'm not unequivocally positive about Rogue Trader myself, I'd love to see the game get more polish, and see expansions that play to the game's undeniable strengths.

There's been a lot of discourse about how bugged the game is. I waited a month to play, and serendipitously finished Act 3 just as the most significant patches for Act 4 were rolled out. I basically got the ending I wanted. Most of the bugs I encountered were immaterial to game progression, and just straight up hilarious. Like, at one point, some corrupted servitors temporarily joined my party, and then proceeded to use their turns in combat to do the Running Man for two minutes. In another instance, a bunch of dead admech guys were resurrected with the power of spaghetti code, and started t-posing during a moment that was supposed to be filled with gravitas. Maybe I don't give enough of a shit, but I really didn't think it's worthwhile getting angry at that specific level of stuff, but I do feel bad for everyone who is hardlocked due to the critical path bugs that I was fortunate enough to avoid. 

[b]Combat[/b]

OK, while my game wasn't fundamentally borked by bugs, the combat really, really could use some retuning. NB: I played most of the game on Daring, which felt like Story mode once I figured out how to game the system. If you have two officers in your party and Argenta gets a heavy bolter, you will break the action economy over your knee, and every fight will be over before everyone in your party can take a turn. When you get a certain bugged plasma rifle and set up the (for now, legit) AP refund talent, Pasqal will kill literally every encounter in the game for you if Argenta doesn't. Watching him destroy the entire Word Bearers Legion in less than a complete turn was definitely a bit shark-jumpy. Next time, I'm going to play on Hard or Unfair with one less officer, unless there are significant changes.

There is a stark contrast between the unnecessarily sprawling talents/abilities system and how formulaic the fights become if you are playing what the game seems to funnel you towards. The combat system could really have used a judicious editor. A lot of talents don't really shake out to much after you get beyond the verbiage and the math. I guess it's providing abundance to create the illusion of freedom of choice and versatility, when only a few abilities and talents stand head and shoulders above the rest.

On top of it all, the UI design of the level-up screens is straight-up sadistic. Like, ""walk away from the computer for a few hours""-level bad, until you finally develop Stockholm Syndrome towards it.

With all that said, the combat is fun as hell. It's also incredibly visceral for an isometric CRPG. The upshot of everything is that you're rewarded with a ridiculous power fantasy if you build your party ""correctly.""

One request I have is to flesh out the psyker abilities just a tad bit more. It would really enhance replayability to add more spells and make staves slightly more plentiful. It says a lot that the psyker on the game art seems to casting Smite, which is not even available in the game.

Sadly, ship combat is really chintzy and tedious. It feels tacked on. Worthwhile items to upgrade the ship appear very intermittently in the world based on luck. It's really hard to gain rep with the Navy, who sell ship items, until you can get some big jumps through colony management later on in the game. Even if there is no ship combat overhaul, this can be addressed.

[b]Story, Setting and Companions[/b]

The game really creates a great atmosphere. The way it opens up for exploration in the 2nd Act, which is the most substantial part of the game by far, is really satisfying. Although in terms of level design, there's a fair amount of copy-paste with the optional areas, there was enough story-telling and the combat encounters were unique enough that I didn't feel like I was going to go fetch bear asses every time my party disembarked the shuttle.

The original companions you get in Act 1 are terrific and I found nearly all of the subplots attached to them engrossing to some extent. I appreciated how Abelard and Pasqal's quests elaborated on some aspects of the main story. Other companions are definitely thinner on substance, and I can see why people would say that Act 4 is on the weaker side, because you're spending the majority of it wrapping up their plotlines. Caveat: If you don't like characters monologuing and info-dumping as a plot exposition device, you'll probably hate this game.

The character writing is strong enough that I reacted really negatively to the companions I didn't like, rather than just stashing them on the ship and trying to forget about them. That's a form of effective writing. RT marks the first time I've ever deliberately permakilled a companion in a RPG. I had him on the ship for a hot minute, he basically kept shitting on the floor, so I thought to myself, ""This is a quality of life issue,"" and had him executed. 

I wish companions had more reactivity following major events. You're encouraged to check in with them, and it's a bummer to just see the stock dialogue waiting for you most of the time. There were missed opportunities here, especially given that this game is barely voice acted. My understanding is that the romances are pretty static too. The romance I pursued and its outcomes (the ""good ending"" for that character) made complete sense on an Iconoclast playthrough, but it would have looked 100% absurd if I were going Heretic. I just stumbled into the right thing to do.

In terms of the overarching plot, well, it's a damn video game. It's going to be pulp, camp, kitsch and lazy tropes. I go into every plot-heavy video game expecting a C or a D movie, and nothing really rocked my world in that regard here. However, I did find the MacGuffin/Pinocchio Story aspects of the plot that drive you to the climactic moment in the game (and can even enable an unambiguously happy ending!) to be extremely silly even in light of that.  Relatedly, it's a bit weird how much of a care bear you can be (I took the care bear route.). I suppose that was a judgment call made to make the game more approachable to people who aren't huge 40K heads--and don't want to RP as a despot or crazed murderer for 100 hours--which I suppose I have to say was a successful one from firsthand experience. 

Really entertaining game with a lot of flaws that had the misfortune of releasing in the shadow of one of the biggest CRPGs of all time. Oh well, not our problem. If you really want to play now, it's probably fine at this point, with a big patch retooling the combat system and adding new voice acting due in late Feb 2024. I think it bears enough replayability even in its current state if you want to go back for the DLCs later this year, as well.",1706383769,1706383769,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:

• Owlcat improved the biggest issues from their previous games like fixing turn based combat so it doesn't lag anymore (well rarely). I did run into an issue where it took a couple of seconds to execute single target attacks on the literal final boss of the game but I'm willing to look past it, since Argenta breaking her back carrying the team with the heavy bolter doesnt require single shots.
 
• No more time sensitive quests anymore unlike in WoTR (godawful tavern defense).

• Fun gameplay. Colony management and space battles are decent side activities.

• Interesting setting and characters. 1 name : Abelard

Cons:

• Buggy : Yes, tons of bus in this game, luckily most of them are insignificant like t-posing servitors or misplaced npcs when dialogue/cutscene starts. I've been lucky not to run into any gamebreaking ones.

• Like classic Owlcat fashion, balance. Horrible balance, but it's part of the owlcat charm i guess at this point. Now this game can swing two ways, stupidly easy or stupidly unfair. I beat the game on unfair because it's quite easy to stumble into an overpowered build that trivializes the entire game. (looking at you officers, cassia, arch militants and assassins)

The game can be hilariously unfair if you have a bad build while playing on daring on above because it quickly turns into kill or be killed fest. If you fail to kill the enemies in 1-2 turns, get ready to get a TPK. Even random mooks can 1 shot party members late game on daring+ like true x-com fashion.

• Pacing. Be warned. If you like to read and not skip dialogue, this game has ABYSMAL pacing. Just about after every other fight, you have dialogue and exposition. It's not uncommon late game to have a 3 min battle followed by 30 minutes of reading. I'm surprised Owlcat didn't have characters justify and explain their every action during combat too like in Baki.",1706370704,1706370704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Owlcat has been providing constant updates. I would say wait until they fix the late game bugs or play until a certain point, usually Act 3.

While the story has been great fun, it's not enjoyable to constantly have to reload saves because you ran into a bug that breaks your game.  Or lag out of nowhere bugs out the cutscenes so they freeze in place or controls that randomly stop responding.

A great story is useless if the method telling it doesn't work.

Another Edit:  As of January 24th.  The game is unplayable, either the memory leak has gotten worse or a new problem popped up after the update as the game is suffering crippling lag.  It is a stop animation motion film if i try to move, and the loading screens are taking upwards of 10 minutes to progress.

Act 4 is definitely not finished. I had characters show up that I had deliberately killed off, with no allusion to the fact that I had done so (Winterscale specifically was pretty hale and hearty for someone I had purified by fire).

Your Strategists's zones will artifact onto the warp map. Harmless but annoying.

There were some situations where my on hover would show that I had a 95% chance to hit a target (which was really 100% because of the blessed bolter casing item), but my shots would just miss over and over again. I think I was hitting intervening terrain in those instances but I'd expect the tool tip to just give me a 0% or no-line-of-sight message in those cases.

Some of the abilities and effects had no description. I would have no idea how or why certain things were happening to my characters.

The story itself was quite good. The expansion of the mechanics as you go from a small squad to a ship full of loyal servants to a ruler of a planet to an entire empire really grabbed me.

first the pros:
this game is amazing, all the voice acting, the details and the missions are top notch from start to finish and i appreciate the fact its not Binary choice game as you get to choose between three options through the entire game. 
i cant stress enough how much i love the voice acting, the world building and the mechanics.

now for the cons:
through out the entire game it was almost perfect except by chapter 4; by the start of chapter 4 you get a singular mission, two encounters and that's it; no cut scene, no forwarding the story, nothing. 

i would not mind if they left it as a cliff hanger for additional DLC content but it feels like the devs choose or where forced to leave it like that because of time constraints as i refuse to believe the same dev's who worked on the game and are clear fans of war-hammer 40K, to be so sloppy.

The thing that really makes it worth playing is the way it immerses you in every day WH40K experience, giving you a test of what a terrible place it is to be. Your companions, the one you are given and you recruit, are true inhabitants of the universe with all their Histerias and Paranoias, and that makes the game come alive. It reminds me of Planescape: Torment, as every companion interacts with you, with the others and with the environment, holding grudges, following or even betraying you, or forcing you to do what you really would not, if they have to stand their ground.
Combat is very tactical, in a ""Jagged alliance"" way, with maps to navigate, levels to explore and turn-based firefights . There also are naval battles, gamebook-like sections (think of Darklands) and proper RPG isometric maps. Do not expect great cinematic acts like in Triple A titles (BG3), but the story is there, it is deep, and it is challenging.
There is no good and bad, black or white, or rather there are people with their own motivations trying to survive and take advantage of others, but almost never for the sake of it.
You almost always can bargain your way out, oppose or ally with the opponent, until you go too far. You are not the savior of the universe, which existed before you and will keep going after you are gone. Choices are hard, and being a ""Carebear"" is not really an option, or rather, not one you won't regret in the end.
I executed a couple of my log term companions on the spot, just because it was what a character in charge in WH40K would have done. I destroyed a planet full of people trying to flee, and not because I'm Evil, but for the sake of all the others. I could have taken in the refugees but I decided not to and I was praised for that.
If you appreciate the dystopian universe of WH40K, you will find it here, and would possibly get too much of a bite of what surviving means. A great game which deserves the accolade, despite being ""overshadowed"" by the more mainstream ""Baldur's Gate"", but which I actually prefer to the washed fantasy experience of the later.

Even romances is rahter a sort of intellectual thing defining your own personality, rather then a ""Fiction like"" love story. You work for the good of Humanity, and the good of your wealth, which is enormous, but human behaviour often turns its Ugly face on you, as you pass through it, because it’s your duty to keep the Imperiumgoing and safe from chaos and heresy, no mattee the cost, or you decide to go the other way and burn everything to your own ambition, damning yourself in the process.

Rogue Trader certainly is no different, with the story of this game unfolding nearly at a cosmic scale over backdrops of text-heavy and intricate lore from the Warhammer universe, Before, I was no Warhammer fan, but this game has had me, late at night, scouring 40k wikis, watching hour-long lore videos on Youtube, and contemplating reading a novel or two from the same universe. The turn-based gameplay in Rogue Trader is no slouch either and is far more streamlined than any other Owlcat title, without sacrificing the myriad of character building options that is typical for these developers.

Which is why I lament that Owlcat decided to release this game in its current state. At this point, they've rightfully made a name for themselves for releasing games in dire need of quality assurance. While I never experienced any game-breaking bugs or anything else that hampered my progression in the game, the writing's on the wall for how unpolished the latter half of this game is. And it's not just bugs, but the pacing, writing and certain quest outcomes of, notably, acts 4 and 5, felt unsatisfying, at least when compared to the first half of the game or even other titles from Owlcat's library. I trust that Owlcat will fix the bugs that others have experienced in time (though less sure that the other arguably bigger issues will also get fixed), but with a third buggy launch to their name, I wonder just how much longer Owlcat can continue this trend before it catches up to them.

Edited my review after finishing the game. Overall the game is still a thumbs up for me, but I want to surface these caveats for those who may not be huge WH40K fans, so I feel this is a good time to give two separate reviews, also some spoilers may occur in my review

if you don't love WH40K this game is a solid 6/10. So, it is better than average (5/10) but due to the design and bugs and other nuances that non 40K fans may occur I would get that you wouldn't love this game as much as me since I am a huge 40K fan. I have been playing 40K on the table top since the early 90s. If the bugs and nuances did not exist it would be a 7-8/10 for a non 40K fan. 

Now, if you love 40K this is a solid 8/10 and it could have been a 10/10 if they did not have some of the annoying bugs, that the design was more scaled out appropriately and the voice acting was much more relevant. I would have much preferred to watch all the characters like in a movie.

So you love 40K you love this game, and it is quite fun, but lets talk about the nuanced things that make this game not fun. I personally did not have as much problem as my gf did, but we have slightly different PC builds. I also was able to dismiss some of the issues because of my bias with WH40K and that simply I am a fan! 

So, here go some downsides if any of these are deal breakers for you, I would say you should think about it, wait for patches or wait for a sale. If these things aren't deal breakers for you, then go on and click that add to cart button!

The game is really designed around some Min/Max builds. Specifically around crowd control and the Navigator character (Cassia) and some of the fights are really hard if you do not min/max some of these aspects. I am a min/max gamer so when I saw I could crowd control with Cassia I went all in, because I know crowd control can be OP as heck! 

There is maybe 2-3 fights in the game that are near impossible without crowd control and min/max builds. This means you don't really get to ""play the game your way,"" and you may find some fights just ridiculously tough without certain builds in your party. I would mostly call this a negative for most folks, but for me I game this way anyway so I had fun when it got stupid tough.

There are game breaking bugs, that I had to install the ToyBox mod to get around. While annoying, I was able to work around them with little effort due to a Mod. So, not a deal breaker for me, but I will recognize how annoying this is.  

Space travel is fun, but super annoying. I ran out of nav points at one part of the game and read online a triggered event can give you more. I spent 3 hours trying to trigger this event and while I triggered tons of space travel events, not a single time did I ever trigger the 2 events you can get nav points on. So, I just gave myself nav points from the toybox mod. I don't even feel bad about this because it is a bad mechanic and an even worse UX trying to farm nav points this way.

The quest journal and instructions for quest are oftentimes unclear, meaning you will spend time running in circles trying to figure something out. You can web search clues or guides to remedy this, or just try and try again until you figure it out. 

Build diversity and build equality do not exist in this game. I had 3 arch militants in my party, each with tons of multi attack options, because the builds are just too good. My main character could attack 3 times every time they parried an attack, and with stacking a certain passive for the arch militant skill I could stack dodge and parry to the point they were guaranteed. So you try to attack my character, I parry, then hit you twice (3 times if you get CC'd to move away from) when it isn't even their turn. This is pretty OP and I love it, but what sucks is that other builds just aren't as good, so build diversity here hurts. these arch militant builds dominated my party and did way more damage than anything else, including the psykers.  So, while the min/max side of me loved this, being able to create super OP builds, the diversity build and theory-crafting side are pretty much non existent in terms of performance of character build. 

Overall I would say this is a 8/10 for me but mostly because i love WH40K and this game does a great job of immersion and the tactical combat is fun. The space travel is fun minus the shortcomings of it, as i just used a mod to fix that. It could be a 10/10 if it had higher production like voice acting and more cut scenese/movies, and it did not have the bugs 

To give the devs credit they have been hot fixing the hell outta this game and it is only a matter of time before all the bugs are fixed. If you want to see more WH40K CRPG content 100% buy this game as this dev shop I think can do a lot better next go around",1702840409,1706149516,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm going to talk about the negatives I've experienced in this game so far (and preface that I have only gotten up to Act/Chapter IV so far, and will make a more informed review when/if I finish the game)
The fights get to a point where they feel monotonous sometimes, but in that point, you get the occasional dopamine spike when you just wipe the floor with some fools, and you feel better again.
The thing that I hate THE MOST about this game is the boss fights.
It's entirely possible/plausible that I don't have my party balanced very well. HOWEVER, I have yet to win any boss fight (besides the first with the Cult) without cheesing it somehow. With the demon engines on the forge world, I ran to a place they couldn't get and bombarded them with plasma fire. any other style of engagement resulted in atomization, either from the adds or the boss themselves.
Commoragh! god, commoragh. that final Kabal leader is a bitch and a half. Every two turns, more adds show up. He regens to full once he gets to half (mostly fine, wasn't that much of a problem) but I hate that whenever he takes enough damage, they get ANOTHER TURN!
same with the massive demon engine in Act IV (I forgor where it is, my memory sucks). Blowing up the plasma generators isn't too bad, but the arena is cramped and the adds do too much damage for being average techpriests imo.
Anyway, angry rant over. Now to the Pros!
Great work when it comes to the lore. The definition system is great for people who don't know it, but even for a lore fiend like myself, I reminder is good every once in a while. The ship combat is quite enjoyable, the profit factor system is pretty good, contracts and colony management are enjoyable distractions, warp perils are fun. I haven't delved too much into things on Rogue Traders, but learning more about them from this game has been a blast. I enjoy the interactions with characters, 90% of which hit harder than a baneblade main cannon. My only complaint is that I can't romance Argenta (unless thats only possible as a female Rogue Trader). The origin system is nice, the classes feel pretty good, and the music is spot-on. If you played Baldurs Gate 3, are even mildly intrigued by 40k, and need something to scratch that turn-based rpg itch, then Rogue Trader is an excellent (and only, by my knowledge) option!",1706138259,1706138259,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You should be a warhammer loremaster and huge fun of this universe to catch EVERYTHING from this game, but even beside that it is very interesting, deep and addictive.

I liked almost every aspect of it.
The game provides a variety of activities - turn-based tactics, real-time exploring, void battles (also turn-based) and some kind of text quests.
This variety is an advantage and disadvantage in the same time: even in case if you don't like void battles or text quests, you can't skip or avoid them in some points of game, so you can stuck in a plot-necessary void battle and loose the interest.
I've also faced some bugs & freezes, but nothing critical.

The only aspect I didn't like is a cargo system: by the end of the game, I had accumulated a lot of cargo in 60-80% condition, which cannot be combined (to get 100%) and, therefore, cannot be used. 100% Cargo can be used to increase your reputation and get access to better items, thus, this problem blocked the possibility of equipping my ship with the latest archeotech.

- Huge. A lot of content, almost 120 hours for one playthrough.
- Nice loot and gear
- Moderately challenging fights (on normal)
- Diverse classes and enemies
- Very nice naval combat mini game
- Really Warhammer 30K
- A LOT of levelling up

- Depending on taste:

- A lot of (Warhammer) lore, story and reading. Wasted on me.

- Things not to like:

- There are so enormous many skills to choose from when levelling up, each with a lengthy explanation, and most very situational and very limited in scope, that levelling up becomes a drag. Reading 40 lengthy tooltips for each class. It is true that some talents do matter in combat, but it is mostly an add up of many tiny percentages.
- That ties into gameplay: You often do one or at the most two or three attacks with each character, for which you have to utilise four or five self buffs to get maximum effect. Every damn turn again.
- A LOT to read 

Overall the combat and gameplay felt a little bit cluncky, overly complicated, and grindy at times. If I compare that with turn based shooters like Jagged Alliance or Showgunners, this is less dynamic, less satisfying.

I have fully beaten the game. I believe in a less buggy version of this game, the multiple threaded story line could be great.

That being said, in its current state mass confusion happens due to bugs. I killed someone, and then magically in Chapter 4 had a dialog with them like I saved them.... This happens alot, and some of the cut scenes are scuffed, the last boss fight scene locked up on me, so I had no insight into some critical dialog that I later saw on youtube. 

Inventory management - terrible
skill picking /sorting - terrible

Ending is a wall of text updating you on your choices, I did not have an issue with this format, but I can see some might. 

Positives - 

good for a solid amount of time (basically until you hit Chapter 3), even with bugs.

Planet building and events are cool , but shallow, still loved it

Companion story lines were enjoyable, love that I have the option of disposing of people.

I could see it being re-playable

If the bugs were fixed, a great way to hook someone into 40k (don't do it now tho)

I want to love this game, but in its current state, its a buggy mess and it seems to get worse the longer you go. I am currently on my second run into Chapter 3 ( restarted cause A LOT of quest lines I missed out on cause they were just bugged), and Im about to put down this game for a few months while I let it cook. To the credit of the devs, it does look like they are making patches that are starting to resolve these issues, but Ive already sunk 205 hours into this game and I feel Im missing stuff, not cause of fair play but things glitch, or get hard locked/soft locked. I've had party members that were not in play teleport into a fight on a random turn of combat and lock the game up. Quests dont trigger even though there is an event, a lot of people are using mods to try to enable or trigger events properly.  I really suggest letting this one cook a bit more. I want to buy the season pass, I want to support a good 40k game, but things got to get fixed. This is a fantastic 40k game, but that isn't saying much as the bar is set really low.

Make no mistake, what is there is great, but hold off until they inevitably release the version they should have in the first place.

The 60% which is actually there is nice for the most part. Combat is pretty smooth and quick (too many damn stacks to keep track of, but it makes sense after a bit of hands on experience). The story itself is passable, and there's some moments which got a good laugh out of me. Nice that Owlcat remembered 40k is gallows humor satire. I personally enjoyed the space combat as well, it reminds me of the old school Battlefleet Gothic tabletop game. I just wish I could have more than one dingy little escort, or customize the escort to serve different roles (maybe I want them buzzing around with a lance instead of torpedoes).

I am in Act 4 and soft locked. Quest triggers are broken and there is no way for me to progress. I have reported the bugs but until the developers fix things I am stuck. This isn't an uncommon occurrence. In trying to find solutions to my problem I have found countless others who have run into similar issues at various points throughout the game.

I had some bugs before Act 4, but Act 4 and reportedly Act 5 are suffering from a large volume of potentially game ruining bugs and it just isn't acceptable for a professional product to be in this state. 

Community recommendations are to download a mod called Toy Box, which is essentially a total cheat engine, to simply bypass broken triggers and other issues. This may be a potential workaround, but I maintain that it is not acceptable that the only way to progress is to download a third party god engine and manually move yourself to the next stage of a quest. I simply expect better from the products I spend my money on. 

The developers do seem interested in trying to fix bugs, so I hope that one day these problems will be resolved, but as much as I want to love this game this is the first time I've been completely soft locked out of progression in a game in like a decade or more, and it is simply inexcusable.

An entire library of lore texts, dialogue and narrative content, coupled with an interesting tactical combat system that, despite some flaws, managed to hold my attention way into the late game. A unique experience that only Owlcat Games provides these days, and that would receive a very high rating from me if it wasn't dragged down by a litany of bugs and unfinished content that make the later parts almost unplayable at times.

7/10 in it's current state

The game's world is in it's name: it's Warhammer 40k. Now, people who know Warhammer 40k probably don't need to hear anything more than that to know exactly what to expect. And, for the most part, they'd be correct. 
For someone like me though, whose Warhammer knowledge essentially started and ended with ""SPACE MARINES!"", that was kind of a turn off at first. 
Warhammer is known for it's insanely deep and complex lore, and aside from it's many mediocre game adaptations, has a pretty high barrier to entry just based on knowledge alone. Despite that, and some initial ""what in god's name is even going on here"" moments, Rogue Trader managed to pull me into it's world rather quickly and delivered the many wonderfully weird and whacky ideas and concepts of Warhammer 40k in a steady and easily understandable manner. 
The world is really the shining star here, 'the most complete and accurate representation of 40k lore in a video game to date' I've read someone write somewhere on the internet. Don't know whether that's true, but it doesn't matter anyway, this game lives and breathes lore, and I love it.

I also loved the combat system. Well, that may be a bit far, it's by no means perfect. But, as a recent Owlcat fan starting with Wrath of the Rigtheous, I, perhaps controversially, endorse the switch to full turn based tactical combat. The maddening chaos of managing a million buffs and debuffs in real time on constant rotation made me sigh in frustration many a time in WotR. The turn based combat mode was good there, but it was also slow and clunky. It's much improved in Rogue Trader, despite still relying on lots of buffs and debuffs often followed by only a single attack on a character's turn. And yes, sometimes that single buffed-to-high-heavens attack then missed on a 95% chance and I felt that familiar frustration kicking in, but more often than not it resulted in sufficiently gory satisfaction. I did in the end enjoy almost every fight and looked forward to combat more often than lamenting it.

Speaking about combat, quick detour: while Owlcat's games aren't really about the ingame visuals (most of the game comes alive through the writing, creating it's more fantastical scenes in your imagination instead of painting them on the screen), I would still be remiss if I didn't mention the lack of audio-visual feedback in combat. So many abilities just don't do anything other than adding a debuff icon below the enemy's health bar. I don't think it's too much to ask for a simple glow shader or small visual effect when casting buffs and debuffs, considering how often you're doing it. Everything that has effects and audio is really good, so it kinda stands out if your grand strategist just waves their arms around and points into random directions for two minutes straight before the first gunshot breaks the silence.

So far, that sounds like a 9/10 game, so where'd those two other points go? Well, enter: THE BUGS.
There's really no way around saying it: this game is not finished. The further you go, the buggier it gets. And we're not talking Bethesda bugs either, where some ragdoll flies through the room or people stand on their chairs instead of sitting, no, there's something seriously wrong with the code in some parts.
Quests don't finish even after completing every step, quest stages don't trigger, quests just don't appear in your log even though they should, events and cutscenes don't trigger, Dialogue repeats itself over and over, Dialogue repeats itself over and over, Dialogue repeats itself over and over, Dialogue options don't show up or are mislabeled, Items can't be picked up or interacted with, Maps can't be left without reloading the game, enemy's AI turns off and they just stand around in combat doing nothing for minutes on end, abilities don't trigger when pressed despite going on cooldown, gear can't be equipped even though you fulfil every requirement, Perks and traits don't work the way they're advertised or not at all, descriptions on buffs and abilites are wrong or missing, temporary effects and debuffs stick on your character forever only disappearing after death... and all this is just the stuff I could think of right now. 
It is the most genuinely infuriating bugfest I've every had the displeasure of experiencing. Some of these legitimately made me mad and lead to hours of lost playtime. Some of it can be fixed using a mod called toybox, but it's at most a bandaid. Act 1 and most of Act 2 are fine, the occasional bug here, an hour replayed there; but Act 3 onwards it gets unbearable. I'm in Act 4 now, middle to end, I think, and I can't manage through a single conversation without something going awry. It really pulls this otherwise excellent game down and it saddens me to no end. I've heard talk of actual showstoppers later in Act 4, stuff that just bricks your savegame and you can't continue. If that's the case, the game really reinvents the phrase 'going out with a whimper'.

I'll continue the game cautiously for now and simply hope that the rumors of my savegame's imminent demise were greatly exaggerated. Or maybe Owlcat fixes it in time. I'll still recommend the game though, there's a lot to love here and I have now sunk over 150 hours into it. Despite the numerous issues it presented. the game still provided a ton of fun and made me overcome my aversion to Warhammer 40k.

I have been a huge fan of these types of games. X-Com, Jagged Alliance 1 and 2, Wasteland 1-3, Fallout 1-2, and I did love pathfinder kingmaker, Wraith of the Righteous, Drakensang, Expedition games, Lamplighter, Baldur's Gate 3 and even Rogue Trader.  I love the squad based game play and building your power base. 

Sadly, almost all of them suffer mid to late game <boredom>. As other posts have mentioned: Acts 1-3 are fun and compelling , but 4 gets lost. I did not even finish the game because bugs and frankly, Boredom! The game became a <why even bother>. I liked what one person said about the developers being lost after the first 3 Acts only to come back and rush it.

I just wish that a developer would actually listen to their communities. These are niche games and I will continue to buy them even if they disappoint me. I just wish they would focus on full and complete NPC creation, with dialogue even after you finish their quest lines. Once the quest line is done, they become just furniture. There should be dialogue throughout the game.  Maybe with A.I. this might be a future thing.

You should feel something throughout the game. A sense of over coming the odds and enjoying your base or ship, etc.

After a certain point it becomes nothing more than furniture. Boring and bland. It is like the Devs themselves got bored with creating the game after a few Acts and just want to end it. All of the previously mentioned games suffer from something similar. Even as a player you can't wait for the monotony to end.

Maybe, in the future, we will have dynamic NPCs, dialogue, meaningful advancement and base creation, be able to have all of your NPCs travel with you. Combat should be balance throughout the game, or if not, then completely random from the first fight. This would set the tone. No super powerful Bosses that you need to kill multiple times <boring!> Like, you just defeated the big bad guy. You now have to fight another big bad guy, or wait is there another one, no, two was enough. Lol.

Anyway, if you are thinking of buying this game. Do so! Yes, even if it lacks all the polish and things we all want. The more we support these types of games. The odds are there will be a developer sometime, somewhere, that will do it right. They will only keep trying as long as they can make money.

Enjoy the first part of the game. It was worth the money. If you finish, great for you. If not just be happy these are still being made. Otherwise, we will all be playing anime, cartoon, games that have annoying <kaboom!> noises and high pitched whinny little girls <really, do any of the developers of those game actually know what a real woman sounds like?!?>  LoL.

Peace and keep gaming. I know I will.

Combat needs getting used to with the seperate movement and action points, attack actions and other actions, etc.

Even the bugs, while some are progression breaking getting you stuck, I still give this a positive rating.

However, the Balance is terrible. I have no words exept painting a situation:

A sniper, built for high damage single shot, deals 50 damage that can get Critical to 80, and can follow with some abilities for half that damage.

And there is Machine gun build, which allows the character to have 3 (!!!) extra attacks - Run and Gun, Arch-Militant Heroic, Wildfire. Also The build gains bonus damage the more attacks he makes, so by turn 2 he will be able to shoot 16 bullets per burst, 4 attacks per turn, and every bullet will deal 50+ damage with decent chance to pierce and hit a second target. 

And to insult sniper builds, Machine gun built can be equipped with Laser Rifle, dealing 60 damage per crit - slightly less than sniper, but he will have 4 attacks per turn.


Effectively game is INSULTINGLY EASY for 95% of times, and 5% are cheat encounters - like enemy cathces you ambush and their sniper have surreal initiative, accuracy and often can one shot your party members. OR simyple i check the rolls and see the enemy has a +40% bonus to hit me....

I run around with 80 HP member, toughest having 110, and enemy have 600... once mentioned above soldier gained stacks for bonus damage, he 1 burst attack killed 600HP Elite.

This is the 3rd game of Owlcat i play and 3rd game that has such terrible balance. Dont misunderstand, the game isnt unballanced - it is ballanced.

After chapter 2 the main story takes a turn to the worse, becoming bland and uninteresting. All the side-characters with the exception of two have really boring and meaningless personal story arcs with no actual character development or proper payoff.

The combat also turns into a mess of infinitely stacking bonuses on one character to race against the enemy's HP+defensive stat bloat; and it doesn't even require any complicated combos, just take the obvious offensive abilities and talents on an Officer and an Arch-Militant and you're done.

The Big Bad, the End Boss, twice as tough and having leagues more armour and deflection than an actual greater demon, died without ever getting a turn to Argenta with an Improved Heavy Bolter stacking those aforementioned bonuses and abilities. This on Daring difficulty.

Overall the game is really fun, if janky and hard to get into sometimes. If you love Warhammer 40k this game certainly delivers.

About the game as a CRPG: 
If you do not like isometric traditional CRPGs, this might not be to your liking however. The levelling is hard to wrap your head around and finding good combinations takes some experimenting. It is easy to build ineffective characters which results in rather frustrating combat encounters especially on higher difficulties. Balancing is not the best, many enemies one shot pcs, even if you thought they were tanky. Abusing the initiative system seems to be the intended way to fight and while the fights were fun, a lot comes down to knowing how to kill everything before it moves.

Regarding the presentation: 
Classic isometric view, looks good for what it is and fits the theme. Voice acting is great but very limited. Mostly you read dialogue boxes. I normally do not mnid reading lots of dialogue, but the verbose exchanges sometimes where too much for me. Loading screens are a bit much.

Story and character dfevelopment: 
WH is not known for its multi-layered characters and this certainly carries over to the game, but there is more than one would maybe expect. Some characters genuinely have real growth. The main story arc is great for introducing WH 40k, but will not win any prices for innovative story telling. Still, I found it solid and enjoyable.",1706020465,1706020465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've played the Pathfinder games you probably have a good idea what you're in for, but to branch out this time it's strictly turn-based and has a new setting. 
The characters are fantastic due in to no small part to some incredible voice acting, though I wish there was more - it shines through for most of the important parts but I was wishing it stuck around for certain key character moments like the Space Wolf rap-battle.
The new combat system is fun and exciting though suffers some challenge problems. If you are competent at these sorts of games you will probably end up ramping the difficulty up over the course of a playthrough when you begin to one-round boss encounters.
There were an array of bugs on release but you will be happy to know that these have mostly be quashed (enough to finish my playthrough without too much trouble at least).

It's a game with a lot of promise, the plot seems interesting, they do a really, really great job of recreating the 40K universe (praise Tzeentch).

Huge plus: Very, very good that they moved to turn based.

TL;DR below.

I was unfamiliar with the RPG system this game uses, so I played on Normal difficulty.

EDIT: I made this review before I finished it because I had a bug locking my progress. Bug is now fixed, for my summary after finishing look to the comment under the review.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
EDITTED:
Initial positive reviews were irresponsible since the game could not be finished without Toybox mod.

Now it seems like many game-locking triggers were fixed, so you are only left with some minor gameplay bugs.

It's still a not recommended verdict because I was generally disappointed by the ending and I don't want to waste time to confirm if everything works as it should now. Buy at your own risk. Game is pretty ok when it works.

[h1]Description[/h1]
RPG set in W40k with a Rogue Trader system. It's much simpler than Pathfinder or DnD 3.5 because of general lack of magic. Each of available classes will have several abilities + each weapon has it's own skills (usually 1 basic attack and 1 special). There is no class like spellcasters in DnD 3.5 with tons of spells to choose from.

Combat is turn-based only, unlike Pathfinder games before it which also allowed real-time with pause. There is a cover system popularized by modern X-Com games. Each character will have some movement points used to move (duh) and some action points used to perform other actions. However you can normally perform only 1 attack, no matter how many action points you have. The rest of points are used for all the support abilities, which most classes will have a bunch of. There are usually pretty small increases to stats, special moves like charge or fire your ranged weapon without the risk of hitting your friends.

There are only 4 base classes and I think also like 5-6 advanced classes available when you finish advancing a base class. Classes are further modified by origin, some origins having a big impact on your character (like psyker's spells).

The story puts you in the boots of a new Rogue Trader - basically a leader of a spaceship tasked with exploration and exploitation of uncharted space. You will be thrown in the middle of a conspiracy that will, of course, threaten the entire system with the forces of Chaos Gods.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ W40k[/b]
The universe is well-represented. Doesn't matter what kind of weapon or playstyle you like in the tabletop game - it's probably here. Chainswords? Power swords? Force swords? Normal swords? You got it.

[b]+ Pacing[/b]
This could be a negative if you really like large levels to explore. This game mostly has small or closed or linear levels with some exceptions. This means that you have very little downtime as you move from point of interest to another.

[b]+ Companions[/b]
Owlcat nails the party members again. Pretty much everyone is interesting, nobody is a straight-up a-hole to you and interacting with them is fun.

This is the exact opposite from the way I felt in BG3 where nearly everyone got on my nerves. Or tried to sex me for no reason. Rogue Trader's romance options are interesting (at least some of them are) and seem to be well-written, but may not have satisfying conclusions (see romance in cons).

[b]+ VAs[/b]
Most voices are at least ok. But some of the positive standouts are seriously fantastic. Eldar companions take the cake here, but there are others that deserve praise too. This trend really started with Wrath and it's nice too see it's not getting any worse. Big props to VAs and the directors, nice job!

The only issue for me is Ulfar's accent. He pronounces the end of the sentences too harshly.

[b]+ General writing[/b]
There's a lot of it and a big chunk is there to explain W40k to people who aren't familiar with it. I really liked writing for Aeldari and Drukhari both, very in-line with how Eldar are described in the lore.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Bugs[/b]
Some bugs will prevent you from finishing the game if you encounter them. Some of those can be fixed by having specific characters on your team at some points. Others can be fixed by saving and reloading the game. But I also encountered some bugs that must be fixed with Toybox mod, which lets you manipulate variables like quests.

Unfortunately there are also bugs that can't be fixed in any way and some of those will soft-lock you in the quest progression, making it impossible to finish the game. This alone makes it impossible to give this game a positive rating.

[b]- RPG system[/b]
It's based on a very small selection of classes, but large assortment talents (like D&D's Feats). A lot of talents are available to specific classes or origins. That alone wouldn't be something I hate.

My big issue is how this entire system's combat is based on micro-skills that give you small benefits and most of them need to be re-applied each turn before you make your 1 attack that you are normally allowed to make.

Having tons of buttons on your hotbar does not a good RPG system make. This combat plays worse than proper turn-based tactics like Jagged Alliance 2 or X-Com and are just a slog. This makes most encounters a borefest of going through the motions with only few encounters having some interesting challenge or unique enemy.

[b]- Travel[/b]
You can only jump between sectors 1 by 1. if your destination is 15 sectors away - have fun jumping and waiting 15x. Each time you risk getting some encounter or such.

Pathfinder's random encounters were quick and simple, over in 30s. Here you are looking at 5-10m of boring combat.

[b]- Space combat[/b]
I can't even plot a course and set my guns to fire at specific points during my move, which means I have to move, stop, fire and then realize that I can't perform a turn that I wanted because for some reason the ship loses it's ability to turn properly after you stop to shoot. Even worse - the arrows that tell you what direction your ship will be facing are blatantly lying to you. Many times I relied on the facing arrow to make sure I will have an enemy in the arc of my guns only to see my ship strafe instead of turn like the fking arrow showed.

[b]- (Un)Friendly AI[/b]
You should be very careful whenever you have allies during an encounter. They will happily position behind your own characters and unload full bursts into their backs.

[b]- No Sister of Battle romance[/b]
For real, Owlcat. Nenio not having a romance, now Argenta too? You know your playerbase, nobody who ever read about Sororitas would go without thinking about a 'what if' with a Sister.

[b]- Yrliet romance[/b]
Disappointing lack of physicality. You can't just have a hand-wave explanation that it's because she's a xenos. The word 'romance' confers some sort of physical connection and closeness by it's very nature. Yrliet's 'romance' should have been called 'platonic love' instead, because that's what it is - you become connected on an emotional, but not a romantic level. I like the story, but there's no romance at all.

And yes, I did spoil the romance for myself while reading guides on how to progress through it. Turns out without Toybox I wouldn't even be able to finish her first quest because it didn't start for me when it was supposed to.

[b]- Straight male romance options[/b]
Highly wasted potential with Yrliet and Argenta. The only 2 options left is a drunk Han Solo-wannabe who's uninteresting and a navigator princess. Granted, Cassia sounds like an interesting option, but it's still a very large downgrade after Pathfinder games.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
Owlcat should start properly testing their games.

I'd give Rogue Trader in it's current state a
[h1]6/10[/h1]

animations not working as intended, 
there are not many unique builds cause of the perks either pointless or breaking the game (cause of the use of multipliers) and the vast amounts of perks given makes all builds the same in the end.
And there are more things then this that has problems.


I do really believe that this game can be great, BUT! 
As its current state the game is in, I can not recommend it of yet.

Pros - More tactical style of turn based combat than previous RPGs released. Comes with a preparation turn prior to combat if you don't get ambushed. Grim and dark story with aggressive, cut throat, violent, psycho, and overly ambitious characters. Nice world building, interesting lore for new players to WH40k. No cap on inventory but management becomes a pain in the neck with a cluttered bag. Can dump useless things to cargo which can be used for trading. Trading system is cool, so you can get items without currency as a powerful Rogue Trader. Not overly complicated but not also dumbed down character building, not a ton of skills but more skills than other RPGs have. On normal mostly anything flies, but better to have a good build than not. Pretty decent range of equipment to improve your characters through the acts.

Cons - Story gets a bit shoehorned once you hit act three. It starts to take a turn where you really aren't dealing with what you as RT do/did, but what happened before that. I don't think dealing with decisions and outcomes not made by the player makes an overall interesting experience, but I get why it happens sort of in this atmosphere.  Imbalanced combat, either you run through enemies or they one tap you flat. People complain about never ending turns and archtype cheese but I think it's necessary to a degree to offset how corny some of these fights can be. Otherwise, Owlcat will have to completely rebuild combat from the ground up. Rumor system is pointless, needs to be taken out. You can go through every system in the expanse and never finish rumors. Quest log is fine but needs a location system to go with the map so people can spend less time googling locations. Trade is also negatively impacted by each faction sharing the same materials, so you can't legitimately max every faction. Also, pertinent materials are few and far between. You would need an explanation of their purpose up front to avoid wasting them pointlessly - ie. melta charges and extractium. Space combat seems good on paper but it's really not that great. It's entirely possible to upgrade your ship to a point where space combat is trivial but it's still not fun at all. And, if you want to fix some of the ill effecting nuances you need to install Toybox. Warp combat is also not interesting and cool at this time, aside from one or two companion interactions you're just fighting the same low quality enemies for trash loot every battle. You can avoid them for the most part but still, Owlcat should have more outcomes tied to companions in warp combat. Lastly, the visuals are horrible, this is 2024 not 2004, dialogue still isn't narrated so you need to read 95% of the content, but whatever exists of the sound effects and music are nice.

A lot of people complain about bugs and the game not being playable. The game is playable 100%. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs at all. The only actual bugs I've come across have been shots whiffing into invisible cover, and abilities not activating at times. Every companion quest I have been able to complete thus far without issue. There are some vague hints at what you need to do and where you need to go in this game, which might frustrate people, so they could misconstrue their lack of patience as a bug. Also, I think people have certain expectations on how the game should play out considering we're the main character, and when it doesn't, people get frustrated as well. (Like someone gets ran over in a warp battle but then complains the game is broken because they lost, or when Owlcat disables the ability to take gear out of cargo in a certain place but people cry it's a bug because they can't exploit their way around it.)

Overall the game is very enjoyable and pretty interesting. I like it better than WOTR and BG3 but you can't say that too loud or you'll get flamed out of existence.",1705947139,1705947422,True,1,0,0.518348574638366699,0,True,False,False

Yes, there are some bugs and rough edges but it's pretty clear that this game is a labour of love.

The graphics, the music and the setting are really immersive and there were a few times where I felt completely violated or lied to by the narrative. In the moments where you're pitted between insane evangelicals, cruel aliens or your own selfish interests, there's usually no happy ending and the results can be so extreme that you feel like you need to have a word with yourself when you shut down the game.    

I have a lot of respect to Owlcat for having the courage to make this game, to do the lore justice and take on one of the most rabid, unforgiving fanbases in the world and make (most of) them happy. I also feel like a lot of the negative reviews here are unnecessarily harsh and maybe down to the fact that people feel they need to hold developers to account after a few scandalous years. It's a good game - objectively - and If you can plough through some of the tedium of amassing resources, raiding space hulks and plotting warp routes then there are plenty of surprises to keep you occupied and amused.    

As a 40K fan I absolutely recommend this as an experience and as a game, despite its flaws. This is the first game that gives you the freedom to explore and interact with the 40k universe while trying to be yourself and learning about the lore from in-game characters with context. I've really enjoyed it so far and I think you will too. Don't try and play it all in one session and if you don't like reading then it's probably not for you.

Sound - 8/10 - pretty good but could be better
Optimization&bugs - 8/10 - At the moment of writing, i didn't encounter many bugs (mostly visual or interface). Nothing that's game breaking. Rest runs very smooth on 5800x3d + 2060rtx (loading screen ~10 seconds)

I will still leave my review negative as it’s tiring when games are released in such an unfinished state. But even so, ""Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader"" did grant me quite a few hours of enjoyment in the end, and at this point, it's probably worth picking up. (4/10)

This game isn’t awful, but it does have a fair share of issues. Apart from difficulty spikes similar to those found in their previous games, it also has more than a few bugs. I got stuck a few times and had to load earlier saves, sometimes losing hours of playtime. But even so, the difficulty spikes were what got to me the most. You can very easily go from having little to no trouble to having to spend hours on a single fight with very little hope of success. The worst example of this must be the fight with Uralon the cruel. The fight before, and the fight right after were fine, but that one in particular near broke me. Up until that point, I felt my team was very strong.

As for lore, I can’t really say if it’s faithful to the source material or not, as this is my first foray into the universe in question. I found it rich and dark, and I liked it quite a bit, as well as the story. The romances were okay, as well. Short like in their previous games and not very deep.

I wish I could leave a neutral review, but since that’s not possible, I have to say the game’s closer to bad than good. I did have fun every now and again, but the issues with broken quests and needlessly difficult fights between easy ones pulled me out of the game too many times for me to look back at the playthrough fondly. It’s hard not to come to the conclusion that the game was released too early. Indeed, with the bugs fixed and some balancing, I’d say this could be a good game.

Alright, so I've played considerably more of the game, giving it many more chances. It has managed to flip my vote to a thumbs up. I'm still not a fan of the game's systems, though some of them have grown on me, rather like a fungus. 

What has sold me on the game is the story, which is interesting and well told, and above all the characters. The major characters of Rogue Trader, and even some of the minor ones, feel real. They have personality. I want to learn more about them, see them develop and succeed in the hell of the 40K universe. Their voice actors are also excellent and well chosen to fit each character's persona. I only wish more of their lines were voiced. 

I'm plodding along through the game slowly enough that I seem to be keeping behind the wavefront of patches, so I haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs so far. The bugs I see most often are achievements that pop up repeatedly. Not that big a deal.

If you're considering RT, give it a try. YMMV as far as how you like the game systems. However, the compelling story, intriguing characters, and superb voice acting make it an easy choice if you are interested in the space-gothic future of WH40K.

/YET ANOTHER EDIT

EDIT

It just keeps getting worse. Thanks to Youtube I was able to figure out how to level up my crew. Yes, it's yet another game that requires you to turn to Youtube to figure out how to play it. Manuals are soooo twentieth century, darlings. Of course, at this stage I discovered just how needlessly overcomplicated the options for characters are. It's Yet Another Game that believes quantity of boring options is better than fewer interesting ones. And what morons put math formulas in skill descriptions? Seriously?

Combat is boring and terrible. I have no problem with turn-based combat. I loved the original X-COM, and many other games with turn-based combat. But this is just a tedious exercise in trying to guess which math function will give you the most benefit, while RT retains the least-beloved characteristic of X-COM, missing incredibly easy shots. 

The principal bugs I've seen so far have been with achievements. I had two combat-related achievements pop up and then disappear. Although I've only been to the first star system in the game I apparently have the achievement for visiting every star system, as do 2.8% of players. I also, correctly, have the achievement for finishing the prologue. Steam tells me only 3.1% of players have this, which I can readily believe. Ninety-seven percent of players saying ""frell  this"" and bailing on the game before the prologue is over seems entirely plausible based on my experience.

/EDIT

This game should still be in beta, at best. The UI is terrible, providing no cues as to how to do the most obvious things. I've managed to level up two characters and the game keeps nagging me to do something with that, but every time I pick skills and then leave that part of the UI it just ignores my choices. Maybe there's some magical key combo or button that actually implements your choices, but I have no clue what it is.

The ""map"" is even worse. It's Starfield-tier garbage. You'll get instructions to go someplace, but the map is literally just  outlines of hallways with no markers of any kind. If there's more than one hallway you just have to guess and wander around until you find the right place. Phenomenally piss-poor design.

Music and the few voice lines your character utters are very repetitive to the point they detract from what little is going on. 

I'm sure if I can bring myself to play more of this tedium I'll soon find more flaws. If only I'd kept a closer eye on the clock and refunded before two hours were up.

The 40k setting is amazing and Owlcat has done a great job bringing it to life. The cruelty and nihilism of this world really comes to life through their writing. Characters casually murder each other to make a point; slavery, mutilation, and fiery expurgation are never more than a chat box away. And you oftentimes get to personally be the one to pass judgement or cleansing fire. This is not pathfinder. There is no good an evil. Just heresy, zeal, and pragmatism. Your companions are generally all quite cool, especially the more outlandish ones. I always had a lot of fun interpreting Pasqal's litanies and analytics. Sometimes they even have great interesting companion stories (more on that later). Their voice acting also really brought them too life (especially Pasqal). 

The combat makes me feel like Argenta's portrait looks, teeth gritted, wide evil-smile, laughing at the carnage you can cause in this game. When you kill enemies, time slows and you get to watch them explode in a bloody cloud. It's definitely the best system Owlcat has done. Decisions are strongely tactical. Positioning matters, cover matters, map layout matters, understanding enemy types and vulnerabilities matters. The system does a great job of making your decisions meaningful, and I am excited for another warhammer product just so I can see it again. I will say the combat is not perfect. Definitely some imbalance with the archetypes (classes), and some I think just need another look over, but by and large, there are many satisfying and fun builds to make. The 40k system adapted by Owlcat is designed from the ground up for you mix and match archetypes (classes), where as something like pathfinder just tolerates you doing it, and this was definitely way more and personalize-able. Owlcat has mentioned adding more archetypes (classes) in the dlc so I'm excited for that too.

We'll jump into polish briefly, though I think most of my fellow reviewers have covered that plenty. Was the game finished upon release? Hell no. Items with placeholder names, broken animations abound, abilities not working as read, borked quests. I often time used an accessory that increased the range of my guns and oh boy was the game frequently not able to process that. Lots of abilities would use my gun's range for their range and that would only partially update to include my range increase, causing all sorts of things to fail. I once finished an area, then returned to it later to grab an item I missed, and I loaded into the map in small room used for a cutscene I saw earlier, softlocking me. Same thing happened every time I went back; I never got that item. Anyway, so yes, the game is full of bugs. Install toybox, don't feel ashamed to use it if you have to.  Most people seem to say that this was the least buggy owlcat game on launch, but I don't remember path of the righteous being anywhere near this bad. So :shrug:

My biggest problem with the game is its content and pacing however. It's why I would probably agree the C or B- rating it's currently sporting on steam reviews. Ch.1 is like the prologue chapter, but it has you exploring several more elaborate areas and meeting party members all who have interesting consequences to your new role, so it's all good fun, and pretty chunky. Ch.2 is even chunkier, and expands the content to a huge world map with many things to do, including various isolated side 'dungeons' with complete stories.

Then, Ch.3. Chapter three is extremely short, even shorter than the prologue, and doesn't really make a lot of sense? Forgive me for spoiling lightly, but you are kidnapped and then immediately abandoned and forgotten by your kidnapper in a strange place. It's just so weird a way to start a chapter, and all your understanding of your own character motivations get shoveled out of the narrative like it's your driveway in December. It doesn't help that the area is small, repetitive, and barely has anything interesting to see or do. Neither do your party members, who really could have explored any number of trauma related stories. You just kind of... kill a bunch of people, then climb the world's shortest tower, and bam, ch.4.

Except that ch.4 isn't any better. It reuses the map from ch.2 and adds essentially nothing, just a couple of companion quest specific locations. It's narrative beats are also extraordinarily brief. You fight the big bad up til this point after a dungeon that'll take you like fifteen minutes to get through. I got to the big bad, and I was like, ""wait, what, really? Already?""

Ch.5, the final chapter, is cooler but not any longer. In fact it's probably the shortest of all the chapters. And by this point, all of what were supposed to be the biggest emotional points of the story happened so quickly and without struggle that I'm kind of not feeling my sense of character anymore. I just kind of burned through ch.5 in a short sitting. It's clear to me that chapters 3-5 were very rushed and came out very threadbare. I think ch.2 is the same length as the rest of the chapters put together. Theses chapters all need... more... of everything. 

I think there was something really good here, but it needed more time in the oven. I'd still recommend you buy it; it was a lot of fun, but I'd also recommend waiting for it to go on sale. That way they'll have time to bug fix and maybe add more content.

Whoever designed and approved Act 3 should immediately lose their job. What a piece of shit the design is. First, you get captured somehow (without a fight, this is so stupid and I hate this in all games) then you lose all your fucking items and companions. But now comes the funny part: when you finally get your items (I had over 120) and find the companions, you have the honor of re-equipping them all again!!! Each character has over 12 slots (and some have 4x one hand weapons), 4 combat item slots and you have over 6 companions!. you have to search in a jungle of an inventory for some specific items that you gave them ages ago. oh boy was I pissed. Stop wasting my time with this nonsense. 

The whole Act 3 ruined my game experience and fun for that game (and hence the negative review), leaving me struggling to finish this buggy mess of a gamee. And I was so generous enough to overlook some major bugs that are still in the game (attacking and spending AP without doing any damage/animation, items/skills not working, ...).

And the navigations routes on the map are also a total waste of time (possibilities to get to some points to remove/decrease threat). You will get events where you have to fight chaos (which some fights take some rounds) and the funny part is that you don't get any experience in these fights. congrats for this.

Though not without its problems, this title is truly worthy of attention for anybody who is even mildly into the setting. Great art direction, the game really understands this universe, and yet manages to add unexplored things and concepts and ideas to it. The soundtrack is familiar in theme (the choirs/organs of the Imperium), yet also new and exciting. 

What stood out to me personally was the Iconoclast morality. It is such a breath of fresh air in 40K. I hope this will become a precedent and more 40k media will explore the concept further. 

The game is not without its few issues. Starting in chapter 4 (though pretty much only in chapter 4 I noticed) there are a few bugs here and there. They appear earlier, but they are the most “egregious” in chapter 4. I also find it somewhat strange that you can access your ship’s cargo hold in chapter 3, considering the circumstances. Several boss fight mechanics in the second half of the game are somewhat questionable. Having said all of that, none of the aforementioned is game-shattering whatsoever. 

Things I wish there was more of: voice acting. The voice acting work in this game is awesome, and I wish there was more. More scenes where people talk. I would also hope that perhaps the lines of companions would change, considering their state of being (Yrliet calling me a Mon’Keigh after the cutscene where she refrains from using the term is somewhat inconsistent, but that is just me maybe). A little bit more variety in the maps on the ship when you have to fight off the horrors would also be welcome.

I’m sure there will be people who will start complaining about lore accuracy of x, the totally nonsense y and some such. I’m not here for this debate, and I am also open to some new things coming to 40k (for crying out loud, I played full Iconoclast, so that kind of gives it away).

After 113 hours in this game, having played it to completion (on at least one of the 3 potential paths) I can wholeheartedly say that this is an awesome game. Thank you Owlcat, and looking forward for what comes next, be it this game specifically, or something else in 40k. Big recommend. 8.7/10.

You control a trade empire with a palace and a ship crewed by 25,000, and you make decisions that can treat them like absolute dirt. Yes, it's all text, but the writers made sure I was allowed to cut the tongues out of all the lower deck rabble just to make a gentle translucent spider mutant lady happy. While wooing this freak like a true noble, I blood-orgied my way through my own terrorized crew with a lanky terror elf who throbbed me with what i can only assume was a spike strip penis. I walked into a battle zone, used my near unlimited authority granted by 10,000 year dead emperor to order him to tell me military secrets, brutally maimed him for spilling secrets, then ordered his wife to name their firstborn child after me (the Esteemed High Lord Big Nutz Bonanza the Cruel). I AGGRESSIVELY hit on the wife of one of my most loyal noble families on my throne world right in front of him, and threatened to kill him if he spoke up, then made him give me gifts. I went to a zoo in a crowded space station and slowly electrocuted like 6 people to death, then ordered the keeper to find more so I could do it again. I let a daemon possess my guns that sets fire to things, often me. 

This game is definitely for people who don't mind reading their RPG adventures, as it's only about 5% voice acted, but if you're the kind of troglodyte who takes some kind of stand against reading then stick to watching roblox streams with your sensory overload headphones on while you chill in your mom's cart at the grocery store, don't complain about games for adults.

I've got tons of hours in this game, admittedly most of it is the game running while i attend to my chinese son but I'm still close to the end, Act IV of I think V, and while there are absolutely bugs, none of them have been game breaking or beyond what you'd anticipate for an indie game with such grand ambitions. They are releasing patches regularly, though there's a lot for them to get through.

This game is so true to 40k, it is so grimdark it puts every other 40k game to shame. The lore is perfect and I find myself genuinely intrigued by the numerous reveals and twists, which is highly refreshing after so many 40k games' stories amounting to ""oh guess what, it was orks. oh guess what, surprise, it was chaos.""

Here's my perspective, I came in blind, not knowing much about the lore. My lore of this is terrible, just from random youtube videos, but I find it amazing. If you're new to this, that's fine, warhammer40k and like CRPGs, the game's tutorial really guides you through the many systems.

If you love CRPGs like Fallout, or the style of xcomm (without the brutality, unless you want it that hard), but with BG3-lite dialogue features (meaning still a TON of dialouge choices, just expect to read). There's quite a few choices with consequences already in the first act. 

What I didn't like about kingmaker, is the combat, and tedium to it, the pace. 

Well GOOD NEWS! they fixed that. The combat has a better flow/pace (much like BG3, but more xcom/tactical). The prolouge took me 3 friggin hours lol, but it's b/c I took my time. ?

Somehow there's only 10x the amount of load screens you'd expect from a game (still less then starfield). I feel an SSD is required for this, to make it easier, a lot of systems running in the background. But still could run on most HDDs, just expect longer and lots of load screens (like most CRPGs).

The world is filled with interesting locations and the dialogue is written really well. I am also someone who knew nothing about Warhammer before playing this game and the game did a great job of introducing me to the concepts while still being a very densely lore filled game that I'm guessing is enjoyable to longtime Warhammer fans. However, the game does have some problems, firstly being the level up system, which is tedious to the point that I didn't want to level up anymore as I got further into the game and would normally leave it until my next play session when I could be bothered to scroll through every ability again. There is a ""recommended"" ability option but it only appears for some ability categories and often times I found other abilities to actually be a lot better in the lists. Another issue is the difficulty curve of the game. I played through the game on normal difficulty and as someone who doesn't like to obsess over stat details I had a good and challenging enough time for most of the game. But at the end of Act 4, the game's difficulty suddenly jumped up and even lowering the difficulty to the easiest settings made a number of boss fights only barely possible. I understand that this was probably due to my builds not being very good, but my problem was that there was no signaling that my builds weren't good, until this large spike in difficulty. I really enjoyed my playthrough of the game but I don't think I could play through it again unless these difficulty problems are fixed with either a easing of the difficulty for the endgame at least on story mode, or a better system of ramping the difficulty gradually so that the player knows if there builds are going to be viable for the game or not.",1704757754,1705760735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example: You know you've reached an end of act boss when you see unlimited spawning trash until you kill the boss. This is the only mechanic they use beyond the traditional 'big damage and big armour' and its really disappointing to see after seeing such creativity in other areas.

The problem is if you remove this with a mod there is literally no difficulty so you're screwed both ways. What a shame.

Ed: Actually, they discovered another mechanic at the end of Act 4. Teleporting around a huge arena. He's not difficult, but it sure does add a lot of down time to an otherwise mechanically uninteresting boss fight. Incredible work from a game design powerhouse.

(And of course it goes without saying that every time he teleports he summons in a new pack of enemies with him.

Good news, Owlcat has been pushing major patches, and many of the game breaking bugs are fixed.  There are still a few minor-ish ones here and there, but overall, the game is in a MUCH better place.

My original campaign is broken beyond hope; however, since then, I have replayed the iconoclast campaign to the end of act 4, and no problems at all.  I have also done a heretic play through to the start of Act 4, also no problems at all.  So overall, I would say, if you were on the fence about getting this game, now would be a fine time to get it, and actually enjoy the product.

Those may seem daunting for someone that just learn about the game, but allow for a lot of flexibility at the time of creating and raising your group.

The tactical battles are hard at first, challenging later on, and trivial if you get to unlock all the chakras of your characters. Resetting your group skills is free the first 3 times for each character, so you can fix your build mid campaign. (I played on no dmg reduction for enemies mode, so sometimes your characters get one shoted)

Space battles where really challenging, until I found a really difficult one vs 4 ships at once that toasted my shit even before I could act. From there, I lowered the dificulty to a minimum and just kept doing them easy.

the game basically have preset paths that if differs from the way you played would overwrite the what you've done
you'll have companions talking or giving you advise when they are not with you or worst dead or permanently left

often you see act 4-5 as ""buggy"" that's because the divergence between your play and the preset paths becomes glaring

now there are people who would barely see any of this ""bugs"", that's because how they played is close to the established paths

just like cyberpunk you'll see paths that were practically axed, mechanics that are barely done,i got the good ol npc T pose after a book event for one, some points of interest just doesn't get properly flagged regarding your interactions

d1 cyberpunk was axed then stitched together
rogue trader feels like they just left it as it is

oddly tho owlcat gets mostly flowers, unlike cdpr for basically releasing at near similar states
2077 failed at reaching an ambition set too high with insufficient time, on the other hand i don't see what is going for rogue trader, WotR easily tops it in most if not every aspect

Beating the game at my own leisurely pace took 166 hours.  I bought the game at $50, so I paid about 30 cents per hour of entertainment.  Solid investment.

The game still has a LOT of bugs.  Some quests go unfinished despite meeting requirements, some dialogue options don't reflect choices previously made.  The game has an epilogue, and some of its contents don't reflect decisions made in game (I executed a character and she's mentioned in the epilogue)  It's still playable, but if you're trying to pursue specific achievements, you may wanna wait until the game is further debugged.

Coming from a game like BG3's DND 5E adaptation, this game really overwhelms you with microdecisions that lets you feel like you are really building a custom bespoke experience for your party. 

Outside of that, it's a hard sell for anyone not a Warhammer 40k fan. This setting is just obnoxiously oppressive, and while that is a part of the appeal for most people, it's actually the element that I battle with the most. It's just so grimdark, and every character is just so evil, that there just isn't really a ""place"" for a variety of player style. I've been enjoying it by rebelling against it, by playing as the hero, the good-guy in a terrible world, and the game keeps punishing me for it (as it should in this setting), but I'd be remiss to say that without playing it from this express viewpoint, I would not be enjoying myself at all. 

If you love edgelord brutalistic aesthetic, if you enjoy the idea of playing in evil campaign settings, or if you already enjoy 40k, then sure you'd like this more than me.

121 hours playtime

its finally over and done.
I could not care less about the story or the aftermath or anything.
What an absolute grind.
I am now going to uninstall this crap and forget about it.
Whoever reads this, go and learn crocheting or anything really. shovel sand in a desert or snow in the arctic your time will be spent better that way.




Update after 109h playtime.

I am in chapter 4/5 now and the bugs are piling up.
quests simply abort or finish, things just ""happen"" ( Arghathas mysterious planet for instance ) without any information why. at the one point where her questline ends there's not even a single word as to what happened to her on the planet where in a million other places you have to go through 26 novels about why the color of item x changed to slightly more green.

The final fight against Uralon is not doable on normal difficulty unless you have the exact party with the exact skills and move to the exact squares with the exact party member hitting with he exact weapon the exact enemy. This is all atrocious game design there is nothing positive to say about that. there is absolute ZERO balancing done nothing.

colony managements becomes just annoying you are sent to colonies to resolve conflicts the thing is you always have to make 28 warp jumps back and forth which is time consuming also when you arrive to resolve the event it simply vanishes. just like that.

I am super frustrated with the game right now and feel cheated.
The game does not live up to any quality and design standards. I would have been considered  crap even 20 years ago. Putting something like that out in 2023 at a full price is just scammy.

I have to revise my recommendation, maybe buy the game when its 5 bucks or less in 2 years with all dlc included because that is what this abomination is worth.

also owlcat is dead to me.

unfortunately I cant change the rating to ""avoid at all cost its god awful"".





Update after 92h playtime.

I have arrived in chapter 4 not encountered any gamebreaking bugs or blockers up to and including chapter 3. looks like those got fixed.
The storytelling of the game is atrocious. So far in 92 h I have seen three pathethically animated sequences, the last one final chapter 3 had broken audio, it just went silent half way through

the rest is plain text and conversations

the sheer mass of text to read is unacceptable in 2023.
the game lacks everything in design and storytelling that could be used by modern standards to make the story more engaging.
I have come to the point where I stopped reading at all its just next next next I gave up a long time ago.

The only reason why I keep playing is because I want to be done with it. Sunken cost fallacy. I know


original review:

I have not come across gamebreaking bugs or extreme performance degradation but the unfinished state shows in every corner.

- absolutely nothing about this game is intuitive.
- trade is not explained at all ( spoiler you basically do not trade you farm ""standing"" by giving loot that you pick up to other traders  and once that standing is reached you can get everything from a merchant for free/
- character progression is convoluted and feels unnecessary complicated. it too is not explained at all, its not even explained what button to press when a character levels up.
there is  million of skills and perks. every single one may or may not be useful if 85 conditions are met.
I have nothing against complex mechanics but this is just complexity for the sake of it
- somehow all your companions fall into the same category they do not feel different at all
- combat is repetitive and feels like it was just placed there to prolong playtime it gets annoying really quick
difficulty on normal setting is ok. sometimes its just not clear what to do that can be frustrating
imagine having to constantly fight goblins where each fight takes 30 minutes of your time and doing that twelve times in a  row. and then repeat that.
- weapon sounds are lame to say the least. a bolter, a mighty weapon, goes ""slightly pew"" you don't feel like you are firing a massive weapon things like that kill the immersion. 

next point is more a warning than criticism.
the story and everythign is told by text. you will have to read it all.
i come from a time where that was notmal, planescape torment and balsdurs gate 1 and 2.
but by today's standards its hard to come up with the focus to read entire chapters that do nothing for the story and simply describe an idiosyncrasy of one random NPC in detail. it night be great for lore but its too much

playing the game has its fun parts its can be strangely entertaining and the story is nice but you come across parts and situations where you are just fed up with it and that happens way too often.

in its current state its very unpolished and more an early access game.

I understand the scope they were trying to accomplish, but honestly I would have been much more satisfied with a game that had been a bit smaller in scope, but more fleshed out in relevant aspects.

The first thing that I noticed when I started the game was voice acting, which is done really well! Except for the fact that only some characters seem to have it, and only during certain lines? I found it completely jarring to hear the voice of a relevant character speaking in one scene, just to have it cut out in another dialogue, and sometimes interacting with characters that don't speak at all?? It tore my attention away at important moments, because I couldn't help but laugh at the deafening silence in response to the crew.

The second thing is combat. Holy HELL is that UI unintuitive. It took me quite a few combats to fully understand how everything was supposed to run, but even then, I didn't really feel like there were stakes in combat. The battle scars (I forget the in-game term) are just kind of annoying in my opinion, and I honestly just didn't have fun going through combat, because even if I tried to spice it up by using interactables or other environmental factors, I didn't feel like they had any real effect unless it's something so overwhelming that combat lasts 2 rounds. 

Characters and story were fine for the most part, I was able to get at least partially invested in the characters, but (and again I know its unfair) BG3 was able to immerse me in the characters and story in a way this game really couldn't.

I had quite a few people tell me how amazing this game is, and quite honestly it just couldn't meet any of the expectations I had. If you really enjoy warhammer then feel free to give it a try, and I hope it provides for you what it couldn't for me.

I haven't gotten very far into chapter 3 yet, which I have seen some less than glowing reviews of... instead moving to a second playthrough. I've enjoyed what I've experienced so far, however.

I may write a more detailed review later, but I really really hope they make more games like this in the future. I'm new to the Warhammer universe, but this game is amazing and has me interested more than ever.

I also can't help but love how ridiculously callous and harsh you can be in this game. Some of the dialogue choices are just so hostile, and I love it. (I enjoy playing characters that randomly swap between compassionate and reasonable, to unhinged and spiteful at any given moment. So the more extreme the interactions, the more I feel like my character is an unstable lunatic. XD)

They added quite a few dialogue interactions too, and while they don't feel all that impactful to the overarching story path... they do feel like they give genuinely unique reactions and dialogue in return. You are occasionally railroaded into making specific choices, but for the most part it feels satisfying.

While I don't specifically like being an asshole in games, I like being given the choice. Especially if the character deserves it... and let me tell you, some of these Warhammer universe characters really deserve it.

So far my biggest complaint... and I hope they fix this... because omg.
The game is buggier than hell. So much of the game is broken, or breaks... a lot of it creates frustration, missing dialogue, or just outright breaks quests or blocks progress. It's frustrating, and detracts from the game in a big way. If you aren't as patient and tolerant of game breaking bugs, or just bugs in general... I'd say wait for a sale, or give it some time to get itself sorted out. (Hopefully it does!)

First of, I never encountered any game breaking bugs. I just went through the whole game picking options I thought fit, and everything worked for me. There may have been some wonky skill issues, however I didn't notice anything. Many people have complained about these, but I didn't see it.

Second, this game is FANTASTIC. It blends the heavy role playing of Owlcats other cRPGs, with an interesting turn based combat reminiscent of xCOM. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the game. I felt combats were all interesting, and some with the little quirks to break up just shooting everything. I really liked space combat and struggle to see why people don't like it. Is quick, and a lot more enjoyable than army combats (which I also liked, but thought were too trivial). It requires thinking and planning ahead for manoevers, and that made it interesting.

Third, the companions in general are great. I liked their stories, even if some of the characterisation was weird and they flipped morals occasionally.

Fourth, I love 40k which helps. But the theme and art of the entire game is awesome. I love the grim dark and it really shines through in this game, and if you delve into the lore points can really get into the nitty gritty.

Now it isn't all upsides. I had some issues with the game, Gear and cargo was my main complaint - a lot of gear was useless for the majority of the game. And once you settled on a build, technically better weapons would be worse due to talents or restrictions.

Do I wish there was more companions, or choices. Sure, but no game is perfect. As it stands I think the game is great and if you like cRPGs or just 40k in general I would buy this game. Even at release price (which I paid) I think the game is worth it, and now looking to run again with an entirely different build, and chocies.",1705675431,1705675431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For the most part, I really got into this game.

This was a little bit of a surprise. I'd only bought the game because of great reviews from people I trust, I didn't have any pre-existing interest in the Warhammer universe or lore, am often not a great player of sci-fi games, and am not the greatest lover of complex, min-maxy RPG systems of the type that Owlcat are known for. Couldn't get into WOTR because I got frustrated with janky systems before I could get into the characters and lore.

And yet it absolutely, 100%, got me. The world is interesting, the characters are well-written, the combat is engaging and the learning curve around the combat systems isn't unsurmountable. These are characters I want to spend a lot more time with. i smashed out 30 hours really quickly because I didn't want to put the game down. It's something that I really wanted to - and still might - do multiple playthroughs of.

There is one big caveat, though, which has slowed my playthrough down to a crawl, and that's the loading screens in space travel in Chapter 3. I am not someone who generally cares much about modern-day quick loading screens. A lot of people whinged about it in Starfield, and I didn't care at all. The Rogue Trader loading screens are much, much worse - they're considerably slower in a way that I haven't really seen in a game in a few years, and there are a lot of them. This combines with the game's no-fast-travel-on-land rule to make travelling interminable - if you want to get from some buildings in Footfall to, say, the main building on Kiava Gamma, you could easily have something like 10 long loading screens - and that's if there isn't a warp event (or two, or three) that pulls you back to the ship and throws in another two or three long loading screens each time.

It isn't helped by the introduction of ship combat at the same time, which unlike land combat is slow and tedious and needs a rework, particularly the stage before you've had a chance to upgrade your ship. It was a battle to not go to sleep in some of the larger ship fights before I got ship upgrades that allowed my ship to turn easier and do more damage.

This causes Chapter 3 to slow to an absolute crawl, because the actual lore and encounters and exploring and land combat is great and I wanted to see it....but it just took so long staring at long loading screens that it continually just pulled me out of the game. I'll finish the game sooner or later, and I really do recommend it - but i hope they try to do something about the amount and length of loading screens, drop their opposition to on-land fast travel (because it makes the loading screen issues so much worse), and fundamentally rework space combat, particularly in the early pre-upgrade stages in which it's an absolute snoozefest.",1705671889,1705672018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is not perfect - but no game is.  The game is not for everyone - but no game is.  Chaos Gate Daemonhunters is my favorite game, and Rogue Trader is not, but that is not Owlcat's fault, just my personal preference.

However, I do think this game delivers the 40k universe VERY WELL - it has detail, breadth, and many choices for you to make - and so I am happy with this game and to recommend it.

One GREAT feature I want to call out:  superior combat difficulty settings (there are about 30) that you can change at ANY TIME outside of combat.  Feel the enemy has too much HP?  Reduce it.  Cover bonus not good enough? Boost it.
One feature I would like to see improved is the camera, which needs to be able to Zoom Out more, so I can see more of the map during battles. 
BUGS?  so far I have encountered only one UI bug (it has happened twice), and all I had to do was save game, back out to main menu, and load game again.  No progress loss.  It is possible there are other small game rule bugs (skills not working as intended) in combat, but with such a complicated system, I can't tell for sure.
GLHF

Update after completing Chapter 3:
Chapter 1 & 2 are a great game.
Chapter 3 is a tedious, buggy/poorly designed mess.  Clearly Owlcat put all  of their pre-release effort into the first two chapters.  So, for normal gamers looking for fun - beware!

Update after completing Chapter 4:
As far as story progression goes, I think chapters 3 & 4 are less buggy than they appear.  The issue is that the story elements get more complicated, but the game does not improve in the way of communicating this to the player, leaving you to feel that you can't progress the story, or reach a part of the map behind a wall, or complete a side quest, because it is a bug, when really it's because you have not talked to the right npc or failed a required check, or need to go somewhere else and come back.  It would really benefit Owlcat's reputation if they invested in ensuring that the player can always figure out what needs to be done next, instead of leaving it to random answers in forums and game hacks to help players progress.  Frustrated players = bad reviews and bad reputation for Owlcat and their games.
Update after finishing the game:  ugh, I am so glad it is over.  They should have removed chapters 3 & 5, improved chapter 4 to the quality of chapter 1 & 2.   This game needs less quantity, more quality.  Much of that is due to the RT RPG system, which gets more tedious and repetitive the longer it goes on.",1702081912,1705643853,True,56,2,0.670563280582427979,3,True,False,False

As of this review:
1 playthrough complete on Daring*
130 hours

This is, hands-down, the best game to experience a good portion of the 40K lore IMO. I also enjoyed being able to deviate from the dogmatic path, embracing a 21st century mentality of human decency, a sentiment unafforded in the 40k universe. Each character (that I unlocked) allowed me to experience a rich history. And some of the plot resolutions were jaw-dropping. Be prepared to read and fight a lot; the game is half novel / half combat.

That being said:

[b]Bugs[/b]

The game was a buggy mess at times, especially at launch. But the devs responded to most of the bugs reported. I still had several graphical glitches even after a slew of patches all the way until the end of the game.

[b]Difficulty[/b]

I played the vast majority of the game on Daring. I consider myself an experienced role player but not with the Rogue Trader TTRPG. Most of the game was fairly well balanced until I entered a boss fight. That is when the game felt like a Souls boss fight, and it took me several tries to take down a boss after finally understanding the boss mechanics/gimmicks. That whole experience was rather rewarding once I changed my perspective at the end of Chapter 1.

*The only boss fight that made be take a break for a few days was the Chapter 4 final boss fight. After 16 hours of trial/error/failure/chagrin, I set it to Normal to finish phase 1 of the fight. It is the only fight the entire game that broke me from finishing it on Daring. Those 16 hours of stressing over strategy, placement, skills, equipment, etc. could not prevent my team from being one-shot in round 1 or, by some miracle, in round 2. Even playing on Normal, half my team went down. Phase two of that fight was a joke in comparison to the first half. And I played the rest of the game on Daring all the way until the end.

How to overcome this issue on your playthrough?
[olist][*] Manually save before going on an away mission. This way, you can respec as needed for the mission or change out your team for a skill set that matches what you are experiencing. this may mean running around for other quests to level up.
[*] Be prepared to try at a fight several times to understand it.
[*] Read the talents the enemy has, and play to them.[/olist]

This game is excellent - good writing that pulls you into the 40k universe, interesting characters, tense decisions, and a good balance between combat & dialogue/exploration. The combat itself is also a lot of fun, giving you lots of opportunity to figure out how to use your characters abilities most effectively & adapt to the situation- this is supported by character progression and gear choices which give you a lot of different ways to optimize you characters and combine their strengths.

There are, apparently, still a fair number of bugs at time of writing- I have not encountered any that had any serious impact on the story (softlocking quests etc) that some players have reported, only minor ones of specific gear/talents etc not working exactly like they're supposed to. I haven't found it intrusive, but the devs also seem to be releasing bug fix patches pretty rapidly, so hopefully the more critical ones will be dealt with shortly anyway. I am 56 hours in and just about to finish Act 2, so if there are bugs later on in the story they will probably be fixed by the time you get there :)

Edit: I have now completed the game, nearly 100 hours in- I think it is extremely good, but the highlight definitely becomes the writing.

 I played on normal/default difficulty, and for the later acts found that combining solider/arch militant with few officers meant that I could pump out truly absurd damage, and many fights were effectively or literally over before the enemy could do anything to me. I still found it fun to execute the combo & figure out the most efficient ways to do things, but combat was not particularly tense at any point after acts 2-3.

However, the writing is very engaging, and they stick the landing with some really excellent conclusions to companion questlines. [spoiler] Pasqal [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Ulfar [/spoiler] are personal favorites, the former for being a really cool way to build on existing 40k lore & some fun metatextual symbolism/jokes, and the latter for just being extremely fun execution of a straightforward concept. The central plot also has some really high notes and ends with a flourish, with (at least for me) a great balance of foreshadowing and sudden reveal of how things interconnect. I think the core stories & the overall tone and attention to detail in the writing make this game very fun for both 40k lore buffs and newcomers alike.

I ran into exactly one ""important"" bug, which did lock me out of completing one of my companions quests, though I didn't mind too much (I had been increasingly apprehensive regarding the character & where I thought there story was going, so I decided my rogue trader simply decided not to help them out), but I didn't encounter this until I was ~ 80 hours in, so given how fast they are putting out patches it will probably be addressed before new players can encounter it. The other bugs I ran into were random abilities or items not working as intended, and I never found it particularly impacted my experience, but be aware there are still plenty of those if that will bother you.",1703196396,1705634684,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I do have some complaints. 

   -The foremost is that [Spoiler]Heinrix[/spoiler] can only be romanced by a female mc. I became instantly attached to this character and it was a huge let down. 
   -Combat can be extremely tedious. Most characters can preform MANY actions in a turn. *This can become combersome in solo play, but I would actually list this as a positive for multiplayer. When each character in the party is controlled by a different player, it is easy to feel accomplished with you turn, without being overwhelmed with learning the actions of every single character.  
   -A lot of abilities really need to have their descriptions clarified/cleaned up.
   -Lastly, there is a LOOOOOOOOT of reading. Obviously this could be negligible to those who don't mind reading. As a slow reader myself, I don't exactly mind but it seems like a core chunk of game time is spent reading. I'm left to wonder how much shorter this game would feel if it had more voiceover.


All  that said, this game is really really good. I personally love the large number of game actions and have built my mc to [Spoiler]buff/heal my other party members and give them extra actions/whole turns.[/spoiler] However, I am playing multiplayer and don't enjoy playing games solo. 

The story is actually really interesting. Much much better than BG3 in my opinion, and I'm typically a much bigger fan of fantasy. I can see that Owlcat has learned a lot from their digital Pathfinder games and I am glad to see them improve upon their formula with Rogue trader. I can't wait to see what they do in the future and would love to see a game based on the other factions in this universe. The imperium is hands down my least favorite factions in this entire universe. I dislike that an overwhelming majority of 40k games seem to be centered on them.

This developer has become too adept at combining worldclass writing with terrible gameplay. I'm not even talking about the bugs, which I'm sure will be ironed out over time, but when you have an RPG that makes me, the player, straight up groan with preemptive weariness at levelling up, there's something seriously wrong. Level-up should be a time of joy, but no so in Rogue Trader, because in this game, you end up looking over the same list of talents, most of which only marginally improves your build, trying to remember what they do and getting a headache from reading these unhinged descriptions, like 'reduce -(greater between PER or INT bonus + 2 x number of stacks)% armour'. Sure, I can parse it out by referring to my character's attributes and come up with the number, but once you've done this for 6 different talents, any spark of happiness that such a buff would provide me is long since gone. To make matters worse, you level up A LOT, so get ready to experience this mindnumbing process again and again and again.

There are many positive aspects to this game, but, unlike Wrath of the Righteous, the frustration of the gameplay is too difficult to ignore. It's a shame, because there could be a really great story hidden underneath. I dearly wish for Owlcat to rethink their design philosophy; sometimes, less is more.

For the first time in over 30 years playing video games, I had to stop playing one due to bugs. Rogue Trader's Act IV is [i]completely[/i] broken, to the point of having one of your companions go missing, no quest being activated, and you being left with no way to recover them. [i]Game Over[/i].

I get that these games by Owlcat are extremely complex, that thousands of bugs will show up during development, but why the f*ck do they release a game in this state as ""finished?"" This is [i]clearly[/i] still in early access, with some 6 months to go until the game is actually playable (assuming they keep working diligently to fix it).

There are instructions in-game on ""how to properly report a bug"" and an interface to do so. And that means Owlcat's intention is for the players who [i]paid them[/i] to [i]work for them[/i] for free. I've filed some 20 bug reports myself, trying to help, but once it became obvious they are fully aware of how broken some parts of the game are, and deliberately released it in this state, I felt like an idiot. [i]F*ck these guys[/i].

The game, so far as it works, is great. But thanks to Owlcat's clearly ill-intentioned behavior, I'm not sure I'll be buying anything from them again in the future.

That was the main issue -- the game is [i]very[/i] broken at the moment, perhaps even ""unfinishable."" I've seen several other people besides myself who have stopped playing it, at least for the time being, due to the enormous amount of bugs.

Wait some 6 months before you get this.


Now, I'd usually describe the game in details but, since the bugs question supersedes everything else, I won't bother. But I will tell you what I believe is [i]the[/i] most important thing about Rogue Trader, when compared to Owlcat's previous Pathfinder titles:

The game is essentially D&D, but without spells that require resting to recharge and only 100-sided dices. So, the most horrible and annoying thing from D&D has been removed, and all dice rolls have become intuitive, easy-to-understand percentages. You are also fully healed after each battle (but your characters can suffer Wounds and Traumas) and Medkits heal a fixed amount of HP.

You still have to save-scum a lot. [b]A LOT[/b]. Because activating stuff, opening chests, disarming traps, etc. are still RNG-based. Still, those changes are enough to make playing Rogue Trader a [i]much[/i] better experience than playing any other D&D-based game.

As usual, though, the game starts off pretty difficult and, after the first half of it or so, it becomes extremely easy. You start winning most fights without losing a single HP (and I played on Very Hard). So... we have some heavy balance issues here. And when the challenge goes to the Warp, the fun goes along.

Again: wait some 6 months, then come back to this game. Perhaps they'll have fixed all the major bugs [i]and[/i] done some proper rebalancing by then.",1703259968,1705529548,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OK, so I was one of the guys who laughed at the comparison of RT with BG3 and was somewhat vocal about that. Having spent some quality time with both games now I feel like I owe a kind of an apology to Owlcat Games. So I'm writing this review with my thoughts on why Rogue Trader is right there in the League of RPG GOATs.

An important note: I only write reviews on games that I've completed at least once, so that I know what I'm talking about. 

SO. Rogue Trader is a turn-based party RPG set in the grim darkness of the far future of Warhammer 40000. You play as a (unexpectedly!) Rogue Trader -- a mighty space explorer prince of the Imperium of humanity with a divine pact to boldly go where common people are forbidden even to look. You have a mighty and ancient spaceship, a retinue of outstanding individuals and also a small personal empire of several planets. Things aren't going so well in your domain, besieged on all sides by aggressive aliens, bandits, intriguing nobles, rival traders, religious fanatics, rebels, cultists and... well, demons. And you are the one who will have to sort out this mess (or die trying). Welcome to 40K!

[b] Gameplay [/b]
So the game itself consists of:
- Traveling through various locations and interacting with different characters 40%
- Turn-based combat on above mentioned locations 40%
- Exploring space, star systems and scanning planets 5%
- Turn-based spaceship combat 5%
- Colony management 5%
- Text-based events (where you see pictures, read texts and make choices) 5%

In its core the game is a classic RPG experience where you have to explore, talk to people and fight. Everything else is just a side bonus for the main course. 

[b] Why is it so good? [/b]
Sometime ago there was a discussion among game developers that with the release of BG3 the ""RPG genre is dead"". Because no one can match Larian's team size, budget or time allocated to production. I was infuriated by this discussion, because for me it is obviously wrong and the solution is not to try and match Larian resources but to focus on a certain topic and details. To go deeper not wider. And Owlcat Games did just that. They've chosen 40K, specifically Rogue Trader story and poured all their resources and talent into bringing that grim and dark world to life. And it worked. Even though the locations are not that big and the number of characters is far less than in BG3 they manage to create the atmosphere of the 40K. The texts are brilliant. NPCs feel like real people -- both those who can join your party and those you interact with. They have their own ideas, ideals, agendas and motivations. Every single character action made sense to me. Either loyal to the bone soldier, religious fanatic, or maniacal alien killer -- I understood their motivations and [i] believed [/i] in them. This game [i] feels [/i] real.

I love Larian (I own every single of their games since the very first Divinity). But their “signature humor” spoiled my fun innumerable times. Let me explain. Say you play a tabletop RPG. And you want to tell a story about a dark and epic adventure. Yet there’s that one player at the table who is unable to not crack dad and toilet jokes and perform stupid out-of-character action during key scenes. And it's fine as a style of playing, some groups enjoy it but in this case it simply ruins the fun for those who want dark and epic. Now imagine that this player is a DM. Yeah. Larian does a lot of that. Owlcat -- does not. And I love them for that. Mind me there are a lot of humor and jokes in the game but they all are in-world and do not ruin the atmosphere. 

So [h1]  for me [/h1] Rogue Trader [/h1] [b] is great and better than Baldur’s Gate 3 because of [/b] its Atmosphere, Story, beliavable Characters and great Texts.

Also romances in this game are REALLY good. They too feel real and mature, not like the teenage movie fantasy we get in [strike] Baldur’s Gate 3 unless Lae'zel [/strike] some other games.

[b] What about combat? [/b]
Combat is a huge part of the game. As I understand the game systems are somewhat based on Rogue Trader RPG from Fantasy Flight Games, hence most of its core strengths and weaknesses are rooted there. It’s d100 at its core. The number of classes and abilities is huge and allows you to build very different characters with very different ways to kill things. I’d say that there are a bit TOO many choices, some of them obviously better than others. It can become pretty boring to read through all abilities, skills etc and compare them. Especially since you have to level-up six characters simultaneously. On the other hand it can be very rewarding if you’re into that stuff. The core principle is very simple -- you have to debuff enemies and buff friends as hard as you can. Without these damage dealers do like 5 damage. With these they can do 30 to 150+. What is important in my opinion is that combat feels visceral and satisfying. Also for players who like to focus on the story there’s an easy mode and for those who really like to push to the limits there’s hard mode. 

[b] And the auxiliary systems? Space exploration and combat, resource and colony management? [/b]
They are fine. Feels like pleasant additional mini-games.

[b] But there are flaws, right? [/b]
Yes there are flaws in this game. In my opinion they are easy to fix and will be addressed pretty soon.

The biggest problem that I’ve encountered is the camera moving back over the character after each ability usage in combat. As I’ve said before, this game is about stacking debuffs on your enemies. My main character was a sniper so the necessity to scroll over the enemy on the other side of the map, debuff him and then having to scroll all the way back to him to debuff him more or shoot was really annoying. This is easily fixed by adding an option to not move the camera back on character after using his/her ability.

The second biggest problem for me was that by the end of the game there seems to be too many different choices made and the game kind of struggles to keep track of all of them and react accordingly. I’ve had instances of dialogs with dead party members, dialog choices that immediately skipped the quest and some contradicting outcomes in the epilogue (one part saying that something was short lived and another saying that it lasted for hundreds of years). I was able to finish the game and most of the interactions were smooth though.

Acts 4 and 5 obviously received way less attention at this point (btw the same was true for BG3 at the date of their release). Less polished interactions, bugs with several side quests etc. For example I couldn’t complete the side quest for Inquisition acolyte and didn’t get a reward and/or acknowledgement for hunting down and destroying the legendary pirate captain. Again this is something that will obviously be addressed as they update the game.

Also even though I played the game thoroughly I could only max out reputation with one faction and couldn’t reach the maximum character level. Maybe that was the developers intention but it feels more like they are planning to add several more expansions that will allow you to get way more resources and experience. 

The icons are not drawn for each ability in this game atm which looks like a bug and is hilarious. You have just capital letters instead of icons for a lot of abilities. Hopefully this will be slowly fixed as they update the game. 

[b] That was one long review! [/b]
Yeah. I’m kind of amazed you’ve read all of that. Thanks!

To sum it all up: [h1] Rogue Trader is a beautiful and mature grimdark RPG with a great story, great characters and deeply satisfying visceral combat. [h1]

Highly recommended to all fans of turn-based RPGs!",1705503051,1705503051,True,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed this game very much - including difficulty spike from Act 3 and while it worked it was really nice journey.
Excluding huge amount of still persisting bugs and problems - game was astonishingly good and fresh experience. Entirely different leveling and battle mechanics actually is interesting even (or maybe because) it feels so incredibly broken. It is hard to say at any given moment if something happened because of the broken mechanics, or it is a bug, or game working as intended. As example - you can pass some incredibly restricting skill checks or miss some very easy ones. On one level all skill checks are easy and on another they all insanely hard. Sometimes you can pass them with any character and sometimes only with main. Most fights are actually very easy but sometimes they can have some trick behind boss or they can be actually challenging. Because of that game is really unpredictable but interesting.
But anyway - game is great, have a plenty of memorable companions and actually interesting story, plenty opportunities for role-playing and I can recommend it to anyone who loves cRPGs. Ending slides was really extensive and touching with some unpredictable outcomes here and there. Still I was really happy to know all consequences of my choices through game (angry look at BG3 here). 

As always Owlcat made really good game, but even as they known for messy releases - this was worst of their releases. I hope they will change this tactics because clearly community is fed up by this and they suffer some financial damage because of this. Plenty of people decided to buy this and next game only after year and on sales. I'm sure it is a bad decision because clearly Owlcats will have less money for next project but also Owlcats kinda made this situation themselves.

Anyway hope to see DLCs and sequel in few years. WH universe deserve more great RPGs like this.",1702019865,1705500107,True,0,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

I've definitely gotten my money's worth from other Owlcat games, and after playing Rogue Trader for 245 hours, I feel the same about this one.

There have been a few bugs that messed up some missions, and in my first playthrough, I missed out on a potential colony. But overall, the good parts of the game outweigh the bad. There aren't many good turn-based RPGs out there, so your options are limited anyway.

Here's what I liked and didn't like about the game:

Pros:
+ The storytelling is good.
+ The world building is interesting.
+ Normal difficulty is pretty forgiving, so you don't need to min/max to enjoy the game.
+ There's no army/kingdom management like in the Pathfinder games. You can take your time, which is a nice change.

Neutral:
+/- The game can be easy to exploit, making even the harder difficulties manageable. Psykers and navigators are really powerful, especially with officers. But this only becomes clear if you focus on powering up from the start instead of enjoying the story.
+/- Chapter 3 changes the game's pace a lot. Owlcat has done this before, so it wasn't a total surprise. It didn't bother me much in my second playthrough.

Cons:
- Ship battles are slow and sometimes too hard.
- Some achievements are really hard to get, like the 20 trade missions.
- You can't change some companions' builds. Baldur's Gate 3 does this better by allowing full respecs.
- It's very hard to fully align as dogmatic/heretical/etc. You often have to stick to specific choices for the entire 140-hour campaign. Plus, a normal-looking text line might lead to a hidden alignment choice, so you might end up reloading conversations to get alignment points.

Overall, Rogue Trader is worth buying. If you can handle a few bugs, the role-playing experience is as good as it gets. Most of the major game-breaking bugs have been fixed. If you do encounter a serious bug, there's a mod tool called ToyBox that can fix almost any issue, but it takes a bit of getting used to.

Act 1, Act 2 are amazing.
Act 3, the escape from hell chapter is great.

Act 4,5, hmmm....it is still playable and fun for 1st playthrough.
it could be better once bugs are being fixed.

Companions are not as interactive as WOTR, quite bland as compared with WOTR when it comes to their story writings. character development and impact on your playthrough.
most of the time, they dont react to any of your decision except for few decisive moments.
There is no option/choice that will change the character like how they did in WOTR's companions.

Conviction points given should be increased, certain choices will not appear unless you go full heretic/dogmatic/ iconoclast for the whole playthrough. so to unlock certain choices, you are forced to go extreme and stick to 1 conviction the whole game.

 Why I say that ? Because the main attractive of this game is how deep it goes into the lore and build up of the things you cross path with. There is moments where the game is so overwhelming with information that makes me happy that I don't need to check the extra lore content the game offers (yes, you can read a huge in depth guide of wh40k in game if necessary), making the experience more base around just playing the game instead of trying to understand the consequences of my actions, why ?
 
 Gameplay is something that doesn't stay too far from any previous CRPG, but with the Wh40k universe, things can't be that simple. The extermination of civilians, attacking innocent alien species or killing a companion which sounds bad on paper, actually are good things in the Warhammer universe, which makes the game really interesting since, you know the consequences of keeping alive civilians that got in contact with heretic materials, and exterminating them is the right thing to do. This is what makes Rogue Trader so interesting, the constant fight on what in the real world would be something bad compared to what would happen in lore
 In the other hand, there is a in depth build of the universe in which we have to travel, explore, conquer and even administrate since we can have our own planetS that will give us resources for our trips

overall, the game's a 3.5

+ Great Maps
+ Good story from Chapters 1-2. After that it seems to lose track of what the main plot of the story is.
+ good blend of game play elements from Colony management to RPG leveling
- lack luster character models
- bugs & glitches
- unfinished models
- buggy cutscenes
- some quests bugged
- unimpressive and buggy combat effects

the story and lore building of RT is great expansion to the 40k universe. It's great having a story that doesn't just revolve around space marines fighting the enemies of the imperium.

That said: the game is still full of some technical issues ranging from unfinished textures, T-posed models, freezing cutscenes, misspellings in dialogue, lack luster combat effects, and a lack of detail on the character models.

The game overall is not bad. There's some dialogue, but not in every event. Mostly in general crew conversations, first time encounters and key events.
The maps are gorgeously detailed from xenos ruins, fauna & flora agri-worlds, to gothic architecture ship interiors.
The character models are disappointing. You can zoom in but not enough too really see whose who. The most part, the models are so much a like the npcs, it's near difficult figuring out where your guys are without getting them in a crossfire. I actually had a moment where I thought one of my guys was the enemy, b/c the lighting of the map was so poor.
the character portraits are amazing and detailed. But they juxtapose the actual characters on the game map. There's not enough geometry to the models or their texture tones are to dark at times.

there's some space combat, but it's nothing like Battlefleet gothic per say. it's kinda like how Sid Meier's Beyond Earth did their Space expansion.",1704586310,1705459081,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an amazing narrative within the bounds of combat/technique heavy source material (much like their Pathfinder titles).

If you can bear it, I'd recommend waiting a few months after release to purchase Rogue Trader, hopefully the bugs will have been hammered out by then. But if not, the ToyBox mod can be a real lifesaver if bugs break your game.

I'll admit to being a long time fan of Warhammer media, and it took me 80 hours to finish the game from beginning to end, so I have a lot of thoughts on different aspects of the game, in rough order of best to worst:

The setting: There are a lot of games that are set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, but I can't think of one that does a better job representing the setting than Rogue Trader. The Rogue Trader character has a special perspective in the 40k universe, being able to journey far and wide with a great deal of freedom, while still being integrated into human society. The game takes full advantage of this perspective, and lets you see the dirty underside of space stations, distant xenos worlds of countless varieties, space-faring noble courts, planet sized factories, etc. While Rogue Trader is an RPG with a primary focus on fighting and violence, I appreciated the constant little snapshots of day to day life in the Imperium, whether it's the families that toil from generation to generation inside your city-sized space ship, or the pagan cultists who worship their alien forest. There is a huge breadth in the game, and lots of good writing within that breadth. Great stuff.

The gameplay: This is an RPG, and what will make or break it is the combat mechanics. Overall I enjoyed the game's combat a lot. The level up system is pretty complicated, however, to the point of being overwhelming. The game maxes out at level 55, you have 10 or so characters to level up, and each level lets you pick from a pool of ~30 feats. I found myself delaying level ups because I didn't want to think about what to pick. The choices _really_ do matter. Nestled away in each character archetype are some very powerful builds, and the higher difficulty settings (I played on Daring) expect you to have found those builds by the end of the game. But once you've put together a few very strong characters it feels very good. I was excited each time I got more items, new things that my companions could use. And don't worry too much if you mess up your build, respeccing is (nearly) free.

The game keeps a steady stream of new enemies coming, with new special feats and quirks, so I had to shift strategies around for each one, at least until my characters were so strong I didn't usually have to think about strategy. I'm not the biggest fan of a game that is built around certain optimized strategies that are orders of magnitude stronger than the simpler builds (my preference in games is for it to follow the 80-20 rule for optimization), but I felt rewarded for being smart about the game, which is plenty good already.

I also thought the early game was a little heavy on the 'ambushed by 30 filthy pirates' scenes.

Characters: I liked the stories of some characters a lot (Ulfar, Pasqual, Idira), others less so (Heinrix, Jae, Argenta). The companions are each a good mix of what you'd expect from that type of character, with a couple curveballs mixed in (the taciturn navy officer with a love of family, the unsanctioned psyker wracked by fears of her power, the aloof Aeldari frustrated with her own people). The individual stories and missions of each character could have been fleshed out a bit more, in my opinion. Each character has around 2 small quests associated with them, I thought there should have been more to supplement that, maybe just more dialogue. The characters are also not terribly dynamic. They don't react to a lot of what you've done, which I'm told is very noticeable in the 'evil' run.

Overworld Mechanics: The game lets you explore the universe on your ship, and found/develop planetary colonies. This is obviously not the core focus of the game, but I wish it had been bulked up more because what is there is fun. It adds a lot to the worldbuilding (hah) to see your planets develop. I know it wouldn't sell well, but a 40k SimCity type game would be loads of fun for me, if no one else. Exploration is also pretty good, but I also wish there were more of it. More planets, more ship combat, more space weirdness. Please and thank you.

Some of the high level game stats (alignment, faction reputation) are a bit messed up right now, where it is difficult/impossible to max them out. I'm told they've already updated the game to give you more options to increase these values, I may have just gotten in too early. More evidence that it is worth waiting (or using ToyBox)!

Main story: The main story starts very strong, but spreads itself thin by the middle act. You face off against too many enemies at once, and it's all tied together in an unsatisfying way at the end. The enemies have a 'villain of the week' feel to them sometimes, there's no consistent antagonist, after the first act it's just one big bad to smash through after another, without sufficient buildup. I'd say on average you get two scenes with the villain of each act before killing them. For a game this big, it doesn't feel good. Also, the ending scenes themselves are all over the place.

Bugs: BUGS! Too many of them. I was spared anything truly game breaking, but I had one quest glitch out (that I could fix with ToyBox) and a ton of visual bugs. When a game is this buggy you also lose a bit of trust you have with it. Am I missing something in this quest, and I need to think more, or am I just stuck because it's broken? I really hope this improves with time.

Overall, I had a very good time. As it stands, this is the best 40k game I've played, and that's in spite of some easily fixable problems. The deeper issues (the main story, certain character arcs) are taunting, hinting that there is an even better Rogue Trader game within reach... but not here. And yet I am content.",1705274250,1705434290,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Really fun gameplay
- Finally a crpg in warhammer 40k universe
- Good Replayability due to different routes and possible builds
- Nice work on the part of voice actors when its voiced
- this time, the ""World Map"" mecanics are ok (you know what i mean if you played other owlcat games)
Cons
- Owcat game, so polished first acts messy on the later part, its getting fixed bit by bit, so far in act IV havent had any run breaking bugs, thou quite a few graphical ones, a few broken interactions in teh later part of the game, some weird checks not working with the proper party member.
- This is personal opinion but rather than making iconoclast a ""good"" person i would have just writen it as a outof the box thinker, too good in 40k feels weird for the setting.
- Heretical should straing up being deemed heretical by dogmatic companions, come on we have an inquisitor and a sororitas, tehy would shoot you just out of suspicion.
-Heretical should corrupt companions, at least the ones that dont mind you are heretical

The powers and abilities make almost no sense and require far to much reading to even begin to figure out how any of these bonus stack with each other. The difficulty spike after the first few chapters is insane and just leads to frustration with zero hope of ever beating some battles. For instance a random void ship lets you get to the end and then you are foreced to back track out and you have to deal with a bunch of over powered servitors and corrupt tech priests which is fine but there's these speakers on the wall that buff the enemy 30+ extra wounds every turn. Keep in mind there is multiple of these speakers and not only do they buff the enemies inside the room they also buff themselves and the other speakers making it almost impossible to take down 1 speaker before the party is wiped by all the other enemies. These speakers also seem to have unlimited range are located high on a wall so only ranged attacks can damage them. My party is mostly melee so I'm basically SOL. After several attempts I beat the first room that only had to speakers just to enter the next room that had 4 speakers and double the enemies. I lost a few hours and had to load a far back previous save. IDK if this is supposed to be end game content but with zero warning and a crazy difficulty spike has me questioning my purchase and if I care enough to play anymore. Yes game requires lots of reading and is very story driven and lore heavy which doesn't bother me but basically the game feels very unfair unless you know exactly what your fighting and build the perfect team to take it down. BG3 on tactician has nothing that unfair compared to that room with the speakers.,1705426948,1705426948,False,2,0,0.501622974872589111,0,True,False,False

At the moment i am writing this review, a month after the games release. Half of the combat talents in the game are still bugged or do not work entirely. Acts 4-5 still have run-ending bugs that can stop your quest progress. But besides all of that. 

This game just feels like no effort was put into it. Its combat system is unbalanced and seems like noone ever tested it. The entire game can be cleared with any damage dealer + officer combo. The game past Act-2 turns into rocket-tag. Pray that you get initiative first and kill all enemies in one turn, or enemies will kill you in one turn. Things like the cover system start not mattering because the enemies have their stats jacked up so high, they can one shot you through cover. The only way you can consistently survive is either playing rocket tag, or buffing everyones evasion and hoping to god the enemy doesnt hit.

The colony system is unfinished. Half of the events in the colony screen do not work, building up various resources and projects in the colonies feels completely detached from the main game. In the end, despite the colonies being ""unique"", they are less interesting and less well integrated into the game than Kingmaker or WotR settlements. They are also bugged and do not consume resources half the time, or other times, double your resources for seemingly no reason. When i started Act 4, i could build every building with no wait times or resource requirements on every planet. 

The map exploration is unfinished. Enemy space encounters do not tell what you are going to face, at all. So you have to quicksave/load before every space encounter. There are some unique space encounters that give text to what is happening, and in the end give you nothing special as a reward. There are some trading encounters that can result in you trading your resources and getting nothing. Some encounters imply that they are repeatable, but they are not. The map itself is unfinished too, the map does not tell you what planets you have visited or not, does not tell you where you have claimed resources. It tells you nothing.

At the same time, because the rumour log doesnt work, your map can be quickly filled with various area markers despite you finishing the rumour in question. Oh yeah, the rumour log acts like a mini-quest log in essence, but half the time it doesnt work, it does not react to what you have finished or not. In the game you can also have rumours around your character, not only are they pitiful in number, they have no meaning in the game. 

Space combat, while enjoyable is also clearly unfinished. If you equip two weapons of the same type on the front of your ship, they will share cooldown. Nothing in the game says thats how it should work, but it does. If enemy reinforcements spawn during encounters, they always teleport into combat near your ship and instantly get a turn to act, thus damaging your ship no matter what you do. The same applies to any combat encounter in the game, for most space encounters, the enemy will not only act first, they will also be capable to do damage at the same time. One can get a ship skill that stops that from happening. But that ship skill can only be accessed when your space combat level is HALF of the max achievable level.

Some companions like the Space Marine companion Ulfar are unfinished. Not only does Ulfar not have a proper build (His build is literally just every reccomended perk taken on level up), he barely has any equipment for himself, he does not even have items for some slots. He is also a 2x2 companion in a 1x1 grid game. And the game maps were never designed for 2x2 characters. He can get stuck on his own personal quest mission, because there is impassibble terain for him there. His main charge ability is also bugged.

The story also takes a sharp dive in quality in Act4 and later. Your choices stop mattering, you are rail-roaded, literally rail-roaded into opposing the Inquisitor character. There are barely any quests in this Act. The game also reveals to lack a central villain, you meet and fight multiple characters that you met ONCE, as if they were some kind of ""bosses"" for you to overcome. The story completely and utterly falls apart here.

Same goes for the games endings. Besides most of them being bugged, Owlcat wrote all of the endings in a ""Grimderp"" way. Most endings are tragic in some way or another, even if it means ignoring the story itself to do so. For example, if one romances the Aeldari companion, the ending slides state that after decades of searching for a new spirit stone, the Aeldari visits your character on their death bed. This Grimderp ending ignores that Rogue Traders can live for centuries with Rejuvena treatments, the fact that we have access to a Crone world, can be friendly with 2 farseers and even be friendly with Harlequins. The writing just becomes Grimderp. It wants to be ""dark"" and ""tragic"", but it just turns stupid.

At the end of the day, this game is not only a buggy mess, and will remain a buggy mess for at least a year since its initial release (Because the game literally has over a thousand bugs). It is also unfinished in terms of content and everything else. 

Do not waste your money on this game, and i will say, do not waste any money on Owlcats any other new projects either. Even if you are a fan of 40k, i would suggest to give this game a miss and instead to play WotR, an actually finished game.

Because its quite clear that Owlcat has grown complacent and lazy in their work ethic, with this game releasing in an unfinished state before Christmas, just in times for Christmas sales. Just for the sake of greed.

I've also spoken to people who have finished the story, so I have some insight into how it progresses as I continue. The longer I play, the more frustrated I become with this product. It feels like the game is unraveling; as I progress further, the apparent problems of rushed development and a lack of thorough production become more evident.

The game starts off slowly, making it hard to immerse myself in the role of a rogue trader, but maybe that's intentional for the story's sake. In the second part, you become the ""fire brigade"" of the Kronos Expanse, constantly intervening to prevent collapse. This experience felt a bit odd to me.

The storytelling itself is decent, capturing the Warhammer Grim Dark essence well. The narrative constantly implies widespread corruption and betrayal, with few loyal subjects of the Emperor, which seems strange given the nature of the Imperial Cult.

The game is plagued by various bugs—visual, technical, and long loading times, even on an M2 SSD. These issues include quest softlocks from untested decisions, blocking other quest lines. I've had to use the Toolbox, a modding tool since Kingmaker, to fix broken quests or game states. Whether my problems are from the Toolbox or inherent to the game is unclear. For example, characters who died earlier reappear, and there are dialogues with characters who never joined my party, including spoilers for future events. Even the colony management descriptions spoil the main quest. These issues are not unique to me but are experienced by other players as well.

The technical story aspects are lackluster, barely functional enough to possibly finish the game without resorting to external fixes.

The game's other mechanics, except for space combat, are disappointing. Encounters range from fun and engaging to impossibly hard or annoyingly easy. Unlike games like Baldur's Gate 3, there are no non-combat solutions or environmental strategies. The combat mechanics, like missing and having single or burst fire attacks even with automatic weapons, are unsatisfying. The combat flow involves using ultimate abilities to defeat stronger enemies. Healing is less effective compared to strategies focused on extra attacks and turns. While initially enjoyable, it gets stale if the encounter design is poor.

Other game systems, like colonies, suffer from bugs and poor design, although some colony events are interesting.

The jungle planet was particularly frustrating. The idea of getting lost could have been fun, but frequent long loading times made it a poor experience.

Some quests are played out badly. For example, there is background information you can obtain that clearly justifies certain decisions. But when you do not find this background information, the decision that instinctively felt right is marked as the opposite. For example, a heretic is obviously a heretic, and when you get the decision to kill him, you get ""heretic points"" because you did not encounter the dialogue flag that now indicates he is a heretic. This feels bad.

Visually, there are many issues, such as improperly scaled weapons for space marines and characters holding items incorrectly. These are noticeable flaws that should have been addressed in testing.

In conclusion, this game offers a well-depicted WH40k universe but is plagued by a poor state, questionable design, and an outdated RPG system. It could be significantly improved with more investment in time, money, and care. Given its current state, I cannot recommend Rogue Trader at a price beyond 20€.

The main over-arching story is a bit of a mess. I finished the game and am still puzzled why a good 50% of the main story is there and does it even relate to the finale. On the other hand, the individual stories that make it up, as well as character storylines and side quests are amazing.

I played a very dogmatic character, so i didn't pick up any xenos party member. That said, the variety of characters is such that they cover the juiciest parts of the Imperial archtypes. 

3D graphics are a bit last-gen, but the style conveys Warhammer 40k feel very well. 2D art is very nice.

Gameplay wise, the Rogue Trader system, especially character leveling, is quite a bit more complex than DnD. If you are not familiar with it before you start the game, as was the case with me, it is hard to make a consistent build. Regardless, some by choosing what looks best in that moment and having some idea of what you want each character to become, you can make some really powerful characters with unique play styles.

Verdict
9/10

2023 was the year in which we PC Gamers were blessed with two serious CRPGs; the first one was “Baldur’s Gate” with its rightly deserved GOTY award in Steam; the second one is “Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader” with a lesser budget and cutscenes, but packing an awesome storyline deep into the Warhammer 40,000 universe (even if you are a Warhammer noob like I am), a nice exploration of the Kronos Expanse, and a great turn-based combat system. If you have been disappointed by Starfield, look no further: this will sate your need for space combat and planetary exploration.

2186680,155265233,76561198019746188,0,44,18670,0,18649,1705360291,"So after almost 157 Hours of Playing the game. Currently in a second playthourh, I completed most of what the game has to offer, and am currently just fishing for more Achivements. I can say a couple of things to the game.

First off, I have not played the game right at the realease so I have not encountered as many bugs, this means since the release till about 2 weeks ago, when I started playing, the game was patched hard enough to iron mosto f the issues, on the other hand I do have alot more bugs the more companions are deceased. In my first playthough most companions were alive and this allowed me to get the most optimal and smooth run... But when characters were missing at certain points, like Act3, a lot of more bugs popped up. I must also say that until about the end of act 3 you will encounter almost no bugs, but Act 4 and up feel very much like a beta test sometimes. Very rarely something gamebreaking but mostly annoying like camera spasming and shootig into stratosphere.

Now atmosphere and music, the atmosphere of the game feels wonderfull and realy Epic, just how Warhammer should feel. The music is more serene than what I would expect from Warhammer 40k but it is wonderfull, so I can roll with it, What does suck though is that the music is at 100% settings on all sounds very quiet. Especially in epic moments it feels like the music goes totaly into the background. Makes the moments feel less epic. They had a much better balance in POTR.

The combat feels fantastic and the systems are easy to understand, BUT there is one major issue, and that is the fact that Feats Talents and Skills are very hard to find, they are not ordered alphabetically, nor in any sensible way, so you will be constantly fishing and reading every level until about 30 hours in when you will finaly remember every name of the feats (it is also a bit unintuitive since the feats dont have names like: Heavy Weapon Penetration, instead something like Overkill. this makes is even more difficult to find).
In addition, builds are laughably unbalanced, Melee psycher can deal upwards of 4k damage per turn, soldier about 2,5k, and melee tanks about 800 damage per turn... The descrepency is HUGE. You can put a melee psycher into your party, 2 or 3 officers and just watch him go ham, each officer can give him extra turn on the same round... This means every encounter is laughably easy when you cheese the combat. Difficulty was always an issue for Owlbear games, they like to do difficulty in spikes, one ecnounter is super easy and the next encounter is bruttally hard. 

There is one more thing with systems and gameplay and that is reputation and morality. Currently the reputation system is EXTREMELY BAD, like horendously extremly bad, the main issue is that until the end of chapter 2, you will not see the best items reputation vendors can give you, this means until the end of chapter 2 it is actually better to NOT trade items, untill you actually CAN see all the rewards, otherwise you can actually loose access to stuff like Power Armour, as a Heretical playthrough... This also means it is better to NOT build any infrastructure on planets since you can lock yourself up from progressing enough in a reputation since you will need some structures which will do heavy lifting for you, This also influences your Prosperity since you will be missing buildings and materials... It is just so incredibly stupidly bad right now. I can understand what the devs were thinking, They knew what rewarsds you will get so that must not have felt like a large issue, but on your first playthrough you will not have this information. It also does not help that there simply is not enough loot to max out more than 2 reputation factions. So you HAVE to specialize in which ones you wish to obtain. 

lat but not least is the morality progress bar, I thought at the start of the game that morality will be more lenient than what it actually is, I thought you can make choices in your playthough but in reality it completely takes any choices out of the game, once you choose your first Dogmatic, Ironclast or Heretic, unless you do not care for maxing it out you CAN NOT EVER under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES choose anything different than the same option. If you do chooe something else it will mean that you will not have high enough ranks in your morality to be able to choose the option you want to focus in, and this will mean you will not be able to continue leveling it up... And it has such an easy solution too, simply give a small stacking bonus with each decision, which resets if you choose something else, something like 15+1 rep for first decision 15+2 for second 15+3 for third.. this means if you stick to one decision in early game you can bump it a bit higher, if you than choose a different it justresets the bonus, this way you can make diferent choices awithout influencing the beginning but you will not get absolutely crippled if you make a different choice. 

The more I write the review the less enthusiastic I am about the game lol.... No, The game is fun, and I am certain they will fix this stuff in the long run, but right now it does suck a bit. Good game nevertheless though

WOW the game is currently TOTALY BROKEN... As of 4. 1. 2023 ACT5 does not work. You will be completely hinderen from progression. No matter what you do or how you do it the game does not proc the necessary cutscene for you to procede at this moment!

It has a lot of potential, bus also a lots of bugs, even after the patches. i felt like they increased with every act of the game,  Had one game breaker, too where a combat not ended, because there was a enemy left, but you couldn`t target him with any attack. so he was basicly unbeatable. 

ii really like the game, especially the atmosphere that warhammer bleeds. The story is solid, as are the characters. Nothing deep, but I really liked most of the characters over time. but oh my god, this skill system is really way too overloaded and complex. it's the first roleplaying game i don't feel like levelling up in because it's not fun. too much, too obscure skills. 

i would have preferred a more complex combat system instead to the skill system. It feels too simple in combat. I would like more variety and tactical depth, height differences that have an impact. being able to block opponents or bind them better, flanking and above all being able to shoot and run. simply being able to change positions and still shoot and vice versa. the fact that you lose your moving points when you shoot feels so restrictive. yes, later there are skills with which you can compensate for this with one class or another, but that's too late and too little. the fights often feel, i can't find a suitable word for it... unwiedly i guess
I like the idea of trading with factions, selling them resources and getting valuable items in return. it also fits in with the setting and the role of the main character, but the fact that it's so complicated to get better items or any items at all, apart from the loot, was rather annoying. a normal item shop for the usual stuff and the faction system for the unigue stuff would have been more fun. 

that are some big issues for me, but the game is stil worth it. i will do a second run, but will wait a few month for patches or mods, that fix most things. solid 7/10 for me, but big plus for the warhammer setting.",1705353353,1705353353,True,1,0,0.50188678503036499,0,True,False,False

The combat is fun, I like being able to make dialogue choices that affect the story but the voice acting so inconsistent! Like the main story and character aren't even fully voice acted for the prologue. I understand its expensive to voice act but the way it has been implemented is so confusing i thought the audio was bugged. Ive seen games that do partial voice acting, but this doesn't even meet those low standards. If they didn't have the budget to at least voice the entire main story probably should not have wasted any money and just focused on the Polish.

The co op is fun but, it also doesn't feel finished, feels like they clicked a check box. I have had the game get stuck when my friend moves a character and they just run in place forever.

Also the way in co op if ur friend moves slightly ahead of you and accidentally starts combat you will spend several turns just trying to run to them to help with the combat. It really should keep the group together when combat starts or allow for an option to allow 1 player to move around the map between combat.

The game has really good potential and is fun, i just think it needed more Polish id wait for a sale before you buy because at 49.99 its over priced for a game that doesn't feel fully finished.

but its not just the bugs, there are clear game-play decisions that are just, bad. I've only encountered it twice, but some progression relies on skill-checks, and in one particular case, a skill-check, AND a finite resource. 

also, I decided to play on the slightly harder than normal difficulty. im not sure if its because of this, or if the games like this in the base mode as well, but some fights seem like you werent meant to win them. my latest example was a particular boss fight, where in between each of your characters turns, 3 very powerful enemies each get a turn, and are able to make 3 attacks, that are one-shotting my tank who should be ignoring about 60% of their damage!

Buggy mess.

many talents and skills straight up don't work. quests can bug horribly causing you to have to download mods to bypass or autocomplete quests. the space marine can get stuck on things meaning you need to reload saves. I sometimes am getting dialogue from companions who are already dead or have left my party. At the start of the game it really holds your hand which kinda broke my immersion asking dumb shit like ""what is the adeptus ministorum"" shit like that would make people super suspicious of you but I understand why you need it in a game but then at some point the game decides ""Now thou shalt receive consequences for dialogue"". quite frustrating. 

Currently I'm bugged on a quest for Hienrick. Trying to enter a doorway in Galarthar's calamity and it keeps attempting to start an ambush with no enemies. 

The combat is pretty underwhelming sadly. With the right talents (when they work) you can end most combats in the first turn. The hardest part is the UI messing you about. 

I feel the game did a really poor job explaining how the mechanics work. To the point I think it barely bothered to do so I've been spending 80% of this game looking up guides for how the rogue trader system works and it is now in act 4 that I'm getting the hang of it. There should have been a tooltip explaining how your bonuses are calculated, there should have been a moment to explain the leveling screen properly. A lot of the bugs are still here and it doesn't seem like Owlcat Games have gotten to fixing them sadly.

Because of these issues I am really struggling to immerse myself in this game that I desperately want to enjoy. But I only want to enjoy it because I am a 40k fan. I wanted to do a dogmatic playthrough but sadly most of my options are ""kill him - Dogmatic"" which cuts a shit ton of content... should have gone iconoclast. Gonna try heretic next but I hear that is even worse when it comes to dialogue choices and misses opportunities.

I'm a fairly fledgling 40K fan--I practically just started with Darktide when it released and have since played several games and watched countless Lore videos on Youtube. I hold the 40k universe in very high regard and for what it's worth, I think Owlcat does 40k justice with Rogue Trader. If it wasn't a 40k game I'm not sure I could've gotten past its myriad issue but alas, I triumphed.
It's difficult to quantify what I really liked about the game and a lot easier to talk about what drove me insane so let's get the hard part out of the way, first.
The Good: Like I said early, Rogue Trader does 40k very well for well for what it is. You get to amass an awesome retinue with a character from all your favorite factions: A tech priest, a Sister of Battle, an Inquisitor, an OP Navigator qt, a fricking Space Marine(!) an unsanctioned psyker (she's mid), an Aeldari ranger, a Druhkari Kabalite and you even get an old man and old woman (just because.)
I feel like this game is the epitome of Warhammer 40k fanservice, for better or for worse. The more you like 40k, the more I think you'll like this game.
On the other hand, I've heard some people say ""Rogue Trader is a great place to get into the 40k universe!"" and I couldn't disagree more.
It's time for....
The Bad: Now, I have to give credit where credit is due. Owlcat games is a fairly small and newer studio with only a handful of games under their belt.
If you come into Rogue Trader expecting Baldur's Gate 3 because they're both CRPGs, you're going to be in for a rough time.
The overall production quality of Rogue Trader is not the greatest. The characters models and animations are okay but a little dated. The cutscenes are often laughable and desynchronized. Whenever I see an NPC get shot by a lasgun in a custcene and then react to the shot 4 seconds later I feel a little embarrassed.
Where a game like Baldur's Gate 3 has detailed character animation and the entire game is voice, Rogue Trader has.... text. And a fucking lot of it.

I HOPE YOU LIKE READING!

Anyways, the rest of my review is apparently too long for Steam so if you care to read the rest, here's the link to my backlogged. 
https://www.backloggd.com/u/FlyingMachine/

I will leave you with the conclusion, though

Alright, I've been pretty harsh on the game so let's go over a quick list of things I do like.
-The combat kinda slaps. It's a lot of fun and the weapons and effects are awesome
-The music, atmosphere and environments are pretty good. Especially the environments. There's lots of little details and NPCs that make the small areas feel busy and full of grim dark life.
-While a lot of the companions are relatively one dimensional and mostly serve as representatives of their respective factions, they're still really cool and I liked the majority of them
-I thought the main story and narrative was pretty interesting and engaging, even if longwinded at times.
-Despite my qualms with character builds, I do think the character customization is pretty cool, even if it feels like there's a lot of ""objectively best"" builds or weapon choices for most characters. You still get to make fun choices, I feel.
-I think the encounter variety of both combat and exploration is really well varied. A good amount of enemy diversity and a lot of unique adventures and events.
And that about does it! I didn't touch on every aspect of the game--it's more just what stood out to me.
If you're curious what my verdict is, I think it's a flawed and maybe even divisive game but it's 40k and 40k rules. That being said, there was clearly a lot of love and passion put into this game and I think my love for Warhammer and the God Emperor guided me forward to finish this awesome game.

This game has issues. Problems. Bugs. But overall its a good experience. If you're a fan at all of the 40k verse its an amazing game with a few flaws, probably implemented by Games Workshop because they like to stick their fingers in everything. On the one hand these flaws are bothersome, and on the other i understand. 

Visuals are good. Nothing crazy here, nothing new. 

Sound is also good. I wish they had more voice acted lines for more than main missions but you can't have everything. The voice acting they do have however is top notch imo.

Game play is where it is at. Like other Owlcat titles the game play itself is very good. I enjoy turn based combat as well as real time so it's either way for me. The combat, and game play systems are well done though not particularly well balanced at times. There has been one patch thus far to help with that but it will likely be 2-3 more patches before it gets dialed in.

Story is fantastic. I AM a fan of the 40k verse and i enjoy the story immensely. Though i do have some issue with Chapter 3 in both storytelling and the power gap that gets created due to the circumstances. 

Overall fun factor, especially for multiple games is definitely there. Your choices between the ""good"" & ""evil"" are very well differentiated and the variety of endings seem acceptable. (I've only seen one myself and watched a few others on youtube.) Of course this is 40k. There really is no ""good"". There is only war and filthy heretics and xenos that need to be cleansed. 

---- Some/Maybe Spoilers----

Here are my main issues. The main story characters are members of the Imperium, and if you are playing a dogmatic or iconoclast playthrough its ok. But in the case of a heretical playthrough the game stops making sense to me. Your party members should be more than willing to kill you out right for some of the heretical choices. Since there is no system in the game to influence your companions to become more dogmatic or heretical and they maintain their belief system the entire game your heretical rogue trader should likely be killed in the second chapter by his/her own crew. Period. Now that's not to say a heretical playthrough is without its systems to make it clear. Most of your dogmatic followers leave you in chapter 4 if your full on heretic. But this isn't a setting where 'oh you made some choices i'm not cool with. I'm just gonna leave.' is something that happens. This is a setting where 'What? He said the emperor didn't protect? Heretic! Question and burn him immediately!'. Suspiscion is reason for a bonfire to be built on corpses that may or may not already be dead. 
Secondly, the romance options in the game. Honestly i have no issue. Some people dislike you can't romance Argenta but... She is a hyper violent space nun. If anything Cassia being an object of romance is weird. She is a mutant and in the imperium even helpful mutants though sometimes like in the case of navigators are afforded great power are still not viewed favorably. Then again neither are most psykers. Even sanctioned ones. Some space marine chapters view their own librarian spykers with suspicion. 
Lastly. Chapter 3. Escape Commoragh? Noone escapes that place. Supposedly a space marine chapter grand master got stuck there once? Or a primarch? I cant remember the story but it was hard for them to get out. And supposedly they didnt really get out and got stuck wandering the webway. Also you lose all your gear and companions in chap 3 which SUCKS since chap 2 you start feeling powerful. Then you get the hammer dropped on you. 

Anyway other than that i overall approve.

So thumbs up. 7/10 as of writing this.

Rogue Trader does a fantastic job at immersing you into it's setting and many of its systems and mechanics are quite fun to engage with. 

The character leveling system is deep and allows for a variety of viable builds across different playthroughs, although certain builds for certain characters (Argenta) may end up breaking the combat balancing of the game, turning what should be difficult fights into a breeze. 

Story-wise the game does a good job at getting you into the intrigue of it's story, at least early on where the most polish has clearly been done (acts 1 & 2). However both the quality of the story writing and its pacing begin to suffer towards the middle of the game, with some characters behaving in an odd way and several writing breaks that I can only assume are the result of half-baked storylines being scrapped and re-worked into the final game, when they really should have been re-written in their entirety.

Even though the story may falter a bit what really carry the game are it's characters, and Rogue Trader does not disappoint in that aspect, as the game is filled with well-written and realized characters for the player to interact with throughout a playthrough. From the staunchest servants of the Golden Throne, to the most devious and vicious Heretic Zealot, they are a joy to interact with and those who are fortunate enough to have received voice acting are all served by excellent performances from their voice actors.

By far the largest problem with this game is the amount of bugs that plague it. Many quest and story flags in the game simply don't track properly resulting in bizarre sequences where the game will think you did one thing when you actually did another. Sometimes quest objectives will not update leaving you at a loss for what to do. There is a weird bug in act 3 where some of the passives on your character simply disappear. The worst offender of this issue may be the finale slides which seem to have a mind of their own to an extent, displaying slides for outcomes opposite to what they should be. However considering that these are clear bugs in the coding of the game, I expect that the developer is already aware and working on fixing these issues.

If I had to rate this game (at this time) I would give it a very high 7/10, broaching on an 8 if certain issues get fixed.

Right now it is an easy recommend for a Warhammer fan, and anyone who enjoys character-driven RPG experiences.

For anyone else though, probably best to wait until some of the more serious issues are ironed out.",1705270843,1705270843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the game and my hours in it shows that it has plenty potential, but just needs some more tweaks. 

Pro:
- You feel the power of being a rogue trader in the 40k universe. 
- Each faction feels unique in fights.
- Character details and backstories are well done.
- Plenty of exploration options once you get your own ship. 
- All the chaos gods and their minions are featured instead of the game focusing on just one of them.
- Chance to become a champion of the dark gods and turn the imperium against itself. 
- Sometimes making morally right choices have dire consequences.

Con:
- Boss fights as you get further in the story become increasingly unfair for the player as you play 2-3 boss battles back to back with no means of removing your character trauma's between battles, leaving them ever weaker with each battle. Hell, I switched to story mode difficulty just to keep going and I'm still getting my butt handed to me with final act 4 boss.
- Voice acting is well done, but confusing. Not every line has audio for it and it feels weird when an audio file will suddenly kick in out of nowhere instead of the entire conversation having audio. 
- Constantly having to return to your ship to fix trauma's is frustrating and kills progression. I know there are items that can fix some, but there are far more that require you to return to your ship for treatment. 
- There are bugs with conversation prompts are sometimes missing blocking you from taking certain actions.",1705267959,1705267959,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

I'll probably update once I get further into the game/after the first patch. However, right now it feels like its in early access. There are soft locking bugs that are reproducible enough to where they should have been caught. People are also reporting them rn so hopefully the game will become better with the next patch, but I can't recommend it after getting softlocked in what should be a full product.
If it was early access then I'd recommend it 100% because its likely the bugs would be fixed, but it isn't early access.

Edit at like 90 hours: Significantly less bugs, but Act 5 is almost unplayable. Newer companions have broken actions or are just outright broken, but the story is pretty good.

Things That Are Good:
-Argenta is a crazy woman who doesn't want to touch your junk, and this is good. She cares about burning heretics and having religious ecstasy. 10/10 depiction of a Sororitas, makes coombrains unhappy. Of all the companions who have stiff writing, hers at least makes the most sense since there is only one (1) canon Sororitas that's fallen to Chaos and not gotten burnt to a crisp immediately after.
-Xenos companions are arguably the most interesting companions you have aboard your ship. Gives a perspective that is rarely seen in 40k media outside of some particularly niche books or audio dramas you might not even know exist. Asuryani Ranger is always dope to see in a game, and having a Kabalite around is a dark descent into misery, villainy and pettiness that honestly this game could have used more of.
-Visual aesthetic. We have been spoiled a lot with first-person, graphics card melting 40k games that give an overall better sense of scale and largeness, but a cRPG operates on a different metric and presents the 40k world in grounded gothic grandeur and alien environments.
-Act 3 is an interesting locale that gives a rarely seen part of the 40k universe spotlight, point and laugh at those who seethe.
-Planet Development Events. If you remember the Crusade Management events from Wrath, where big things are talked about and dealt with in abstract, you'll feel right at home here. Some of the more interesting lore happens in these events, along with some subtle foreshadowing towards a certain enemy faction because of one planet in particular. If you're a powergamer you'll get some neat things, but there's also plenty of opportunity for roleplay to happen here as well.
-Abelard, introduce me to the idiots with no media literacy in the comments.
-Iconoclasm is Hard. Being a normal, good person in 40k is seen as weird. Being a good person in 40k SHOULD be hard, and it SHOULD blow up in your face; that makes being a good person all the more rewarding when it does work out. The Virgin Dogmatics wouldn't understand.

The Things That Are Just Meh:
-The music. It's fitting for 40k, but it's such a roller coaster ride of an OST. Especially considering that Wrath of the Righteous had banger after banger, it's a little disappointing that Act 3 has most of the really memorable tracks.
-Overworld exploration. Honestly there's not a lot of optional areas to explore, the resource gathering from it is braindead, and when you learn where you're going to be heading back and forth most times, there's no reason to not just save your Navigator's Insight to connect your central colony with the other parts of your protectorate. Not terrible, but lacking.
-Companions. Most of your companions suffer from 40k Writing Syndrome, otherwise known as ""their profession is their character"". Argenta is an exception to this rule because Adepta Sororitas should be brainwashed weirdos, but everyone else? Your Tech-Priest is a Magos Explorator, people well known for wanting to touch xenotech and weird things, but he's generally a fundamentalist who feels like he should be your average Tech-Priest, the Interrogator can't really have his buttons pushed in a way that matters, your Space Marine is ""battle hungry but secretly melancholic about it"" that we've seen dozens of times before. None of their writing is especially bad per se, but coming off of Kingmaker and especially Wrath of the Righteous, it is honestly shocking how little your decisions manage to influence your companions in a meaningful way. It isn't unreasonable to assume the writing team is capable of this, I've seen it before, so I'm wondering what happened this time. It feels like the writers were afraid to rock the boat too hard or they'd upset people who want the most vanilla, procreation only version of 40k that's astroturfed by idiots on Twitter.
-The story. This could probably go into the bad if I really wanted to, but I think that the events of the story honestly do feel like a Rogue Trader campaign that got a few plot threads lost, and the GM has to scramble to try to tie everything back in because they tried to do too much in too short a time, and then the final act is just kind of there and suddenly everything is over. Honestly, accurate to a lot of tabletop experiences people might have, and that is at once a sincere compliment and a damning indictment.

The Oh No This Is Bad:
-Combat. To say that combat in this game is unbalanced would be a massive understatement. There are enough YouTube videos out there documenting that Officer and Arch-Militant are basically ""I win"" classes, but if you play on a difficulty above Normal, you are probably going to be shoehorned into making the most broken, OP builds possible because of the fact that enemy encounter balance is fucked from about Act 2 onwards.
-Space Combat. You play the Great Value Brand version of Battlefleet Gothic, and if you had some mild flashbacks to the Crusade Battles of Wrath, welcome. Welcome to the space slog.
-Planet Crisis. You're going to be flying back and forth between your planets to engage in events that are either too brief to be interesting, or Space Combat.
-Lack of Variety. This is probably going to make the people who still think shouting Heresy! at people is funny or guys with anime profile pics or Space Marine avatars upset. There is, quite literally, a lack of significant Iconoclast or Heretical choices in the game. What a lot of people who don't actually engage in 40k and just use the aesthetic to push weird shit might not understand is that you are a Rogue Trader. What this means is that, ostensibly, you work for the Imperium of Man, but you're also given a significant amount of operational freedom as to how you do that because you're typically in the fringes of galactic space. What this translates to is generally being a guy who fucking loves money, has an astounding amount of it, and suddenly you have a whole lot of blank canvas to do what you want with said money. Sure, Uncle Imperium comes knocking sometimes to make sure you're doing an imperialism, but you're also free to touch xenos stuff, touch Chaos stuff, touch Imperial stuff, and generally just kind of do as you will. This freedom increases as you get more stuff, more resources, more planets, and more dudes. In this game, there's not really enough opportunities to do that - as a matter of fact, because of who your companions are for the most part, being a Rogue Trader who would want to do all that feels oddly limiting, because you have an agent of the Inquisition, a Sister of Battle, a fundamentalist Tech-Priest, your loyal Imperium loving butler, a Space Marine... even the Cold Trader doesn't really want you to do provocative stuff, and she literally sells alien knick-knacks (and more) to incredibly rich bored nobles. Your Unsanctioned Psyker? She's not into heresy either, she just wants to stop hearing voices in her brain all the time. On top of this...
-Literally Not Enough Non-Dogmatic Choices. You can comfortably become a K-Mart Inquisitor with the game's morality system, but if you want to reach Tier IV with the other choices (you will not reach Tier V with Iconoclast or Heretical), you have to slam every single choice you get of those, even if it might not make sense in that moment. For instance, if you play a Heretical character, you might be compelled to, once or twice, pick a Dogmatic option so that you don't rouse too much suspicion - you're just Odd and Quirky, not full blown Heretical. Chaos is insidious like that. Well, if you do that, congratulations, you've locked yourself out of tangible mechanical benefits and roleplay opportunities later for not sticking to your guns. Same for Iconoclast.
-The Epilogue. Oh goodness fucking gracious the epilogue slides.

Pros:
-Very good story
-Lore accurate
-world building is detailed and fleshed out really nice

Cons:
-Gameplay (combat) is shit. The first act was very enjoyable relatively balanced. its not easy but its not hard either, you need to think of how you fight in order to live and win. After that it gets terribly unbalance up to the point that its frustratingly unplayable, you get one move and one attack in general enemy gets one move and keeps attacking like there's no tomorrow. you're damage is frustratingly low, 1 out of 3 you get a decent damage hit (i.e.[in 3 turns] 13-54-7) enemy dishes out a constant stream of punishment (i.e. [in one attack sequnece] 34-40-33) to be brief enemy has a monstrous amount of DPS while you take potshots at it with some smooth pebbles. Also skill checks don't work a skillcheck requiring 90 Tech use will still fail (3/5 times) even when you have 115 Tech use, Melta charge key items do not appear on breaching prompts (it says 0 melta charge even when you have like 3). You are almost mostly outnumbered and surrounded there being no point to position you're retinue and character because you are surrounded and there being no cover. enemy life is always exorbitantly more than yours (i.e. my tanks life Abelard 211, enemy foot soldier life 842, boss at 2130) Miss rate for your character and retinue is always something like 70% while enemy can hit (in a single sequence of consecutive attacks) 99.9% of the time. I think I'll stop playing for now and be back after like 3-5 years. I would've refund this had I known how shitty it was gameplay-wise. But I already persevered for 130+ hours so I can't refund it.

not to gate keep or anything i think WH40k fans are going to love this game fun for people who dont mind casual reading and some of the visual bugs and such,  There are way worse games out there like BG3 and such
7/10  with patches fixing the game can see it being higher in the future we will see

The Long total Reading this section
So im going to admit im sketchy about WH40k games there hit and miss and honestly Lets face it,  So when owlcat anouced they where making Rogue Trader i was worried
this pleasently surprized me it basicly had like a year to be made and it did a better job then games in EA for like 3 years and where in testing for a few years b4 that it legit surprized me in a pleasent way
Yes the game has some bugs, its not the worse ive seen,  I Mean people are trying to make it sound like its unplayible,  but every single one of these people have seem to bitch at stuff that are not bugs but gameplay mechs,  Example one guy was legit bitching that his audio keept glitching out whenever he keept using Warp powers, and when people pointed out thats not the game bugging out its a gameplay mech and explained it to him,  He legit flip Not going to name names but i legit found that lolz
of course BG3 Fan boys are attacking this game, like they attack alot of games/companys,  F Em that game was soo over-rated and realy not good, not the worse ive seen but it clearly had a number of issues

WH40k Rogue Trader is pretty interesting love the atomosphere like how the Warp works in this game among a number of other things,  Legit like the option to skip space combat but honestly I enjoy it wish there was more of it in said game,  The Games Story is pretty neat for a WH40k, lets face it there storys are pretty War Heavy and what knock so dont expect a masterclass story performance
happy about any game in WH40k that dosnt feature the ultra smurfs,  Yeah i admit i am sick of that faction in fact im not a big fan of most WH40k fans,  They need to take a massive chill pill
but reguardless? this game is pretty neat,  I 100% Recommend it to anyone who likes WH40k
and I semi recommend it to CRPG Fans that dont mind a little reading and have a will of there own and arnt brainwash smucks,  Yeah i get the irony considering WH40k fan base / lore but still its a good CRPG None the less,  The fact it was made in like a year and such dos mean it has some graphic bugs and a few other problems but honestly? I Mean BG3 Was in EA for 3 years and was in closed testing for like 2 years or more b4 that and still released with 0 epilogue and in a buggie mess its a game was was heavly frontloaded anyone who claims thats a great game but is bashing this is obvioiusly a hyprocrit",1705195603,1705236493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're just scrolling by: this is another labour of love from Owlcat, and one of their iconic disastrous launches. Wait a few months.

The scope and setting of this game are a daunting task for any designer or writer. Lording over and exploring the frontiers of the Imperium, having the fate of billions of lives in your hands, dredging through it's bleak and satirical tone. The writing team really knocked it out of the park. The Koronus Expanse is depicted wonderfully, an interesting slice of this huge setting, where you as a mere mortal try to write your own destiny. Clashing against monolithical institutions and powers, new, old and ever-changing.
Too bad that many times the weird design choices and budget constraints ruined many pathos heavy moments. Too many big personalities and the circumstances when you meet them or fight them are voiceless, or their dialogue trees disjointed or cut abruptly because of a bug. Or a cutscene breaking, skipping audio, or not loading the gorgeous scenes painting the skills challenges, or just because it wasn't voiced at all.
Companions really suffer from these shortcoming, and for some pretty rushed and linear final chapters.
Combat is a treat, but a lot of level design and engine quirks make it sometimes unreliable, leaving you guessing or bore you with the many lengthy animations or soft locking you in the middle of a fight.

Judging from the response of the original backers regarding the future monetisation, this was not discussed previously and can be considered a sloppy attempt to raise enough capital in order to justify the expense of labour for fixing it and developing it further.

As for many games from this generation, wait and see what it becomes, buy it on a sale, put on your pirate hat, do what you want. Just keep an eye on it from time to time, it's really worth it.",1703531194,1705192574,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Had lots of fun with it, it feels like a modern fallout 2 in a lot of ways. Really enjoyed many aspects of it however there's definite room for improvement that I'll break down below. 

[b]The good:[/b]
Lots of content (took me ~170 hours to complete)

It's a complete campaign and you wont need dlc to get a sense of closure

Crisp graphics, nothing to write home about but get the job done

Runs smooth

Includes ship combat (I enjoyed this although I know some people dislike it)

Good variety of classes and progression 

Awesome writing that really captures the grimdark 40k flavour [spoiler] You can choose to exterminatus a world in the first few hours of the game and it just gets better from there [/spoiler]

Meaningful choices at least as far as dogmatic / heretical go, Iconoclast seemed like a bit of trap though (not much content for it)

Many planets to explore / exploit

Varied enemies

[b] Needs Work: [/b]
Is currently buggy, I encountered several quests that glitched out and forced me to backtrack / resolve with 3rd party tool, some of these were bad enough that I was genuinely surprised the game was allowed to ship in that state. Owlcat have already patched out some of the worst offenders and this will get better with time but shouldn't have been allowed in the first place.

Chapter 4 needs work, To give a rough non spoilery breakdown of the chapters: 
1, intro.
2, Explore and establish empire.
3, Go somewhere else where you cant access your regular stuff. 
4, Come back home.
5, Climax elsewhere.
 When you come back from chapter 3 I really wanted for there to be more to do in my empire, as it is there's a few quests then it's off to chapter 5, there's no way to farm for items to increase rep with factions / alignment reputation once you exhaust what is there and there isn't enough content to max out rep everywhere. If you're supposed to pick one or two factions and just trade with them then this isn't made apparent during play. By the end of chapter 4 I was literally just warping between systems in order to pass time while my colonies developed with nothing else to do. Owlcat really need to add some repeatable stuff here, a way to farm space battles would also be good, I went the longest time without being able to get a battle which was really frustrating as I was adding cool stuff to my ship but unable to play with it.

I played on the 'standard' difficulty and found the vast majority of the game way too easy. There aren't many problems that can't be solved by pointing Argenta's heavy bolter at them, and the same can be said of most damage focused characters. I've enjoyed it enough to go back for a another run on a higher difficulty though and am hopeful that it will be more enjoyable. This also applies to space combat where all but 2 of the battles were a pushover and torpedo's are probably overtuned.

Iconoclast looked like it needed work (very few items / dialog choices)

The dangerously insane mechanicus priest trope gets done to absolute death.

[b] Summary: [/b]
Enjoyed this a lot and going back for another playthrough (heresy time!) despite all the flaws. Genuinely optimistic that Owlcat will fix the worst of them and hopeful that the DLC will help to resolve the chapter 4 quest desert a bit.

Sometimes funny, absolutely hilarious when a servitor suddenly starts T-posing and a man next to it explodes in a squall of gore. 

Dialogue is an issue but not in the sense that what is said or written is bad, on the contrary its excellent. The problem is the inconsistency in voice overs and character portraits. The voice acting is excellent but can be frustrating when you're switching back and forth between excellent voice acting and then reading. The lack of more character portraits is a more of a nitpick than the former but you can tell who will or will not be important based on whether they have a portrait. A bit disappointing, especially considering how excellent the art for these typically is, I would love to see more of it.

Would recommend. Fun game play, excellent story, and a wonderfully faithful adaption of the Warhammer aesthetic.

EDIT: I absolutely still enjoyed the first three acts of this game, and if that is all that this game was I would not be changing my review to negative. Unfortunately in the games current state I have come across numerous bugs that have brought the experirence down signficantly. 

Often the dialogue will simply end depending on the choice of dialogue you pick, forcing a reload, or you will be severly limited in the dialogue options you can pick to ones that do not necessarily reflect your character or lock you out of paths that you have progressed up until this point. It becomes tedious to even interact with the environment as it keeps breaking, and when coupled with the reloads to fix encounters it becomes tedious in the extreme.

Considering this amongst many other bugs I have had to put a hold on my game for the time being and wait for it to be ironed out in the last acts. Story, gameplay, dialogue, and atmosphere are still excellent, I just wish the game let me enjoy those things.

I've put 200 hours in and completed the game.

The good---

The gameplay is good,
The mechanics are complex enough to be interesting,
The visuals are great,
The story is captivating,
There's a ton to explore and the optional events/items you find can affect the plot.
You can be a loyal servant of the Emperor.

The bad --- 

When I really consider this game, it's actually bad. It's the Fallout 4 of Warhammer. In terms of plot it switches between really deep and heavy storylines to just forgetting them entirely or skimming over stuff. It's also incredibly slow feeling at times, once you have played the (very long) tutorial/intro you can't skip it in a new game and I found myself just spamming 1 to skip through a fair amount of text walls where the option was ""continue"" despite needing to scroll to read the text at times, meaning they knew it was a wall of text and just broke it up by having you press a button. It's also very partitioned during play, you fight pirates, then xenos, then different xenos, then chaos then necrons. It's rare to jump between fighting the various groups and the main story chapters are very segregated.
However, you don't really notice this while playing, it's more of an after thought when you look back and realize or when something happens that breaks your immersion (say spamming 1 and accidentally saying something instead of just skipping text).

Now, onto semi-spoilers. 
The ending. I'll grant that it's interesting, overly complex but interesting. It's also got actual, real choices where you can be locked out of options if you have/haven't done certain things or picked certain paths. It's also just kinda nonsense lore-wise.

1. Certain quest triggers can fail to trigger. I usually found this to be the case with events that occur in and around combats. For example, when helping Jae in a warehouse, if you initiate the combat before she comes into the area, after the combat, she and her companions will just stand around, rather than moving forward with their post-fight dialogue. I encountered similar bugs 3 times throughout my playthrough.

2. Companion movement AI is incredibly frustrating when dealing with traps, as they will happily run right through them. To avoid this, when you get auto-paused by the discovery, you need to A: spot where the trap is, and then B: unpause and move your character away from it then stop and then C: unlink all the characters, and switch to whomever you want to disarm it. If you unlink before doing these things or don't unlink them, the AI party members will continue happily running in the direction they were going til they hit a wall or the trap. 

4. UI elements sometimes fail to respond, such as when trying to investigate something or loot a body. Party members will attempt to get into interaction zone with the element, but fail to do so. 

3. Particularly to the Steamdeck, the expanse map is very hard to navigate as rather than moving between adjacent or connected systems, when you move around the map, it will regularly fling itself to the furthest system up or down in the vague direction you indicated.",1705179028,1705179028,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once I was able to play around on the map screen I would have crashes in both Co-op and Solo play.
I've crashed over an hour in to as little as loading the game.
Not only does it crash, but it sometimes it likes to take out Discord on it's way out.
My amusement then turned to slight annoyance then sadness as I realized after two patches that Owlcat may not be prioritizing this bug. So for now I'll be enjoying the game by couch co-op with my friend who has not had these crashes as frequently as I.

Getting real tired of Owlcat releasing bugged out games and then slowly spoon feeding us fixes little by little. Knock the crap off, act like grownups and do the job right the first time (yes, I know some bugs are inevitable. Doesn't excuse the state the game was released in.) If it was simply a case of T-posing servitors (which was kinda funny given the in-universe stuff going on) and the occasional crash or forced reloading of an encounter it'd be one thing, but that's not what we're dealing with. Many people can't finish the game due to quest bugs, half the companion quests are bugged and unbeatable, dialogue is missing from quests, MANY talents are bugged and not working at all... this is genuinely pathetic. There is no excuse for this nonsense. The fact that the 'ultimate' editions of both of Owlcat's previous games are still loaded with bugs that will now never be fixed really only adds to the current problem.

None of this even comes close to touching on the issues regarding balance. That's an entirely separate can of worms that honestly, I was prepared to give Owlcat the benefit of the doubt until I got to act 3 and realized that they apparently got bitter about halfway through the game in regard to how powerful they made the player in act 1 and 2. ""Oops, we gave the players the tools to make their characters immortal. Better make the next boss immortal too"". This was a major complaint of mine in their last two games. In order to beat the bosses, you needed to min-max your character so much that every other fight besides the handful of tough ones was silly easy. In Rogue Trader they made it turn based only, so now the game can't play itself, though it has the same problems with balance. Had they not made those stupidly difficult fights, I was going to let the balance thing go, considering how many difficulty options there are in the menus. The hardcore people had the tools needed to make themselves suffer just fine, and the rest of us could just enjoy the game. Here's hoping Owlcat actually learn to adjust to criticism and fix this issue, as well as the multitude of broken quests, talents, dialogue, talents, encounters, etc.

In terms of story, it's okay. Lots of fun if you are a WH40k fan, but still with issues like, for instance, a major plot point being forgotten about (don't want to spoil things, but it's a major plot point introduced at the end of the prologue and has a couple of lines of easily miss-able dialogue that reveal what the deal is, and no one comments on it and there is no resolution), the entirety of act 3 is that irritating trope where they take all your equipment and make you fight 'naked' for a while (yes, some of your equipment can be lost forever. Some of that is bugs, but your shoes get stolen and a random NPC in the area has them. They have no special name and the other NPCs in the area don't have dialogue, so there's no reason to believe that talking to that ONE in particular would do anything and no way of knowing that your boots specifically would be there. The game does not tell you that your boots were stolen, it makes it seem like they would be with the rest of your equipment and by the time you find out that they aren't, it's too  late.) and then after act 3 it's basically just fights. There's no more space-exploration (I was hoping new warp paths would open up and reveal more sections of the map to explore. No dice).I am a WH40k fan so I will play around with the game a while waiting for fixes, but I can't recommend it. It's honestly more disappointing than fun at this stage.

Now on the Rogue Trader (over 200hts player). Owlcat I'm not sure what's is going on with your guys at that company but this game ins't complete.

It starts pretty good in the 1st few acts then I have no idea what happened around ACT 3 and onward it seems Owlcat didn't do any sort of quality checks on the later acts and just start doing simple work and not putting the same effort they did in the  1st 2 acts. 

I can understand bugs in still in process to release game. But you -Owlcat put this game out there as ready and complete eventhough it isn't. You guys really just drop the ball on the later acts like you you can feel the drop of  polish/content once you hit the last ones. 

This game needs a few more patches to fix alot of the costly bugs. As for the later acts, it makes me feel as a player like there no point in finishing them because they feel bare and the story it seems like you guys had a direction and then forgot all about it after the 3rd act. 

Don't get me wrong I did have lots of fun playing the 1st few acts. But I don't know what happens where it feels like that same effort into the random events/story from the beginning doesn't carry over to the later half of the game. Looks like the game needs a few more months to polish.

In addition Owlcat I really do not hope you guys are not getting a bit too confident that this doesn't hurt your players interest in you. I'm really hoping am wrong, but if the dlcs turn to some cash grab with no effort into them. I think this will be your last game I purchase on release. And maybe interest in the company what so ever. 

You guys have had some questionable things in the past, that I can overlook but the way this current game was released left a bit of a sour taste.",1705095648,1705095648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I ended up feeling like it was based on the tabletop game in the same way that a servitor is based on a human - it's the same general shape, but so much has been bolted on that little of the original soul remains. Owlcat piled a lot of things on - an archetype-based leveling system with a lot of fiddly choices, a frigate with way more guns than frigates generally have, a variety of ways to expand the story - but for me it never gelled into something I enjoyed.

I didn't feel like the story was well-told, or that my choices were significant to the other characters. (For example, I chose to save an ancient piece of technology at significant human cost, and my Tech-Priest said nothing about it.)

Leveling my characters felt like a four-credit college course, given the number of abilities that interacted with one another. The archetypes felt like narrow corridors rather than paths through an open space. I picked Officer at the beginning because I wanted my character to be an inspirational leader, but it turns out that being an Officer means it is always a bad idea for you to shoot an enemy yourself, when you have the option of telling someone else to do it instead.

Fights often felt like a slog. It's 40k; fighting ought to feel good. I got into a fight with a Chaos Space Marine and he fired a full-auto burst at my party at almost point-blank that did almost no damage because I'd buffed us so thoroughly. This felt surreal given the lore - like the threat wasn't real. Lots of fights also have wonky line of sight tracking and long distances that make some people spend multiple turns just hoofing it to the fight.

Some of my opinion might be related to the fact that I love the TTRPG and this feels so different. Perhaps without that perspective I'd like it better. Regardless, in its current state it's not for me.

It's also kinda buggy. They'll probably fix that eventually.",1705094709,1705094709,False,0,0,0.487721711397171021,0,True,False,False

I'm gonna start with the negative parts- the game is buggy. My experiences with bugs haven't been that bad compared to others, I have exactly 1 quest about 80 hours in that I can't seem to resolve at all because the routes I chose for it seem to be bugged, but other than that almost every bug I've run into has been fixed with a quicksave + immediate reload, and the ones that weren't fixed (almost all were just certain skills/items that didn't work as intended) by that have all been patched by now. I also encountered almost no bugs in the first 50 hours or so, chapter 3 is where they started becoming really noticeable and chapter 4 is where stuff (like that quest) started to fall apart a little bit. All-in-all, bugs haven't impacted my experience too much. Launch Baldur's Gate 3 act 3 was way buggier for me, but it seems like the late-game bugs here aren't getting patched as quickly as most of those were.

Speaking of BG, the other negative is going to feel especially obvious coming off of that game- the production value on this game in general isn't astronomically high. There's not really any pre-rendered cutscenes, the large majority of dialogue isn't voice acted (although the voice acting when present is PHENOMENAL, the whole main cast + villains sound amazing when they get to speak). There's some really good reactive companion dialogue, but not nearly as much as in BG3 or Mass Effect or whatever, and there are a few scenes in particular (like one where I chose to execute a very important character for being heretical) where I would've expected strong reactions and/or extra camp dialogue from companions about it and I just kinda didn't. It's disappointing but overall understandable considering the length of the game, the number of companions, and the size of Owlcat compared to BioWare or Larian.

Now, for the good- in short, this game fucking rocks. It NAILS the Warhammer setting, choosing to tread pretty different ground compared to most 40k video games. You see a different side of the galaxy, and choosing to focus on a mix of chaos, pirates, Eldar, and Dark Eldar early on plus a cool last-act twist villain later works really well compared to the Orks/Chaos focus that most 40k games seem to have. Well I was complaining about the lack of reactions earlier, the ones that are there are fantastic and make the world feel really alive. You have interesting and well-written characters who all make sense in the world while having very different outlooks, which is awesome. The story is also fantastic and in true CRPG fashion, almost every quest has an unfathomable amount of possible solutions. I did my first playthrough as a very stereotypical ""FOR THE EMPEROR"" dogmatic, and its awesome having to literally kill companions to hard-stick to this route, its been great and makes me really excited for a second playthrough at some point.

The gameplay itself also really clicked with me. I spent the first 40ish hours experimenting a LOT, and then I fell into a really cool rhythm a bit after unlocking tier 2 archetypes (basically advanced classes that chars unlock at a certain level) where I just get to stack a million extra turns on 1 guy and have him solo every enemy before they even get to move. Everyone has been complaining about a  difficulty spike at the end of act 4 boss fight but I really didn't feel it at all, I plowed right through him and it was a blast. In hindsight I do wish I'd picked a higher difficulty, but I struggled a LOT with the pathfinder games on Normal so I expected the same difficulty here. This is definitely Owlcat's easiest game by a large margin but I think that's fine, I enjoy the gameplay a lot even 100 hours in, and I think the progression helps a lot with that. The unique 3-tier archetype system is awesome and gives a lot more build variety within a single ""class"" than most crpgs do. You do a LOT of levelling up in this game, since you'll have around 10 characters in the midgame and the level cap is large, but its always fun. I'd guess i've spent about a tenth of my emmense playtime leveling up and its been super rewarding.

So to sum up- the game is buggy and has some signs of being low-budget, but the writing is phenomenal, the quests are open-ended, it's filled to the brim with unique design choices to set it apart from the competition, and the combat is very tactical and rewarding. If you're fan of the setting or just of crpgs in general, definitely pick this one up!",1705080354,1705080354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first, this game is better then the roleplaying game its based on, by a country mile. 

Lets get serious, even though this is a thumps up review, even though I loved every second I spent in this game and even though I consider it one of my new favorite games, I must stress that this game is far from flawless. It is good, its a 7 or 8 out of 10 good, but it has some problems in it. 

Lets talk about what is good: I really enjoyed the story, surprisingly so. The studio did a smarty by picking the setting of Rogue Trader (as in the TTRPG not the OG warhammer 40k books) since it allows maximum player freedom, antagonists variety and companion choices. Each Companion was enjoyable, had a solid personal story and seemed viable into the late game in a gameplay sense. 

The Ground Combat is excellent. I felt it was fast, fun and with plenty of room for creative builds and strategies. The idea of Archtypes + Orgins is a real neat way of making builds, allowing you to mix and match some fun combinations. I found the Equipment system is also nice, with a good variety of weapons, armors and trinkets to supplement your builds. 

Now for the flaws: This game has bugs, from small animation problems to soft-locks. These are usually fixed either by forcing a save, reloading a save or restarting, but they are annoying.  Reading other reviews, bigger bugs have been detected and needs fixing. Nothing would suck more then a bug that kills a save when you are 40 hours in. 

Space Combat is currently quite boring, and feels like filler. Its thankfully a very small part of the overall experience, but its not a good sign when I tab-out during it to watch YTPs instead of playing. 

With all this now mentioned, I will once again say: I love this game, I recommend this game, and I will play this game again. It is a super solid, super enjoyable adventure, and I do hope the creators will iron out the bugs in due time. It is rare to find Warhammer 40k games with this much soul in it, and for that the studio deserves all the best.",1705054389,1705054389,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Now I do think it does a good job of giving you the feel of living in the grimdark setting of Warhammer 40k in a way no other Warhammer game has to date. Sometimes the path of mercy just gets more people killed, sometimes you have to recognize that no matter how nice you are to that xeno lady she won't see you as equal to her, and kindness is met with suspicion and many will try to exploit it. My own character tried to thread the needle between being a good man but holding to faith in the God-Emperor, which meant I never got past rank II in either Dogmatic or Iconoclast. He tried to make friends with as many factions as possible... which means aside from the Imperial Navy nobody got enough loot to see the Rogue Trader as an ally. This is one of the major problems that keeps me from giving this game a recommend: the pacing.

[b]So about that Pacing:[/b]
Alright, so here is where I was at the end of Chapter II - I had just finished a bunch of sidequests, none of my companion stories were finished but they had all had a satisfying Act I or thereabouts. I was at rank II of V on Dogmatic and Iconoclast so I was thinking that okay, so while I know I will be capped based on which one hits rank III first I'm in little danger of that not happening. I wasn't very far along on anybody's reputation except Explorators but I was about a third to maybe halfway through which, this being the end of Chapter II, meant I felt fairly confident regarding my progression.

Little did I realize I was actually 75% of the way through the game. Chapter III takes you out of Koronus entirely for reasons I won't explain because spoilers, and each Chapter after that feels like it has about as much content and by extension resources and missions as Chapter I. Worse, the bridge from Chapters 4 to 5 comes more or less out of nowhere and while you are warned ahead of time you are going for the endgame and have a chance to gather stuff and finish sidequests... as far as I could tell I had done everything already.

And that's the big issue - I took the massive amount of content and all the adventures I had for Chapter II to mean that the rest of the game must be like this and I've probably still got dozens of hours of gameplay left! But as it turns out, I had missed the boat on committing to an ideology already, and had also missed the boat on gaining any real allies other than the Imperial Navy. I also rarely encountered story events or other means of boosting reputation with other factions that wasn't just dumping all the garbage I had looted upon them, making things feel so very limited.

All of this would be fine and keeping with the themes of Warhammer 40k if I was warned ahead of time and knew that what looked like ""not even halfway through the game"" was actually ""almost done"".

Oh, if you're wondering why I was able to max the Imperial Navy's rep and nobody else's? It's because they're special and get a resource to boost their reputation with that's completely separate from everybody else and that nobody else will take meaning boosting rep with the Navy costs you nothing with the other factions. Which means if you just focus one and only one faction then good news - you can be best buds with both the Navy and the xenotrading, heretical artifact smuggling pirates! Again, I'd have been fine with the idea that you can only be friends with a couple factions if they had, oh I dunno, maybe had some mechanic where boosting one faction lowered rep with another so it basically signaled you're not supposed to be friends with everybody ahead of time. Or maybe just more story stuff that made you choose one over the other more often.

[b]Actually, about the story...[/b]

So I'd say the story is overall pretty good in terms of immersing you into the setting. It does this job quite well in fact, for a while. The problems really begin towards the end of Chapter IV. I won't spoil anything but... well if you've played Far Cry 3 you probably are familiar with this pain. There is a threat you're dealing with, eventually you deal with that threat, and it turns out the real threat is something you never even saw a glimpse of once on screen until you get to Chapter V. They also tease at another faction showing up but they never seem to matter - which is funny considering they went through all the trouble of having you fight members of this other faction that I don't mention because spoilers but nope, never seen again.

Basically, after doing a wonderful job pitting you against a chaos cult, xenos raiders, and all sorts of other problems the story falls flat on its face, gets tied up in Chapter IV, and suddenly you get a whole new villain and threat out of practically nowhere because I guess somebody told them they have to have FIVE chapters.

[b]The Combat:[/b]

So anyway, how is the combat? Afterall it's the grimdark world of 40k where there is only war, and it won't feel like there is only war without, well, warfare. Well, the combat is bland to put it mildly. The biggest issue are the infamous difficulty spikes that owlcat is known for. This makes it critical to focus your characters and know from the start what niche they'll fill and build focusing on that.

The problem is if you do this well you end up with an utterly broken character who trivializes anything you run into and all anybody else gets to do is chip in once in a while while they murder entire rooms of xenos, chaos marines, daemons, and whatever other horrors this game throws at you. Now, you could deliberately nerf your builds a bit to avoid this... at which point your backside is artfully removed from your body and served to you with garnish and a sweet, tangy sauce.

Space combat is not as bad in terms of balancing but it's really tedious on the whole and that's all I've got to say about it.

[b]Regarding Bugs:[/b]

So as of this time it's very possible to finish the end without encountering game breaking bugs. That said it's still buggy - the game sometimes forgets its own rules or how its own status effects work, I'm not sure how much of the damage I dealt (or didn't deal) was due to a bug and how much of it was just game mechanics interacting in ways I didn't anticipate, and actual chances of success are not always displayed accurately. It's playable, but just don't trust everything to always work the way you expect it to at all times which can be infuriating if things break in a way that makes combat far harder than it needs to be.

[b]Overall verdict:[/b]

So basically, I think I enjoyed this overall but as you can tell, I can't recommend it. It scratches a 40k itch that nothing else does, but all the bullshit in the way just annoys me. If I had to call this game anything I'd probably call it unfinished more than anything else. It feels like there was supposed to be more content at least in Chapter 4 that just never made it into the finished product. I'm sure some are hoping for DLC but, well, even a small studio like Owlcat doesn't get to get away with selling an unfinished game and then making us pay extra to get the cut content. Granted it's not as insulting as Day 1 DLC would be, but I'm still not so inclined to forgive them on this.",1705046596,1705046596,False,2,0,0.481283396482467651,0,True,False,False

But when I scour reddit wondering why I can't seem to find my way to the next 'checkpoint' only to find out I need to have saved someone the game offered for me to kill during a fight that took place HOURS ago... that really sucks.

Negative Review but there are positives

Edit: I've played it more and this game is half finished. There's obviously a lot of content meant to be implemented but not even in Act 2 and from everything I've read and talked to others it gets worse as you go along - nowhere near worth the price tag.

Really needs a better review system. 
I'm enjoying aspects of the game but regret buying it new and not waiting for a bit sale.

The big issue - it feels thin. For a crpg anyway. The world around you isn't alive and just exists as an aesthetic and a mechanic to hide loot crates and the occasional puzzle. Just set dressing between fights. 

Which isn't necessarily a terrible thing but not what I expect from a solid rpg. Companion interactions are pretty light (so far)

World, lore and art are top notch and seems to be following a very 40k story but I was hoping for more than just some art between combat events.

With its awesome decision-making aspects and interactions within the 40k universe, there is a lot of depth to the experience, although it may become a bit overwhelming for anyone that doesn't have much spare time. If you're a 40k fan, I strongly recommend for you to get the game and allow yourself ample time to play it. 

The game's heavy emphasis on dialogue and options might be a concern for players with time constraints, yet it is precisely these elements that contribute to the game's excellence as an immersive RPG.

While encountering hardly any bugs, the combat proves enjoyable, albeit with some confusion as to what stats you should concentrate on. The game could benefit from more comprehensive explanations of certain traits and their impact on combat. Nonetheless, the flexibility to redesign character combat stats/perk at any given time mitigates any concerns about making an initially incorrect combat-oriented choice. The game does have a recommended stat advisor, it's simple but at times I found my character could output more damage if I avoided the stats the game advised me to pick from.

Despite the learning curve associated with character builds, players familiar with the 40k lore will at least have some basic familiarity when it comes to the wider non combat decision making. At times it would be nice to have a glimpse of the consequences surrounding the decisions but being in the dark can also be quite fun, makes it for more immersive role play. Plus The ability to align decisions whether embracing chaos, or embodying a pious servant of the God-Emperor, or navigating the middle ground as an ""iconoclast"", provides an awesome experience.

Having explored both iconoclast and dogmatic character paths, each proving enjoyable, I've only scratched the surface, having experienced approximately 30% of the game. The ongoing enjoyment and depth of the gameplay make it a highly recommended experience. However, it's advisable to allocate substantial time for each gaming session, given the extensive dialogue and decision-making involved.

The only real negative experience I had was some repetititon with the planets exploration as well as the voidship combat. But they weren't that bad, just weren't as fun as the elements the game offers. 

Positives:

• Immersive gameplay
• Rich decision making
• Overall game quality
• Combat gameplay

Negatives:

• Repetitive game play for voidship combat and planet exploration
• Lack of initial explaining for some combat stats

OBS

I don't think the dialogue is a negative as it adds to the richness of creating the overall 40k universe. But sometimes, I think the dialogue didn't need to be as heavy as it was.

[*]Please make the unvoiced dialogue into scrolling dialogue if you can't get staff/AI to voice it cause having a huge wall of text thrown at you is less engaging than the scrolling dialogue as seen in most unvoiced RPGs.

Long: 
Story: the story is good until around chapter 4, which is when I began to lose interest in it. It wasn't bad by any means after chapter 4, but the game overall felt as though it reached it's peak in chapter 3. I found that I enjoyed a majority of the companions and their side stories, and the side characters were all rather well written. 

Content: when you first open the expanse map it's massive, downside is that you'll only visit a portion of the total expanse. Also, once you're done with chapter 3 the amount of new or additional content begins to drop off hard, you'll have 90% of the map explored, most of the points of interest explored, etc, but you'll still have like another 30+ hours of the story left. 

Combat: the combat is very well done and enjoyable, with a large variety of weapons and skills/classes, you can do a lot of experimenting throughout the campaign. However, there is a lot of bugs when it comes to combat (I will be talking about this later). 

Setting: this is easily the best representation of the 40k universe that there has ever been. Most 40k games focus on large scale events and battles, focusing on the major factions like Space Marines and so on. In Rogue Trader, you get to experience the smaller details about the universe, like life on these massive ships and in these massive cities, gangs, nobles, xeno's relations with normal humans, etc. You see a side of the Warhammer universe that you don't get to experience often. 

BUGS: this is my largest complaint about this game, there is a massive amount of bugs in this game. Many of these bugs can even prevent you from completing quests, finishing battles, etc. I had the same bug multiple times where an enemy would just be invincible and so I would have to reload the save as I couldn't proceed further since I couldn't end the combat scenario. Also, the optimization is horrendous at times, sometimes during battles my fps would drop as low as 20, and I know it's not my computer as I have a pretty decent rig. 

Difficulty: if you've ever played a Owlcat game then you know they enjoy their difficulty spikes. One moment you feel like a living god, instantly killing everyone, next minute you get into a fight that just beats you into the dirt. I didn't feel as though the spikes were as insane as they were in their Pathfinder games, but the finale of chapter 4 is just insane. That is one of my biggest complaints about Owlcat as a whole, you can go a majority of the game feeling as though you're picking good skills and perks, and then you run into one of these spikes and you realize that you didn't pick the right ones or didn't optimize properly.

Genuinely surprised this game is sitting at Mostly Positive (70%). Reading the reviews it seems some players encountered numerous bugs which I never came across with an Iconoclast/Heretic 50/50 play through. The handful of bugs I did happen to came across were solved via patch one so no complaints here! 

Pros: 

- Intriguing and excellently written story with a deep choice/consequence system. 
- Fun combat system with plenty of offensive/defensive/support roles.
- AMAZING atmosphere and world-building. Just about every facet of the setting receives some love in one form or another. Most of our favorite factions and races are represented!
-Many complex gameplay systems which interact well, making you actually feel like a Rogue Trader in the setting (space combat, colony management, economic system, exploration etc).
- Interesting and varied companions with their own quests.

Cons:

- Several bugs that were fortunately ironed out for me in patch one!
- Bloated/too many talent choices where some are absolutely useless and can lead to feeling overwhelmed.
- Combat is wayyyy too easy on anything under the normal difficulty.
- Rushed final act in terms of concluding the main story.

Rogue Trader is a MUST BUY in my opinion, particularly for fans of 40k and CRPG's. Really, really looking forward to starting a second playthrough when the DLC's come out, this time as a loyal, dogmatic servant of the Imperium...

[/u]

[h2] The Good [/h2]
The role of a Rogue Trader is one of the best options to start learning about the universe of Warhammer 40k, since you're one of the most influential and free individuals in the Imperium, as well as the role being accurate for someone discovering the unknown, which this game is really good at showing you how powerful you are (at the start, your character is treated as royalty by the main officers who always refer to you as ""Lordship"" or ""Lord Captain"", and as a legend from myth by the peasants), and how grim the world of Warhammer is (one of the first casual decisions you do as an official RT is if you should execute or lash one of your officers for just doubting if you're capable of your task, and everyone reacts without surprise no matter your choice).
The opening does a great job at introducing you to this role, as well as giving you a view of how most of the Imperium works by showing the essentials of it in just one system, giving a great degree of choices and even in the combat showing the scale of this setting, as most of the bossfights aren't against giant creatures but simply leader cultists or strong psykers, and the final bossfight of the chapter being against a single Chaos Marine. And topping it all off, it gives the choice to save a few thousands from an eternity of suffering, or killing the whole planet to spare them and the rest of the sector from the hands of the Archenemy.

The characters are all very intriguing from the moment you meet them, be the starting cast or the ones you only get at chapter 3, all with fun personalities and dialogue, showing different aspects of the Imperium and universe of 40k, as well as fun to play with during the gameplay. Each of them can have a large importance to your character, be as romance option, or just a friend while you progress through the main quest and their individual side-questlines. 
Some of my favorites were the Seneschal Abelard, a man fully loyal to you and the Imperium, always sticking to honor and fairness, even if his family were put into trial, but who still shows his worries and weaknesses through subtle cues; and the Aeldari Yrliet, from a race of elves who dominated the stars and lost that domain but still see themselves as a superior race, yet she is one who went on a Path not seen well, respecting you as a Rogue Trader, and later learns to respect your species alongside admiring you, while creating doubts about her own.

[h2] The Bad [/h2]
Some of the first issues that happen at the start of the game are very common for people to have (and stick along until the end of the game), mainly being interface, usage of skills, pathing and bug issues. 
[list]
[*]The interface for leveling up is not fluid at all, requiring you to scroll down a giant list of traits that isn't arranged alphabetically to find the oen you're looking for.
[*]The game has too much skills that really only apply to narrative scenes, a big cut of which are not used a lot, if ever. This leads to you only caring about the existence of barely a handfull of them, which usually leads to only needing 2 characters to handle all the tests.
[*]The characters, outside of combat, navigate by you clicking on where to go. This comes with the issue that their pathing is very janky, and sometimes can actually lead you to death, as they might gest stuck when you try to leave a timed trap, or just walk into one when you wanted to go somewhere else entirely.
[*]It is a buggy game, with the only salvation that on the first 2 chapters there aren't as much bugs. The most common ones I had were the game crashing while it loaded after I Alt+Tab, or the movement in combat being janky if I was looking through a wall in tight areas.
[/list]

The biggest issue I had by the end that was stacking up since the start was with the alignment system and the trading system. The main issue is that both require so much points to finish, yet it is completely impossible to do so legitimelly, and I know for sure because I finished all the unique encounters and did all alignment decisions 90% being Iconlocast, yet on it I got only level 3, and never got to even half of the max trade level with any faction. 
The trading requires you to keep gathering resources to trade, when this game has no sort of repeating encounters except during warp travel which barely give low quality weapons (note: ship battles give their own resource type and only one faction requests them [exclusively them], and there are no repeating encounters so it is impossible to farm it). Most of the time you at best will get 10k reputation per trade, if you accumulate for the whole chapter and give it all to one faction, of which there are 5 different to pick from. And on the alignment system, you gain points with each alignment by picking dialogue options that match one of the 3 alignments (Iconlocast, Dogmatic and Heretic), gaining points for that alignment. But whenever you pick those options, you get 2 to 5 points, only increasing to 12 at the end of chapter 4, and already to get to the level 2 of an alignment the game asks you for 200 points. Dialogues that give those choices are not common at all, so it is literally impossible to get even to level 4 on an alignment without cheats.

[h3] From here on, there will be some spoilers for chapter 3, 4 and 5, since these are where a lot of the problems with this game are. [/h3]


Chapter 3 began well, but quickly turns into an annoying mess to play through, caused by extremely unfair bossfights, areas filled with traps, and disappointing story reveals and teammates, such as Argenta casually revealing she was the one to kill the Rogue Trader in chapter 1, which is never brought up again, and the damn Space Marine underperforming in everything except being a wall and having a broken Charge.
When you finally leave Commoragh into Chapter 4, you are met with side-quests that are broken at best (for me, the Yrliet, Argenta and Marazhai questlines never appeared as complete, so I got locked out from seeing their proper endings due to it) and disappointing AND broken at worst (I've chased this pirate through the entire sector and you don't even give me an unique piece of gear and/or dialogue for killing him? Just finish combat and that's it?). As usual, final bossfight of chapter 4 is completely unbalanced, fight literally just starts and 3-4 of my teammates are dead consistently. And when you kill the cult leader and Lord of Change, that's the end of it, let's immediately go to chapter 5.
The beginning of chapter 5 is one of the most jarring ones I've seen. Suddenly my team is chasing the Inquisitor until the ends of the Expanse due to him doing his job, when I finish a dialogue with no stakes in it the entirety of Footfall is giving goodbyes as if they knew before me I'm going in a journey with no return, and suddenly I'm fighting Necrons and locked out of trading (yet the game still gives trading resources). Suddenly find the Inquisitor, alongside a Shard of the Void Dragon, kill both, end of it. That's the chapter 5 experience, and the ending of the game.",1705011970,1705011970,False,3,0,0.521934747695922852,0,True,False,False

I'll get the bad out of the way first:
-Owlcat games have pretty bad optimization and the longer the game goes on, the worse it gets, and this one is no exception.
-The writing is a bit too contemporary and your character should know that certain decisions have very, very bad consequences, but for some reason doesn't.
-More sidegrades in equipment would be appreciated in mid- to endgame, or some way to sidegrade/customize them with the help of Cult Mechanicus.
-Combat on the default difficulty was pretty easy, unless you stumbled on an area way too high level.
-If you run out of Navigator Insight, your only recourse is to jump between unsafe routes and hope that the die land on a specific encounter that [i]might[/i] give you more.
-Bolters are mostly trash

The good:
-It is an Owlcat game, so they've done their legwork in bringing the setting to life.
-78 hours for the first playthrough does give bang for buck, and I didn't manage to do everything either.
-Voidship combat is simplistic, but pretty satisfying.
-Combat in general is pretty fun with every archetype, except for the operative. Satisfying when you pull off combos and see a bunch of numbers.
-Pretty much every skill in the game is, if not critical, at least somewhat useful, except for Carouse.
-Replayable, like every Owlcat game.
-Characters can be specced into pretty much anything, allowing great flexibility.
-The story is okay and it wraps up okay too.

Neutral:
-There's a ton of cheese to be found and some math used in the game is insane (I conjured 2400 flogiston out of thin air, alongside 3000 xenotech and ~4000 profit factor), YMMV.
-Characters vary from stoic non-characters to annoyingly disrespectful. [spoiler]Enjoy the Black Ship, Idira.[/spoiler]
-There are some missed opportunities in how you deal with some characters. 
-If you want to reach max rank on any conviction, commit to it immediately and all the time.
-Some areas and boss encounters really stretch the limits what I'm ready to accept that the Rogue Trader could handle.

That all said, I'm gonna probably sink around 200 hours on this, a non-insignificant time of which is sitting in a loading screen. Like all Owlcat games, the technical side is lackluster, but it makes up for it with the world itself, which reminds me of Troika Games (RIP). 
I mostly don't have a problem with the stoic characters in the game, since this is 40k we're talking about, but the insane disrespect some characters fearlessly show the Trader boggles the mind.

When a player adjusts the font size to its maximum value, it is a clear indication that they require assistance in viewing the text. It signals, ""I need help. I can't see these fonts as they are, and I need them to be larger."" However, the game seems to overlook this setting in most places, defaulting to their fixed fonts.

In my opinion, when the font size is adjusted, it should uniformly affect all elements within the game, providing a comprehensive solution for players with visual accessibility needs. Everything should scale, just like it does in Windows.

Bizarrely, the inconsistency extends to the game's settings screens and even the accessibility tab itself.

This is really disappointing. In this image below, I included 2 font layers showing what the font size for 1440p should have probably used for the average consumer, let alone the 1.2 setting:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3136828188

The 36px amount is not arbitrary here - that is probably the smallest font size one should use at 1440p (54px for 4k) for this kind of text, and to be honest, 50px might have even been better. The film industry has rules and best practices surrounding subtitles and the like, but despite the gaming industry being worth far more these days, they are so behind on these standards.

And just visually compare those dialogue fonts with the font size in the accessibility options in my screenshots - it's like the game is just totally ignoring the font size option entirely:

I really feel for people on Steam Deck or are sitting several feet away from a 55"" tv. These fonts are absolutely not good enough for them. They are not even good enough for me sitting at my desk. It's a shame that this is the 1.2 option instead of the regular option. I shutter to think how small the normal option is.

It's kind of unplayable for me honestly. I genuinely don't understand Owl Cat's pattern of using such small font sizes in their games. The fonts could have been much bigger without really sacrificing anything.

As it stands, the first 3 chapters will have a number of bugs, usually (but not always) pretty small, and then once you hit the fourth the entire game will break before your eyes. A companion will begin to speak with you then the screen will cut to black. You never hear from them again. You'll look it up and see this issue has been around since release, and you irreparably have lost access to the latter half of a companion quest. Reload a save, the same thing happens again.

Visual bugs will go from bad to worse, such that they begin to happen with interact icons and impact gameplay, and instead of sometimes glitching a bit or showing hitboxes on accident, all the characters will stretch and warp as their models break. While noticeable during all parts of the game, by chapter 4 they become impossible to ignore. 

Multiple quests will begin to break in other ways than mentioned above. Characters will retain dialogue options from earlier stages of the questline, and clicking them either breaks the quest, suddenly sends it in a new direction, or ironically, sometimes fixes a quest you didn't even know was broken. Who knows! Dialogue options from companions you don't have can appear, rarely. Quests in one chapter will never trigger, then in the next will be in their completed form, with characters speaking to you about events you never got to experience. 

I want you, the reader, to understand how much you should avoid purchasing this game for now. I was willing to ignore the mostly-inconsequential bugs of the earlier chapters. I say mostly because I missed out on at least one entire quest of the main questline in chapter 2. Half of chapter 3 is poorly executed and annoying, which isn't helped by worsening bugs, but I still found the game enjoyable enough to keep going. Even when most of my companion quests either completely failed to trigger or shunted me off to some other branch of the quest triggered by options I never chose, I still was willing to at least see the main quest through and return to it later. Now that is broken too. People have been posting about the issue which stopped me for about a month, yet it persists unresolved.

I'm thoroughly enjoying this game so far. I played both of Owlcat's Pathfinder games, and while I did enjoy them, there was something that kept me from getting too far. I never could exactly pin down what it was, too many character options that I got distracted by or just a lack of interest in their setting or story. Whatever it was, it isn't present here, and I find myself continuing to return to it when I can.
The combat plays well, and the split of abilities between Origin, Homeworld, and Archetypes provides an interesting variety to individual characters that allows for everyone to hold a different role in combat. Each weapon class has its own advantages and disadvantages (personally I'm partial to flame weapons, despite their close range requirements) and it forces you to strike a balance and focus on building a team that has good synergy.
The narrative is also fantastic. I find myself genuinely struggling at times to make decisions between what I feel is morally-sound and what is strategically advantageous. The divide of morality along Dogmatic, Iconoclast, and Heretical lines allows for a middle-ground of non-religious response while also making no option inherently evil, hooray for the wonders of the Warhammer world and its grimdark, morally ambiguous ways.
Overall I'm really having a good time with this game, and look forward to how it continues to pan out and discovering more about the Big Bad's plan.

UPDATE: So, I'm 100 hours deeper into the game, and I do have a couple of things to note, one of which seems very prevalent in the other comments and reviews. There are definitely a fair number of small issues the game has that really just come down to quality control. Numerous typos and misspellings in dialogue, some glitches where it labels certain NPCs as random members of your party (or my personal favourite: your PC) while speaking, and a weirdly abrupt spike in skill check difficulty that seems to even be difficult to mitigate while min/maxing crew stats, but all of these are small things and can be forgiven. Mostly. (Seriously Owlcat did you do any proofreading on later chapters??)
The big one is the lag. Oh. My. Holy hells. The lag. It started around the beginning of Chapter 3 and it's just been downhill from there. It's basically only in combat, and I know it isn't my computer. (I played Baldur's Gate 3 on ultra without issues) I even tried humouring the game and turned my graphics to their lowest and it was just as bad. There's a fix that involves deleting a specific, seemingly unnecessary, game file (really?), which worked for about 30 hours of gameplay before the lag came back with a vengeance. Put the game file back, it got worse. I'm at the end of Chapter 4 out of 5 and I don't know if I can finish the game. Not because of the story, not because I'm not enjoying it, but because one turn of combat quite literally takes almost a minute sometimes. I was thoroughly enjoying this game in basically every other aspect and I'm so sad and annoyed that it just crumbled on its optimisation at the very freaking end. Hopefully future patches help, I have heard that the previous ones already have, so I'm holding out hope that one day the lag goes away and I can beat the game finally.

For the longest time i was torn on what i should rate this game but i have reached a point where i just have to give it a negative review, simply because the coop is one of the worst i have seen in a very long time.

Originally this game was supposed to be singleplayer only but a few weeks prior to release the announced that it was going to feature a 6 player coop mode, sounds crazy right? Tones of people claimed it was going to be like Baldurs Gate but with Warhammer so naturally i got quite excited for that. Then launch rolls around and we all starts playing but soon we realized the coop was off... really off.

To put it simply the coop in this game is GOD AWFUL, the implementation of it is lazy and so poorly executed that it suprises me no one else seems to have as much issues with it as i do. DO NOT i say again DO NOT buy this game if you intend to play it in coop. If you yet still want to play it in coop then get used to the message ""This action can only be performed by the Rogue Trader"" because you will see it a lot.

The coop is literally just jury rigged together, 90% of the game can only be done by the host like opening doors, choosing dialog options, flying the ship, walking around in the hub, selecting the characters for the party and a bunch more. This is not coop, its watch the host play most of the game while you wait for the next combat after enduring a 30 minute section of pure unvoiced text dialog. If you happen to play with someone as the host that gets angry easily when you touch something you apparently were not supposed to touch yet that also does not help the whole situation. 

Bottom line is i cant even fully say something about the game itself as the absolutely terrible awful coop just ruins pretty much all fun one could have.

[strike] Update 1.0.89 (Part 2)

Coming back after a few patches to see if Owlcat has finally finished this game and spoiler alert they still have a long way to go. This game makes me so mad because it is going to be great and Owlcat eventually does a good job but why do they shoot themselves in the foot? TLDR Owlcat still doesn't deserve you money, wait until they do.

Most of the talents seem to be fixed but some are still broken.

The game breaking bug I encountered has been fixed. (I anticipate I will find another)

On the bright side in this play through my allies have not fully burst fired my characters to death from behind... yet. This is sadly no longer true. All I can say is F*** who ever programmed your AI friends.

Your character will still run right through identified traps. Again this should never happen in any CRPG.  Movement in CRPGs is not their strong point. Why punish the player for that when their char already found the trap?

Void Ship Combat still sucks. What is worse than not being able to tell which way you ship will face when your orientation determines everything in combat? A move previewer that tells you the wrong information. If you cant get even get the fundamentals down keep it out of you game. Void Ship Combat is a cool idea and I want to love it but man did the inters program this part?

Update Patch 1.0.78: Two weeks into release and everything from before is still applicable. Also a list of which talents are not broken would be shorted. I have not even made it to the later acts to see what insane bugs are drawing attention way from making basic talents work.

Right now Owlcat does not deserve your money or support. (Still True)

Original Review

Buggy ass mess. Fix your shit then we will talk. Also I say this on every CRPG if my Char finds a trap the party should NEVER auto path through it! BG3 and now Rogue Trader both commit this sin and its unacceptable. Also ship battles could be cool but you literally cant move where it says you can and points you in directions that do not correspond to the move preview.  Adding to the awful parts of ship battles, you will allways go last and the enemies will kill you before you move.  The amount of garbage mixed with gold is amazing. Pass hard on this until it is fixed. I wish I could. Another ""fun"" oversight, your allies will burst fire you to death while aiming at a melee foe. I have lost more character from friendly fire than the enemy.  This game that i want to love gets worse and worse. 

Story note: (Spoilers) The start of the third act is horrible.  You get railroaded so hard it made me lose any interest in the story.  It is clear that they didn't know how/try to write compelling reasons for what happens and went with the old, ""the bad guy is so smart and cleaver you will just fall into his traps, over and over again because the PC apparently has brain damage."" I have a clairvoyant psyker, and an agent of the inquisition specializing in xenon (specifically drukhari), have been tricked twice before and have been warned that the drukhari are after me but still I am forced to walk right into a situation that might as well say ""WARNING this is a TRAP created by a 5 year old.""

I even can't wait to give it a ""Yes"" as my recommendation. Yet, this game was released in a pretty sorry state. This really should have been an early access release because I would've been better informed as to whether or not I wanted to dedicate 100+ hours to an unfinished product. 

The bugs are numerous, as are the cohesion issues that exist apart from any errors that caused them, as well as the cohesion issues caused by them. I understand that it's hard to make a game of this scope move smoothly and contradict itself the least bit possible, but as it stands the amount of plot contradictions I've read, failures to mention the death of characters at times that would be appropriate causing conversations to go forward as if those people were still alive are many. Certain sidequests or more commonly, planetary events that shouldn't be able to happen due to the death of side characters are present enough that you'll be running into the double digits as far as spotted contradictions go. 
Some quests don't resolve at the proper time or they don't resolve at all, sometimes leaving you screwed out of experience or even rewards such as weapons or armor. Combat is a lot of fun until your characters action economy gets intricate enough that the game starts having trouble keeping up with all the extra turns and what should be allowed during them. There's a plethora of smaller things like animation errors, plenty of t-posing abound. The frequency of occurrence for any of these small, or large issues shoots up exponentially the further you get into the game. I found it deeply discouraging and it's kinda dented my ability to have fun with it. 

This last note isn't a criticism as much as it is just something to be aware of, this game is REALLY combat heavy to the point that sometimes it wears on me a little bit, but that isn't for lack of other content or conversational choices, it's just such a large game that combat will be taking up a SIGNIFICANT portion of your time. I kind of wish there were more opportunities for ship combat too.

After a full run, some update: while the game is good and represents the genre, as well as the source material quite well, it's far from perfect. 

Bugs are definitely an issue: I found myself googling around for solutions more than once just to be able to progress. Saving often helps there. Some talents are evidently also bugged, as showcased by my character who ended up having infinite heroic acts per turn at his disposal (and yes, happened to be of the attack type).

The way the game and the writing both sort of just melt away into a meaningless dungeon crawl towards the end was also a bit disappointing. Getting a rundown of events supposedly happening after the big finale helped a bit in getting back some of the illusion that choices mattered - even if some of the bits were contradictory to what my choices actually were. 

Overall, still, I spent plenty of hours on this with no regrets and am planning on spending more. The depiction of the setting in general is refreshing in all of its grimdark ridiculousness and I'm looking forward to seeing how a different approach will affect things.

I'm not 100% convinced that this isn't a beta release...
Is it fun and immersive? Yes.
Can it be tedious and long-winded? Yes.

It has a good story so far. I've been playing Warhammer 40k since the 90s across all mediums. This game absolutely confuses me. I often have no idea what I'm doing, not because of WH Lore... But because the game doesn't explain things well or offer hints.

There doesn't appear to be a waypoint system, so you have to just wander around to figure out where to go for the next objective.

I've picked up upgrades for weapons or armor, but have no idea how to apply them.

But taking all of the above into consideration, would I recommend this game? Yes I would. Because despite all that they did Good by the Warhammer Lore.

The combat is thoroughly enjoyable, it is alive and the sounds of the weapons are spot on with how they should be.

The character customization, abilities and items are beautifully done. You have the choice between several archetypes and can customize your characters to suit your play style exactly.

The only real issue I have with the game is the dialogue. Sometimes it's voice acted, sometimes it's not.

Now obviously we could easily say they only voice acted the main characters and any random NPC you talk to doesn't need to be voice acted, that is fair. However oftentimes you will be talking with a main character and only a portion of their dialogue is voice acted.

It's like if the dialogue you're in has to do with the main story then they voice acted it. If the dialogue that you're in is just you making idle chit chat during a mission or when you're on your ship in downtime, then it's not voice acted.

I would like to see a major update where every single solitary bit of dialogue in the game is voice acted. Especially considering the dialogue you have with NPCs can be Pages long.

I spent over 100 hours the last two weeks playing this game that for a long time was incredibly fun and rewarding. But the more I've played, the more frustrating game design choices and bewildering bugs I've encountered and I'm truly at my wit's end.

Rogue Trader is incredibly fun until you reach Chapter 3 - and right from the getgo it was a drop in quality. I spend hours trying to figure out what to do before finally finding where I needed to go. Then out of nowhere I'm thrown into area that benefits - no, [i] necessitates [/i] - prior knowledge in order to get by. [spoiler] Being forced to grind through this dull, linear, irritating Comorragh I endured with mostly a smile on my face until I reached the final part of this accursed level. Traps around every corner that require seemingly 100 awareness to have a chance at spotting, followed by the catalyst: the fight against Yremyress. Words cannot begin to describe (besides BULLSH1T) how ridiculously infuriating this fight is. Turn 1 RNG, lack of decent cover, terrible agility in comparison to the AI, additional adds, and to top it all off crashing TWICE mid fight after a ridiculous drop in frames made me throw in the towel, even after attempting the stair strat many times. When I'm wasting hours of my life trying to pass through a single godforsaken fight just to get through it and not to enjoy it, the game no longer is a hobby and has become a chore. Say skill diff all you want, I flat out have not had an ounce of fun the last 10 hours or so. [/spoiler]

Until the ample amount of bugs and [spoiler] the Yremyress boss is nerfed [/spoiler], I refuse to play Rogue Trader. Many years have past since I've legitimately given a game a negative review on Steam; I only make this vent my frustrations while I wait however long it takes Owlcat to fix this glorious pile of potential.

Update: upon finishing the game, it occurred to me how grueling the midpoint of the game is compared to its beginning and finale. While the game retains lots of issues going into the final two chapters, I'm glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the final third of Rogue Trader. The game is still very buggy, unfinished/rushed in several areas, and has balancing issues but for me those problems were incapable of truly dampening my experience completing my first playthrough.

Loving this so far. How there hasn't been a decent traditional RPG set in the 40K universe before now is crazy. This very much scratches that itch.  The setting and writing are both very nicely done too. I'm 10 hours in now and haven't encountered any significant bugs. A couple of minor graphical quirks and one time I needed to briefly exit to the menu screen to get full functionality back, but nothing even remotely game-breaking.  Whether the lack of bugs means that the patches have done the job, or if I just haven't hit the problem areas, I can't say.  I'll update this again when I'm further along.

Edit 1: A couple of points I've noticed since the initial review (now more than 40 hours played):
- Load times on changing areas are long and do get a little tiresome. This is on a modern and pretty decent spec PC, and installed on an SSD).
- I still haven't had any game-breaking bugs, but crashes to desktop are not uncommon now. Maybe every 4 or 5 hours play, but sometimes you seem to get little spates of them. Whether this was introduced by the recent patch or if they are area specific, I'm not sure.
- It's amazing how long you have to spend before the game opens up and gives you access to all the mechanics and options (though I don't know for sure if that is even true yet). It was over 40 hours for me, but I do play slow / read everything etc, so could be quite a bit quicker if you push through. Until this point, the decision space is a little limited and feels somewhat railroaded. I don't mind this particularly, but something to be aware of.
- I've only scratched the surface of ship-to-ship combat, but it feels a little tacked-on / thin. Maybe it improves with levelling up the ship and more difficult enemies, but my first thought is that it doesn't add a great deal to the experience. Edit 2: It does get a lot better and more interesting.  There is some real tactical depth and playing well is the difference between a comfortable victory and getting absolutely ruined.

Edit 3:
-This doesn't really impact anything gameplay wise, but sometimes your companions start dialogues with people either not currently in your party, or even not yet recruited. It's a little jarring from an immersion perspective (and can introduce minor spoilers).

Edit 4: I'm getting much more serious bugs towards the end of Act 2 (circa 100 hours for me).  Corrupted save files, refusing to save at all at times, periods of unplayable slowdown / stuttering and getting stuck in dialogues without any way to return to the main interface.  I'm trying a reinstall after verifying the game files didn't complete properly. I think, like a lot of people have said, unless you are desperate to try it out or are willing to brave the potential issues, it might be best to wait a few months before picking this up.

But it released buggy, broken and untested. A month after release, there remains a host of bugs and, frankly, thoughtless design decisions. 

The first 50 hours are a joy as you discover more about the characters, races, and themes of the setting (when you don't lose hours of game-time due to frequent game-breaking bugs in combat (the worst of which appear to be fixed now?)). However, this does make the game feel rather front-loaded, which disadvantages your later companions.

The post-Chapter 3 sections of the game are a clear decline in quality compared to the game's start, both in story and design.

Frustrations are countless and only grow as the game progresses; you'll find that many of the in-game mechanics do not function as described, written or intended, frequently break and lack logic in their implementation. 

Your Space Wolf companion, Ulfar, for example (if the game doesn't lock you out of getting him), will frequently get stuck at the start of combat or be unable to even enter the battlefield because he is larger than your other companions and will not fit through a narrow path. The conversation that locks you out of getting Ulfar can, and did for me (prior to back tracking a couple of hours), occur with Tervantias, shortly before meeting Ulfar and without any reference to the space marine, leaving you clueless to this fact unless you google it. (When you first meet Ulfar you may need to reload like 5-10 minutes if you immediately went through all of Tervantias's dialogue trees, post his initial conversation)

Enemies appear to heal when you target them with certain damaging abilities (like operator momentum abilities) to end up with more health after the hit when there is no described reason for this interaction. 

Abilities that have split options for your primary and secondary weapons simply do not work on Pasqal, your Ad-Mech companion, due to his unique equipment set.

Non-playable allies will frequently stand behind your back-line and burst fire, potentially downing your fragile units due to the ineptitude of your allied NPCs.

And, companions will often stand just out of range of providing their skills in conversations if you don't position them prior, a needless hassle.

Frustrations aside, if you're a fan of 40k and narrative-rich games and are patient and save often, I'm sure you'll get something out of this game.

[h1]Spoilers below![/h1]

For context, I am a veteran of the Rogue Trader tabletop RPG, so my experiences are coloured by the fact. I played through almost the entire campaign on Daring difficulty, which gives no penalties or bonuses and feels like the most balanced difficulty most of the time despite being a step above 'normal'.

+ This game looks, sounds, and feels great. The developers paid attention. Generally speaking, it is a very immersive 40k game. Standouts include the game's depiction of Footfall, which is my favourite part of the whole game - the environments, music and ambience combines for a simply wonderful experience. The voice acting ranges from adequate to excellent and never took me out of the experience.

+ The combat system is adapted well. Splitting half/full actions into an AP system makes sense, and diversifying statlines for even more granularity is helpful for a video game environment. Land battles feel good, look good enough, and are quite fun in their own right.

+ The story and writing is excellent. I was impressed with how complex the narrative could get at times, and how difficult some moral choices presented to you were, even if you chose to try to play a 'good' character. There are three main moral paths - a generally good humanitarian one called Iconoclast, a fanatical and arrogant evil path called Dogmatic, and a generally chaotic and cruel evil path called Heretical. I am curious to someday play through the story with one of the other two (especially Heretical) to see how the story changes, because (thanks to item tooltip spoilers) it seems you outright get access to a couple of different companions if you do. I have to give extra praise to the epilogue which, despite being essentially a glorified powerpoint, is -extremely- long and thorough, addressing the fate of every significant character, location and decision in the story.

+ Exploration is well rewarded. Rogue Trader is very much about exploration and has always been, and chapter 2 - which is where you unlock the star map proper - is where I spent most of my playtime exploring every system in the game. I wish there'd be more of a conclusive feeling once you had fully explored each optional planet on foot, as it felt like you sometimes made shocking discoveries without anyone addressing it, but generally I never tired of just going to the next star system and seeing what awaited.

- The game is buggy and unpolished. It starts well, but the later in the game you go, the worse it gets. By chapter 5 (the last chapter) I had a softlock bug that required installing a third party mod to get past, and dreadful game performance. Generally there are many odd things though. Vanishing tooltips, abilities with missing animations, one fight in chapter 2 I even had the enemies stuck in T-pose the entire fight. A very frequent bug is enemies getting stuck for 10-20 seconds (after which the game auto passes their turn) which is more annoying than anythjing else, and generally enemy AI makes them sometimes take very weird decisions like running back and forth in a line.

- Balancing is inconsistent. As mentioned, I played almost the entire campaign on Daring. Like above, it starts out well - chapter one has a reasonable difficulty curve with a very arduous and intimidating (but perfectly winnable, I needed a couple of tries) bossfight at the end, and chapter two is mostly fine as well despite it being when you unlock the 'open world' (aside from a planet whose fight is clearly tuned for chapter four). But difficulty becomes more inconsistent the further you go. The last fight of chapter 3 was the most difficult fight in the game for me, though I struggled for unrelated reasons I will detail below, and phase one of the main boss in chapter 4 was significantly harder than any fight that followed it for the rest of the game - after that point, the damage dealt by enemies seemed to drop off greatly, and your characters weren't in any real danger anymore. Speaking of inconsistent balancing...

- Space battles. This is where I ran into the first real bummer in the game. The first few tutorial space battles ease you into it, but from there, things get quite janky. Difficulty becomes extremely inconsistent - I had to turn down the difficulty in a land battle only once, but I had to do it several times in space battles during chapter 2, as early on your ship is very weak and enemies you run into are simply too overtuned. One such battle saw my ship be destroyed on turn one. Some things are also unexplained and seem to be bugged, and generally space battles quickly became a chore.

- Late game balancing. Early on, stats are tight, but the further you go into the game, the more out of control stats get as exponential stat buffs can be used to buff other exponential stat buffs, creating ridiculous monster characters that melt even enormous bosses like paper. Some bosses do use this against you as well, but as mentioned above, this falls off towards the endgame, and it makes some mechanics (like certain giant chapter 5 enemies with a 95% damage shield to the front) simply be irrelevant because you brute force them.

- Star chart battles. I like the idea of warp route dangers in theory, it is lore accurate and a reasonable mechanic, but it's easy to get fooled into spending insight on making routes green when routes that are yellow usually only cause harmless flavour text. Orange routes on the other hand force you into a land battle most of the time (unless you have spare resources), and this ends up becoming tediously repetitive over the course of the game as quests send you to and fro over the star map. 

- Chapter 3. This may be a controversial opinion, and this is where most of the spoiler warning was for. Chapter 3 takes place in Commorragh. Now, to the developers' credit, Commorragh is depicted in a very immersive, lore-accurate and detailed manner. Unfortunately, Commorragh is also not a very fun place to be. Environments are samey, there's some nasty bugs, early on you lose all your equipment and have to arduously get it back and set it all back up again, and you also get two new characters who you may be curious to try out - but doing so is a trap, as the chapter has no respec and almost no party swapping opportunities, and the characters are likely to be a lot weaker out of the gate than whoever you replaced them with. (This is a big part of why I struggled so greatly with the chapter 3 endboss, by the time I got stuck on it I'd have to go back hours and hours to reach a party swap point). Chapter 3 alone is the main thing deterring me from starting a second playthrough.

- Finally, a little minus: the mass of skills and talents gets really dense in the late game, and it starts becoming unclear what exactly contributes to the results you are seeing. The combat log has made a valiant attempt to explain every detail, but it doesn't quite go all the way to explain how I reach a 3000 damage hit with a 30-45ish base damage weapon (as happened on the main boss of chapter 4).

All in all, this is a tarnished jewel of a game, but go in with appropriate expectations and you will have 100+ hours of fun.",1704851430,1704851430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I lost a few hours of game play but didn't run into the bug again and was able to continue on with the main story. Make sure you save regularly so you can go back prior to the encounter with major bugs like that.

The voice acting in this game is fantastic, however only a portion of the dialogue has voice acting. If you don't mind reading a lot this won't be an issue. If you do, the reading may become tedious.

Edit: Exception - The romance portions of this game's story are terrible and the conclusions make no sense, souring the rest of the game. Even some of the romance dialog choices throughout can cause nonsensical reactions from some of the characters and can lock you out of their romance storyline.

Also, It feels like a lot of companions are bricked because you are unable to respec them fully. I don't know why the devs wont allow you to respec them back to 0, but it feels horrible being stuck with un-optimal companions that may not fit into your party.

Combat mechanics are another strong point. They're relatively intricate and offer a satisfying level of strategy, demanding thoughtful planning and execution especially on harder difficulties. It's clear that Owlcat Games has applied their experience from previous titles to refine these aspects.

However, the game is significantly let down by its execution and quality control. Another feature of Owlcat initial releases. Players will encounter bugs that range from minor annoyances (abilities don't work) to game-breaking issues (borked quests), which severely detract from the overall experience. This is disappointing, especially given the potential.

My recommendation for those interested is to wait. Hold off until these bugs are addressed in future updates or patches.

- good replayability since many choices have lots of consequences in the companions' and storyline's events. You can be a bitch to the companions if you want, I chose to be nice and it brang good consequences.

You might want to get it on sale though and check the status of bugfixes at this point because there are a lot of bugs.

Ultimately, Rogue Trader is a compelling and immersive crpg that has been let down by being released before it was finished.

First off, Owlcat have really done a great job of capturing the essence of the setting. It feels lived in and makes Warhammer 40K seem like more than Space Marines and the adventures thereof. The atmosphere, the characters, the music and the abundance of lore, all come together to weave and intricate tapestry that is amazing to explore.

The first half of the game is pretty tight, good pacing, a wide array of side content and choice based quests and narrative with good reactivity. The game really shines here and is really enjoyable to play. But it is most definitely front loaded. This level of polish (by Owlcat Standards atleast) does not persist throughout the game. Not all is well, mind you. There are features in the game that don't function as intended or minor bugs but it goes unnoticed in the early game as the important stuff works.

Then you get to Act 3 and beyond. Unfortunately, it is here the game is marred by a multitude of broken mechanics and systems. Entire  side quests don't trigger or completing this side quest or that, doesn't register that it has completed. Companion quests are quite buggy, in-game events don't fire properly. Character feats don't work or work contrary to descriptions. Even the ending slides are a bit of a mess, not reflecting accurately the choices you make in your playthrough and some people don't even get most of the slides at all. There are reports of game stopping bugs in the 4th Act, though I was fortunate enough not to experience those myself. They do exist.

Add to this that Act 3 really interrupts the flow and pacing established in the first two acts. You get whisked away, a literal prisoner of circumstance that is unavoidable for plot reasons. There is really only one path through this act, you can decide who comes out the other side as your allies and who comes out dead, but it doesn't really feel reactive or impactful the way choices do in the previous acts. 

This is compounded further in the fourth and then final fifth act, where there is a distinct drop in content and the quality of that which is there. The 4th Act has us return the the Koronus Expanse but there isn't much left there to do. Especially if you were diligent in developing colonies and pursuing side content in the early game. Act 4 feels a little barren in comparison. The showdown with the primary villians from the prologue and Act 1 feels anticlimactic and depending on the choices you make, very lacking in fleshed out reactivity. There are unexpected companions you can pick up here, but they wind up having next to no dialogue or real engagement with the player or the narrative. It feels unfinished and the potential unrealised. Which is a real pity.

The final act is remarkably brief and enemy encounters become incredibly spongey too, with massive health pools that are a pain to whittle down. The brisk and fast paced combat of the early game can become bogged down and mired in the usual Turn Based slog.

There is so much to enjoy in this game and yet it is held back by a sense that the game just wasn't finished and was rushed out the door too soon. The patches to fix bugs just haven't been coming fast enough and I have no doubt it damages Owlcats and Rogue Traders reputations no end.

If you love Warhammer 40K, if you love CRPG's and have to play them all, if you are a dogged fan or Owlcat, by all means get this game.

If however you are more discerning, do some research. Check the status of bugs and bug fixing at time of purchase and check the discord and Steam forums for opinions. Maybe buy it on a sale. 

As of the time of this review, be sure you really want this game. I've enjoyed it and I am a huge fan of Owlcats previous game Wrath of the Righteous, but even I found this hard to get through because the sheer volume of bugs.",1702807067,1704836418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
* Great character building -- it's overwhelming at first but once you're over the hump it really gets going
* Satisfying combat
* I personally enjoy the 40k universe
* Space combat is unique and mostly fun
* The story/lore over the first couple acts is interesting and not a generic ""big baddie"" thing

Cons:
* Act 3 features the horrendous cRPG trope where you get captured, lose all your items, and lose your whole party
* Act 4-5 the storyline unfortunately turns into the generic ""big baddie"" thing, at least to some extent
* Space combat can get annoying if you have to do too much of it, or have to replay a fight after failing
* I'd say the game is too long, overall -- it wore out its welcome once my party became unstoppable gods

Из недостатков можно выделить малое число сопартийцев, не самый лучший финал (опять эти карточки) и есть придирки к поведению некоторых героев. Но ничего значительного, по крайней мере по итогу одного прохождения.

Она хоть и стала проще относительно WotR, но все еще непонятная. Понятно, что это фича, чтобы фанаты боевой системы могли всем этим обмазываться, но я к другому. Мой негатив не к тому, чтобы упростить, а сделать понятнее. Тут как я понял дело в интерфейсе. При левел апе, очень тяжело понять, что мне казуальному игроку сейчас прокачивать.
Например, возьмем оперативника. По сути у него 2 основных класса.
Снайпер. Стреляет с другого конца карты, накачал восприятия и выдает очень здравые криты.
Дебаффер. Сидит накидывает уязвимости и дает бафы и дефабы.
Что мешает дать казуалам выбор из этих двух классов, а при левел апе в рекомендациях выдавать скилы именно этих классов. (Это не вопрос, понятно что бабло).
В идеале хотелось бы увидеть не просто рекомендации, а прям обучение для самых маленьких. Вроде получил левел и на каждом апе мне дают выбор и объясняют, какие прикольные штуки я могу делать. Выбери перк1 и получи опцию стакать дебафф и еще сильнее бафать урон по врагу или выбери перк2 и получи опцию при использовании скила получать бафф к уклонению итп.

But I can not wholly recommend it in its current state due to the amount of bugs present which may keep the game from progressing, both in the main questline and in multiple side quests.

People say the game gets really buggy in Act 4. Guess they've been lucky, because I can't even get past the start of Act 2 because of bugs.

The game clearly wasn't finished, and there are numerous bugs that make the combat a frustrating chore. Abilities will regularly fail to fire, including Heroic Abilities, and the core mechanic for the Assassin is broken (The mark will be on the left side of the target but the actual trigger for the bonus damage will be on the right side). Some abilities are bugged and only deal 20% of what they're supposed to, and the difficulty curve is poorly tuned in that you can go from breezing through fights in a single round, to losing half your party in a single round, and then suddenly the combat will go back to being a mere road bump to your story progression.

 This is made significantly worse with the broken skills and mechanics I've already mentioned. You can easily waste an entire turn setting up for an ability that just refuses to function. After reloading in a boss fight 8 times due to broken mechanics/abilities wasting my turns, I finally decided to shelve the game for however long it takes for them to fix these issues.

I beat the campaign and have to agree with what a lot of others have said in that the game was front-loaded with content (the first two acts are GREAT) and then it tapers off into nothing with a lot of questions left unanswered. Now this doesn't mean left unanswered in the sense that there's meant to be room for explanation later (i.e. DLC). It felt like several of the quest lines, namely the companion ones, were just cut short so the game release could happen.  
The game is buggy. I had to install ToyBox to get through some campaign-bricking game crashes. You shouldn't need a mod to make a game work. The game wasn't finished or tested enough. They should have delayed the release instead of putting out something unfinished.
""All builds are viable"" only works for normal difficulty or lower. The combat system is very complex and the numbers have to be drastically bloated to apply a sense of difficulty. The travel system is tedious and leads to a lot of unnecessary and bland combat. You have to spend a finite resource to respec characters or create more.

So you have medkits that will heal old Injuries but not traumas for some reason. However when you go back to the ship you can get rid of traumas the problem with the Main story missions is theres no way to heal the traumas because they deny you access to your ship and medkits will only heal old wounds. Traumas majorly hurt your gameplay so its awful when you have alot of them built up. Also the main boss fights are the biggest pains in the ass theyll have you doing secondary objectivies while the bos gets to smack you three times (Aurora). Then the boss will  spawn in more and more minions, thats not even mentioning the other mechanics like recovering half their health when they are half health, or automatically attacking when when hurt so much. I started my playthrough on Unfair difficulty which I dont mind the challenge its just when I get down with an intense fight let me heal all the way (INCLUDING TRAUMAS) So playing load save simulator. Also psychers have the dumbest mechanic in the game. Who TF wants a warp monster to appear out of no where when using a character Id understand in the beginning but when the psychic rating goes up that should reduce the chances. Just improve the healing mechanic or allow me to go back to a rest point in EVERY MISSION.

The bad parts? overall the game is clunky and im sure they will work on those tweaks but as of right now it lends itself to time wasted and unneeded frustration. The thing I dislike the most is the game mechanics, they suck. just my opinion. 40k is supposed to be relatively easy to play even the RPGs, this is overly complicated. If your not a Min Max type it really isn't for you. Most reviews I read were of the its better than crack and then you always have the it sucks balls. It reminds me when kingmaker came out, took some time to make it better but it never really was Pathfinder, not really.

It is infuriating fighting enemies that just randomly regenerate because ""game mechanics"" or when you do kill them they somehow re-spawn because ""game mechanics"".

Why?

Update: This game is just pure frustration and will infuriate you. Every fight is littered with the same ridiculous game mechanics ""just to make it harder"", just about every fight you start off at a tactical disadvantage due to terrain/cover.

Despite the hours I have in this game I actually hate it. Hope the developer never gets another opportunity to do a 40k game.

Every time I I come across some game breaking mechanic I'm adding to this negative review. This time it's the chapter 4 fight against the chaos space marines. Literally what is the point, you get dropped right in the middle of them and not once have I seen them miss an attack.

Suffer, bitch! Choose between dozens or even hundreds of perks on levelups.  Prepare to read tons of text on each perk. For each levelup of each companion.  Thou some of them could not work at all or work incorrectly. Just be prepared.

The game - like most Owlcat titles at first - shines where it works. The later you come into this the better your experience is probably going to be. For brevity I'll do a pro cons list like the walking cliche I am.

PROS:
* Great story telling, with very surprising moments.
* Your choices matter.
* LOTS of passives talents, which means building a character becomes quite intricate.
* Companions are well written and the romances like Yrliet are pleasantly unusual, when they don't stop working because of bugs and you somehow find yourself alone in the epilogue without your Space Elf Waifu.
* When you click with the combat it can feel incredibly rewarding. Pump swaths with burst studs or heavy bolters, or unleash psychic devastation.

* High level cap. FINALLY FREEDOM from level <=20 jail. 55 seems to be it, though you'll likely not reach it.

CONS:
If the pros list got you, I wouldn't even read this part as I already mentioned bugs, but for fairness here goes.

* BUGS. This will be less and less over time, but I did have to manually progress using Toybox (MOD) a few times because of game breaking bugs. I was also romantically abandoned but I take that as a real life reflection for the lols apparently.

* Slow paced combat. You do figure out a groove eventually but combat can become a bit of a slog when everything is turn based and enemies start having huge health pools, or every warp you get attacked and can't farm insight to lower this.

* World map is, well, I mean, it's gorgeous, but like in the above, navigator's insight being a VERY finite resource is not explained. You have to be very careful on lowering dangerous routes or suffer considerably later on. Focusing on making direct routes from colonies to your capital is what I'd suggest.

* Reputation is fucked. Or was for you in the future. You CANNOT get max rep with anyone except the navy. This may be a formula issue or a ""We forgot the 0"" issue but considering how much equipment is locked at max rep, it's a great misfortune. The market system is very novel but you should absolutely be able to max 2 of 4 factions a playthrough. On my close to completionist playthrough most were at half, one 3/4. Even doing a HUGE favor for all the factions nets you a measily 500 rep.

* Psychic power balance. Minor gripe. Pyromancy is explained as the boom aspect, it isn't. It has great passives but fairly weak actives. Telepathy is the boom aspect. Biomancy has 0 offence despite being used offensively in cutscenes. Santic is awesome but sword of light is buggy and impractical. More importantly though, veil degredation is a little too punishing early on. You need your navigator to lower it (the only reliable way in the whole game) but even then you'll stop casting because of it a LOT. Alleviated later on with your own stat bloat.

* Extremely few classes. 4 classes. That's it? Kinda. They diversivy based on your origin (huge for navigator - which you cannot be) and you can mix and match them up with later sub classes but it still feels a little samey and barren. No archetype seems to be designed for Psykers (Willpower based) as well which is a bit disapointing but Soldier works surprisingly well, and Arch Militant does too if you excuse its main buff not working properly if you switch from single psychic to aoe psychic.


Honestly though, all these could be fixed with patches and the remaining DLC. Take out the bugs part alone and the game is so worth it already. This is a 120+ hour adventure and is fantastic. I would go in with Toybox for now though, or in the long run if you want ""player sexual"" characters.",1704707775,1704707775,True,0,0,0.498377084732055664,0,True,False,False

It's a game that is very ambitious but overall gets in its own way too much. I have been a fan of Owlcats and player both Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous many times. This game is rougher than both of them, but it was a good introduction for me into the world of Warhammer 40K, which I always heard about but never bothered explore (being a longtime D&D fan). 

The game's number one flaw is that it's trying to do too much. If you are familiar with Owlcats games then you have seen this in Kingmaker where the management of the kingdom kind of got in your way too much, they improved this in WOTR where you could delegate some of it, and it did not get in your way too much while you were adventuring, but here, they regressed to a very poor state. Basically, to move around the universe of the game, you have to ""warp jump"" from start system to star system (so you cannot go from system A to system D, you have to jump A to B, B to C, C to D) and almost every jump there's something going on (an invasion of your ship and a mini-fight, a skill check event, a companion wants to talk to you, a colony event needs your attention, the ship has taken damage, ..., etc). Every jump. So, by the time you get to system D you forget what you even wanted to do there. It's incredibly distracting and provides little entertainment or thinking value. Feels like getting advertisers calls at home when you are trying to enjoy a movie. 

The game also lacks polish. Several quests are bugged (only one companion quest was fatally broken for me), many skill checks are bugged (instead of using anyone in the party, they use the main character), you'll find yourself save-scumming if you care about learning and understanding the full plot of what's happening in the story. 

The arch-types (classes), talents leveling up and combat were interesting and a cool change of pace. Space combat is a fun distraction. But overall, the game is just bogged down by all these minute, meaningless events. I hope they improve that in future updates. I usually get a lot of value from Owlcats game by playing the games again and trying different moral alignments...

A Dream Come True for Warhammer 40k Fans, but Mac Users Beware

As a fervent Warhammer 40k enthusiast, the announcement of OwlCat Games venturing into the grim darkness of the far future with their adaptation of Rogue Trader had me brimming with excitement. Having thoroughly enjoyed their previous work on Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, my expectations were high, and for the most part, they were met with this new foray into the 41st millennium.

OwlCat Games has managed to capture the essence of the Warhammer 40k universe admirably, delivering a gaming experience that feels authentic to the lore and atmosphere. The attention to detail in the visuals, the gritty soundtrack, and the faithful adaptation of the Rogue Trader narrative all contribute to an immersive experience that Warhammer fans will undoubtedly appreciate.

However, my enthusiasm is tempered by a significant issue that plagues the Mac version of the game, reminiscent of a problem encountered in their previous Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous release. During the prologue, a game-breaking bug rears its ugly head, halting progress and leaving me frustrated. This issue brings to mind the black screen problem in the commanders' tent during the first chapter of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous for Mac users.

While OwlCat Games has proven their dedication to addressing bugs and issues in the past, the recurrence of similar problems in their Mac releases is disheartening. As much as I want to recommend Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader to fellow Mac players, I cannot in good conscience do so until these critical issues are resolved.

For players on other platforms, the game offers a tantalizing glimpse into the expansive and captivating Warhammer 40k universe. The blend of tactical combat, rich storytelling, and the freedom to explore the vastness of space as a Rogue Trader make for an engaging experience. I eagerly await the day when Mac users can fully enjoy this stellar addition to the Warhammer 40k gaming catalog. Until then, caution is advised for those seeking to embark on a journey through the grim darkness of the far future on a Mac platform.

EDIT: Greetings Warhammer 40k enthusiasts,

I'm thrilled to share an update on my experience with Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader on Mac. After encountering a frustrating black screen issue during the prologue, I'm pleased to report that the problem has been resolved.

The development team swiftly addressed the bug, and I'm now able to progress through the game seamlessly. Kudos to OwlCat Games for their prompt action in fixing the issue and ensuring a smooth gaming experience for Mac users.

With the bug squashed, I'm delighted to change my rating to a wholehearted ""recommend."" The game offers a rich and immersive dive into the Warhammer 40k universe, and with the technical hiccup out of the way, I can wholeheartedly encourage fellow Mac players to embark on this thrilling journey.

Thank you to the community for your support and understanding during the hiccup. Let's continue exploring the grim darkness of the far future together!",1702149643,1704697183,True,0,0,0.488376528024673462,1,True,False,False

I would say if basing on Chapters 1 and 2 alone, I'd give this game an 8/10. The issues I had in Chapters 1 and 2 were more so too many load screens, lack of voice acting (which isn't too bad) for many areas, and the coop features isn't too refined. The positives -- the game did a great job to stick with the lore, and overall very fun game.

Now for Chapter 3. Numerous bugs, incomplete quests/dialog, and really just poorly designed quests. The Chasm is the first area you start in, and without spoiling, the mechanics employed here are just lazy. Combined with the many load screens (most load screens I've played of any game in my entire history since the 1990s), this becomes a very clunky game. It gets old after 50 hours and beyond.

Pros:
Writing is excellent.
They nailed the 40k setting.
Cool and interesting decisions to make.
Very much grimdark, as it should be.
Unique leveling system.
Companions are interesting and fit the enough of the niche's I was hoping for.
Ship combat exists and I dig it, but I know it's not for everyone.

OK:
Combat, could be better, it feels pretty clunky and can fights can be a chore/sluggish at times, but it's serviceable.
Leveling System - feels like it doesn't explain or assist you enough. There's lots of times where you can add on an additional feature to a skill, but it only tells you the name of it, it's up to you to remember what that skill is and does. I like the different archetypes, but it feels like it needs a lot more polish.

Cons:
Bug. I haven't encountered them myself, but I know certain quests have been bugged enough that the game can't progress, but I think they may have fixed all of those by now. Just something to be aware of. The most egregious bugs for me are certain skills/abilities not doing anything, really only applies to ""motivation"" abilities, which are like an ""ultimate"", so it not working hurts even more.

Lack of full character respec. You can only respec in the current archetype you're leveling, of the 3 you can have, that's pretty weak.

The game is frontloaded. 5 acts, but the 2 first one makes up for more than half the game. Starting from act 3, story and content take a nosedive.

[b] The bad [/b]
- Bugs, talents bloat, (it will takes months to sort that out because there are so many)

- Combat was fun at the beginning, then you realise that the balance is wack. Tactic is all about giving turns, momentum turn stacking the same buffs and debuffs to broken level. Then you finish in one turn. There are so many mechanics breaking the balance that I'm not even confident it will be possible to fix it.

- Animations. Guns effects are well done. However most buff and Psyker powers are uninspired at best, lazy for most. It consist of your character standing up from cover and pointing toward your ally or enemy.
Remember how I said combat was all about buff debuffing ad noseam before shooting ? You spent each fight looking at you characters standing up and pointing a direction 10x, then shoot.
Pyromancy psyker ? Point towards the enemy and watch the debuff dot appear under him. Firestorm ? same deal but aoe.
wow.
It bothers me because they clearly could have done better even if they are not ubisoft sized.

So, what's wrong with Rogue Trader?

1) As always, bugs. To see if you will be able to finish the game, you should always look at Owlcats official equation for their games.

gb% = p x a 
Where gb = game breaking bug; p = playing time, a = Act you're playing. 

This is an Owlcat game, which means that it's going to be broken during the first year. Oh, no, no, no, not broken as in one weapon is too overpowered or there's a dialogue box missing, I'm saying that there is a very good chance you will be soft locked from act IV onwards, then it's time to wait for patches, re-do entire fights and so on. This is just a little bit more functional than Wrath of the Righteous during launch, which isn't saying much.

2) Owlcat has no idea how to do a turn based CRPG. It's like they took encounters from their real time rpgs and put it here. There are SO many encounters, with SO many mobs that they take ages. Encounters mostly don't make sense too, with combat arenas that are pretty much ""???"", some of them offering no cover, some of them offering too much cover, some of them with mobs right next to you. This would be less of a problem in a real time game, but in a turn based game... please, make encounters more meaningful. Don't have so many trash mobs.

3) Too many systems on top of systems on top of systems. It's the old quantity > quality thing. They want to have space combat, expeditions on planets, research, harvesting planets for materials, trading resources, profict factor, multiple materials, dance parties, ice skating ... it's a lot of shit that doesn't add much to the game and is just there to add to the overall playing time. 

4) I dont like most of the party members, they only complain non stop. Jae can die in a fire btw.

Yes, it has delivered me over one hundred hours of solid enjoyment and I wouldn't say I regret purchasing it, but I have now run into roadblocks that seriously detract from the overall experience of the game.

To get the positives out of the way: the game's greatest strengths are a great story and compelling characters. I would liken the game to reading a 40k novel that just happens to have visuals, occasional combat sequences, and often allows you to take part in deciding how events will unfold. Many reviews complain about the over-abundance of text but, for me, that was actually the best part of the game. If you're someone who is really into the novels, you will have a lot of fun with this game simply for the story alone. I would also add that the degree to which you can develop your character's morality within the limits of the universe is actually surprisingly broad. They could have just used the generic DnD morality system but instead they implemented a morality system that makes much more sense within the context of 40k as a setting, allowing you to define your character loosely around three distinct moral persuasions. In addition to the excellent story, I also loved the soundtrack and art direction. Both perfectly capture the atmosphere of 40k.

Now I'll move on to the parts of the game that I didn't like. Ground combat feels good for maybe the first chapter and a half but gradually deteriorates as you level up and increase exponentially in strength. It's simply too easy and it's mostly due to poorly balanced abilities. Some of the abilities are so obviously broken that it feels as though there must have been no proper QA process during development. There is an ability that you are almost guaranteed to encounter early in the game (tactical knowledge) that can be effortlessly stacked to grant all party members an unlimited amount of armor which will invariably lead to them becoming invincible. If there were only one or two abilities that were this exploitable, I might give it a pass and just not use them, but that's sadly not the case. There are dozens of different abilities across the various archetypes that are so overpowered it's hilarious, and if you try to consciously stop yourself from using them the game just becomes boring anyway. I think part of the problem is that you get far too many level-ups. If each character only had room to acquire one of these abilities then the game might be able to remain enjoyably challenging throughout, but instead each character has more than enough levels to collect all of these abilities and use them in unison. Right now, even on hard difficulty, my party is practically unkillable and my damage dealers can one-shot most enemies, including elites. I would increase to unfair but it would hardly change anything. If you can max stack all stats and boost armor by 300 percentage points on all characters within the first couple rounds of combat, there is nothing that can stop you. Your characters' base stats lose all meaning since every character can easily get +100 to all stats with the right buffs during battle and stats like parry and dodge will always be maxed out at 95%. It just becomes a boring and repetitive spam-fest once you reach this point. At the end of the day, the combat system can be fun for a while, but it is unfortunately poorly thought-out and loses it's charm pretty quickly. It would require a full overhaul in order to make it truly fun and challenging.

As for ship combat, I can only describe it as half-assed. It is shallow, boring, and ends up just being a time-waster that you will have to deal with in every few systems you visit. If they really didn't have the resources to devote to making it feel enjoyable to engage with, they would have been better off abstracting this system by simply turning ship encounters into a little minigame or deciding the outcomes based on text and skill checks.

Colony management is fun to an extent, but the choices are not very meaningful to the narrative and the rewards are almost always just further unnecessary buffs to your already monstrous combat abilities. Your faithful dogmatic character can build pirate hideouts and heretical monuments on their planets with no limitations from what I can see. It wouldn't matter anyway since these decisions won't affect the story in the vast majority of cases. I still enjoy watching my planets gradually build up larger and larger green numbers, as it taps into my lizard brain, but the overall impact of this system on the game is minimal and it feels, in general, like a mobile-esque side mechanic.

The trading system is one that I actually enjoyed more because it does tie into the story in some ways. Sometimes you will encounter faction members throughout the story and can choose how to interact with them which may increase your reputation with them. However, I was generally disappointed by the lack of interaction that you have with the main faction representatives. I was really hoping for something in the vein of Skyrim where you can choose to join a faction and then do quests for them, gradually progressing their story. Instead, it's all very surface-level and mostly rewards you with the same things as the colony development: more overpowered weapons and items, most of which you won't need.

Finally we come to the bugs. As many others have noted, bugs are omnipresent throughout the game but get worse the further you progress. You can go through the first thirty hours and things will generally run okay and function in most cases, but after around the 30-40 hour mark it starts to get downright egregious. Many abilities only partially apply in combat or simply do not work at all. Dialogue options sometimes bug out or don't appear. Many of the quests just stop progressing or fail entirely out of the blue, locking you out of completing them unless you want to go back to a save from hours ago. As I write at this moment I have actually not completed the game because one of the main quests has become permanently bugged, barring further progress. I hope to return to the game when these bugs are fixed, but for now I find it hard to recommend a game that I can't even play to completion.

Playing ""Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader"" feels like willingly subjecting oneself to the chaos of assembling furniture from IKEA. You go in with high hopes, convinced that the thematic allure aligns with your interests, only to be left with a profound sense of dissatisfaction, buyer's remorse, and an overwhelming feeling of cluelessness.

Despite my deep love for the WH40k universe lore and its dark, grim aesthetics, ""Rogue Trader"" fails to live up to the expectations set by its illustrious setting. The most glaring issue is the shockingly subpar graphics. Even with settings maxed out and zero performance issues, the game looks dated and lackluster. For a universe as rich and visually intense as Warhammer 40k, the graphical quality falls embarrassingly short, making it seem like a relic in comparison to more modern titles like World of Warcraft, which is over two decades old.

Comparisons to other games, like Baldur's Gate 3, only highlight the stark deficiencies of ""Rogue Trader."" It lacks the quality in graphics, storytelling, animations, choice liberty, range of motion, combat options, exploration, and role-playing elements that make other games in the genre shine. This stark contrast leaves players feeling disheartened, especially if they were expecting a more engaging and contemporary experience.

The game's reliance on text walls and reading is a double-edged sword. While I personally don't mind this approach, the limited paths available for navigation, combined with lackluster and unenthusiastic combat, turns the game into a bedtime sedative. The 20-30 minute combat engagements, coupled with the lack of exploration and static RP elements, make for an experience that falls woefully short of being engaging or memorable.

The UI's learning curve, coupled with perplexing stat mechanics and bizarre occurrences during combat, leaves players scratching their heads in confusion. The occasional voice acting, while enjoyable, is marred by a poorly thought-out display text structure, creating a disorienting experience akin to having two people talk to you simultaneously.

For example,
[i]As Noodlz's grimace changes and contorts as he writes this review, he eagerly types more quickly to convey his words in a way that will make sense.[/i] *Voice acted* [b]""Holy shit why am I typing such a long fucking review, shoot myself in the head, I just wanted to play a game for the love of God.""[/b]

The voice acted section is audibly occurring first while you attempt to read the initial section your eye naturally gravitates to. Yeah, its a doozy in game.

In the end, ""Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader"" does not strike the right tones for an engaging and memorable experience. The repetitious and frustrating combat, combined with unfinished elements and ridiculous bugs, relegates the game to an unfinished conveyor belt masquerading as an RPG. The bugs, often referenced by other players, are all too real and further diminish the already questionable value of this title.

Is it worth $50? Absolutely not. ""Rogue Trader"" is an unfinished mess masquerading as a game, and until it's available at a steep discount, consider it a cautionary tale. Don't be like me – don't be the unwitting soul attempting to put together a piece of furniture from IKEA without instructions. Save yourself the regret and invest in a more polished gaming experience. The bugs and unplayability only serve as the bitter icing on this disappointing cake.

I want to keep it as short as possible. Overall I would rate the game a 7/10. 
In its core it is a good and enjoyable RPG, and for sure the best WH RPG there is(competition is not that steep). Partialy very well written Characters that make you interested in their Background. Enjoyable Core Gameplay Mechanics. And certainly a love for the lore of the WH40k Universe was felt.


Things I would have loved to see improved in the game though:
-More Consistent Voice Acting, Only your Companions and Like 1 Enemy got ... some voice acting. The very few Characters in the game that got Voice Acting barely get some spoken words.Maybe 1-2% of the game is voice acted to be realistic and only ever in the first Act it seemed like they even cared. Even more immersion breaking was the fact though,that sometimes in the same Dialogue one sentence was voice acted , just for the next one to be not voice acted again. In myopinion a huge Immersion killer and the game could have been an easy 8/10 with proper voiceacting for some of the maincharacters and opposing figures at very least.

-Non Existing Choices: Besides Dialogues slightly altering. I did not feel that any of the choices you do or take, change the actual course of the game, it always pretty much plays out the same with most people having this ""whatever"" attitude around you.

-Non Existing Soundtrack: 95% of the game is just some small ambient noises in the background. I really missed ... like anything. If i compare this to something like the Adeptus Mechanicus game there is a lot to be desired.

-Ingame Cutscenes are pretty wonky. Maybe due to engine boundaries,but they often look more comical and make you giggle,when they should have a serious tone.

-Main Story is a bit all over the place, without wanting to go into more details to prevent spoilers.Overall the game is very well written, but sometimes it gave me a feeling of short stories smashed together with only some very,what feels like, forced string between them. The thing that kinda kicked of the game and also interested me the most, in sense of why and what,how. Is allready not being talked about anymore shortly after beginning of the 2nd act....

-Ingame descriptions of Skills can be confusing,especially at the beginning you feel overwhelmed.

I think with some of these Points being improved on the game could be a solid 8/10 even for a brighter audience and a proper 9/10 for warhammer fans",1704650313,1704650313,True,1,0,0.505882382392883301,0,True,False,False

Rogue trader is filled impeccably with the vibes of what it is to be a rogue trader in the expanse, until chapter 3. As mentioned by seemingly everyone that got that far, the game falls off. The balance of the fights gets non existent and the story doesn't make sense anymore because the game struggles to remember what you did. This is due to the mind boggling amount of bugs that are in the later half which astounds me that it could even be released in this form. Say i kill one named companion for plot reasons, the game then decides that my characters will keep talking to them. The story writing is fun, but if it can't remember what you did then whats the point of your decisions?

I want to like this game a lot because its fun, the mechanics are far more balanced than the Fantasy Flight TTRPG its loosly based off of (not particularly hard since while that game is fun its also absolutely broken) , and the characters are interesting. The game is just held back by everything chapter 3 and on. i want to leave a good review (and will gladly change it later if its fixed) but if half your game is nigh unplayable then its inexcusable. 

Chapter 1-2, 9/10
Its a fantastic time with very fun warhammer vibes, good rollplay, and pretty good fights. This is the game I want. This is the game everyone raves about. This is the game where you get a psyker and first round she uses an ability that causes the warp to accidentally kill herself instantly by random chance and my bad luck. This, is truly Rogue Trader. I want to rave about how good this section is but i also dont want to just list the fun story beats people reading this would want to play. Either ignore my recommendation and see it yourself, or watch the copious amount of videos online. Either way I don't want to spoil the fun stuff here

chapter 3 2/10
A dark stain on the story. you would think its fitting considering its location is pretty much a dark stain, but its far too buggy, linear, stupidly difficult at times, or too easy. balance goes out the window. the worst sin of it though? Its forgettable. I remember hating the entire place and like 1 npc. it feels like it was written in a week and it throws all momentum off. 

chapter 4 5/10
The main issue here is 'sins of the father' from chapter 3 and the bugs. Dear god emperor are there too many bugs. Enough bugs that the tyranids look like nothing. in some cases the game in unable to be finished due to progression errors. but everyone has been talking about how the bugs suck and i desperately hope it'll be fixed. The issue im worried wont be fixed is how it comes right after chapter 3. After how jarring chapter 3 is, the final chapter tries desperately to play catch up but it fails. it gives a valiant effort, and does tie in some overarching plot points nicely, but the tone is just off. Characters feel like caricatures of themselves where you meet them quick and move on. its like the soul has been drained from the Expanse. does that vibe fit with where you were stuck in chapter 3? yes. but it sucks. I would almost be happier if the game treated everything after the beginning of chapter 3 as a hallucination you see as your character is being tortured in that act. It would make more sense that way why the depth of writing seems to have failed because its coming from the memories of a broken mind. Yours from act 1-2.


all in all its a 5/10. 
I cant bring myself to recommend this due to how bad the last parts are. This is going in the pile of games that were 'released' but clearly wernt finished, and we cant keep tolerating that. Either this game was rushed due to laziness or corporate greed but its not done, Its not finished by a long shot, and Owlcat should have the decency of at least saying its still in beta.",1704646789,1704646789,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'v never really played much any 40k game, be it a tabletop or a video game, so this is kinda my first experience in this universe, and I really like it very much.

Sooo, here it is:

Pros:
+great atmosphere,
+very interesting combat system,
+deep character progression and leveling,
+great visual style and art work,
+outstanding VA performance
+inventory management
+loot system (you click once and get all the loot when leaving the area)
+trading system via reputation (but there is a con also)

Cons
-a lot of bugs, though I must say none of them prevented me from completing anything I'd want,
-balance issues. Some archetypes and skills are completely busted (looking at you, officers, arch-militants, Argenta, Ulfar, etc). I don't know if this was made intentionally in order to give players to feel the power of the Emperor or this is a result of some bugs, but the power of some abilities and characters is insane,
-a great pity that this awesome VA work could be  experienced so little in the game, and the majority of characters lines lack voicing,
-trading system via reputation. Looks like it is supposed that you can max like 3 out of 5 factions reputations, but you cant get this information until you realize you cant get any more reputation, or it is very tedious and annoying,

Obviously, roleplay is such a vague, nebulous term in itself. For some people, openworld sandbox is what roleplaying is about - because they create their own stories in their heads. However, to me, it was always most fun to have options in dialogue that are written with personality, and to see world react ot my choices, and to know that if I took a different route, the experience would differ drastically, not just slight swap in phrases or slight recolor of a slide. 

While this game is (currently, month after release) is very flawed with bugs and outright unfinished bits, narratively and atmosphere wise it provided me such a wonderful experience, that I'm willing to say I loved it even more than Baldurs Gate 3 (which I ADORED). Because in this game my main character feels so brimming with personality, and options I can take are so thrilling, I just can't help but be invested. And, of course, not to mention how fun and lively the companions are - and even just npcs in the world, there's just so much to like about them! 

Obviously, it's all with a caveat of ""everyone in this world is terrible in one way or the other"", but that's what is especially fun. Writers didn't try to soften the edges, and game is all the better for it. 

I'm fond of roleplaying characters on an evil spectrum, and while I find that there could be more done with heretical playthrough (corrupting certain companions for example), what game offers already is absolutely wonderful. It is so rewarding and fun, and honestly amazing that so much thought and writing went into what is usually a hastily added afterthought in other stories, because by default most players will play as a good guy. 

All the more, I think this should be appreciated - so much effort and love went into this story, even if it currently is a buggy mess. I am hoping that whatever DLCs Owlcat will add, the writing stays on the same level. It can be goofy, and it can be ridiculous, but it's lively and robust, which is not an easy feat to accomplish.

Rouge Trader by Owlcat Games is one of the better games of 2023 which in a board since it’s not a difficult thing to achieve. However, it feels unfinish or straight up not play tested at stages. This is the first game I have played by Owlcat and it makes me wary of their future products simply because the nature of the launch of Rouge Trader and finding out how their other games have launched. I shouldn’t have to do that, when you pay for a product, it should be finished none of this waiting for patches to play the game.

[h1] The Story [/h1]
It is probably one of the best story games of 2023, the game centers around a space captain in the grim dark future of Warhammer 40,000. You’re basically task to chart an expanse of stars for Humanity as charged with being a Rouge Trader. You have a lot of freedom and can do a surprising number of things when it comes to the story level. Things I haven’t seen in other story RPG games. And to my utter surprise you even be a good guy in Warhammer 40k, and it feels very interesting as it feels like you’re a noble light in a galaxy that fallen into darkness and despair as if everyone has lost common sense. (Reasonable Marines meme) It really makes me want to see more.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
If you have played XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012) or its sequel or any other game similar to that, then that is the base fundamental gameplay of the game. It has this one more turn type of feeling that keeps me wanting to play. I honestly feel like the action cam from those games would make the combat feel more alive in Rouge Trader. The other gameplay mostly reveals a rather convoluted leveling process where you can practically do any type of build you can think of however there are major drawbacks.

[h3] Drawbacks [/h3]
[list]
    [*] Buggy game — There are segments of the game that are beyond buggy or the only way to procced is to bug out the game. The later acts are rather bug ridden and it ruins the experience. The game feels like it was not play tested.

    [*] Warp Navigation — This system becomes rather tiresome real quick when you like to explore and the points to make exploration safer for travel is rather finite but how it is explained to the player doesn’t feel great to play. Like it feels like that one uncle at family gathers that you know but don’t know how its related and feel good to be around them. Also, if you have spent all your points and you want to go to another system that doesn’t have path towards, well you’re out of luck. This system needs to be reworked since the game is going to be patched worked into a better game. 

    [*] Text & Voice — The game constantly switches from voice acting parts to text base, this is really annoying to the ninth degree. Pick one or the other, do not flip flop between the two. Worst still is that this happens randomly and gives the underlying feeling this game is not finished if not outright cheap. Smaller gamers were able to do it, why can’t this game have it. The voice acting is really good for when the game has it. Personally, I like hearing Pasqal when he talks, that blend of robotic tunes in his voice makes him sound better. It is rather annoying when you have to read some text when the game is playing its rather loud but good music. It’s distracting and it devalues the work as a whole.

    [*] missing artwork — When talking to a large number of characters, even minor characters do not have art for their talking portions. Again, it adds to the feeling that this game is unfinished.

[h1] Closing thoughts [/h1]
I would love to give this game a recommendation, it can easily earn it for me when I barely give them out but for the price paid for the game, I expected a more finished experience. I may update this review later once the game is patched but in this age of everything launching unfinish or playtest is becoming tiresome.",1704338764,1704630706,False,1,0,0.518583178520202637,0,True,False,False

It is probably advisable to wait a while before getting it, so that they have more time to iron out the kinks and you get a more enjoyable experience.

But that being said... It is a Warhammer 40 000 CRPG! And if you're like me, that alone outweighs a lot of concerns. We're not spoiled for good 40K games really, and certainly not actual RPG's. It's a good enough game, and the makings of a great one are there. With some minor quibbles aside, the uniqueness of the setting is well represented and enjoyable to be a part of.

Broken context interactions, dialogue choices from characters that have been killed and shouldn't be there, broken cutscenes that prevent progress from occurring, sudden FPS drops that slows a 10 minute combat encounter to a 40 minute slog (it was actually probably more like an hour, but I'm trying to be generous). I could go on, but you get the idea. 

The first three Chapters also have their own share of bugs, but nothing on the scale of Chapter IV. They're so bad it's completely killed my interest in continuing my journey in the game. Hell, there was a dialogue bug that I'm pretty sure was a page or two worth of text missing because a choice I made that had an outcome that I did not expect nor was it even hinted at what the consequences may be. 

It's pretty clear that this game needed a lot more time to cook. It's impossible for me to recommend this game in its current state as much as I want to sing the praises of this game, I cannot do so knowing your gameplay experience will suck a lot until the bugs are fixed.

TLDR: Overall great RPG but needs alot of gameplay polishing to make it outstanding. If you accept this its worth the money. Loads of replay-ability. 

First up the game has a plethora of bugs which can frustrate or outright stop gameplay. However the team seem to have been busily fixing these and patching them. There is also a very handy bug reporting tool (alt-B) in the game which does on occasion allow you to skip the issue (for me the main issue was enemies not progressing their combat turns). 

The bugs aside the story, plot, environments and sounds are awesome. The voice acting is not complete for all lines / text from voiced characters but what there is (which is substantial) is great! The overall writing is awesome with great dialogue options which fit in the 40K universe and the various alignments you can go down. 

The standout for Rogue Trader is its world building (visual, textual and through sound). There was one point where the written description, combined with the art and sound which made my skin crawl. Exactly what I want from a full on 40K roleplay! My other favourite feature was the text ""choose your own adventure"" type ministories. They are great and remind me a lot of the old physical RPG story books that the creators of 40k cut their teeth on.

The Rule Set is weird, so many % based, cumulative modifiers its almost impossible to work out whether anything you are doing will make a difference or will be noticeable (I'm looking at you fire psyker who doesn't do any noticeable damage until lvl 30). 

Unfortunately, the re-spec costs you 'profit factor' meaning that realizing your build is junk because you don't understand the system will reduce your ability to develop your planets, or obtain 'rare' gear. To be honest though, you don't miss out on much, most 'rare' gear is junk. Additionally without progressing further into planet development, you cannot see what you are missing out on clearly without researching, meaning you can develop a settlement and realize you missed a very good permanent buff because you didn't click extra boxes or consult google.

The part that really is problematic, and the reason I don't recommend the game is the pitched battles. Sure, if you know the system and want to optimize, you can kill hordes of enemies in a single turn, but the game assumes that is exactly what you are doing. This means, when you are in combat, you are consistently put in less than advantageous positions. At first look that might not be so bad, but when you are 3/4 through the game with no re-spec available, and start a battle without any solid cover and 1-2 allies instantly go down at the beginning of the fight, its not fun. Its not fun at all. It's like a vindictive gamemaster who throws in extra enemies because his BBEG didn't get to finish his monologue (to be clear, the fight I am referencing has multiple powerful enemies, with additional mobs and two turrets that join the fight later, oh and a boss that recovers all their health). 

Additionally, taking a note from Wrath of the Righteous they take away your agency and push you through a dungeon akin to the abyssal city. The third act is just a fancy dungeon, no more space-faring, or really any warning that once you go to 'this super special place', there is no going back.

I want to like this game. I REALLY want to like this game, but more often than not I am playing and realizing that I am noticeably irritated, angry, or simply not having fun. That's the deal breaker for me.

If you want a challenge, want the nihilistic world of 40k, and want to sometimes get your brown-eye stretched to spectacular widths until RNGesus decides you win the fight this is for you. If you are looking for a game with a smooth learning curve and having your party not be dog-excrement without 10-20 minutes of calculus at every level up, this is NOT your thing.

If you really want to support the studio, or want the video game equivalent of accounting, go ahead. I hope you have more fun than I did.",1704598925,1704598925,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The worst space marine representation. Ever.
If you have the chance to recruit space marine - do not do it. Its. weak, cumbersome and worse then useless - it is harfull. You will be forced to take that useless piece of shit onto series of hard fights.

Overall visuals are worse then in DOS2, yet whent it comes to the art-style, oh it is great!

Very few dialogs voiced, worse then in DOS2 or BG3, however significantly better then in Pathfinder: WOTR. 

Combat system feels and .world interaction feels ""wooden"" comparing to DOS2 and BG3, it is slighlty worse then in first DOS. As for the gunplay it is far worse then in Wasteland 3/2, Jagged Alliance. It is very close to ATOM RPG.

Also, i am quite disappointed in game balance: explosives (all kinds of granates) become useless garbage very soon whic looks odd. Considering how much AP granate takes, it should be abl to turn the dite of battle. I would reccomend developers to seek inspiration in Jagged Alliance 3 combat system, when it comes to explosives and guns.

Story is the best part of the game, Owlcat know how to emerge in the world of nobility struggles, as Larian knows a thing or two about divinity. It is still suffering from the same pacing problems as its predecesors, but to thhe lesser degree (fucking end already - effect).

And yes its performance is awul at the time of this review: i5-10600, 32gb DDR4 RAM, RTX3070, WD SSD (had no problem with BG3 on Ultra) can't handle it - frequent freezes in combat, crashes, often ti is impossible to alt+tab to check messendger, as it is will likely crash the game and OS.",1704129689,1704576298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the game, it is an awesome experience that doesn't pull any of the punches of the 40k universe. It shows the absolute terror that not only is Chaos but also how horrific the Imperium is. 

Gameplay
The game play itself is similar to other Owlbear games. So if you are a fan of Owlbear this will feel familiar. It is missing the real time combat option that the previous two games had, but there is a lot of stuff going on so I'm perfectly fine with that. There can be times when there are a TON of enemies on the map, but when this does happen I can guarantee that most of the enemies are going to be mooks, with HP low enough that you can keep their numbers under control. Like I said though, that is common Owlbear stuff. There is only one point that I didn't like, and that is the void combat. Frankly evertime I do it I feel like Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 1&2 would be awesome to play.

Story
The story is well-written for the most part. [spoiler]I didn't like the Commorragh arc. I felt that it threw off the story quite a bit, and I honestly thought that the devs didn't get the feel of the city right. But that is my personal opinion. I would have liked the Third Chapter to be more like a political side of things.[spoiler] There are also some common story elements with other 40k stories, but I'm willing to forgive that. The final chapter, (this could just be me, or it could have been bugged) but some of the story details just don't track. Overall though, I think that the story is quite good. 

Characters
The companions are fairly well written. Their motivations, related quests, things they do and don't support, and their conclusions all are consistent with their character. That is something Triple A studios can't keep consistent so I give Owlbear thumbs up for the character writing. NPC and non-companions, are hit or miss a great deal of the time. Sometimes they can deal with really good characters who are extremely well-written, but other times the character is fairly one-dimensional. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing because it is difficult to write every character in a story to be a well-flushed-out character. Especially in a universe as cartoonish at times as 40k. 

Bugs
Yes the game is bugged. I'm just going to be honest with you. There are some game-breaking bugs, but most of the ones I found seem to have been fixed by now. Although there are still many I have seen, the devs are patching these bug out frequently. 

Final remarks
I was honestly shocked at seeing the lack of character portraits and unvoiced lines, even for the companions. Especially in comparison to the previous two games the developer released. I'm not expecting EVERY character to be given a VA and portrait, but there are several important characters like the nobility sworn to you, that I feel need at least a portrait. 

Other than that, it is a fantastic game I absolutely recommend you buy it. If you are either a fan of CRPG or 40k you will love this game.",1704571071,1704571071,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I really like the lore and story of the Warhammer 40k universe and have been waiting for a good RPG in this universe that captivated me for hours, building a party of unique companions with associated banter. Customization of your main hero and the ability to reset a bad build  (if one path was too underwhelming helps. Additionally feedback during early access about having additional merc hires such as in the pathfinder games helps replace/fill in any unwanted companions.  Perhaps a future DLC will have the Orks (orcs) version as well as other recruitable characters. 

The fights are memorable and each class its Medieval Fantasy Equivalent. Pyskers= Sorcerer/Wizards. Holy Inquistors/Paladins, Servitors/Golems and Space Pirates and Undead Space Pirates!

The ability to run your own Planets and Colonies adds to the Kingdom Building and I like the ability to explore the universe without having to run back to each specific planet when halfway across the map (only for unique events)

The space battles add another dimension to the game and also allow your mobile base (voidship) to be upgraded exterior however it would be nice to also customize your private quarters throughout the playthru which this does not currently have.  Aside from a DLC purchase skin to change the appearance of your voidship, it is unfortunate there are not other options to seize or obtain other ships in game which seems like a miss.  One mission involved capturing a certain merchant ship and it would have been nice to have the option to recruit it as an escort ship, or switch ships depending on circumstances.

One other option I have been enjoying in a different game called Wartales allows your band of mercs to capture prisoners and then eventually recruit them into your party.  This would be a nice dynamic to have in a future DLC.

My feelings on this are uh, pretty complicated. A lot of the issues with the game seem to stem from the setting of 40k just kinda sucking. Games Workshop also apparently has put their hand on the scale at least once, almost certainly more than that, which probably lead to a few of the more questionable story decisions.

I am leaving this positive despite my takeaway being largely negative because I know in about a year or two this game will be pretty dang good. 

Everyone already knows about the bugs, Toolbox is mandatory to progress in the game at times. I couldn't start Chapter 5 without manually inputting the next cutscene that was supposed to trigger but didn't. The game is also really easy to break combat wise. After chapter 2 I found myself breezing through combat due to some pretty messy design choices being incredibly exploitable. It's very common for enemies to never get a turn against me, including several bosses.

Large issues with the narrative are due to, well, bugs. I imagine a lot of scenes that were meant to trigger for me simply did not, which left me with two endings that are nearly identical and lacked closure for what had actually happened. I could go on, but the long and short of it is: Rogue Trader lacks an emotional core that makes the ending feel very hollow. 40k's shitty fascist nature makes an unwelcome appearance more than a few times, overall making the game a bit of a downer.",1704551080,1704551165,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Looking forward to the continuing story and investing more resources into learning about the universe. 

This is my first ever cRPG, I was debating getting Wasteland 3 or this to try and glad I started here. I enjoyed the character stats and setup, although I did find it a bit difficult to create a solid build for my characters on my own, I relied heavily on youtube vids for these and wished in game it was easier to manage/setup. Felt like I needed a higher level overview to see how everything connected and built upon itself further down the levels. 

The pace was great, I never felt stuck, slow or dragging on. I could've done with a bit less warp battles on the adventures through but they gave me a chance to test out changes and increase levels, not enough loot from these encounters. 

I got all characters except Ulfar because I messed up and thought I would just get him without really looking into it, so I'm sad about having missed out on his story and side quests, I also did not get any secret characters, I didn't go all the way in the 3 paths, and I mainly chose IC as my path, killing off anyone who was an idiot, except that Dark Elf, he just felt like a lil f'er and I wanted his chaotic life on the team. Added some danger. 

I didn't feel like accessing gear, especially from the factions easy to obtain, I lost well over 150+ profit points from a few of my planets being hit by the pansy chaos marines (seriously I felt they were lame, I would love to see more races brought into this game and expanded upon, like Orks) and I couldn't get some top level gear. I got Angie's power armour, but for Abe, Pas and anyone else I couldn't advance that far even though I did all the side things and hoarded everything. I'd like to be able to play in the universe even after having put the evils to rest. 

Space battles were neat, although I felt OP at the end with my upgrades, posts etc and just owning the ships. It was a neat added changeup to the battle, would like to see it expanded upon and more random encounters, side quests and fun interactions. 

I had some graphic issues and a few game crashes, but I saved often because, you should. The graphic issues would've been from my system, settings and playing for hours on end. I didn't run into any game breaking bugs either.

I enjoyed this, looking forward to more.

There are some problems with the game however, such as a few visual glitches and bugs that may cause problems with gameplay or the story so it is a good idea to save often.
The characters and events aren't all voiced like many RPG games on the market, however there are many interactions and the few voiced parts are really well done so as long as you don't mind reading you should enjoy yourself.
Some people who know nothing about the Warhammer 40k setting can have trouble getting into the setting or understanding the flow of things, so as a warning to said people: There are no good guys so to speak. The main goal is survival of yourself and humanity as a whole. People questioning too much, acting in a way that goes against strict laws can have dire ramifications and can result in entire planets or systems being overrun by alien and Daemonic horrors. The brutal and horrible rules and actions are there for a reason, not just to be cruel for cruelty's sake. Keep that in mind when going with choices as extreme measures are sometimes the best way to ensure the survival or the species if you are inclined to be a force of humanity and not worship/use the forces of corruption and daemonic influence.
For those who are familiar with the setting things are easy enough to steer in the direction you wish to go.

Story is there, gives enough reason to want to go places, but I don't pay a lot of attention to those in most games. Sidequests are everywhere and give plenty of reason to go looking for them and complete them too. Dialogue options based on the 3-branch character alignment are much more fitting in the world of 40k, Dogmatic crusader, Heretical megalomaniac or Iconoclastic humanitarian are basically what you're going for. All are great.
Playing with friends and concocting various combos adds to the replayability, There's a lot of hilarious things you can do, like a tank that sets themself on fire and runs in to spread the flames, or buffing rate of fire to unload a hellstorm of shells onto your foes only for your ally to give you more action points to do it over and over before the round ends.

At its core is one of the top 5 crpgs ever created and the best one with science fiction aesthetics. Highly recommended. 
It will be great after it receives more polishing and bug fixing from the devs. 

Reviewer background:
I have completed the game (~260+ hours).
No previous knowledge of WH40k. 

Visuals/Art (9.5/10)
- Fantastic art for book sections, end chapter animations, distinct UI and great visuals to represent the world/buildings/space exploration. Mini maps and some minor UI elements need further refinement. 

Dialogues/Lore/Quests (10/10)
- Excellent introduction to the WH40k lore. The writing regarding the npc dialogues, descriptions and quests is mature and high paced (highlights are the options for dealing with party members/other npcs). All the party members are well written and I found 90% of the companions interesting. Probably the only recent game trying to stay true to story/materials and not proliferated by modern politics/agendas. 

Music/sounds (9/10)
- Good music (fantastic intro theme) and sound effects. Voice acting is limited but all the party members and main npcs have high quality voiced dialogues while some of them are the best in the genre (e.g. Marazhai).

Gameplay (9/10)
- Encounters and combat mechanics are great and fun, levelling is interesting, most quests have multiple endings, the space battles are the best mini game that owlcat has implemented until now (vs kingmaker, WOTR). Inventory management doesn't waste your time and is easy to use. The game requires more polishing for chapters 4-5 and simplification (e.g. we shouldn’t have to travel back to our colonies to resolve non-combat events/avoid multiple loading screens/etc). 

Technical state (7.5/10)
- I have encountered ~50 bugs during my playthrough but nothing to block my progress. With the exception of 2 corrupt saves all the other ones were minor. They affect the game mostly from chapter 3. There are also constant patches and hot fixes released by the devs that have addressed most of these problems. The performance was constantly good except for 1 fight in chapter 4 (end of Marazhai quest). Re-training on higher levels needs 2-5 mins to apply the changes. Some skills are currently not working as expected.

Examples of my favourite games: 
bg1 (durlag's tower), tyranny (story/lore/dialogues), wasteland 2 (story/quests), deadfire (side quests/art), wotr (combat/story/visuals), kingdom come deliverance (story/visuals), Witcher 3 (story/visuals), bg3 (I liked only act 1 for visuals/exploration), wasteland 3 (combat/music)",1704507724,1704507724,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

I would critique the somewhat lacking graphics, though they do the job. Just nothing special. Small things like some animations and skill icons are missing or have a placeholder graphic put on them. Rough around the edges but very tactical and challenging game. Characters could do with more voice-acted lines, right now only some conversations are voice-acted, rest you will just have to read.

I would recommend this if you are very into 40k and turn-based RPGs, otherwise it might be quite lot to get into. There is a lot of reading and sci-fi jargon for a newcomer to the 40k universe. For a fan of the series, go for it, you might like it a lot.

The entirety of this game can be described as ""quantity over quality"". It nailed the 40k Universe as far as dialogue and characters and design... and basically nothing else. 

I understand this is a story driven game, but it's almost a visual novel. You spend 80% of your time reading, and only random tidbits of it is voice acted (with no rhyme or reason what is and isn't.) Often, you'll enter a room for a sidequest, and instead of a cutscene, you get a text popup describing what is happening in the room, and after the fight starts. Maybe a creative way of adding more storytelling, but it ends up feeling more lazy, like cut content. 

I understand this is a lower budget studio that tries to focus more on content than a AAA presentation... but the animations are on par with 2003's Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic, with no cinematic cutscenes. I care about a good story and gameplay more than graphics, but this game looks like shit for $50.

The combat is boring, not challenging, unbalanced, and everyone ends up with the same build of 1 Argenta and 2 Officers. Feed her extra turns and you win the game. The character customization is almost non existent, the variety of weapons underwhelming. 

BUGS galore, and the entire second half of the game is outright unfinished. This is NOT a full release game. 15 years ago, you'd buy a game on a disc and that was the only version you'd ever own. Nowadays, studios release half finished products for full price and just keep working with their profits rolling in earlier than anticipated.

I'm seeing a lot of reviews where people are moaning about the game being unfinished and crashing all the time/bugging out all the time. 

Nonsense. Has kept me glued to my screen this far. Clearly a lot of thought has gone in, and I've only noticed a light smattering of small bugs so far, and it only crashed when I was trying to load out in the middle of something else. 

What I think so far:

Graphics - 7/10

Art & Design - 9/10

Writing/Story - 9/10 (very good and gets the flavour just right. Also CHOICES MATTER)

Combat Mechanics - 7/10 (personal preference - if you love micro and 2% critical hit +10 willpower stuff then its for you. I just want to bolt and flame the enemies of the Imperium).

Gameplay Mechanics 8/10 (fun, especially space battles)

Loading Screens - 1/10 (seriously wtf in 2023? Can only think this was some kind of retro callback. It sucks and is unnecessary. Cyberpunk loads faster with 1000s more assets and much more intensive demands on my GPU).",1704486614,1704486772,True,1,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

I'll say this, wait for the ""ultimate edition"" to come out and by then they might have most of the issues resolved. I say might because this is a niche game and there are a LOT of issues. Meaning I fail to see the devs putting in the work because they've already made 70%+ of their lifetime earnings. It will take a couple years probably. Like you could throw a dart at spinning wheel the has all the game issues you can think of in your head and this game has it. Bad UI? Yep. Extremely long and frequent load times in a graphically basic game showing the game isn't optimized? Check. Missing tool tips, broken items and skills, poorly worded quests? Yes, yes, and yes. What about a silly story (40k fault really) and bad companions? I think so. Level up system and UI that is an absolute chore to get through with overly complex skill design which are at the same time boring and monotonous (each characters turn will be you setting 5 or more buffs/debuffs, it's absurd)? Sadly so. Poorly balanced combat the swings from stupid easy to 1 shot before you get a turn? It is real. No quick travel to exacerbate the load times? Uh-huh. Crashes, freezes, chugging in random spot, awkward transitions, typos? *Nods*.

Here are some things that bother me in particular, but some will be able to overlook:

-Middling controller support. It technically works, but there are many times in the game you will want a mouse. The galaxy map is the most egregious example, as the joystick scrolls randomly, causing the selection of the galaxy that you want to view to be a chore. Also, in battle some times, you'll need to click an object (turning on a light, deactivating an enemy shield) which is possible with a controller if you hover over it juuuuust right, but is very difficult. There's also a lot of input lag, where you have to press the button several times on NPCs and doors for them to activate. It should be a lot better.

-Inability to zoom in. I want to view these fantastic looking models up close, but the game won't let you zoom in. It should be a fairly simple thing to implement, right? Just another zoom level. The game already uses a greater zoom in some of the cut scenes...

-Punishing the player for being their first time playing the game. What do I mean? Well for example you can take abilities that have zero benefit for you character. Power armor proficiency at level 1, even though there's hardly any in the game and very late at that, skills that benefit heavy armor for characters that can't wear it, ect. They badly need to prune the the skills and abilities down by 50%. On top of that, you can do things like use your ultimate with no ammo. You can't fire a regular shot with no ammo, so why can you fire your ultimate with no ammo only to do nothing? Not work as intended, but I'm sure some people will blame players and not the devs. Understanding how all the buffs. effects and items all work together in any given moment is a chore. The UI does you no favors. On normal I would say just spam buffs/debuffs and attack and you'll be fine. There is a point in the story where party members can leave you and they take all their equipment with them (hope you saved). Why is this gear not purchasable to begin with?

-It feels like you are expected to know 40k lore and tabletop rules. It took me forever to understand what something a simple a stat bonus was. There is no category listed and the tooltips don't tell you. There is so much hypocrisy and dystopia in 40k it's really hard to buy in or care about the story. There is so much death, death becomes meaningless. Why is the economy involve the Rogue Trader picking scraps off the ground and giving it to factions for very limited supplies? Wouldn't doing tasks for them make more sense since the Rogue Trader is like Elon Musk rich? I just don't know if 40k works for a CRPG and what limitations Games Workshop put on Owlcat Games. Being the GW gives their license out like candy, I have to assume it was Owlcat's decision. To be fair, Owlcat does try a bit to explain things, but if your new to Warhammer 40k, be prepared for a lot of confusion and world that feels pointless to exist in.


Ironically the best part of the game is the ship combat for me. It's simple and unique, with some layers of depth/tactics and great animations that make it really fun. If they want to do a game fleshing that out I'm down. I think the devs bit off way more than the can chew and have rushed out another game a least 6 months early. My recommendation, play Boulders Gate 3 first (they actually fixed most of their issues), Divinity, Tyranny and other CRPGs like classic Fallout 1 and 2, then come back in a few years if you're still interested. 4/10 for me below average in every way.

It's true from the first 30 hours that this is the first and definitive CRPG for WH40k, I've got faith Owlcat will touch up the latter part of the game like how they have with Pathfinder or like how Larian has done with Divinity, these are immense games and it's unfortunate they see a bit of an early release.

So lets start with most imporatnt part:

Is it warhammer? in age of lack of respect to the source material owlcat comes for the rescue delivering something so warhammer i am surprised it is read.

You are rogue trader, act like it, everyone is mere work for you to trample!(your ego has to be slightly bigger than your ship).

Music? Yet another take on warhammer which is to be appreciated because again, they know warhammer

Gameplay?

first two chapters:qiuite balanced and that rogue trader 2nd edition works fine

last two chapters? system wasnt well thought through, very prone to exploits and im not even talking about enemies and their stats, its the buildup of passives actives buffs which was clearly designed to not go past first half of 2nd class

Is it as bugged as they claim? as by 050124, yes and no, chapter 1 and 2 are very well done, 3rd 4th(im counting 5th as part of the 5th, its 2 planets and dungeon), but this is owlcat, give them time and ivan in the basement will treat his hangover and get things done.



story: good but without fireworks, which is good as for first game of this type in warhammer, at least story works.

companions?

good, you have totally not chaos option you have fanatical option you have all you want here, pretty good mix



Should you buy? YES, even if 2nd half is buggy you still get 50 hours of very good experience and further you wait the better other 50 will be",1704470645,1704470645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Marazhai's romance is STILL BUGGED in in act 3, as the developer who implemented that romance in act 3 did not understand how the underlying variable works.  

Voidship cool-downs still persists for me between combats (not intended).  

One of the secret companions still has no in-game model.

There are not even close to near enough faction turn-ins to max faction rep (even if you only chose 1 and give that faction all of your rep turn-ins, there are still not enough to max one single faction, unless you do ALL optional side content), this is a glaring oversight and needs to be remediated.  The faction turn-ins need to give AT LEAST 300% more rep.

Finally, there are not even close to enough Heretic / Dogmatic / Iconoclast points given out.  The game is super stingy with them, to the point that the hitting rank 3 locking you to rank 2 in the other's is not even a real restriction.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to hit rank 5 in one with rank 2 in the other 2.  There are just not enough points handed out.  Things that are blatantly heretic choices or actions just do not give any heretic points because the devs pushed this game out too early.

However, I have to give this a No because Act 4 is utterly unplayable. Quetza Temer is bricked, and even loading a save before I started it and redoing the whole planet again did not fix it. I get a notification that some weird tech-priest was caught sneaking in my ship, I choose to go see him, and suddenly I'm in my bedchambers with Heinrix - and the next warp travel puts me in a black area behind the walls of my bedchambers with no way out. All the rumours cannot be completed - I defeated the Contempt pirate flagship and all three rumours related to it are still unresolved.

I really like this game, but as it is right now this is, without exaggeration, unplayable.

Sure, Toybox or other mods could fix it. However, I don't play a game modded the first time through, nor should a game be literally impossible to complete without mods.

Edit (23/12/2023): Credit where credit's due, the latest patch fixed my broken game. Only lost like a couple hours of progress, which is nothing in the long run. Well done.

Edit 2 (23/12/2023, later): Spoke too soon. Next part in the main story, the Explorator Fleet part of Act 4, does not trigger the meeting with the commanders in orbit. No way to progress right now.

Edit 3 (05/01/2024): Did a fresh playthrough, I have now managed to progress past where I was stuck earlier with no gamebreaking bugs. Tentative recommend for now unless I get stuck again.",1703131839,1704452797,True,0,0,0.52041316032409668,0,True,False,False

It's just broken. Incomplete maps (as in: unreachable areas or chars getting stuck). Buggy combat (frozen NPCs, pathing issues, characters that suddenly run off-map and so on).

Issues with character models and camera zooming (clipping, random movements).

As a video game first-and-foremost, but as a piece of Warhammer 40k media second. Like, it fails at being super fun, but also doesn't entirely capture the vibes of 40k? Like, it absolutely resembles 40k, but some of the heart of it is missing. 

Some of the video game aspects that make it not great? The cutscenes that pause regular gameplay to play pre-scripted actions are so bad. The audio is very strange, like your character is supposed to be standing in the middle of a warzone but all you hear is ominous ambience and a single lasgun firing intermittently? Also, the strategic combat does not serve the game's vibe at all. Not only is there just too many individual combat encounters, the length of each encounter slows the flow of the game to a halt and getting back into the immersion of it is genuinely really hard to do. This also de-incentivizes me to go exploring in any of the warzone areas I've discovered so far as there WILL be one or several combat encounters in optional areas for barely any payoff, and you'll have wasted an hour of your own time for 17 extra Flak Armours and combat knives.

And the story... Maybe I haven't gotten far enough, maybe it hasn't hit it's sweet spot for me yet. But damn. It is not good. For me personally that was to be expected as I didn't enjoy the stories of the previous Owlcat games either, so I won't complain about that too much. It just feels very convenient and railroading. Like, Tzeentch is very clearly set you on this course and ""fate"" dictates you must follow this defined path. It's not very fun to have your player agency taken away, even in a manner that serves the story.

Something that bothers me quite a bit is why the voice acting is so sparse? Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire had an entirely voice acted game on a crowdfunded budget. How can Games Workshop not afford to do the same? I enjoy reading 40k novels, but this isn't exactly where I expected to enjoy that hobby. The fact that many of the game's characters are not voiced means that every conversation is just another slog to slow the flow of the game down, like combat. 

I am going to play until I've beaten it because playing a Warhammer 40k CRPG makes me very happy even in spite of the stuff I dislike about it.

It's the first 40k game where not only do the Eldar feel relevant but makes the universe feel textured and nuanced in a way that most games don’t do.

It's not perfect though. Animations break all the time; there’s way too many loading screens and there are some nasty difficulty spikes that are just inexcusable from a design point of view.

It always felt 'okay', mildly interesting but nothing more. After playing Rogue Trader tho, it got me super interested in the world and when I'm not playing this game I'm reading the wiki on everything

Rogue Trader is amazing, but also rly buggy (so I'm avoiding Chapter 4 til there's more bugfixes, and using ToyBox for minor flag fixes) but the game overall is another extremely immersive Owlcat CRPG. Combat is great, build variety is insane. In some ways, I actually prefer these systems to Pathfinder, and I definitely find the turn based combat far more interesting (honestly, prefer it to BG3 but ONLY because I dislike or don't bother with 'emergent gameplay' so the BG3/Divinity stuff doesn't interest me as much but I love the complex skill/build interactions and finding rly broken combos)

I'd say it's very well worth the buy, though I'd advise either trying out a few playthroughs until Act 3 (until more bugfixes are done) or waiting a bit before buying the game since it's still quite buggy in the latter acts (not unlike BG3 but at least BG3 wasn't gamebreaking other than Minthara being completely broken at the start)

Not saying it's btr than BG3, and if you haven't played it yet, you definitely should.

Well, Rogue Trader is actually good. Great grasp of the setting and tone is backed up by fun gameplay - the most important part of it is the story. Writing is good. Both in terms of the plot, with twists and really well executed companion storylines (particularly Pasqual's), but also superb descriptive writing, prompting immersion and making you feel you're in the presence of a skilled DM running the game for you. The cast is varied, authentically presented and with some exceptions well executed: Yrliet writing deserves a special mention and the path route allows introduction of flavour which makes choices matter.

The mechanics largely borrow from the d100 FFG system, so some of the skills should be familiar to table top veterans. The system is thankfully simplified, but for those shying away from maxing out stats I say - specialise. Tabletop has a +/- 60 cap - rt can easily slap you with a -100 penalty so make sure your skills and stats are maxed out for purpose-built characters. The fact the game offers  a free reset means you can experiment without having to torch your playthrough; the characters get quite powerful and while there is a pacing problem in level scale, it isn't detrimental to fun. A bit of whack is expected from anything 40k. 

Length of the game is just about right, providing a rich and varied experience: Commoragh was particularly soul-crushingly well done, propelling the player towards new locations before endless jumps and fighting off Warp incursions becomes too repetitive. 

Perhaps the weakest part is space combat, which is as unfun and tedious as it is in the table top. They really should've ported Battlefleet Gothic and called it a day. I understand that the bridge design is tied to the frigate and it's the dynastic flagship, but inability to change ships is a huge drawback.

With all in mind, between endlessness of the Koronus Expanse and the well-fleshed out Calixis Sector, the game provides an endless material for future DLCs and expansion packs. 

The epilogue was an experience of its own - it was really well done and my compliments to the writing team for dedicating so much love and attention to their art.

But in proper review, this game has some strong elements and a lot of flaws. The atmosphere of the setting feels true to 40k, and the narrative feels relatively engaging up to the halfway point. The writing in general is also give or take, there are well-written segments such as the general arc when connecting with Yrliet, but there are also elements of writing that are very poor. There is nearly no reactivity in the game based on your world origin, or background class, and some of your decisions even, which leads to very immersion breaking conversations that make no sense. The latter parts of the game feel very empty and poorly fleshed out, and need some work in terms of content and writing, along with the bug fixes themselves. On release rogue trader falls short of some of the better cRPGs that we've gotten in the past decade, and I would not recommend anyone else buys this incomplete game at full price, or purchase it at all until there are more bug fixes and some sort of expanding of the latter acts, whether by DLC or (preferably) for free.
Quick throw to other systems-exploration feels nice the first time, but exploration and colony management UI are terrible and need work, especially when seeing where rumors point to, what's new in act 4. 
Combat can be quite enjoyable, there's a lot of cool gear that can make builds work, but the balancing per usual is trash. The game is incredibly easy when using certain characters or certain archetypes, and then later in the game certain fights are unbalanced if you're not using those. The game devolves (even on normal difficulties) into a game of alpha strike, where you wipe the enemy in 1 or 2 rounds, before they do the same to you. This also means that many of the interesting items that can slot together (bleed and toxin for instance) are simply worthless unless playing at lower difficulties and intentionally stretching out fights.",1704394144,1704396840,False,3,0,0.532026171684265137,0,True,False,False

Major issues:
1) Act 3 is straight up rob you from game experience for cheap drama. 
2) Game is messy and bugged even after 4 patches.
3) Companions quests is uninteresting, unrelated events your companion forgetting about after finishing them. Then they suddenly remember, to forget again.
4) Game is empty. It's not a galaxy full of persons, wonders and events, but just bunch of little event maps. It feels less populated and less eventful then towns in both Pathfinder games.

Minor issues:
1) Game imbalanced not in a fun way. Start of second act is quite hard (playing on core), but at the end it becoming walk in the park, when 90% of your battles ending within turn 1. For crying out loud: boss of Forge world dies with both his buff minions in one bolter burst.
2) Classes idea is neat, until you realize 80% of skills is useless.
3) Story-wise you get ton on input at the beginning of the game and then really slowly and rarely adds something new. You just don't feel progress.
4) Act 4 Quetza Jungle. I mean what devs was smoking? 15 locations with random ass exits which leads you randomly until you find one. Each location have loading time. Worst puzzle I ever did see in my entire life.  BTW that quest did it for me I'm never recommending anyone that game.

Good things:
1) Atmosphere, but most of it due to WH40K already have tone of art, assets and lore to copy from.
2) Trading and class systems. Original, good. Classes is need lot more work 'tho - you need to focus on exactly one class, or you will be ineffective.

PROS:

-Worldbuilding; Hands down, they nailed this. From the setpieces of various worlds the player explores, to the names and portraits of various characters, the various tidbids of lore gleemed from checks, this is one of the most well respected games of the 40k franchise that faithfully sets the stage for the Grim Darkness of the 42nd Millenium.

-Combat System; This is a really interesting one, because your starting class will influence your tier 2 class options once you level up enough. With an overabundance of talents, it does get confusing, but this also means there's no limit on what you can build. Plus, you can always respec a character by speaking with the High Factorum on your ship if you need to remake a build. Combat was always engaging (except for specific conditions), and there were only a few times I genuinely felt it was too punishing. Ship combat as well is handled in fun ways (outside particular conditions), and it was fun hunting down modules to upgrade your voidship.

-RPG Checks; Many of the skill checks, both present and in passing, add a touch more flare to the game. Whether it be a hidden check that gives insight when conversing with a character, or a critical one that allows a new path of attack, the various skill checks Rogue Trader has in the game always felt appropriate for the time and place they are at.

-Story; Aside from the ""Dropped the responsibilities unto you"" opener, I genuinely loved the story that Owlcat had for the MSQ. Story was engaging, and always kept you trying to figure out where the antagonists are going to, but also who is really your own allies, and the circumstances of Theodora's legacy. Even actions minute as to what factions you do trade with will impact your end card at the completion of the game.

-Audio; From the scripted voice acting, like [spoiler]Idira's bloodcurdling scream in the prologue[/spoiler] and the hoarse, bestial edge in Ulfar's lines, to the BGM in the main menu and combat, the audio team really knew how to set the tone. Props to everyone on this front!


CONS:

-Combat; While the game combat itself is fun, there's numerous issues with certain skills, spells, and actions that are broken or straight up don't work. Owlcat is actively working on addressing these issues, but it is something to keep in mind. However...

-Ulfar; I love him, I genuinely do. For a Space Wolf, his character balances the brash, brutish warrior with a more melancholic sagaholder. But pathing for his movement in combat, his Go For the Throat ability often sending him to his last position before a fight cutscene or another random part of the map, and using [i]his Bolt Pistol instead of the more powerful melee option[/i] if that does work, and a general lack of Astartes gear after you get him really hamper his potential. There are some guides out there that can make Ulfar work, but as it stands, it's exceedingly frustrating turning him into a melee tarpit when half the game conspires to make him [i]not[/i] work.

-Certain Combat Encounters; Yes, I know having an unoptimized build isn't going to help, but I will point out that there are specific enemies through CH4-5 that will exceedingly punish you if you don't start cheesing the combat system back. I get it; the difficult is there for scaling, but I had to go back to an earlier save and retroactively rebuild all of the retinue to have a chance of continuing onwards.

-Space Combat Encounters; specifically, a lack thereof. While the space combat itself is very fun, there's a rampant lack thereof outside of designated areas. For example, systems around Fubundius (Footfall Station), which does have pirate contacts inside, never seem to have a random chance of encounter like you do if warp jumping on an unstable route. As a result, it doesn't feel like you're getting your worth out of the hull and module enhancements. Some battlepost abilities also range from being able to use multiple times despite a cooldown on that ability, to never being able to be used for some reason.

-Trade System; while Owlcat utilizes the Profit Factor system when it comes to getting goods from trade contacts, it often feels like there's a persistent [i]lack[/i] of items you can actually trade away to raise your reputation with a representative. You have to not only give generic flavor items you recover in the field, but also any weapons, armor, and consumables you don't use yourself, and those tend to run out fast. The biggest flaw with this is with the Chartist Captain for the Imperial Navy, who only takes Void Trophies as a commodity, and those aren't obtained outside very specific encounters. More generic combat and exploration zones, such as randomly generated voidship or hulk encounters, would be a better solution to remediating this issue.

-Lack of explorable systems/planets; depressingly common, yes, but there's a gigantic map of the Koronus Expanse when engaging in warp travel, and there's only around 30 planets/locations you can actually set foot on and explore. This also ties back into my complaint about the trade system about never having enough stuff to actually raise reputation for more gear.

-Planetary Management; this is a neat little idea, but in practice, it's very aggravating to secure some of the requirements for certain projects. I locked myself out of two separate projects because I couldn't raise reputation with their associated trade faction to unlock the project for the colony. I know Owlcat has plans for an expansion in the future, but it does feel like there's a lot that could have happened.

[u] Rogue Trader is perhaps the most enjoyable Warhammer 40k game that came out in the last decade. [/u]

It has a good immersion factor, the combat is hard but not annoying, challenges are actually enjoyable instead of making me optimize my party build, and the general tone of the game is pretty good.

You are a Rogue Trader, and that has a lot of interesting ramifications, and the NPCs are quite nicely done.
The writing and plot is good to okay, the overal ambience is pretty good.


Why ""Not Recommended"", then?

Mostly because the game needs a [strike]fair bit[/strike] lot more polish, but also:

EDIT: Ive been warned about Owlcat games often being lackluster the further you progress, and i did not experience a hard-lock yet, but the impressive care to lore and design/decor is being depreciated by issues around game mechanics and bugs the more you progress.

EDIT 2, done at round 140 hours playtime: Still perhaps the most immersive 40k game, but during ACT 3 and afterwards, bugs and bugging questlines, etc, are taking even more of the enjoyment out of the entire game. 

Recruiting custom characters costs Profit Factor (Primary currency resource)

but the most annoying thing that is stressing me out:


[b] Re-training a single character has a global (and increasing) Profit Factor cost.  [/b]
EDIT: And you can only reset characters to the state you first encountered them, meaning that anyone joining after the starting party often has the entire first archetype/class completely locked in.

This is the most non-smart design choice ive seen in an otherwise good game. 
Your party´s level depends on the main character´s own level, but you can re-spec any character without losing any experience.
The absolute issue is that doing so costs Profit Factor, and the cost increases with each use.
Thanks to that, and the slight lack of UI telling me the cost (There is a -X icon, but please, its nowhere telling you that it costs Profit Factor) means that in my first game, i spend 20+ Profit Factor on re-training in the first 10 hours of the game.

This left me having to scramble and being unable to procure Extraction devices to get other ressources, and made me start a second game. 

It is utterly baffeling to me how you can have a really nice game with multiple class choices and a LOT of possible perks and traits to configure said classes, but have the re-spec be a scaling  cost for the most hard-to-get ressource in the entire game. 
With such a design choice, i am left to wonder what else will pop up.",1703495595,1704388784,False,4,0,0.570758700370788574,0,True,False,False

aside from bugs - rogue trader is OK, a game has everything needed on paper but doesnt  really shine in any aspect, characters are not fleshed out and not interacting with the player, or the world, in a way to see how relationships with player and in a group, are changing with time or quests etc, battles are interesting only in the beginning because you can't really interact with terrain, and synergy among party is very one sided (small number of strong options and the rest is just weak in comparison)
there is voice acting, but it's inconsistent
there is animations, but they bugged at times and sometimes outright broken
there are xenoes weapons, but in game its listed as just las weapon without some special effect on an enemy or something
there is lore, but it's not deep enough for nerds and not concise enough for new people

They did a good job with the feel of the world, but there often are no consequenses to any actions beyond reputation changes and there are a lot of moments where NPC reactions feel very strange. It also has an issue with dialogue leading to unexpected choices. For instance saying ""let's discuss this problem"" led to me only having the choice of different ways to persuade the NPC to do things a certain way, something my Rogue Trader had no interest in doing.

Like previous Owlcat games it has quite a few tedious mechanics. The warp travelling gets annoying fast, there are a gazillion loading screens and you often have to go through two or three loading screens in quick succession when changing locations.

Some reason are the  weird design decision like :

-There a shallow amount of good loot, mean you will stay with the same gear for a long time, so not really any progression on that side it's pretty generic gear .

-the forced ""multiclass"" that for some character is not interesting in anyway , by that i mean you have a certain number of action per round if you're starting class allow you to use them all in a way that work adding more ability that cost action is useless and having 15 level to power up those useless action is boring ... a bit hard to explain without writing a roman so in short forced character progression instead of allowing you to choose isn't that much fun .

-There's nothing special about our character no bonus point or special ability or anything that only he can do make him generic and not interesting , compared to let's say the navigator lady whose power make her the star of the show as soon as you get her .

- Ship battle , once you get the hang of it , are awesome and lots of fun but again weird design choice where there no random ship battle , so once you're done with the one on the map its over , you can level and equip it so kind of bad that there isn't much of a point to it.

-random event on warp travel be it fight or event are repetitive real fast you have a limited number of point to lower the ""danger"" of travelling so cant make everything green (no event) , and since there like 5-6 different fight possible maybe more but i did the same one over and over with no variation wasn't difficult just boring and an annoying waste of time that give no reward ....


i could go on but this long enough , so conclusion : decent setting plagued by weird decision that remove the fun of the game making the whole experience bland and  unrewarding

However, I find it harder and harder to convince myself to load it again. It's not BG3, where you want to see every encounter again but with a different character or choice. Here, you want to see it once and move forward.

Narrative

The game shines in its companion backstories, which are well-crafted and engaging. The dialogues with these characters are also a highlight, being the only ones that feature voice acting.

However, the game's writing style may not be to everyone's taste. Fans of Black Library books might find it enjoyable, but others might find the dialogues lengthy and filled with superfluous details that don't impact the story. The information-to-noise ratio is quite low, which can make it challenging to stay engaged, especially considering this is a game, not a book. At times, I found myself merely skimming for keywords and pressing' continue'.

The narrative presents itself inconsistently through ""cartoons"", on-engine cut scenes, regular dialogues, and dialogue stylised to the book. Almost all of them are used randomly and have no connection with the event's importance or type. Pacing is also slow, especially if it's an on-engine cut scene with slow dialogue bubbles.

Last, the writing becomes lazy quickly. The first time when the quest starts with a dialogue with an important person and then interrupted by rebels is fine. The second time, it's suspicious. The third and fourth are laughable.

Combat

Occasionally, a lucky chain of heroic actions and random hits give you an impression of being badass in the world of 40k, destroying enemies with your mighty bolter. 

Unfortunately, it's rare. The majority of battles are split into two types: regular and ""boss"" fights. The regular ones are always the same: melee enemies run to the closest of your troops, and the shooters hide behind the farthest cover from you, which is still in range, and never leave it, occasionally shooting at you. After you see it once, it becomes predictable and boring. The ""boss"" fights are the same, plus an extra ""boss"", which is a usual bullet sponge or something buffing or spawning enemies infinitely every turn. As a result, ""boss"" fights are also predictable and repetitive. Difficulty also spikes randomly from easy and boring to hard and annoying with no particular patterns.

Game systems

The game has many unfinished or unnecessary systems. The first one is three types of travelling, i.e. rooms, solar system, and warp. Meanwhile, the solar one is just a slow way to list points of interest without stakes or gameplay. Remember, switching between them requires a load screen.

There is also trading, which is a very convoluted way to buy more guns. You have to claim some resources, which are then used in contracts or colony improvements, which is nothing fancy but a selecting option from the list. Those, in turn, give you currency, which is reputation, unlocking the items in the shops. There are a lot of steps with no stakes or gameplay in them. Again, there are no risks or many choices; you just have to do it. Luckily, the loot is abundant, and you never need to buy anything from the shop.

The last system to mention is fleet battles. They are solid and fun, if a bit slow. 

And yes, there are bugs. But I didn't pass chapter 3, so I haven't encountered the gnarliest ones.

Overall, it's an okay game. It can give you a solid 10 to 30 hours (not due to the amount of content but because of pacing) of occasional fun and sometimes good writing. If you don't expect more and are fine with not finishing it, I can recommend it. Otherwise, it's at your own discretion and knowledge of whether you love W40k and Black Library Books.",1704363591,1704363667,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story: It gives a really interesting perspective on the 40k universe, one that has you interacting with a wider variety of characters and factions than I think any other game allows or would allow. But at the same time, it feels really unambitious, or constrained by GW restrictions, because the story overall is very predictable. All this especially applies to the party members, variety is great, but nothing particularly interesting about their development.

Gameplay: Really good in the first half of the game. Very deep mechanically, but also easy to understand, and fights are challenging without feeling unfair... second half of the game, all that gets thrown out the window, the combat is easier to break than cracked glass, nothing is remotely challenging a super important boss fight against an opponent with 1000+ HP was killed in just one turn, its a mess past Act 3. I played on Daring, which is one higher than the Normal difficulty, and I feel like if I could make it past the first 50% of the game somehow, I could easily beat this on the hardest difficulty, it's that easy to break it and how extreme you can break it. 


As for everything else, the music and visuals, it's all pretty average. I have very little to say on that front.

So, do I recommend the game?

I'd say if you're big into 40k *and* turn based CRPGs like Baldurs Gate 3, the most recent Xcom games, or Wasteland 2/3, you'll probably get a lot out of this. 

If either don't, or neither do, apply, then no I don't recommend the game. 

Also, I recommend getting this after a year or longer, the DLC is adding new party members and mechanics to the main story, which both have a high chance of elevating the game to new heights. It's also fairly buggy still, though far less buggy than previous Owlcat games, and a year would be enough time to iron all that out.",1704336603,1704357968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most impressive aspect of this game has to be the devotion to getting the feeling of the game correct. The story is engaging and reasonable well paced, the game is atmospheric and you get exposed to a great cross-section of the 40k universe. The game allows for you to play through as a dogmatic Emperor worshipping made person, a daemon loving heretic, or anywhere in between. 

If you have played modern CRPG games (BG3) the combat may seem a little slow. It can be confusing and time consuming to read the huge amount about each upgrade you are selecting... or to work out how the damage is actually calculated... but if like me, and you just want to play thematically you can still build a range of characters that can be enjoyable to play and can beat the game on the mid level difficulties without the min/maxing.

There are a reasonable amount of bugs in this game. I have not experienced any game breaking bugs, just some slightly odd ones.

Story was fun. A bit disconnected but that doesn't feel too bad since it has this going to places and having random adventures vibe fitting for a Rogue Trader. Last villains come kinda out of nowhere. All build up in the story is for mid game boss so I expected they would be the final but no. It does make sense when everything is revealed at the end but they could have tied it together better.

Can't comment on gameplay much. Balance seems kinda wacked up and I don't like difficult games so I played on easiest. There was a weird difficulty shift in act 4 that went away at act 5 not sure what's up with that.

I heard ending slides are bugged for a lot of people but it worked well for me. Had a good satisfying ending with all my companions having happy times. I would recommend it. First cRPG I actually had fun with.",1704310131,1704310131,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

As a fan of the Warhammer 40K series, I found this game to be a thrilling journey into the dark, gothic sci-fi world that the franchise is renowned for.

One of the most impressive aspects of ""Rogue Trader"" is its rich, detailed storytelling. The game's narrative is engaging, filled with the lore and depth that Warhammer fans have come to expect. The characters are well-developed, each with their own unique backstories and motivations, adding layers of complexity to the game's plot.

The game's graphics and art style are another high point. The developers have done an incredible job of bringing the Warhammer 40,000 universe to life with stunning visuals that capture the grim darkness of the far future. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and animations creates a truly immersive experience.

Gameplay in ""Rogue Trader"" is both challenging and rewarding. The tactical combat system requires thoughtful strategy and planning, making each encounter a test of skill. The variety of weapons, abilities, and units available allows for a wide range of tactics and approaches, ensuring that no two battles feel the same.

Moreover, the game's RPG elements are well-executed, allowing for significant character customization and development. This adds a personal touch to the gameplay, as players can tailor their characters and party to fit their playstyle.

The soundtrack and sound design also deserve praise. The music perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, enhancing the sense of epic scale and drama. Sound effects are crisp and add to the realism of the combat and environments.

In conclusion, ""Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader"" is a must-play for fans of the Warhammer 40K series and tactical RPGs. Its compelling story, beautiful graphics, strategic gameplay, and rich universe make it a standout title in the genre. It's a game that not only respects the source material but elevates it, offering an experience that is both deeply satisfying and endlessly entertaining.",1704307552,1704307552,True,1,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,False

The game is a turn based Pathfinder style 40k adventure where you play as a rogue trader. You can follow an heretic path, dogmatic one and an iconoclast one. the game has content for 100h if you rush to the end in one go and much more if you do other stuff.

the game include:
deep story
Pathfinder 40k style characters
Reputation system with some imperium factions
space battles
romance
huge amount of encounter be it trough exploration or warp travel 
companions that dont like other companions
resources and planet management
no item limitation. you can take every thing in your inventory, if it is on the map, you should take it

I will divide this review into pros and cons

Pros:
+ Lot of character options
+ Re playable
+ 40k universe
+ the hub design is neat
+ the soundtrack can do a lot for immersion 
+the gear variety, example: you can have a laz gun, laz pistol, hotshot laz gun, hotshot laz pistol assault laz gun and many, many more only for laz gun, the other types are doing the same
+great enemy variety, you can face a lot of one faction during one chapter, but enemies always seemed diverse and non redundant.

Cons:
-Lots of texture bugs: characters in purple due to missing textures, arms stretch glitch during animations and rag doll, character being invisible except floating gear.  
-the terrain you visit have static characters that stay there even if the said character got executed, abducted or declared traitor
-some skills often don't act as said or are just plainly not functional sometimes
-The Corpus Valencius... is a lexicon where all mechanics are explained like a dictionary. I expect a only a low amount of player will read it, all myself included, and I realized only in the end game that i missed some key functionality in the game
-your character options are as vast as a normal human can be in 40k: except your origin planet, you are no tecpriest, adepta sororita, space marine and etc yourself.
-not balanced
-you can soft lock your exploration*
-*spoiler* the game premise give you a lot of dialog choices but in my play trough I realized that if you play a pure dogmatic character that always attack xenos, you cannot beat chapter 3. You have an event trough dialog that end your game if you don't cooperate with them and you are forced to make deals with xenos.

*about the soft lock exploration, you have a mecanic named navigator insight to explore the map. You gain 1 point for every sector that you chart and you can chart them only once, you can have more trough story event and if you have some chance, you can generate 2 with warp travel but it happened to me twice in 160h of play. you can spend these points to make paths easier to navigate and make new path to navigate. What the game don't tell you at the start is that some sector in the late game have no path if you don't keep navigator insight.

This review is from die hard 40k fan that has more than one tabletop army and was waiting this game with high anticipation. This game could be delightful and is near it. you can have some fun in the current state, but you have to overlook a great deal to be fully immersed because truthfully the game need some patchs.

Of course not, but that's hard to do anyway. Does it do a good job at portaying the WH40k universe in all it's beautiful horror? Most definitely! (Exterminatus! ^^)

The Story: While I will agree with a lot of other reviewers that the final acts are not quite as strong as the first two, I still had fun figuring out what the hell my predecessor had done and how those actions had affected everything around me. 

During the epiloge there were a few small inconsistencies (due to the secret ending, I think), so that was a bit of a bummer, but over all I think they addressed the outcome of all my choices/reputations.

Regarding reputations: I only managed to get one of them to maximum - the Navy, and that was so easy that I had plenty of their loot left over. The others, though: I tried to get Explorators and Drusians as high as possible (also since I needed them for the colonies), but didn't manage for either. That was a bit disappointing. Could maybe have been communicated better that the reputations really needed to get focused heavily. [Also, a note of advice: if you're looking to max one of the morals, you very likely have to stick with it.]

The Companions: I have played a lot of RPGs in my time and I have to say, I don't remember such a beautifully dysfunctional group of companions ever! Everyone (well, with one exception, really) has some kind of more or less bloody skeleton in the closet and some of them are of the kind that the option to dispose of the companion in question was very tempting, indeed. In fact, I think this is one of the first games where I just could not find the in character motivation to play through all the companion quests. Some of them... well, without going into spoilers, I'll just say they deserved what they got.

Things even went so far that for once in an RPG I did not finish a romance. (I was playing a male RT and well, two options are filthy xenos, the next a mutant and the last one... let's just say they went and embarrassed the RT before the whole crew and that was the end of that.) Was also a bit sad that Argenta wasn't an option (and that Heinrix only goes for female RTs).

All in all, I enjoyed the companions and their stories.

The Mechanics: Over all, I did like the way things are handled with AP and MP and good job for going for a tactical combat approach instead of the horrible real time thing from Kingmaker/early Wrath.

At first I tried to do my own builds, but damn there are a lot of skills that synergize in a bunch of different ways. I think I hit the mark with my officer and with Abelard, but to the end I didn't get a good grasp of the operatives, my own arch militant build failed miserably and the bount hunter didn't really do a good job either. (That's on me, though, not the game.) Once I went and had a look at some build guides, though.... hot damn, those officer/Argenta combos... Just shredding the enemies.

The Minigame: First off, just as in the PF games, I hated the minimap and the travel mechanics to the point that Toybox was my best friend. Navigator points... yep, taking all of them, thanks. Random warp encounters? Nope, 20 of them are enough, no more, please!

Also, how hard is it to show in the map overview if an extractor has been placed or not? No, I needed to visit the systems to check the specific planet.

However, contrary to the awful crusade minigame in Wrath, I greatly enjoyed the spacebattle minigame. There could have been more of them. (Though maybe those would have been part of the random warp encounters. Oops.) A few more ship-equipment options might also have been nice. An improvement would also have been to have control over the escort you can get.

The Sound/Music: Very fitting, imho, and the voices were well done, too.

The Bugs: Sure, there were several, but only a few that really annoyed the hell out of me. Once an opponent just wouldn't let himself be targeted and I had to kill him with Toybox to get out of combat. At one point the game seems to be clearly missing a dialog option. Without going into details: I'm being asked to do something that's clearly in my interest and... I only have the option to say ""nope, thanks"" and then be forced to do it anyway. Very odd. Not sure if it was an oversight or if some dialogue path is broken.

And the main annoyance: the grand strategist with his combat zones is awesome! A lot of options. But: the placement. Oh the abysmal placement. It snaps weirdly. It can't be rotated. Afaik they know about it and it's planned as a fix down the line, but merciful Emperor, this was so frustrating (especially with an RT officer/grand strategist).

Oh, right and there was the first time I took Ulfar for a spin and he got stuck in the back of the fight because he couldn't get past the various obstacles in the fight arena. -.- Yeah, Mr. Angle of the Emperor was then stuck on the ship, except for his personal missions.",1702372920,1704303164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rogue Trader has a solid foundation to build on. The classes took me some time to get familiar with, but once i got the hang of it i rather like the system Owlcat came up with. If you are not adverse to get some help from Youtube you can create / copy some very fun and utterly broken builds. 

The companions are ok-ish to adequate. They are definetly not on-par with characters from PoE I & II, or BG3. 

The itemization and weapons are pretty cool altogether. Sadly the armor do not have a super big impact of how your character looks, barring some unique armor.

Combat can be a bit tedious, since you will be fed a lot of low-level fodder to ramp up for the few dangerous enemies. But it can also give you that satisfying feeling of mowing down hordes of enemies with a single attack.

As far as the story goes, its what you would want and expect from a good 40K game. Lots of misery, lots of planets dying or being ravaged, all around fun times.

But the bugs are unbearable. A significant amount of companion quests can not be completed by me becuase of missing triggers or just all around fuckery.  So i would wait for a few months to a year to get this game.

The good news: Bugs are pretty normal in Owlcat launches and they are fixed fairly quickly. Normally this would turn me off of a game, but Owlcat has a record of delivering outstanding games and staying committed to them well after they have been released. Owlcat is one of my favorite game developers and I am willing to play with bugs because the games are that good.

With that being said, the story is wonderful. This game is dark. It is very lore accurate and does the world of Warhammer 40k a lot of justice. My first playthrough was 180 hours long, and I fully explored pretty much everything that I could possibly do. There are generally 3 decision paths that affect the story (Dogmatic, Iconoclast, and Heretic) which vary from being an all-in zealous “For the Emperor '' type, to somewhere in the middle, to full on Chaos. Some decisions change the narrative of the story in a major way, but most of it affects the flavor of the story a lot, as well as which companions you can recruit or which ones stay with you throughout the various stages of the game.

The big takeaway for me was the writing. The story leaves you wanting to know more, when big plot twists come I found myself having genuine “WTF” moments, the side quests were very enjoyable and had some fun payoffs at the ending credits. Combat was pretty challenging on Unfair at the start but as you level up the difficulty gets easier. Eventually you become so OP, combat isn’t that challenging at all, especially if you build your party to take advantage of the many synergies between classes. Ship combat is very challenging, especially in the final act, even with maxed gear and levels.

I am really sad the story is over and am looking forward to another playthrough in the future. 

10/10. If you love Owlcat or Warhammer 40k, this game deserves your time.",1704260056,1704260056,True,0,0,0.473575830459594727,0,True,False,False

The Good: This is a real love letter to WH40K, everything from top to bottom, world design, sounds, equipment, story, characters, everything. You can tell a lot of effort went into making this setting come to life. The core gameplay is flexible and engaging, and I've been having a lot of fun discussing my character builds with friends. I've seen all kinds of xenos scum and wretched heretics, and purged them all the same. Apart from colonizing worlds, collecting loot, and making big trades, the ship battles are a fun addition to the main activities. Now I want to play Battlefleet Gothic again. Rogue Trader is easily one of the greatest games this franchise has ever gotten. I was completely enraptured from the start and ready to declare this a 10/10 ... up until Act 3. 

The Bad: Act 3, in my opinion, should have been an optional side quest. Without spoiling too much, it completely kills the pacing of the story and the flow of the gameplay established in Act 2. It's also horribly unbalanced. I was forced to download the mod kit Toy Box in order to proceed - and I abhor having to do this on my first run of any game. My build had effectively softlocked me despite it holding up well in combat before. This sequence alone nearly made me quit the game, and sullied the beginning of Act 4 for me. It took a while to want to continue playing. Storywise, the sequence in a vacuum is pretty engaging, and the real kick in the groin is I actually adore this area in the lore. But within the broader plot of the game, Act 3 just feels like a massive, unnecessary detour. Why this? Why here? Why now? 

The Ugly: From Act 3 onward, many side quests were simply impossible to complete due to critical bugs. At least the main quest was able to progress, but again - I absolutely hate having to miss out on so much content during my first run. This is my biggest gripe, and I hope to see the game fixed in the long term, kind of like Cyberpunk. Minor gripes include things like janky pathing and movement, confusing and poorly explained systems at times (looking at you, trade, literally in the name), missing item names and descriptions, characters randomly getting stuck or not entering the combat phase properly, and on, and on...

Should you play it though? Absolutely. Maybe wait until it receives a bit more polish, but do not miss out on this. Despite the bugs, you can absolutely play the main quest from start to finish, and it's something you can really savor and enjoy. I'm just now hitting the end of my first run at 174 hours, having done all that I can on the side. I applaud the team at Owlcat for putting this beast together, and it's so close to being perfect - please continue working hard!

On one hand, story, lore, and shear environment is nailed down to a T. I really enjoyed act 1 and most of act 2. 

However, as the game continued, more and more flaws came up:

- Multiple quests that were bugged to the point of game-blocking, where I had to reload 30 minutes and try different dialog options. One of which likely bricked my romance options.
- Combat balance boils down to ""make one character an OP god and give them lots of turns"" or scale harder than a LoL carry and by God make sure you chose things that scaled well. When you build around a sniper and can shoot for 100, what does that do when your boss has 900 hp and another character can unload multiple times for 10 shots. 
- If you want to be effective, make sure you press the so many buttons each turn, each that resets your view and plays an unskippable animation. Lay out your zones, debuf your enemies, use this skill, then this skill.
- A number of scenes, such as the end of act 3 separate you from your home base. So if your build isn't good enough, you can't respec and try to fix it without reloading 5+ hours back.
- Small nitpick, but consumables are limited by design.
- Respecing after a point costs profit factor that is not renewable. You can't just ""grind for more cash"" to pay for it without gimping your total power.

I really want to love this game, and I love that they tried something wild with the combat system. But it doesn't work. If you want to not get yourself soft locked, save often and consider using a build guide.",1704257506,1704257506,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are issues, bugs that cost you resources or skip your turns - wild hunt what're you doing - but overall this is a good game and I do not say that lightly. I'm on my fourth playthrough with others abandoned. You can seriously gimp yourself, the systems are deep and complex and I find it less forgiving than OwlCat's other games. Combat is a slog and utterly brutal if you've wronged your build somehow. I personally find Werglia's video is be enough to have competent team and the thought of using a guide isn't heresy for me because the complexity. You can easily gimp your reputations by spreading yourself thin, as well.

I feel there are some insane difficulty spikes but they DO feel manageable. It just seems rough for someone not using a guide. Space combat is pretty fun though admittedly sometimes you'll find yourself in an eternal dance around the enemy where nobody is firing.

Storytelling is amazing. Choices seem impactful. Planetary management is pretty fun with the projects having neat outcomes. I've enjoyed Iconoclast, I adored Dogmatic, and I'm REALLY enjoying the heretical story branches.

This is a CRPG through and through. If you want that in a warhammer setting this is a must play for me and if you want that but are intimidates you'll have to do some reading. And you better like reading because LORE LORE STORY STORY galore but it is in text. Let the flow of your imagination take you to amazing Warhammer heights.

The only good thing about the game was the combat and it was easy until about end of act 3 when the game decided to fight back... but not fight back in fun ways, just waves of enemies. I built a broken squad so it wasn't hard but it was annoying. Ship combat was pretty neat too until act 5. idk why it spiked up that much but whatever. this system was better for me than kindom management and crusades by a LONG shot

story was pretty good until end of act 3 then it got stupid. it didn't jive with me but maybe you'll like it. I'm more into high fantasy but i've played every owlcat game so i wanted to see what this was like. Their writing team is still pretty good i just think the setting was too limited. everything was edgy lol, play a ""good"" character = edgy, dogmatic = edgy, and heretical is edgelord. idk

BUGS: there are many... just wait. i don't even want to talk about all the ones i faced. At this point they need to either cut their games shorter, ie only do like 4 acts, or they need to give the entire game to beta. clearly their QA team is too small. How can they continue to release games where their entire niche is the combat... and talents don't work. or something is completely busted. I'll definitely be holding off on all their future games. idk if i'll even be back for the dlc unless they do some major overhauls

The game is overall great as a 40k story, but it should also be mentioned that that means that your actions will only have so much of an effect in the grand scheme of things. The combat also feels very nice, and is 99.99% enjoyable (par from that one fight in Act 4).
The biggest issues this game has is that it's leveling system is awful if you're not following a guide; the companions are basically cardboard cutouts of what they should be; usable weapons basically only drop in Act 2 and Act 5; the entirety of Act 3 is a mess, and most importantly of all: despite the genuinely good writing, the story is tedious to get through as it feels like trying to speedrun the Night Lords trilogy in one sitting.

All that being said, I spent 86 hours doing one blind run of the campaign. Never does it feel like the game is padded with random BS to achieve that as well, dispite my grievences.

All in all, I'm giving it a solid 87/100.

You can have an enjoyable experience roleplaying in this game. You can even make a ogryn type character work if you at least try to read some of the ability tooltips. You will have to interact with fanatics, xeno (filth) and other unsavory types. The game gives you freedom to chose your own path. 

The game revolves around you being a 40K character so expect swarms of mindless low HP minions with the occasional mini boss. It was completely fine until the later chapters where you either are in a horrible position in every fight or the battle is unbalanced to the point that your party will be wiped if you do not meta game.

The space combat in my opinion is not all that interesting but not horrible. At some point it becomes easy. The main issue with it is that the difficulty of the space battles depends on how many enemies there are. There are next to no tactics involved. There are abilities that are seemingly always on cooldown, and if the Emperor blesses you with access to one of them, the encounter is all but over. It would be nice if something was added to the battles such as positioning, charging attacks etc. to make them more engaging. 

The reputation system is alright. It would have been nice if at the end of the game you had more loot to trade and get higher levels but I don't see that changing any time soon. I looked in every crate and safe and yet I did not have enough loot for the truly awesome stuff they have at the end.

Exploring the Koronus expanse was fun but by the end of act 2 you have seen 95% of places you can visit in the game. They have about 60% of the map empty for future expansions. Unless you visit a system on your own you cant get the extractors back and good luck remembering where you littered. Some resources have value, other only have a perceived value. I though that by having a lot of something would entitle me to some benefit but the game revolves around 2 concepts: 
1. Have x number of A resource to get benefits
2. Trade x number of resource A for y number of resource B
You don't need to micromanage anything. At the end of my exploration anything remotely exotic was mined. Profit factor ties closely to the things you can buy from the factions. Unless you focus on one faction (except the navy) completely your profit factor is irrelevant. 

Your protectorate does not really give a lot of room to role play. Same goes for the contracts the game gives you. All planets eventually become hellholes. It would have been nice if there were projects that were tied more closely to you reputation but at the end of the day you are only looking at what a project or event will give your party and ship. Resources are irrelevant, and to my knowledge so are the colonies stats. They are nice but not necessary. 

The game is nice and fun until act 3. At that point I believe that the fun of the game takes a back seat for the narrative. Until that part of the game is changed (if ever) enjoy the guides and try to survive the horrible game decisions that were made. 


[h2]Now that I have outlined some of the gameplay elements let look at why you should not buy this game (currently)[/h2]

From act 3 onwards expect bugs (some game braking), unbalanced encounters, having your hand forced and performance issues.

I have encountered dialog issues, areas where once you enter you are stuck permanently, mechanics that should lower some resource actually increases it, etc. There is no telling what bug you might encounter during your playthrough. 

The game gives you a tip to save if you are unsure about something. You might as well follow the advice as it is your only life line if you encounter something game braking. 

The game is plain and simply unfinished. I gave it a benefit of a doubt and expected issues when I bought it but I did not expect to be unable to finish the game due to the bugs. 

I regret buying this game on release as the experience with its unfinished elements has tainted my opinion of it. If not for the horrible state of the game I would have sung its praises but the scrap code has done its damage.

-Some balance issues (Soldier/Arch-Militant characters blow out the difficulty curve completely)
-It's an extremely WH40K game. If you don't already know a lot of the lore about how this universe operates, you're going to have a lot of catching up to do
-Not fully voice acted. I don't think that's actually a problem, but if you're coming over from BG3 it might come as a shock.
-Last, but not least, BUGS. The last two chapters especially have some serious issues that the developers are still working through, and I needed mods to correct issues like permanent buffs disappearing, quests sticking open after completion, and other mildly gamebreaking issues.

The reason I think its a no, is as a game I don't find it that enjoyable.  The combat is very repetitive in a meh way, even after unlocking lots of talents.  many of the talents seem kind of the same.  So even if you are building or trying to do unique builds they don't really feel ""THAT"" different from each other.  Sure they have differences, but not enough to make it feel like you're invested in your build.  The talents are very heavy in the playing off of other talents and characters to get any strong effect, ESPECIALLY if your playing on anything harder then the base standard difficulty.  So the learning curve can be kind of steep.  

If you are expecting something like Pathfinder WOTR when it comes to builds and game play, this is not it.  Fights are very tabletop 40k like, which is good if you like tabletop 40k.  But after the 20th fight they all start to feel the same.  Even the more unique boss fights don't feel that unique.  Right now im struggling to finish a single play through.  And not because its too difficult, but because it's not holding my interest very well.  I have sunk about 111 hours in at the moment trying different builds, but im losing interest.  

And this is coming from someone that played more then 1300 hours of Pathfinder WOTR and beat that many many times with different builds.  Also I am a fan of 40k which is why i got this.  Used to play table top and had a painted chaos army and have bought many warhammer games on steam before this one.

So would I recommend it to 40k fans, yes with a disclaimer.

As a big CRPG fan, and a 40k dork, I was pretty excited about this title.  When I finally started it, my first impressions were great.  The story seemed interesting, the characters were all pretty unique, and the combat was fun - almost like a better X-COM.  These feelings continued for the first chapter or two of the game, but it all unravelled from chapter 3 onwards.  

This has been a problem for Owlcat with all of their games.  They put a lot of care and attention into the start of the game, but beyond the mid-point they start rushing and it definitely shows.  The game is riddled with bugs everywhere.  Quests triggers don't fire, abilities don't work, animations freeze and if you're not saving the game every 10-15 minutes, you're going to have a bad time.  I've had at least 5 different quests become unresolvable and I've had to reload previous saves.  That's really annoying and by their third game, Owlcat should be on top of this sort of stuff. 

Bug fixes are coming, and these will get ironed out.  These are things I can live with.  What makes me recommend people not buy this game is that it's ultimately a half-baked game that starts off strong and then falls apart later.  They rushed it, and beyond just the bugs, it shows everywhere.  

1) The combat system and character leveling falls apart after the first two acts, with far too many different stats and talents that were never properly tested.  It's a complex system, but the ruleset needs a LOT of work and I'm not sure how likely it is that Owlcat does much with it.  After getting a basic understanding of mechanics, and collecting some gear, combat becomes a snooze fest even on harder difficulties. 

2) The story takes a nosedive.  A lot of CRPGs have this problem, where they follow a tight and compelling narrative for the first half of the game, and then the game opens up and you do a bunch of unrelated sidebars and the standard companion quests.  Some games can tie these in nicely to the overall story and setting, and sometimes they just feel like box-ticking exercises to provide a handful of extra dialogue scenes you quickly forget about.  For Rogue Trader, it's unfortunately the latter. 

3)  The game is full of tedium.  The primary culprit for this is an oppressive skill check system, where there are THIRTEEN different skills to level up, governed by 7-8 different stats, and the game drowns you in them.   95% of them are completely irrelevant and reward nothing but 10-15xp (when leveling up is 1000+ xp), but you never know when it might actually be something important that you don't want to miss.  This slows the game down tremendously. 

4) The last part of the game that disappoints is the ship-combat mini-game, which just sucks.  It's easy, but incredibly boring and shallow, and I guess the best thing I can say about it is that it's at least less crappy than Owlcat's management sims in Pathfinder Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous.  This was supposed to be a core feature of the game, but the devs put zero effort into it and it shows.  

Overall, this is a game that starts strong and falls apart quickly halfway through, and whereas I had faith that Owlcat and modders would fix their previous games, I have little faith that most of the problems for Rogue Trader are solvable.",1703441581,1704214507,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm not super big fan of the universe, however I do like to read lore articles on Wiki and listen to lore podcasts - also ocassional video games from the universe. 

Rogue Trader explores the 40K's universe in other aspects than war - and it should as cRPG. Be it position of the player character in the world, interactions with NPCs, actions that NPCs do (great example - even faceless voidmen from your ship have 'some' agenda). Imperium of Man is usually described as conflicted, yet so far I usually seen unity in face of war aspect. In case of Rogue Trader - it is very well shown that interests of different people within the Imperium might differ. 

As for the semi neutral cons - turn based combat is okay-ish. Certainly it is not Baldur's Gate 3 level of fun from the combat. Unfortunately there is a lot of combat in Rogue Trader. That said - the combat is not bad, it is just ""okay-ish"".

- AI allies are really dumb, they shoot you in the back without *thinking*, they need to improve the AI or allow the player to control them. 
- There are still a lot of bugs, especially after chapter 3. I had to use mods to go through certain parts of the game

When I stumbled across this by chance, I had to buy it almost instantly. And I am so glad I did. The use of the lore is excellent. There is some nice writing that brings alive the universe. There are pop-up tips and an encyclopedia for players without the background knowledge. The plot is good for a computer game and does a good job of making you encounter a wide range of aspects of the world without it feeling forced or clumsy. Sure, it moves you very quickly from being a random guy to being someone who owns several planets, but I can forgive them for that because I want to get into the game. Some parts are voice-acted and this is done well. Exactly the right amount of over-the-top for the situation.

WH40K is famous for being ""grimdark"". WH40K veterans know this means that sometimes the ""right"" thing to do is something that would be a horrific crime in the real world. Rogue Trader certainly allows a few choices like that. You can also choose to be a nice guy, without being punished for it too much. This will help players who are unfamiliar with the background, or who feel uncomfortable with exterminating an entire city because there may be heretics among them. It's not grimdark-lite, it's grimdark-optional. You can also play an extermination-happy purist or a budding heretic.

A similar freedom is built into the combat and upgrade system. It can be very complex for those who want to engage with it. Each character has various numbers that can be optimised, which would be needed at the highest difficulty levels. The list of upgrade options is dizzying. For more laid-back players, you can play happily at medium difficulty without worrying too much about the detailed mechanics. During level-up, you can choose from a shorter list of suggested upgrades. I mixed things a bit by sometimes planning my upgrades, sometimes picking skills that just sounded fun and, when I couldn't see an obvious choice, just picking one of the suggested ones. You can easily re-spec any of your characters later, if you feel you made a mistake.

The core part of the game is the battle system. This is turn-based and gives you a lot of tactical choices. Your characters, particularly when upgraded, fit specific roles. My tank started out as a basic tank and now stands in the middle of a crowd of enemies, laughing at attacks and just getting stronger the more his enemies hate him. There is usually some complex counter for each of your characters. For example, my run-and-gun solder gets more powerful the more she changes her tactics. At higher difficulties, you will need to optimise these numbers. At medium difficulty, you just need to get a general feel for their strengths and go with it. The battles are interesting. You are usually heavily outnumbered and can enjoy cutting through the opposition. There were a few battles that seemed to be horrible difficulty-spikes but each time I found that changing my tactics made the second or third attempt much easier. If you need to, you can change difficulty temporarily, but I never needed it and I am neither a power-gamer nor unusually patient.

There are other activities. Travelling through warp space is dangerous and can lead to battles on board your ship, or simply eerie descriptions of strange events. Occasionally it resulted in short text-based choose-your-own adventures, which were well-written and a nice change from the battles. There is an in-game way of making warp travel safer, but I preferred letting the warp events happen. There is an activity involving managing your trade empire. Personally, I thought this was a bit under-used but it did a good job of providing motivation for exploration and fighting. And there are ship battles. Players are divided over these, but I enjoyed them. It's not Battlefleet Gothic, but a boardgame-style turn-based system. I found one particular battle unwinnable but coming back later with an upgraded ship solved that problem.

I came across surprisingly few bugs for a game this complex. The developers have pushed a few patches out to fix things I never actually encountered. There are probably specific issues in the subtleties of the combat system, but I never noticed any. A couple of minor graphics glitches, and an occasional error in the text. Part of the ship upgrade system was less obvious than it should be.

I'm loving the game. I'll probably replay it, which I hardly ever do, especially for a game this long. Perhaps when the DLC is available. Special praise for the designers who managed to offer a game with whatever level of complexity you are comfortable with, and for the writers who did such a good job with the background lore while still supporting people experiencing it for the first time.

I recommend it if you LOVE WH40k universe and you know something about it (because game itself doesn't bother to explain many of things). 
In this case you will enjoy this game even there are some major problems: 

- It's huge game. Well, that isn't right word. The right word is - it's HUGE GAME. There is tons of possibilities, TONS of options how to build your party. And there is TONS of text. 
And if you absolutely don't know anything about universe, you will be lost. Noone will explain you anything. That could be problem for casual players. However, if you know universe, you will be blown away. It is AWESOME. 
To be fair, it isn't ""text game"" at all. There is probably same amount of fights. Finally - it's WH40k and ""fight and win"" is main goal for anyone in universe. So don't worry - you will probably spend same amount of time by fighting like talking. 
- As I said above - it's HUGE game with TONS of options how to walk through. Problem is - it have TONS of BUGS. Really. If you are lucky enough, you will find ""just"" dozens of bugs in EVERY act. 
Most of time those issues are minor ones- glitching texture or animation, ""cutscenes"" which triggre multiple times whenever you cross the trigger lane, ""frozen"" enemies, invulnerable enemies, sometimes in fight enemy took really loooooooong time for decide what to do (and after that they will do nothing). 
However, you can find (and you will find) some really annoying and game breaking bugs. Sometimes you are not able to interact with quest items/characters (which is extra bad in main story), some places have so bad optimalization that game could be unplayable in current settings, sometime your character is not able to reach key area because of ""litteraly anything"" (mostly some invisible obstacle). You can solve it mostly by reaload last save or restart game, but still - it's really frustrating. 
So (as game will advise you in loading screen) ""If you are in doubt - SAVE"". You will need tons of saves. 
- And there are some ""not so big and not so small bugs"" - lots of skills, talents and items are not work properly. Sometime they work, sometimes not, sometimes on halfway, which could ruin whole fight if you don't know it before. :D 
Some bugs play for you, some play against you. F.e. in my gameplay, enemies were affected even by those debuffs, which should be aplied by characters, which were not even in current group. Somehow they aplied their passive skills from base. :D 
However, Owlcat games constantly work on it and releases patches, which repairing those issues, so it getting better and better. 
One of issue could be also very short and kinda useless ""tutorial"". However, game has its own ""wiki"" with context links where you can find anything you need. 

Conclusion: if you really love this universe - buy it. Because after all, it's strong, immersive game with awesome plot, dozens of awesome quests and interesting characters. Owlcat was able to make amazing story and amazing part of WH40k. The first hunderd hours of play will catch you and you will want to spend your every minute in game (to be honest, slightly before end it is a little bit boring for me - it is really long journey, but I want to reach the end at all costs). 
However, even if you are not fan, I believe it worth for try. Just be patient and you will have one of the best story, which I ever get in this universe.

The review does not contain direct spoilers, but contains indirect ones. The size of the game, the number of the ending slides, and what the player’s actions affect.

I think any opinion on CRPGs will not be complete without mentioning the great and mighty Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, and even more so for a game from the same studio, because in my opinion, PF2 is not just a benchmark of quality, it’s a huge leap for the entire genre, which not only raised the bar of quality, but made a breakthrough so great that I seriously doubted whether the developers themselves could repeat their triumph.

Well, they almost did!

Whereas PF2 created colossal possibilities in terms of variability through paths, in RT, due to a different setting and approach, everything is more linear and closer to a standard CRPG, yet there are still branching options and the detail is fantastic.

Where PF2 took diversity, RT counters with volume, the first ending I got from a blind playthrough consisted of 62 (!!!) slides (for comparison, in PF2 it's on average 30), and that's not the limit, the player's actions practically influence everything, for example, reputation with factions is not just a tool to increase combat potential, each faction has an ending that depends on reputation level, each colony has an ending that depends on the construction of the final tier, of course, all these variations are multiplied by the player's choices in specific quests and their worldview, which dramatically affects the ending.

Moreover, one of the slides was dedicated to an NPC whom we met only once…

Choose wisely!

This is what I call attention to detail and I fervently recommend the game to all CRPG fans, finally a project we deserved.

About technical side, i finished the game on the first week and only meet 2 bugs, final quest of Argenta didnt completed and blackscreen on one of cutscenes, both was solved by toybox.

The negative review is because the game is an unfinished, disjointed mess. As incredible as it sounds for an Owlcat game, they completely botched the narrative on this one. Act 1 is fine, and Act 2 is great, and after that everything takes a nosedive. Companions mostly dont' have any sort of arc, they just have a few random quests that usually end up in unsatisfying pointless endings. The plot is a confused mess of different things, they clearly tried to tie together different elements of the wh40k universe but they ended up giving not gravitas to anything. 

Entire plot points that are presented as important mysteries end up resolved in a quick, potentially missable dialogue that just says ""oh, yeah, and that happened"" (looking at you Theodora's murderer! Looking at you, stolen suns!)

New villains get introduced in every act and you kind of feel more like a tourist that is constantly get thrown into random events more than the protagonist of a complete story who has an objective to fulfill. The plot almost feels episodic, or as if they had ideas for three different games and then they just clumped everything together with little care for logic and narrative sense.

The game is almost entirely non-reactive to your MC, meaning it lets you choose to be a psyker or a naval officer or an imperial guard commander or a former crime lord etc, and none of it matters at all except for the stats this gives. There are very, very few dialogues where your origin comes up at all. 

Combat is mostly broken, side-systems like outpost management are essentially placeholders. Space combat I actually found pretty fun especially in the beginning, but like everything else is completely unbalanced (quite hard in the beginning unless you repair the ship during combat, which feels a bit cheatey, and a complete cakewalk in later acts when you're massively overpowered).

I don't know how Owlcat managed to take such a massive step back from the peak that was WOTR, but I think it's important for people who are considering buying this game to understand that this isn't a gem in the rough that needs a few months of patches to shine. Even at its best I think it will still remain an unfinished, botched crpg that just utterly fails past the act 2 mark.",1704188235,1704188235,False,0,0,0.465686261653900146,0,True,False,False

I missed several things, as indicated by achievements, but overall I believe I saw near-everything. I have played game in the Story mode (the lowest difficulty meant for those who want the story, not the challenge), so some of the balance commentary might not be correct. I also only completed one playthrough as a ""good guy"", so I cannot offer opinions on how well-developed ""bad guy"" roleplay scenarios are. With this premise out of the way, my review:

Rogue Trader is the first CRPG (computer RPG) game in Warhammer40k universe. As such, one of its tasks, as I see it, was to portray the fictional universe for a wider auditory - to serve as a gateway for new people to join the community and fandom. At the same time the game had to be faithful to the lore and to please the fans, who can be pretty pedantic. Did the game succeed? In my opinion - [b]yes, absolutely[/b]. Stylistically, it is near impeccable, it has good compelling narrative that makes sense in-universe. It is large without being too large. The core gameplay loop (tactical turn based combat mixed with an extensive dialogs and skill checks) is compelling without being too tedious. 

[b]Being objective, I would rate the game as 8 out of 10. As a fan of WH40K, 10/10, keep them coming! [/b]

Now, onto detailed list of pluses and minuses:

[b]Pluses[/b]:
1) The style and atmosphere of the game. As mentioned above, it can serve as a perfect introduction to the universe of WH40K. A+, no grievances. 
2) Roleplaying component. From what I was able to glimpse, there are choices everywhere, and the choices matter, both down the road in later chapters, and for the very, very extensive ending. The game reminds me of Fallouts 1 and 2 in this way. As a separate note I wanted to commend the ending – it was very extensive and satisfying. I believe I mostly got good endings for everyone. Could several of them be better? Yes, absolutely. Did they leave a bitter taste of grimderp in my mouth? Mostly not. And perhaps I missed something, and better ones could have been achieved. Something to check later. 
3) Storyline. It makes sense in-universe, it’s plausible and develops from something relatively small to a grandiose finale. The only thing I am left wondering about is how canon all of this is, because, depending on what ending is canon, the ending of the game can have consequences for the wider WH40K universe. [spoiler] a newborn Ctan that is benevolent and on the side of humanity is kinda up there with Primarchs are back [/spoiler]
4) The game size. It took me over 90 hours to complete on the lowest difficulty, and I suspect that on the highest it would take longer. The game is big, but not overwhelmingly so. Just on the border of being too big to complete, I think. 
5) Relative lack of bugs. Owlcat games, sadly, never had very good quality controls in terms of bugs. However, in this game, which I played a little less than a month after initial release, with patches coming just a bit faster than I played, I didn’t really experience anything game of plot breaking. Some minor ones, but overall the game was good. 
6) A very interesting and unusual trading/reputation system welded to inventory management system. 

[b]Minuses[/b]:
1) No Orks. From the perspective of the gateway to WH40K, complete lack of orks in the game makes little sense. They are everywhere in the universe, and their complete absence from the game even as random encounters makes little sense. Yes, they do not fit the main story, but as random encounters they would make sense. Maybe something to add in DLCs? 
2) Drop-off in quantity and breadth of stories in chapters 3-5. In most modern RPGs you have the main “body of the game” and then the “final sprint”, where the story focuses, the side quests drop off, and you just go for the big boss? That’s how chapters 3 to 5 of the 5 chapter story feel like in this game. Chapter 3 is a big interruption, chapter 5 is that last sprint, and chapter 4, while having side-activities, could have more. 
Overall, I get a feeling that in the middle of development, Owlcat realized, possibly due to rapidly changing geopolitical situation, that they didn’t have resources, or time to implement everything they wanted, so they instead focused on wrapping up what they had by that time (chapters 1-2, and core storyline of the rest of the game, it feels like). If that’s true, and I suspect it is at least in part, then that’s a winning and praiseworthy realistic strategy, but I can’t help but hope that the game could be more. 
And yes, I realize that this would make the game larger, and so fewer people would finish it, probably. It’s a hard thing to balance. On one hand, I like that I was able to finish the game. On another, I want more. 
3) Space combat. This will probably be fixed in the first promised DLC, but I feel that this is one of the parts that could have been developed more. 
4) Weird mechanics/lore balance issues. 
During the game you get a veteran Space Wolf space marine party member. He is supposed to be a post-human super-soldier, strong enough that several hundreds of people like him could take over an industrialized planet. Yet, mechanically, he’s severely lacking. A sororitas sister, who is supposed to be a normal human, is better than him in nearly all respects. I realize that it’s hard to both have a superhuman in the party, and not to make him imbalanced, but I think Owlcat strongly over-corrected when designed him, and made him very underwhelming. The stats, as well as his equipment limitations, and large size (he takes more grid squares than normal companions) just make him feel worse to play. It doesn’t help that he’s mechanically bugged, and so many of his supposed core features just don’t work. 
Psykers are overpowered. Yes, in lore an Alpha-level psyker could subjugate entire planets on their own, but are we to believe that all our psyker companions are high beta to alpha grade? That seems like a stretch, to be honest. 
To summarize: it’s weird from the story perspective how some characters can keep up and, in fact, outshine, others. 

To summarize: a great game, but with a lot of observable unrealized potential. I wish it was made canon, and there would be more of it.",1704185120,1704185145,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the extreme frequency of combat moments in the game means that it's basically impossible to enjoy the beautiful 40k universe that the devs crafted here because it is constantly interrupted by horribly unfulfilling, overly complex combat.  This is coming from someone who enjoys playing Soulslike games for their difficulty, and who enjoyed the combat of BG3 to the utmost, and didn't even consider that combat to be difficult. That should give you some perspective on how needlessly convoluted and complicated the combat/skill trees in this game are.",1704162600,1704162600,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
2186680,155026811,76561198103242983,0,10,4725,0,4725,1704158437,"Game is one of the best entries into the Warhammer 40k universe hands down, often offering explanations for the words used by the characters themselves in dialogue, accessible just by hovering your mouse over them and featuring a sizeable 'beastiary'-like journal in which you can read plenty of information regarding the universe if at any point lost. Despite this, the game's story doesn't feel predictable even for someone truly accustomed to Warhammer40k, as there will still be plenty of surprising moments in the story, as well as moments of ""Ah, hah! So these were actually the heretics!"". Depending on your choices, the game often feels like you're a member of the Inquisition itself with how many of these revelations you can have - and then act upon in classic 40k style. 

The characters and your companions are quite nice and developed and, though some tend to be a little more 'static' throughout the story - in the sense that they don't feature nearly as much evolution along their character arc as others - they still prove to be satisfactory in terms of character depth. You may often find yourself rooting for these characters as they find out more about themselves or the variety of tasks they wish to pursue in their journey among the stars.

The conviction system is quite nice and offers players a reason to come back and replay the game again, choosing wildly different paths than before. Some of the conviction choices are -very- impactful storywise and the player is shown an example of this somewhat early on in the game. The convictions also make their way into the game's mechanics, with certain weapons and armors requiring certain convictions or granting bonuses to a rogue trader of a certain conviction.

The combat system is pretty well done, the combat is often deadly and tense, but it can often become dragged out and, in especially long play sessions in which you encounter several long combats, the combat of the game can sometimes become exhausting. This again, I have only found to be an issue when playing for extended periods of time and actively engaging in combat encounters, but it has happened. One of the main issues for this I believe is the fact that each character and enemy often have somewhat long 'buffing' animations that they have to complete every turn, where, for example, you'll be activating your Soldier's turn - then buffing them with one ability, waiting for the animation to finish, buff them with another ability, wait for animation to finish, buff them again, wait for animation and only then actually firing. Likewise, the balancing of the combat encounters sometimes feels off. My first (and current, as of the time of the review) playthrough is on the Hard difficulty ( second hardest difficulty of the game ) and one of the most egregious examples of awkward balancing was Chapter 1 itself. Most of the chapter felt relatively fine, some encounters were a little more tense than others, but there was nothing insane - that is until the final encounter of the Chapter, [spoiler] with the Chaos Marine Aurora, [/spoiler] which proved to be absolutely ballbustingly hard and took me 4 hours and endless attempts to finally beat.

While many of the reviews on this game speak endlessly of the bugs littering the game, I can say that personally, besides numerous graphical bugs and the occasional (annoying) combat bug here and there (such as, again rarely, attacks not hitting anything at all despite 100% hit chance and the game not recognizing the attack at all, not even displaying a 'miss' text), I have not encountered many - if any - gamebreaking or savebreaking bugs. I completed the game up to the beginning of Chapter 4 by, roughly, 23rd of December, after which I waited for more patches and have recently started up the Chapter, again, with very minimal bugs which were often present in the previous chapters aswell. I believe that these bugs shouldn't be a reason to worry, especially as by the time you are reading this review, they will likely have been fixed.

Rogue Trader is a great and amazingly fun CRPG and, while I refrain from calling it better than Baldur's Gate 3, I can attest to the fact that I have played Rogue Trader for a lot more hours than it. Whether that is a result of the combat system, the elaborate character creation and building or the absolutely amazing world and dialogue, I cannot say.

Game is incredible but very buggy in the last quarter. The game is without a doubt worth the price for the first 3/4ths alone, but hold off on getting it if you want to enjoy everything the game has to offer.

-Long Version-
This game is absolutely fantastic! Truly scratches that RPG itch that I have had for a while that other game seem to have ignored. The amount of different synergies between equipment, abilities, and talents and how they work between characters is incredible and adds so much depth to the combat! It also perfectly nails downs the Warhammer 40k feel perfectly!

This game isn't without its faults though. As per Owlcat games, the game is pretty buggy as of writing this review after just shy of a month after release. Everything up to Act 3 is really stable and consistent, then Act 3 gets a little buggy, and then Act 4 completely falls apart. I somewhat understand as CRPGs are not the easiest games to make due to the massive amounts of moving parts within the game, and to be fair it is more stable than their previous releases.

Outside of being buggy 3/4ths into the game, there are a few aspects that the game needs to polish up. The reputation system between factions which replaces shops (really interesting idea btw, would like to see this idea further explored) is not tuned very well to the point where you can't max out all of them without EXTREME amounts of grinding random encounters. The game also struggles to convey certain information about combat, which can make certain decisions difficult when you are unsure how it will effect combat.

Overall, would I recommend this game in its current state? Absolutely! The content from Act 1 and 2 alone make it worth the money in my opinion, and Act 3 is absolutely playable in its current state. If you want to play the complete game however, I suggest holding off until everything is patched as the Act 4 experience is sorely lacking. Personally I have decided to stop at the end of Act 4 until Owlcat fixes the bugs and then start a new game on a higher difficultly. My builds were so strong at the end of Act 4 that I was clearing fights within a single turn or two, so I would want to crank the difficultly up higher with the same builds and see how it works out!",1704156472,1704156472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Building your character can be a little bit confusing for the first levels as the system allows you to take a LOT of paths, it may take you a couple of levels to understand what does what and if it's truly what you need, you can always make a respec. which is greatly appreciated, and as with any RPG games make sure to diversify your party. 

All the characters are just awesome and their voicing is perfect, the voice of Ulfar it's just amazing and really makes you fee you are hearing an space marine, the only ""bad side"" is that not all the dialogues are spoken and in some cases i could have made a better impact on certain scenes. 

The combat mechanics just hit the spot, and very entertaining, each fight has it's own challenge and with the exception of the raids due to warp travel they all feel different, making you think on how you till face certain challenges and the space battles are extremely fun, such a shame there are so limited encounters but it seems in the next DLC there will be more on them,

Talking about combat it was nice to fight against almost every mayor faction of WH, but is such a shame they missed ork, which I hope they add on a next DLC. 

As every game it is not 100% perfect and the main issues I had were with bugs, some of them weren't that game breaking, however others were really painful making you reload a lot, (and remember F5 does a quick save, always press that button after a fight) , the team is working actively on patching the bugs which is nice.

To summarize Rogue trader is an amazing game, made with love and dedication which can be seen in every small detail that the team did, I don't have any doubt that it will soon became a reference for Warhammer gaming just like Spacemarine did a while ago, definitely a must have if you love RPG's.

The story is quite good at stringing things along, allowing you to piece together the story for yourself as you dig into the secrets. As a whole, it's a bit simple, but the characters are enjoyable and flavorful.
The choices do feel different, enough that they are entirely different worldviews. I think they're portrayed with interesting nuance and well done in the 40k universe.

Overall would definitely recommend if you enjoy the CRPG genre or are looking for more of a role playing entry into the 40k universe!",1704144746,1704144746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also don't like how the ""Rogue Trader"" and his/her actual status in the WH40k universe is blatantly limited by the confined horizon of the writers, since most of the time it feels like you are playing a mere ship captain and not one of the most powerful beings in the Imperium of Man.",1703876965,1704139654,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The system is loosely based on a WH40k table-top RPG system from 15 years ago. The number of classes in the two-tier system is relatively low, but level-ups are plentiful and involve picking talents from a long list, each littered with math formulae that make your head spin at first. Combat is turn-based and starts off resembling X-COM, but quickly degenerates to combo-based alpha strikes where your party takes multiple turns before the enemies even get to act once. It's great fun when you get the hang of it, but probably could do with some more balancing. In addition to the turn-based combat, there is space exploration and turn-based spaceship combat plus colony management to get busy with. The spaceship combat was sufficiently challenging and tactical to hold my interest, and the colony management is mostly just picking what flavour bonuses you would like to have for your trade empire.

The game takes place in the WH40k universe, the grimdarkest of all places, and the obscure lore and unique mind-set of the characters come off well as you travel the Koronus Expanse to battle xenos, chaos cultists, and other enemies of the Empire as a Rogue Trader (a mix between a robber baron and an explorer). The Rogue Trader can recruit a number of companions with unique backgrounds and skills to build their six-person party. You have a grizzled navy officer, a navigator with an aura of madness, an uptight inquisitor, an augmented Tech-Priest, a mentally unstable psyker, a bolter-wielding battle sister, a sultry smuggler, a space marine, and even a couple of xenos for the heretic enjoyers. Party banter and romances are present, but this is clearly the Rogue Trader's story and the rest of the cast play supporting roles. Voice acting is used sparsely but is very good where it is present. There's no motion capture and cutscenes are used sparingly. The sound design is some of the best ever - the music is suitably atmospheric, voicelines echo in the emptiness of massive space ships, bolters and plasma guns make appropriate noises, and enemies splatter in satisfying explosions of viscera.

The biggest problem is the numerous bugs. Over the course of my playthrough the worst bugs got patched out so I never got stuck, but clearly some quests failed and some talents don't work as intended. Nevertheless, the overall package is very enjoyable and WH40k:RT is a solid title in 2024. This is also the shortest and easiest of the Owlcat games, so if you struggled to get into the Pathfinder series this might be an easier starting place.",1704135571,1704135571,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In the name of the Omnissiah, the divine embodiment of all knowledge and machinery, I present my observations on the digital construct known as 'Rogue Trader' crafted by the adepts of Owlcat Games. This virtual machine-spirit, embedded within a complex lattice of code and algorithm, is an enigmatic and temperamental entity, reflecting the capricious nature of the digital realms.

Firstly, it is imperative to acknowledge the intricate and labyrinthine nature of this game's machine-spirit. It is a creation both wondrous and confounding, brimming with the potential for both revelation and frustration. As a tech-priest, I have witnessed its unpredictable behavior - a trait not uncommon in complex machine-spirits. The game's virtual environment is vast and richly detailed, offering a universe of possibilities that both exhilarate and challenge the acolytes of gameplay.

However, it is with a measure of solemn caution that I must speak of the game's propensity for erratic behavior. The machine-spirit within 'Rogue Trader' shows a tendency towards instability, a reflection of the ever-warring binary ghosts within its sacred code. Players must be prepared to engage in the sacred litanies and rites of save and load operations frequently. These rituals serve as a safeguard against the caprices of the machine-spirit, ensuring that one's progress through this digital odyssey is not lost to the ether.

In the throes of gameplay, one must also be prepared to appease the machine-spirit through various means. This may involve incantations (commonly known as 'bug reports') to the creators, so they may perform the necessary rites to soothe the spirit. Patience is a virtue here, as the process of sanctification and debugging is a meticulous and time-consuming process, much like the intricate rites performed on the sacred machinery of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

Despite these challenges, the experience offered by 'Rogue Trader' is a testament to the artistry and skill of its creators. The narrative is a complex tapestry, woven with the threads of lore and character, deeply immersive and engaging. The mechanics, though occasionally inscrutable, offer a depth of strategy and customization that is both challenging and rewarding.

In conclusion, 'Rogue Trader' is a digital marvel - a creation that embodies the unpredictable nature of machine-spirits. It requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to engage in the sacred rites of maintenance and appeasement. For those who tread its digital corridors with respect and understanding, it offers a rich and rewarding journey through the stars. Praise be to the Omnissiah, the divine keeper of all knowledge and machinery.",1704132336,1704132336,True,0,1,0.490463197231292725,0,True,False,False

I love the attention to detail, everything from the music, setting, atmosphere, dialogue, lore is just a faithful adaptation...Except for the Edar/Dark Eldar romance options i felt that was a little out of place, but hey i'm not knocking it. Can't romance the sister of battle either....which is pretty weird all things considered.

The plot is fantastic until you get to Act 3. Things just become more and more broken as you progress, cut-scenes don't function, quests break, progression is blocked...The plot itself becomes inconsistent with severe pacing issues during and after act 3. 

Combat is down to preference, some people will like it, others wont. For me personally i'm split down the middle, on one hand it's fun and engaging and on the other it becomes a slog with inconsistent difficulty spikes.

e: Finally fixed enough to be completed. Still, lots of and lots of bugs though. I think I saw every possible ending for Idira in the wrap up chronicle. Ditto the Cogs.

Final thoughts: This was a reasonably fun foray into the 40k Universe. The actual ""Rogue Trader"" bits ( managing worlds, voidship command, and so on ) seemed weirdly divorced from the core game-play. Would've like to see that actually matter more. The reputation system was a neat idea but the game really needed to make clear the necessity of focusing on one of the main factions to the exclusion of all others. Despite completing every quest in the game I didn't even max one main faction's rep. That said the streamlining they did on inventory management / vendor interaction was wonderful - hopefully Larian takes notes.

Stand by my recommendation to wait on a sale for this one. It's still really bugged in places and the ease with which a properly kitted Argenta just single-handedly sleepwalks through fights indicates that basically no balance testing was done while the game was being made. I can't imagine there's much depth at the higher difficulties.

I used to be a console player/handheld gamer, so most of my life was spent playing turn-based RPG's (Devil Survivor and other SMT games primarily). Since moving to PC in 2019, i didn't play many RPG's for a very long time. i was VERY excited to try Baldur's Gate 3 and had played divinity 2 a bit before then, and came to find after 30 hours or so from each that they're some kind of feminist comedy game for laughs? i dont really understand the appeal of those games. Moreover, i find it difficult to roleplay or get immersed in ""generic fantasy setting"", and this game made me realize how I wish ALL RPG's were licensed games based on huge serious properties that you're familiar with and can learn more about. i do not know or care about a single thing happening in divinity or baldur's gate, and 99% of the characters are jokes and don't care either. I hope owlcat one day makes a Star Trek TNG RPG or something using this engine, it's perfect for it and it'd blow baldur's gate out of the water, too, because of the weight of the setting alone.
I cannot find the credits for the writers, but i am wagering that it has an all-male writing team, PLUS Games Workshop oversight(who are rebranding 40K into a very much serious direction lately), making for a game where you actually care about what's going on because there isnt a joke every 20 seconds, and no party members making feminist Marvel quips every time you interact with someone. 
I don't even know anybody who likes comedy and wants comic relief. I don't know who the target audience is. I think they might do that stuff so much in video games because then twitch streamers can scream and overreact when the cat makes a funny feminist poop joke!!! in baldur's gate 3, and then scream again when your all-gay party members quip about it.
There is nothing like that in rogue trader. The canon is respected the religions are respected and everything is handled very professionally. This kind of serious writing is nearly nonexistent nowadays, and I'm so, so happy with the way Games Workshop is managing their IP now. If you liked the writing in New Vegas then this game is for you. Everyone including and especially the antagonists have reasonable points of view and explain their positions eloquently.

I think Rogue Trader's gameplay loop is bordering on plagiarism of divinity 2, in all of the best ways. Which is why I keep mentioning those games. Rogue Trader is what i wanted those games to be (the stupid puddles AoE spam is not present here however. you and enemies dont spend every turn thinking about puddles. i got bored of that in div2/bg3 after the 3rd or 4th fight).  
Content in rogue trader is dripfed and you'll have an entirely new game mechanic to try out every 10 hours or so, which is largely whats keeping me so hooked. i love the space ship and the space battles and have never seen turn-based combat like it before. 
I fucked up my economy because i was so excited to try every weapon class i recruited 10 mercenaries.
I'm playing on Normal difficulty which feels very fair and balanced to me. I don't think I'd enjoy playing on anything harder because of how this genre abuses hit-chance stuff for artificial difficulty.",1703060371,1704115264,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Combat is tactical and very engaging. With 50+ hours logged at the time of this review, I have yet to feel that combat has become stale or boring. The game manages to make even support characters feel powerful, which is great. 

Outside of character creation and combat, decision making is my favorite thing about cRPGs. I love feeling like my decisions matter and that no two playthroughs will feel the same.

One thing to be aware of is there ARE still bugs.  none of the ones i encountered were very detrimental or game breaking.  there was one that made me repeat 2 hours of game play (i did not have to but chose to), a couple incidents of abilities not working at the right time during combat, and a couple loot sites i missed out on. Altogether there was nothing that made me want to stop playing. the ending was satisfying with the traditional lighthearted, dim, dark, tragic, hopeless vibe. if you like crpgs then its good. if you like 40k too it great.  if you like deep combat and leveling systems its amazing.  if little things annoy you then its not. 8/10",1704100493,1704100493,True,4,0,0.528795838356018066,0,True,False,False

But for some fucking reason Owlcat Games CANNOT get the mini-game systems right.

Voidship combat is fucking terrible. It's fine at first and can be cheesed, but you run into this super fun sector that has not one, not two, but FOUR fucking encounters with the absolute worst piece of shit imaginable.

Drukhari patrols! Enjoy this complete trash designed series of encounters, you have to fight 12 ships, PER ENCOUNTER and not 12 at a time, that'd be more torture than it already is, I don't know why we don't just fight 20 and say fuck you uninstall cunt!

You have to fight an actual fucking armada of ships that are 4x your speed, can actually do a 360 spin on themselves, all of their weapons ignore shields while simultaneously removing your ships, because why not. And they have this obnoxious hit and run tactic that your big dumbass hunk of imperium garbage can't hope to deal with.

This series of encounters ruined the entire game for me, you always fucking drop the ball owlcat, who designed these? I bet it was the same asshole who made the ""burning house dream"" in pathfinder:Kingmaker. I still haven't forgiven him for that, and I know he had a hand in the inception of these encounters.

I had to go into the game files track down these fucking drukhari nonsense, drop ALL of their stats to fucking 1 because removing the files breaks the game naturally so I had to make them useless, which also made all the drukhari armour/weapons useless. A fair trade to remove ALL drukhari patrols from the game.

Though I imagine bugs will be fixed in the new year, and content will bulk with DLC.

Entering act 3 I lost all my permanent buffs & colony buffs for no discernible reason. In the pub fight, my extra companion sat and did nothing forever on there turn, forcing me to grant the emperor's mercy to them. Ulfar - the space wolf - has a tendency to run in the opposite direction when charging, leading to me never using this ability on him - plus the big lad gets stuck in combat alot. Occasionally the characters would be highlighted in a green box at there feet - thankfully only occurred with stationary npcs. On occasion enemies would sit for a while, then end there turn after doing nothing - no clue why but it was confusing. In act 4 there is a character that needs to be calmed down for an iconoclast solution - I did all the necessary tasks - with successful checks - and they didn't calm down meaning  if I wanted to do the iconclast thing I would have to reload >1 hour ago as the world was a maze, comboed with each map segment having a load screen between them and therefore having autosaves on map transitions.

Out of the bad, and into the good - looting is so much better than either of the pathfinder games - no carry weight means I can horde to my hearts content. When not bugging out combat is great, the sounds & general gameplay as well, though potentially adding an optional tutorial for levelling would be nice, though given neither pathfinder games had that I doubt it will happen. The characters were all fun to interact with, and there quests were fun enough to complete.

Kinda loving the game so far but lots of changes that I'd REALLY WANT TO SEE. Owlcat, if you're reading this, please:

1. PLEASE LET US RESPECC COMPANIONS FROM LEVEL 1. You can lock their first Archetype, fine - but please just let us choose their skills and talents. Some of the later companions' builds aren't too bad - Yrilet is fine, I guess. but Jae's build is an affront to the Emperor and the Empyrean altogether. It's as if you guys specifically chose the worst imaginable combination of abilities and talents for her Officer progression. She's worthless until Exemplar where I can start to fix her by giving her the Officer skills and talents to optimise her.

2. Without getting into spoilers, the start of Chapter 3 puts you in a situation where you and you companions are kidnapped and temporarily have your gears removed. You can't equip anything from your inventory and need to make do with trash loot laden about the map. This is just poor game design. Please change this. I was caught off-guard since there was no warning about the sudden kidnapping and seizure of gear. I usually play a one-turn-kill squad where I try to win every encounter after the Prologue without letting a single enemy get a single turn (yes, even the notorious final boss of Chapter 1). I've restarted many runs and I've gotten pretty good at this. This silly surprise was seriously annoying and I had to reload my save to before the kidnapping just to ""adapt"". The encounters I had to deal with before getting my gear back was incredibly annoying, Encounters like Forgefiend and Chaos Space Marine are fun and challenging. Having all your gear seized for multiple 20 minutes slogfest fights against trash mob isn't.

I'd recommend the game should Owlcat choose to fix these annoyances.",1704091176,1704091176,False,4,0,0.53586500883102417,0,True,False,False

Good game overall, but too many bugs and the story starts to fall off in the middle of chapter 3. Owlcat has either not learned about their Pathfinder Kingmaker/WoTR launch issues, or faced significant pressure to get this pushed out early. They also clearly did not fully test chapter 3,4 and 5 given the the amount of bugs people are facing. The way they developed this game in .NET and Unity makes the game break almost uniquely for every one. They really need overhaul their current blueprint implementation, or at least iron out the bugs before launch.

The chapter 1, 2, and first half of 3 stories were pretty interesting. Gets a bit nonsensical after that with some of the key story points being revealed and how they're handled. Not all of them, but it's plenty enough to break your immersion and ask ""Why is no one saying anything about this?"". Argenta's little confessional session in chapter 3 is one such weak point.

The combat is fun overall, but officer spam is OP and nothing comes close to how strong it is. While this isn't necessarily a fault, you're not going to have fun on Unfair w/o abusing Officers. Wish there was more options for tackling the higher difficulties. You don't need to abuse Officers on Normal or Daring to get by, but it'll definitely be painful on some bosses in chapter 3 onward. Combat balance is ""interesting"" and has a pretty noticeable difficulty spike around chapter 3, but since I was abusing Officers I steamrolled practically everything on Daring. Your mileage may vary.

The bugs are very noticeable. Some people get lucky and only encounter minor visual bugs, but I wasn't so lucky. I had to spend many hours across multiple days trying to figure out how to fix a game-breaking bug that would not allow me to advance to chapter 5, the final chapter. There was also a lot of other bugs revolving around cut-scenes not playing, certain flags not being set, and others. Minor visual bugs I can overlook, but the sheer number of game-breaking bugs that holistically block progression in a paid product very bad. It's pretty disheartening to have the game's shoddy construction block you from completing your story, not even mentioning some of the ending slides aren't correct since certain flags didn't get set correctly in your play-through. It definitely has left a bitter taste in my mouth.

Visuals are excellent. One of the best looking WH 40k games I've played. The the attention to detail and the fidelity of the graphics are truly excellent. I have no issues in this department.

The loading screens are a huge PiTA. I have this game installed on an NVMe SSD, and the loading screens were still annoying. Going from the bridge, to system map, to world map takes two loading screens, and then 1 or 2 more loading screens to get down onto a planet. And since you're bound to experience bugs in your play-through, you're going to be saving (and re-loading) often. The loading screens usually don't take more than a minute, but with how many you go through it gets annoying really quickly.

In terms of bugs: Animations jitter or glitch in odd ways extremely frequently, there are frequent slowdowns, characters react as though different events happened (or try to interact with characters not in the party), and pathing in combat is a mess. That last one is especially true once you unlock a character in 2x2 size, as he frequently just runs off wherever if I try to use his charge ability. There are also some serious sound issues in echo-y spaces that made me take off my headphones more than once. It all just seems like it needed another few months or more in the tank to finish polishing. I'm not sure if the game was rushed out for the holidays specifically or not, but it was certainly rushed regardless.

In terms of being unfinished: Compared to the scale it presents, so much of the game feels empty. You can hardly speak to any characters on any of the major worlds (and it's very unclear which have actual dialogue). Your companions very rarely have new dialogue in reaction to any story beats or changes in the world. You go on a whole [spoiler]suicide mission[/spoiler] near the end, and they don't even react to that. Their individual storylines often feel truncated without it being clear if they are over (with a few exceptions), and I just never got the chance to develop a strong bond with most of them.

Overall, it seems like a game that couldn't decide what it wanted to be. There was too much combat in the middle, which made everything feel similar, and that wasn't helped by the fact that so many planets effectively have nothing on them. The colony development didn't feel meaningful in terms of the world changing. The eventual [spoiler]re-uniting the party in Commorragh[/spoiler] mini-game wasn't very detailed in terms of paths through it. The final act felt a bit stapled on despite wrapping up an admirable number of story threads.

•	Dubious gameplay/game mechanic choices

 •	Uneven equipment distribution
       o	Since you can’t buy equipment you’re dependent on what the game serves you which can lead to a lot of

What went right:

•	Great characterization of the 40k universe
•	Crunchy combat mechanics (when they work) 
•	Excellent translation of the table top mechanics from the Rogue Trader pen and paper system



Overall, the game would be good in spite of all the other flaws except for the critical number of bugs which impede progression. If Owlcat doesn’t abandon the game it would be worth picking up in a year or two when (hopefully) the game breaking bugs are patched. But absolutely do not buy the game now, it will break on you, you’ll have to wait on a fix and by the time it’s fixed you won’t remember where you were or what you were doing anyway.

 If you like RPGs but are unfamiliar with 40k, youll enjoy this game 8/10 times. If you enjoyed the pathfinder games then presumably youll enjoy this one as that is this studios pedigree. Its combat heavy(there is only war) but has fun roleplaying moments and your generally looking at 4-6 dialouge options at every branching choice for how to respond or act. The combat is very remenisencnt of tabletop wargames in the sense that you will spend half of it staring at perk choices, past and present, crafting builds for your characters. If that sounds fun this is the game for you.",1704068428,1704068428,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Summary:
Good game, bad/unfinished ending. Not finished, never will be. 
Good, frustratingly not recommended.


To finish the game i had to use toybox as i was soft blocked from passing chapter 4. 
No amount of patches over no amount of years will ever finish the game. The bugs may disappear but this game is obviously not done. No amount of fixing will add more into a game. The end is kind of like a quick jerk like it was written in advance of the game but not connected properly or slapped onto the end, it's a quick and slightly odd leap. 

The game also shit the bed so hard with the bugs that at the end trying to talk to companions would register nothing, and for completed story lines also obviously not flagging as evidenced in the finishing slide show, so after 100+ half of my story lines i may as well not been in, some say it's about the journey and not the conclusion. That's fair but the journey had half my game play in google searching for a bug or another. 
Also i have no seen anyone say this online which is odd, but do sound effects appear to be missing? 


Original review below this paragraph, unchanged. 
Wanted to update my review now that im at 100hrs of game play and in the last act. 
Or should i say trying to do the last act. In a nutshell i can't properly finish the game to leave a review. Without spoilers i am softblocked and cant progress further. The only fix found is start again and home it doesnt happen after 100hrs or get a fan mod to force the game to progress. I have no idea what potentially amazing things i ve missed in this game ive had several dialogues, where a companion says they are approaching me and will me meet in the study and then it cuts to the bridge. There is no one in the study and the companion acts as normal. Going to the final part of the game i really was beginning to wonder if there could be a sequel? Could it be the polished version of this? Alas not being able to finish the game with mods, not knowing what ive missed because of bugs i finally give up on it. I'll get the mods finish the game, drop it and probably not pick it up again. Which is a shame, but the review ultimately is going to remain, as much i hate to do it, a negative. 

First disclaimer. I know i'm being harsh.

I love Owlcat games. When i found them a few years ago by accident i was immediately mesmorised by the game play. It felt like one of the last few developers doing games like this to a level that was just not seen in this genre too much anymore. 

Which is why it sucks to write this. This is a frustratingly not quite good game and annoying enough to not necessarily recommend. 
Lets do a few examples. The combat, turn based can work we all know that just look at BG3. But they have replaced RTWP in favour of this and it feels like a poor mans XCOM. 
You have abilities which are poorly explained at times (some description of effects straight don't have a description when you open up info it is just blank, terrible.), to make it worse now that it is turn based you can have skills where it last 1 round or can stack (and sometimes it doesn;t cost any action points to do) so when it is that characters turn you hit the skill you want sometimes with zero consequence and there can be three or four of these and you press every single combat round and all they do is waits for 2 seconds then points or literally an icon will pop up and nothing else. Did anyone stop to think for a second and just ask whether or not it was fun? It's a pointless time drain  and now that it is not realtime where this usually last a few rounds or with mages with limited uses you just find yourself doing the exact same hit these skill each round for 5-10-15 mins per round of fighting, what a disappointing bore. 

Now this game is a lot more than combat and i can overlook something like this so lets move onto to setting. It is Warhammer, don't know a  lot about it but i know it's cool. Like really cool. So how is it present so meh. You can have these massive, massive areas (art direction is amazing but something about the lack sound and lighting really take away from the the art directions atmosphere which once again makes it a bit meh to look at), with zero interactivity. These not many people you can interactive with meaningfully there's not really a money system the loot at least until act 2 has been Okayish not that exciting to go out of you way and it makes the world feel ultimately empty. There's this massive impressive landscape and, ultimately it feels pointless. How, i've played the other games and WOTR in particular has to be one of the BEST games i've played in this genre. How can the ball of been dropped in this way in this area. 

Lastly probably the most contentious here. I am 2 chapters in and i am not really captivated by the story. There not much conversing. Controversial i know, but there is a lot lot of text. But not much of substance said. i've played however many hrs and the whole story feels on that time feels like WOTR or BG3 story 20 mins worth stretched out over hrs. 

Bugs not even gonna comment the same bugs in everyone of their games which they fix over months but present at the start again. One softlock where stuck in a never ending fight where an enemy is stuck between tiles he can;t have his turn but i can;t attack him. Camera stuck in combat needing reloads, enemies moving getting to a spot then doing nothing for 5 mins. 
(also the camera is kinda sucky i think my view is consistently blocked my a wall that wont dispensary or a pipe hanging from the roof.",1702388435,1704067550,False,5,0,0.547449886798858643,0,True,False,False

I'm playing more than 2 hours, and still new tutorial texts keep coming every ten seconds. I've stopped reading them, it's way too much.
There are too many mechanics, and they didn't make any effort to make them easy to understand. Whereas other games allow you to train abilities like ""10% more dmg"", this one gives you completely cryptic abilities like ""Analyse enemies. Puts a stack of SOMETHING on enemy which reduces his SOMETHING by (X * -Y) / Z"" . And so on. I've taken to just randomly level something up because I don't understand it, and I'm going to ignore mechanics like ""dynamics"" for the same reason.

And why did they reverse the skill-check into negative numbers? Rolling a low means success, rolling a high number means fail. I don't know if that is from the original rules, but it sucks. Totally unnecessary.

The game apart from that is decent, but if you're not a serious math nerd and love reading through hundreds of tutorial texts, better try playing on low difficulty so you can (hopefully) ignore all this nonsense.

Edit : I don't even understand the trade screen. I have no clue how much something costs, how much I can sell, and what the total is. I don't even know how much money I have. Do I even pay with money? Or how? This game is messed up.

- The combat balance is sorta all over the place. This is pretty standard fare for Owlcat, so I'm not terribly surprised, but you still hate to see it.

- The dialogue is really, really wordy. Weird criticism for a CRPG, but stacked up beside Baldur's Gate 3, it just feels dated. They throw paragraphs of text at you for almost every dialogue choice. Only a bare fraction of it has voice acting, too.

- The actual RPG mechanics -- the way you build your character -- is unbelievably bloated. This is my biggest problem. There's just too much noodly garbage that you have to sift through, most of it to gain single percentage-point bonuses. Some other options seem bugged, with a certain combo able to make the navigator companion into an instant-killing death machine. The whole system feels arbitrary and poorly thought out.

Owlcat, as of writing, aren't even acknowledging these issues or offering any support for them, they're happy to ban you from the forums and delete ALL your posts though, just for one indirect reference that maybe it would have been better to get a ""free demo"" of the game online since it's not working.

Would I recommend it in general? even to a 40k fan? Not really.

There are numerous problems and design questioning decisions.

1. The story is all over the place, it feels messy Rumours make you even more confused on some aspects and hold no relevance in the game in the first place. And the whole xeno raids and invasion feels forced.

2. The Combat is, disappointing as not only you have to deal with being outnumbered every single time, but also treatment of some special enemies of not having attacks limits and tailor made buffs feel kind of like cheating? With some encounters being literally outside of this planet's difficulty like why do some encounters are designed to be fought like 20+ levels later if I can easily access it now?

With some of the mechanic being absolutely bad one way or another. Like balancing stats for melee and ranged characters because not only you have to main two stats to be effective in combat in basic form but also have to focus on another 3rd stat because of your Class (I'm not calling them archetypes) like why? It's so stupid that you'll probably end up with a character that in incapable of doing anything beside combat (unless you focus on being a officer/fellowship base char)

2.5 No matter how you build you character, it doesn't matter as it will only depend on the gear you have, it's the sadly reality of this whole game's pase.

3. Bugs, bugs every where. Sometimes even soft locking you from progressing. Animations being jank. Voice Acting being very limited (no wonder since the game has so much text that you might as well go read a book instead).

And my last problem is a personal one but when I was going for heretical playthrough, it's borderline impossible to do so without save/loading certain parts of the game because dialog options are so fucking vague on what is and isn't heretical (Between acting normally and acting cunningly). Like I had no idea how I was suppose to completely my heretical quests because they offer little to no advice.

This game isn't worth the time and money, compare to Owlcat's Studio's last game Pathfinder Wrath, Rogue Trader is depressing to look at.",1704040897,1704043612,False,1,0,0.480803638696670532,0,True,False,False

Devs also missed an opportunity to add some qol to the tooltips. I mean..they made 1km long tooltips, but that wall of text doesn’t explain basic stuff at times.

The game has weird cutscenes. I know what devs tried with them, but either make them as you should make them, or scrap them altogether. As they are now, i’d just scrap more than half of them, seriously. Snappy animations, and a lack of sounds, and there is this delay, like the game doesn’t know what to do, or didn’t realize the actual cutscene is over. It doesn’t take too long, but it gets annoying.

So at times trying to progress through the story is a pain. The game is supposed to make it easy for you but it isn’t, and i am talking about simple things here, not a lot of extra work for the developers. Just simple quality of life things.
Rogue Trader gets a 8/10. It was 8.4, but I rounded down because of the above.

In another few months with patches it could be worth $25 on sale if you want a moderate CRPG to spend some time on. When I look back on this game in 2 years and think of it, I will remember poorly balanced tedious combat, not one notable NPCs I really liked, and an underwhelming story that railroaded me into an act 3 that I hated. Now if you want some more details read below.

Graphic wise it's on par with Owlcats other titles and looks okay. They are trying cutscenes now which is nice. They need work but they are trying. Also with Baldur’s Gate 3 this year setting the gold standard I maybe am expecting too much in this department.

The combat is complex and takes a while to understand how to stack what buffs/debuffs with what to make things work. The issue is after you have it figured out it sucks. You end up having to do 10 things before making one attack that is worth it. In the end combat drags out and becomes tedious rather than fun. Then there is the AI. I would feel safer giving Ian from Fallout 1 a SMG than letting any character in this game that is AI controlled have a burst weapon. In larger encounters the enemy with burst weapons almost always killed more of their front line melee members than I did. God forbid it's one of the few encounters where you have friendly NPC helping you with combat and they have burst weapons. By act 4 combat starts to be all over the place, and the hard fights come down to rocket tag. If you do well on initiative, the fight will be a joke. If the 4 enemy snipers go first and all of a sudden you're down to 3 of 6 party members, and there is no way to win the fight. Oh and can I say how much I enjoy it when an attack buff says your next attack can’t be dodged only to have said target dodge the attack. So there are still a pile of bugs here to be worked out.

The ship combat is not bad but just Okay.

I love the lore of 40k. It does a good job of sticking to the overall lore and making me feel that I am in 40k. There are minor things that bug me but overall the lore is solid. There are some story points that very much make me go oh no that would never happen they would have just been killed right there and then for heresy. 
Honestly the thing that bothers me most lore wise is bolter rounds going through and striking targets a few squares behind the target. Bolter rounds are rocket propelled armor piercing grenades. They hit the target and go into the target go boom and make the target a fine pink mist. There is nothing left to continue on to hit another target.

The companions are a mixed bag for me story wise. I don’t want to get into spoilers. I will say the space wolf does not end up feeling like an unstoppable demi god of war in combat. It might be needed for game balance but really breaks the 40k immersion for me. The other issue is that you have all of 40k to work with and while I agree most of them should be human because well imperium is going to imperium. You could have done better than just 2 flavors of space elf for non human. I feel giving us an ogryn would have been better than the space wolf and shame on Owlcat for not giving us some freebooter ork we could recruit. 

I did not like the overall story at all. Act 1 and 2 are fine. I hate how they railroad you into Act 3. I honestly hate everything about act 3. Lore wise you would never get out. Act 4 has a chance to make some good villains and just does not build on them enough. It felt like they had more planned but rushed to get the game out. Act 5 see notes on act 4. If they had just cut out act 3 all together and built more on act 4 and 5 they would have had a better story.

The real issue though as of right now is bugs, and balance issues. The game feels like it could have used another 2-6 months of polish. The first two acts are good, you can tell they got lots of feedback on those and had time to work on them. Act 3 starts to have issues near the end. Nothing game breaking yet. Act 4 had to restart twice due to bugs. It is just more of the same for Act 5 save lots get ready to reload due to bugs.",1704033009,1704033009,False,1,0,0.493092149496078491,0,True,False,False

The recommendation comes with the following notes:
1. This game is based on a system that does not really allow for ""simple"" play and you will have to learn a lot of mechanics and how they interact with each other quickly.

2. At time of writing the game is bugged. Mostly this is related to the quests and dialogues. 

3. Some bugs only appear if you skip cutscenes...

4. As with previous games from the same devs companions are locked into their base classes.

5. Leveling is a hassle as you can't search or filter really. Luckily respecing can be done for free on lower dificulties

After several tries  i managed the demon engine in the factory, thats still fine if you have 2 try several times at higher difficulty, but....
i didnt manage it to survive 1 round in the boss fight vs uralon on my difficulty (10 tries) and even got wiped at normal difficulty easy....
tbh. that destroyed the fun for me and i have not even a desire now to play the game. why should i try again, if i got wiped instant at normal difficutly.

as a lot other people said here: not to mention the bugs in act 4...doesnt matter if they are quests, npc etc etc etc.

the game started good, but now im quite dissapointed...

i played on the middle difficulty so i assume the hardest is for a masochist.
The second half of act 4 and entirety of act 5 was falling apart at the seams, i had to install the toy box mod to get several quests i had completed to accept i had done so or for story triggers to fire. I had to turn off my audio for most of the final act as it got glitched with an under water reverb/muffled effect from a quest and reloading earlier did not fix it, nor could i find the trigger to turn it off.

I looks like developers tried to bring as more features as they could but they had no resources and experience to do it in a good way. 
IMHO if you are limited in resources you should do less but better. 

Some examples:
I reached act 4, my characters are >= 40 level and becomes a torture to level up all of them because UI for some reasons show all skills including the ones i already have. And there is no way to hide them. At some point you can sort your skills, at another point - you can't. Total inconsistency. 

Inventory management is another hell. You can't figure out which slot item will use until you'll move mouse cursor over it. For guns and armor all good more or less because they are on separate tab. But for items... 

Loading screens between small locations... I thought starfield will kill me with it but no. It was Rogue Trader. 
Special thanks to the person who designed planet with living forest where you have lots of the small locations and you need to go through all of them. Ough T.T

And why in a hell i can't switch to system map from any point of my ship by just pressing the button? 
Why i must run to the Map gadget in the center of the bridge. It's not a simulation game. It consumes lots of time.

Anyway i enjoyed the game at some points but starting with act 4 it becomes more obvious that game is not polished and mostly broken. And companions personal quests look like... i dunno. They are short and weird.

From the design and lore side it should be a galactic scope fights and intrigues. But in the end it looks like a clash in a single village somewhere in the forest. IMHO.",1704008710,1704008710,False,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

However, patches are unlikely to address several issues which make this game a strictly ""buy on sale"" title, we're talking $25-$30.

1. Balance is non-existent. Some builds are broken, some intended build-paths are worthless. Some characters possess unique abilities which are so incredibly strong as to make them must-picks in any party composition.

2. No true flexibility when dealing with narrative situations, it's just three alignments to pick from, genuinely less nuanced than Owlcat's previous games or what Warhammer is capable of in the storytelling department.

3.  Several iconic Warhammer character archetypes are limited to companion characters, and this cannot be addressed by patches because finding and recruiting those characters is a major early plot McGuffin. Writing a story that hard-limits players from specific source material careers in 2023 isn't great.

4. 80% of the writing is universe lore exposition for newcomers, which I'm usually all for if it means bringing new folks into Warhammer, but it means that there's no significant substance to most of the game if you're already familiar with the lore in general.

- Cassia is way to broken, the best tank with 200% dodge and highest amount of wounds in the team, passive self heal which doesn't really matter because fights rarely go to the second round since her damage output is massive. Even the final boss fight ended in round 1. And with some spare action points she can make a monsters out of other team members with her buffs.
- As in multiple other comments, starting from act 3 the bugs hit hard.
- Acts 4 and 5 need some serious polishing. Especially the side quest, and maybe some better way to track rumours?
- Colony development and fraction reputation are not intuitive, in act 4 I found out that I'm blocked from maxing out a colony because I have not met reputation requirements and at this point it was impossible to improve it to required level.
Also maxing out reputation is nearly impossible, besides the Navy.
- Compared to Pathfinder WOTR, encounters are way to easy, but it could be because of Cassia which hard carried me through most of the game.
- Navy battles were fun at the start but became nuisance after some time.
- Story was ok, lore wise lets just say that it went downhill as the story progressed especially in act V.

Having sad all of that, I was really engaged in the game and for sure will play it again, although will wait for the fixes and balancing out the characters.",1703990378,1703990378,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For a quick summary, while this game is mechanically fun and narratively interesting, I cannot recommend buying it in its current state.

First, the good stuff: the standard ground combat is tactical and satisfying, builds feel fairly diverse and powerful while still leaving room for your mistakes to be punished. Space combat is very hit or miss, especially early on when your ship has no/few upgrades, but it's tolerable enough. Colony management feels like a bit of a chore and doesn't tie into the main mechanical systems that well but it's serviceable, and never feels like it gets in the way of completing the primary goals in the game.

The companions are mostly all interesting characters, the VAs did a great job, their questlines (when they actually work), while not flawless feel compelling to explore and complete. The setting and overall tone of storytelling are appropriately dark, the ""alignment"" system has some interesting impacts on how the story develops and your relationships with the other characters. At times it feels like being a stereotypical ""good guy"" has no real drawbacks, which I don't think is the right choice for this setting.

As many other reviewers have mentioned this all works fine and feels fun to play... right up until the start of chapter 3. At that point, the story becomes borderline incomprehensible, and the bugs start getting extreme. Quests stop triggering, companions become uninteractible and potentially die permanently despite saving them, for me the game started crashing every time burn damage was applied (and I was playing a pyromancer on my first playthrough).

The content is also fairly sparse in chapters 4 and 5. Or at least, it seems that way. I can't tell if it actually is or if sidequests are simply not triggering correctly. And that's part of the problem, it's hard to judge the latter half of the game on that front because it's never clear if it's even functioning correctly. Buy this game in ~6 months when things are at least functional, getting invested in a playthrough at this point is just not worth the trouble.

There is something at the very least decent here, but the experience was totally ruined by the need to shift through the quest triggers, endlessly reload, miss the cutscenes and dialogues, all that good stuff.

The game's great, I just can't recommend it to anyone in its current state.
From the act 3 onward it is filled with broken quest triggers, non-functioning cutscenes an all those good stuff.

Having completed the game now, I have more thoughts.

In short,  the writing for the endings of the game is really poor. [spoiler]The game basically acknowledged that I didn't do anything too incompetent or heretical, so randomly the Imperium decides me being competent and not treasonous with a strong working relationship with a new Lord Inquisitor obviously means I am intending on seceding from the Imperium. . .If they were desperate to invent bad ends for the player, just have the Soritas murder me for cooperating with the Alderi.[/spoiler]

There is still plenty of bugs, and basically the entire game starting with the [spoiler] Commorough kidnapping [/spoiler] is substantially worse than the first half. Some of the companion quest lines are pretty nice, with me deciding to kill my own companions 3 seperate times in the game. However some of the quest lines (Henrix heavily) feel pretty boring and a couple of the companion deaths feel like the game didn't give you options you really should have to convince the companion and avoid merc'ing them[spoiler] RIP navigator lady[/spoiler].

Overall the game is probably a 6-7/10. Good game, but honestly one you can wait a sale for.",1702433585,1703976180,False,5,0,0.522859811782836914,0,True,False,False

That said, Owlcat have a consistent problem, and that problem is absurd late game difficulty spikes.  I had thought they fixed this after Wrath of the Righteous, which had a pretty good balance, but I was wrong.

The game is generally pretty easy right up until the end of Act 4.  The final two bosses of that Act (which come one right after the other with no opportunity to save or change loadouts), require absolute mastery of the game systems and character builds with no mistakes.  I'm pretty good at these kinds of games, but I went from breezing through every fight to dying in seconds, and then having to reload a save prior to a brutally difficult boss gauntlet.  And I'm playing on Normal.

The writing on the game is great, the combat is fun, the characters are good.

Chapter 1: 7/10 cool introduction, a little handhold-y but introduces the mechanics and the world of WH40K pretty well

Chapter 2: 9/10 introduces my favorite mechanics of the game, story becomes more dire and gives the scale of the problems in a very scary way.

Chapter 3: 6.5 probably the low point because narratively it is the lowest your characters go and shows that you can rise from anything thrown at you, for development it gives the characters it should be commended. It was not only the 2nd shortest but the most railroad-y and choice restrictive.

Chapter 4: 8.5/10 the fights were the most cinematic, knowing about how the factions of WH40K interact make this the most deserving of Poggers and soyjack faces, it returns the mechanics of chapter 2 that I love and improve on them but by this point they are a little worn and done. It would be a point higher if every fight didn't make my computer stutter and drag the fights on for 3X as long due to poor performances.

Chapter 5: 7/10 Makes you really Pog and Soyjack if you know about the lore, the storytelling and fights are both great but by the time I reached them I was so overpowered that I destroyed every fight (Including the final fight) in less than one whole round (Sister Argenta MVP). The decisions you've made through the game come to satisfying conclusions and all the whodunit stuff really pays off in a satisfying way.

The things about this game that that give me the good feels:

-Great combat. if you are a veteren of ""wrath of the righteous"" you will defiantly have a hey day with this one. The charterer creation and leveling system make it a min-maxing paradise

-Very lore accurate. The way they present all the different factions of the Impirium, from the low borne pesents all the way to the nobles as well as all the different xenos filth makes me very certain this was produced by fans of the franchise

The things that made me have the bad feels

-Story was awesome and very immersive, up until chapter 3. it just kinda loses it momentum and stops feeling like im a privateer blessed by the Emperor him self

-The epilogue was very inconsistent with my play through, having many contradictions

-can't romance the muscle mommy battle sister

-The space battles kinda drag on, and feel very basic. its a really cool concept, but definitely needs some fine tuning

Like to preface that I've been into the hobby and the lore of Warhammer for over a decade at this point. Haven't played much of Owlcat's other titles besides WotR briefly and that game is very tight in mechanics and writing. 

Positives first; I'm blown away by the attention to detail with the lore as well as the environments. If you are a Warhammer 40k fan you're going to thoroughly enjoy this one. The way the game presents itself with it's writing and setting is on the spot. I'd like to point out that it is very friendly to people who have no idea what the hell a God Emperor of Mankind even is. You get to ask questions during the game and have lore explained to you by characters that are *in* the setting, which is a big plus if you ask me. I already know enough lore to fact check and found nothing wanting. Great game to get into the Warhammer 40k setting with. 

The game play can be very tactical at times. Certain enemies require your attention to their monster sheet because of their abilities. Sometimes it can be a slog to get through fights because of the size of mobs or the scenario, however getting your character and party abilities to a point where it's just as unfair for the computer as it is for you is satisfying to say the least! Late game Soldier/Master Tactician is brutal fun. Tooling your party to match your play style is a must and very enjoyable to see in action.    

Party characters are likable because how they are written into the story. Their companion quests make sense and don't linger too long. Most are tied to the main story line and help move the plot forward which is greatly appreciated. Whenever the game decides to include voiced interactions it is always a treat. The voice acting and direction are very good and I'm almost wishing there was more in the game. I know how time consuming and expensive that is to do but I wouldn't mind a few extra sermons form Sister Argenta.  

Now the negatives; The game can be buggy at times. I've encountered a good number of visual and character model bugs. A few favorites have been the T-Posing servitors throughout the game or the Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Citizens in a cut-scene on your home-world. Though funny they aren't game breaking in the slightest and of those bugs I have none to report. Had to reload a save once because of a camera issue but that was it in the 100hrs I have logged. There is a bug report option and seems to be very thorough, use it!

Although the writing is solid most of the times I have issues with some of the character decisions and motivations in Chapter 3. It did not eject me from the story but made me question the writers intentions with certain characters and how they expected the player to react. Very strange choice but nothing a few plasma shots didn't deal with easily. I won't go further into details for spoilers sake, however there are other aspects of the writing that did not line up with other earlier statements or encounters - every one being minor slip ups it seems. Forgivable but I noticed whenever it happened. ""Wait, didn't you just say X? Why are you saying Y now?"" sort of stuff. 

When the game ends there is a still slideshow of what happens in the Expanse due to your actions. Everything seemed to be out of order. NPC characters died but in a later slide it explains what they were doing in other places. Seemed jumbled and I'm unsure why. The jumble soured the ending for me but did not ruin it. A good take away from some of these endings is that the Warhammer 40k setting is brutal and uncompromising. I take a point off for the fumbled presentation but I was satisfied nonetheless. 

TL;DR 

If you enjoy the Warhammer 40k setting as well as Owlcat's other titles (Party based RPG's) and have approx. 100 hours to spend, buy this game. It is buggy at times and has its flaws like everything else but well worth the cash and time value.

I finished it on the 21st on 'Daring' with bugs, so this is mostly my opinion based on that experience. This is a spoiler free review. 

There were several issues on my play through but since then Owlcat have worked diligently to remove the majority of the visual glitches, cut scene errors, missing quests etc that many others are saying, though if their previous titles are anything to go on everything wont be fully smoothed out until 3-6 months after launch. 

Not as bad as Pathfinder 2 and although I had some issues I still managed to complete a path before the patches, and now the majority of bugs I encountered have been fixed.  

-Story (no spoilers). 

The player is thrust into the life of the human aristocracy in the Koronus sector in Warhammer 40k taking over what is essentially the East India Trading Company of the Imperium of Man for this part of the galaxy. 

You are an explorer, trader, diplomat but also potentially a conqueror and law-bringer unto yourself so far away and isolated from the normal scrutiny of the imperum that could reign you in if you go too far, with enormous consequences for the entire sector. 

The sense of scale, gradually expands until you really feel like you're the head of your vast empire, walking a fine line between service to a higher calling and personal indulgence... either greed or showing mercy toward those who the Dogmatic would call heretic, or even becoming one yourself. 

Even though Rogue Trader is a more compact game than WotR, the sense of scale and feeling of playing a character IN the world of Warhammer 40k is unsurpassed and I loved every second of it. 

-Audio
What little voice work there is really is stand out amazing. I feel spoiled by BG3's full voice acting but what there is here is great, and the music is incredible especially the atmospheric pieces by Pawel Perepelica. 

Actually CRIMINAL that they didn't release the OST with the Deluxe editon and despite giving the whole thing a listen a few times I cant physically buy it. (come on Owlcat). 

-Mechanics 

The combat system on 'Daring' difficultly started off strong but if you are a veteran CRPG player you will find that relatively early on it is possible to absolutely outclass your enemies with action economy.

Especially if you've come to this game from WotR on Core you will have a comfortable time with the character progression with internal synergies being apparent, but also that there are so many of them. 

There are lots of ways to make effective characters and its more about player empowerment than brutal difficulty especially in the later half. 

And I must stress this there are a LOT of ways to build your characters viably, even at this early stage it is apparent and this is wonderful, with respec being available on your ship. 

I am not familiar with the mechanics it uses outside of this game (I have only played WH fantasy tabletop many years ago) so as someone new to this system, I can say I really enjoyed it, despite only needing say 1/2 to 2/3 optimisation to comfortably win. 

Already we had some balance changes, so perhaps this is subject to change. 

-UI/other

Finally I hate the UI decisions and think the 'songsheet' of Pathfinders WotR was the ideal way to display complex information i think the Wheels feel clunky a lot of the time, UI and menus are kinda janky, the whole presentation is functional but feels full of friction including the loading screens 'click to proceed' annoyance. Maybe it'll improve in time but its not a deal breaker for me. 

-Conclusion
If you're interested in Warhammer, CRPG's, and want some of the most and engaging and brilliant grim-dark writing in videogames (and don't mind reading a lot of text) with a deep power fantasy character progression then this is the game.

As it stands though, there's simply more bad than good, even though it won't deter me from finishing the game, I feel like buyers should be informed the state in which this game launched.

The good:

- Amazing storywriting. You really get immersed and everything is explained thoroughly through writing. The only qualms I have here are needless use of ye olde English, when there's better words available that don't have vastly different meanings depending on the dictionary opened.

- Most of the graphical work is great. Other than the 3d character models, everything is well polished. 

The bad:

- Blindly copying many facets of the rogue trader tabletop ruleset. I'm sorry but certain characters get extremely limited equipment wise because of this, amongst other problems. It makes little sense from a development standpoint, as it costs more time to implement unique equipment for these characters, whilst also detracting from player experience. Why?

- Bugs which get worse from act III onwards. I assume early access helped iron out the first two chapters... but thereafter the game is just a mess. Good luck understanding what's going on in combat anymore, what's intended and what isn't. Many equipment items, skills, abilities... Don't work as they should according to their most basic interactions.

- Horrible pacing and difficulty spikes from act III onwards. I'm having to cheese encounters even on normal difficulty because you don't even get to survive the first turn otherwise. Many characters feel underpowered, others feel completely broken, able to level encounters before the enemy gets a turn.",1703905401,1703905401,False,4,0,0.511530697345733643,0,True,False,False

An off-key piano tune where the sour notes hit louder every time they're struck, where the flaws gradually pile up until they can't be ignored any longer and the motivation to keep playing dries up like a wad of spit under the sun. I'm not even talking about the glitches, of which the game has many, this game is flawed on an almost fundamental level.

I'll start with what I [i]did[/i] enjoy about the game. The developers truly did do their homework with the setting, and it's very clear that many of the devs were almost certainly huge lore buffs of 40k. You really do feel at first like you're a dynastic warlord out on the far fringes of wild space, cleaving your own path with a small retinue of companions that are all interesting in their own way. There's a certain intrigue into every area you can explore, finding out whatever you can about this dark corner of the galaxy you inhabit.

And the game squanders it. It squanders it by drowning in entirely avoidable flaws.

[h2]The Grim Darkness of Bad Design[/h2]

To address the elephant in the room, this game [i]does[/i] have glitches, and has them by the boatload. That is only a minor part of the reason for this negative review, because Rogue Trader's problems are so legion that the glitches become an afterthought. So, where do I start?

I suppose I should begin with the combat. It's a pretty standard fare; movement points and action points, along with special actions any character could take. There's flanking and critical hits, and honestly if you've ever played any CRPG before or really just any tactical game, you know what you're in for. There's even a nice chunkiness to it, with enemies turning into bloody chunks when hit by bolters or sizzling into burning corpses when shot by lasers. 

There is no consistency. And you never really feel like you're getting stronger. This has been a disturbing trend in CRPGs as of late, where the game basically expects you to run into a fight you weren't anticipating, die, then reload with an actual plan. In one of the loading screens it even [i]outright says[/i] this by saying the player should save often, in a tacit admission they player will just often die out of nowhere with zero warning. This shows a [i]dire[/i] lack of actual agency that the player truly has.

I know this is a hard square to peg, giving the player the freedom to explore the galaxy but also giving them a good sense of progression, but the game is outright [i]irresponsible[/i] for some of the fights it lets you stumble into. This is a problem where almost every grunt has double the health of any of your guys. This doesn't really make them any harder to deal with, but it [i]does[/i] make you feel like you're spinning your wheels. There's also the problem that despite how varied the combat system is, the game kinda pushes the character in one direction regardless. It's the same direction nearly every CRPG meta revolves around, which is to buff up one guy to a ridiculous degree and let him go to town on the enemies while the ranged guys sit in the back and waste everything else. That's it. That's every encounter. Near as I can tell fights are quite literally [i]built[/i] around the assumption you will be running this build or something close to it, along with the officer abilities that give people extra turns. 

For consistency, let me give an example here: there's a system you can visit shortly after being let off the leash and allowed to explore space proper. You wander in, and immediately smash into enemies that have double to triple health of the last enemies you fought, get extra armor every round by extra enemies, and many of them are capable of OHKOs with sniper rifles. No, you do not in fact place an area that feels like the slog through the final boss's lair in the starting zone. This applies to the space combat, as well. There's a space combat system! Hooray! Except it suffers from the exact same problems and worse.

I [i]could[/i] stop the review here, but Rogue Trader's problems go deeper than that. Like, for a role-playing game, your skills matter [i]shockingly[/i] little. I don't even mean combat, I mean things like skill checks. There's standard stuff like persuasion and tech and whatever, but more than any RPG I think I've ever played they seem to matter so utterly little. They never seem to act as alternate outcomes to quests or shortcuts, and with only a few exceptions ([b]extremely[/b] bad ones that I will get to later) they seem to have zero outcome on anything except different lines of dialogue. The only thing it actually seems to affect is how much loot you get, and everything else is like you accurately deducing useless information from some thingamajig on the floor. This is a problem for a player like me, who likes to roll slick smooth-talking types. Nothing I actually say seems to matter, or change any outcomes, or do [i]anything[/i] for me. 

[h2]I'm Rich? News to Me.[/h2]

Canonically, Rogue Traders are absurdly wealthy, and when you become the Rogue Trader, the game even describes you as such, but I don't think I've ever played any video game [i]ever[/i] where the player is so rich yet you feel so poor. So, in the game, you don't buy things directly. You have a thing called ""Profit Margin"", which is supposed to be an abstract representation of your wealth. The ""loot"" you find you simply ""give"" to other factions to build your reputation, and when it's high enough, you can just simply take thing they offer if your profit margin equals or is over whatever the item is. The in-game justification it gives is because you're so absurdly rich that simply buying things is below you.

I've tried to be diplomatic so far in this review, but I'm going to be very frank: that's dumb. That's incredibly dumb. You're telling me, a Rogue Trader with enough money to buy out God and a few extra pantheons, can't just buy some medkits and grenades that he needs to, you know, not die horribly?

And sure, you can upgrade planets, but the upgrades barely feel meaningful. You can't bling on your ship or get new threads or [i]anything[/i] other than what the devs have decided you're allowed to have. The entire game is built around getting rich and you can't even flaunt it? You had one job!

[h2]Down Come the Spinning Plates[/h2]

Without getting into too much detail, about halfway through the game you're captured and your gear is confiscated. Whatever devs were in charge of, or proposed, this part of the game, without hyperbole, should have lost their jobs. Enemies are still strong as before, you [i]literally can't avoid[/i] the fights you have to fight in the crappy gear you're allowed to have. You can [i]permanently lose[/i] companions if you fail the one skill check they throw at you, and the whole time your character is plagued by a thingie that regularly plays out an unskippable animation that does nothing but drag the pace of the game to a utter crawl. These sections are already the worst part of any other CRPG, but I think this one takes the cake in terms of sheer boredom. If you want to make the point that this is ""appropriate"" to the lore of where it happens, I literally don't care, there's a thousand different better ways they could've done it and done it in ways that were actually interesting. 

The last straw: towards the end of this part, there's one of those ""chronicle"" book sections that's filled with high-level skill checks. If you fail them, you just automatically die. That's it. Nothing you can do about it. Completely gatekept by dice, in the worst part of the game.

Hahaha. [b]No.[/b]

[h2]Summary[/h2]

Rogue Trader cheats you of the experience of actually being a Rogue Trader. It cheats you of your time, and most importantly in this review, it will cheat you of your money.

If that's understandably an issue for you, wait a few months before you buy. Again, it's Owlcat, so there's got to be a clunky resource management sim tied to the game as a mandatory mechanic. Might not be everyone's cup of tea. Once more, Owlcat, so it's not going to have the sparkle and polish like a BG3. Finally and yet again, Owlcat, so the leveling and character builds are crunchier than a week old baguette.

That aside, best 40K game of all time. Builds are interesting and more intuitive than the Pathfinder entries (although not as diverse). Combat is fun albeit easy to break with the Officer class. Game isn't pretending to be anything it's not. It's a classic style CRPG in a lovingly crafted game adaption of 40K that (finally) doesn't revolve around space marines. To a fossil in his 30s like myself, game feels as cozy as a surprise snow day playing PC games on the family computer.

If you're on the fence, let it cook for a bit longer. If you like 40K, turn based combat, powergaming, old school CRPGs, and/or enjoyed the Pathfinder games, personally I'd just pick it up now and have fun figuring out how to get 300+ crits at the start of Act 2.",1703901531,1703901531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is thus; You play as a custom character (or choose one of the three presets to just get into it), regardless of your name you're actually in the bloodline of a specific noble dynasty. How far removed is irrelevant in the setting as you meet two characters in the prologue whose own lineage is varied. In a setting with a vast population beyond our imagining, imagine you're just standing among a couple of insanely distant cousins. As this is Warhammer, stuff goes badly and you're promoted to a very highly ranked person in the Imperium. Standard fare if you've played the likes of Mass Effect. The game essentially just hands you a title to throw around the game at your leisure and there's only a couple of institutions that outrank you at all.

Character creation is robust, perhaps not so much as Baldur's Gate 3's is but I still found myself with several character ideas. Also, clicking the portraits will automatically morph your sprite into something that resembles the portrait which is a very nice touch. Doesn't work with custom portraits but I can still get to an approximation. There's several tabs to chew through that all give and take against various stats you'll know nothing about at first but usually a mouseover or a right click brings up various tooltips (at any point during the game) that will explain what things like ""Fellowship"" and ""carouse"" means. There's some mix-matching to play around with as you have six origins to choose from but the game is mostly based around the four base ""classes"", each choice later evolves into three subclasses after reaching level 16. 

So far playing a dozen or so hours into it and gathering several party members, I find the classes to be limiting. Warriors always swing the sword, soldiers always shoot, operatives always plop debuffs. That said, not every skill takes up your entire action pool so I've found even my technical party members still able to bring the hurt with their sidearms. Eventually you get a Mechanicus who can wield two two-handed weapons without swapping and despite him basically being your designated lockpicker, I've used him to bring absolute ruin to my enemies. Again, despite his more debuff based class choices.

You can follow between three paths; Someone who's helpful and idealistic, incredibly fanatical to the Imperium, or go against the grain and slowly become a full blown heretic. Certain equipment is limited to these alignments. My first main character I'm playing as fairly dogmatic, but when I had the chance to quell a small union outcry among my workers on my ship, I chose to hear them out and make concessions. Despite being dogmatic, it is your choice to absolutely start gunning them down and rule through fear. That's just how this world is sometimes. I'm quite certain that choice will come bite my buttocks later down the line.

After that it's just following story beats with encounter after encounter. Your stats are often relevant even in dialog so it's always fun to see how different characters may react to things. 

Difficulty seems variable and highly customizeable. So far I've been to two major missions and two locations but nobody seems to ever get completely inflated with hitpoints. Weak enemies always have 7 or 12 hitpoints, all the way from level one to the higher level I am now. Maybe it's act-based and act two might have beefier enemies. Don't know yet. But it seems all my people are only getting a couple hitpoints per level up so you don't exactly barrel into being a complete powerhouse, you simple get more tools and passive perks at your disposal. And there's a ton, most of which I forget about between sessions. I think my Sister of Battle teammate has some kind of perk that gives extra damage when she's adjacent to an ally but in the heat of battle I completely forget that exists and I'm just trying to position my shooters to they are in position to actually hit something. So mostly I try to go for 'unconditional' perks. Can't go wrong with +2 movement.

My current point of contention is the menus. They're not all terribly bad but I have trouble trying to decipher my goals. Within missions there's no map marker directing you where to go, so sometimes I miss a piece of the map that was actually a doorway that leads to a new wing of the ship. Sometimes the objective just states ""Find out what's going on"" or ""reach the reactor"" with no direction. I'm just flying by the seat of my pants and just casing the perimeter and so far it's working out well enough. I haven't spent too much time scratching my head... yet.

There's a beefy game here, expect to dump a lot of hours. My first five hours were basically doing the prologue three times to really get all the tutorials to sink in as well as explore different starter archetypes. There's a lot I didn't even talk about (like how you have to manage your mage-type's madness levels, or the injury mechanic, all kinds of things) and that'd just end up exceeding my text limits. There's a lot of game here. I haven't gotten to any game-breaking bugs that litter a lot of reviews but that seems to be a late-game problem and to my knowledge they've been pretty vigilant with hotfixes.

-Very fun combat. Much better than BG3.
-Incredible attention to the IP, lore, and world design.
-Top shelf dialogue and writing.
-Not overwhelming leveling systems and classes.

The still bad:
-Not fully voiced. Would it kill them to just throw in AI generated voices?
-Only a few static art cards for characters. Again, AI can generate images galore. Stop being lazy.
-Bugs and glitches.
-Not the prettiest game around.
-Limited character creator for visuals.

Dialogue, descriptions, art, and sound are all excellent and all utterly Warhammer. There is a diverse cast to interact with and always something new to discover. 

On the downside, the game is quite buggy at release. I managed to miss the big game-breaking bugs and the devs have been releasing a constant stream of patches, so I'm sure this will get better over time. But there were quests I couldn't finish, character moments I couldn't see, and sections I had to replay due to bugs. 

More fundamentally, I don't know that the combat system here works. And, if it does, it's not much fun. The problem is buffs. You get a number of action points each turn, and most of those are spent applying buffs to maximize the effect of your one or two attacks. Most buffs either last only a turn or stack, so you generally need to apply the same ones each turn. And each application is accompanied by an animation and maybe a voice line. This isn't that interesting and you tend to do the same thing every turn so it gets old quick. Then, once you win a few fights and level up your faced with giant list of dozens of talents to select from, most of which modify those buffs in some subtle way. You'll likely reach around level 50 by the end of the game and have around a dozen party members who each need to be leveled manually, so expect to spend a lot of time reading tooltips to determine which 2% increase to some effect you really need right now. If you dropped the animations and cut a third of the nonsense from the combat system this game would be half as long and likely better for it.

Combat also just doesn't feel particularly balanced, at least on normal difficulty. Your characters are fragile and outnumbered relative to your opponents. To counter this, your characters tend to have quite good defenses (parry and dodge). Perhaps too good? With solid tactics, a lot of combats feel trivial as the enemy struggles to even do damage. The last boss, as an example, managed to push through only 1-2 pips of damage on my characters in the whole fight. Splash damage from my own area attacks was the bigger threat. But then you hit a fight where the math is against you and suddenly half your party is down without warning. I haven't tried other difficulties. Maybe things are better higher up, or maybe the spikes just get worse.

Overall, if you're looking for a good Warhammer 40000 game, buy this. It's worth your time. If you're looking for a good tactical RPG, maybe try something else or wait for a year of balance patches.",1703886276,1703886276,True,1,0,0.532967031002044678,0,True,False,False

A satisfying 40k CRPG experience with two gripes that are likely to be ironed out. 

The first: Act 1-3 are relatively smooth and clean of major bugs, but they come in with force in act 4 and beyond. None stopped me from finishing the game (with a couple instances of needing to reload), but some of the combat bugs were as hilarious as they were frustrating. My favorite was when one of my retinue was supposed to charge an enemy, and instead pathed all the way back to the beginning of the level, effectively removing them from the fight.

The second is late game combat. I don't know if this is a result of the tabletop game system or design choices by the team, but combat is so easy to accidentally break that the late game encounters stop being challenging if you don't impose some local 'house' rules to keep things from being ridiculous. I think some of this is from bugs as well that allow players infinite turns/shots, etc., but the entire system could do with some serious balancing. That said, the combat before it breaks is a lot of fun and, just like you might do with a tabletop game, if you give yourself some reasonable limits (i.e. I won't use free turn spam) then it goes back to being engaging and challenging. 

So if running into some bumpy gameplay in the late game is a deal breaker for you, let this one cook a bit more. But other than that, if you are a 40k fan or just game to delve into a deep  Grimdark Science Fantasy RP experience, pick this game up. 

I will leave my original review below because that encounter is still one of my favorite memories of my playthrough!

****

I usually review games after completing them, but here is how my last big fight played out: 

My glorious presence was announced by a diligent underling, because I do not have time to greet each rabble gathering myself. My psyker then exploded on turn 1, summoning a terrible daemon with about 100 more health than the strongest enemy already on the table. The daemon then ate the character nearest my psyker (the one who introduced me, unfortunately enough).

Deciding to lean into a failed attempt, I figured I would charge into the mass of remaining cultists because why not. The cultist untrained panic fire killed more enemies than it hurt my party, and trimmed a nice chunk of health off our new visitor, that I was able to put down with some focused effort in the next round. 

10/10, would commit heresy under an inquisitor's nose again.",1702330255,1703877634,True,2,0,0.503950655460357666,0,True,False,False

The areas to explore looked really good. Loved the detail of them.

Wait 6 months to a year. I'll change my review when Owlcat releases a game in 1.0 status that's actually done.  I hate buying a game that's ""complete"" where I feel like a beta tester.

-Needs more Space Marine. (Jokes aside, the Space Marine is awesome)
-Has more loading screens than Starfield.
-MANY quests were bugged. 
-Some ending slides had VERY conflicting stories which made no sense.
-Ending slides need to be proof read.
-Some of the models (armor on certain models) looked very muddy.
-Third act was just F'ing terrible.

-Some of the places you are exploring with your team have a lot of overhanging assets, and it gets in the way being able to see what you are doing because the game doesn't slice it correctly when rotating the map.

-The journal where the 'Rumors' are needs a check, or an X, or something saying if they are completed/true or not.

-Have a % of explored, or an indicator saying you've landed in different areas where you zone in. It'll keep people from constantly going ""Have I been here? It says the planet is explored, but not the landing site."" I went to the same places multiple times b/c I couldn't remember if I've been there before.  There's a  lot of places to explore. (Which is a good thing!)

-Remove the AOE on the world map when a certain Rumor has been fulfilled. It's just annoying.

I'm sure there's more stuff, but I've spent a lot of time in the game, and can't remember all of them. There's a lot of good, and bad here.  I love the Owlcat games, I'm just tired of getting an unfinished product that is labeled as finished. 

I hate relying on modders to 'fix the game'. It shouldn't be up to them to make sure I can play through the game w/o having to start over.  

Big shout out to them though.

The choices you make to increase your alignment however need a little more rewards. For example, in one of your travels you find a station that is being salvaged by people and they are a nice bunch. Once you leave it, you have the option to destroy it and the people there and it only gives you like +3 Heretical points. you also have an option to kill a navigator from a  Navis nobilite  and you can kill him for not aggreeing with your demands. nets you a meagre +5 heretical. Another thing is some of the conviction choices are hidden while some choices feels like it should give you points but they don't.

Also the amount of bugs in Act 4 and 5 can be frustrating. You have to heed one of the advice the game says during a load screen. ""When in doubt - save"".

Boss fights are something else. It goes from ""what, is this the final boss in this chapter?"" to ""This whole map has been boss fight after boss fight after boss fight"" (If you know, you know). That one boss in Act IV was way harder than the final boss of the game.

Sadly once you get far into the game it breaks down completely. I can't even finish my playthrough as I'm stuck with gamebreaking bugs. If I can't even finish your game, I can't recommend it. Original review below.

------------

This is very, very good. I can recommend this to anyone remotely interested in CRPG's as well as 40K. There is just one caveat as well as a personal annoynace:

Caveat: There are many bugs. I haven't yet encountered one that is gamebreaking, but there are bugs like talents not working properly, etc. If this is a dealbreaker for you, you're informed. 

Personal annoyance: Sometimes you are not really given a dialogue option that reflects what makes sense in a situation, kind of leaving you feeling forced into doing certain things.

I've been waiting for this game for some time and so far I am very disappointed.
-Graphics... Is this game from the early 2000's? Very lacklustre at best.
-Animations... Utterly terrible. Firing from cover looks like the charterer shot out their crotch. Wondering if the devs have heard of idol animations - nps just stand around in a generic pose. The walk away animation in the cut scenes!!!! Having to skip or sit through clunky walk animations until they're off screen is just awful.
-Story... apparently it gets better but so far, it's very forgettable.
-Voice acting...  Good in some parts, terrible in others. Wish more of the dialog was voice acted, especially all of the story missions.
Levelling.... OK, so I'm enjoying the character progressing but my god, it takes an age to read through all of the skill options. There are the recommend skills but if you want to go your own way, there's so much choice and hard to know a route to go down. I think I've spent most of my play time in the levelling screen.
Loot... half of the loot, I have no idea what it's for.
Level Design... Meh at best. They look good but it's pretty much enter one side, exit the other, go off path for some loot to trade.
Dialog and world skill checks.... Is it possible to fail them? They seem like an after thought to make it more of an RPG. 

I really want to like it and I'll keep playing but so far for a £40 game, it really lacks polish or anything of a game that's come out in 2023.",1703865425,1703865425,False,1,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I've a good PC, on which I've run games which should be far more resource demanding than this one. It absolutely doesn't matter which graphic setting you choose, the game causes my graphic card fan to run crazy even on the settings screen.

As for the game, the gigantomanic gameworld is just ugly and ridiculous, static and lifeless. Combat may be OK, but the combat scenarios are repetitive and in the long run tedious to play: Most of the times you are ambushed by a pletora of lower level enemies with the occasional boss, there is no stealth system in this game, the set up is static, you can see the enemies from a distance just standing there but as you approach the game tells you you have been ambushed.

I am at a point in Act 4 where my party gets destroyed in a boss fight on EASY difficulty. Either I am just too stupid for this game or some fights are really broken...
Combining this with bugs where quests do not start, it gets really painful to have invested about 90 hours in the game.

The Game up towards what I believe to be the end of Chapter 4 has been almost no problem maybe minor glitches, but recently there have been moments that feel disjointed and upon further examination it appears some cut-scenes have been completely vacant from my play-through. I finally pieced this together during a romance and it felt rather disjointed. This certainly did not impact game-play or function, but it heavily impacted narrative (not just the romance scene but have looked other scenes were most certainly important as well). Is the game terrible, not even a little, writing, game-play and voice acting all are rather good, quickly became one of my favorite games. BUT this is another demonstration of modern game development and its problems, games should be (to the best of their abilities) completed and totally playable, not perfect until the halfway mark and then become a buggy and unpolished mess. If anyone bought a 12"" sub and only half had what you wanted and the other half was almost empty that would be a terrible business. So I hope these narrative issues are fixed because ultimately this is a narrative game and having scenes not load properly and thus have the story become disjointed or even certain dialogues completely unavailable is incredibly unprofessional.

The Great:
Rogue trader is set in the 40k universe which i have barley touched. So i dont know how well they did this universe according to what the lore is. But it is very fucking interesting. Everything feels like its brimming with backstory and interesting lore concepts that really solidify the overall worldbuilding. 

The sound in this game is so damn crisp. The sound of the bolt guns and lasers is so orgasmic.

The tactics gameplay is pretty damn good and challenging. There are so many different builds in the class system that you can chose from.  The level up systems are deep and complex but not as complex as pathfinder is. I really do adore some of the classes in this game. The arch militant burst weapon build is probally the most satisfying class i have ever played in a tactics game or in a rpg its just sounds and feels so damn good mowing enemies down with a massive burst weapon combo. The combat in general feels so damn good because the universe, the visuals, and the sound pile ontop of eachother creating this very good package which immerses you in every fight. This also applies to space combat which is pretty well done.

The Meh
The economy in this game is way different then a usual RPG. Its basically a points system where you send your loot to factions to gain reputation, when you gain a certain amount you get a level which then gives you free gear. I did enjoy this system but at the same time i felt like their still needed to be a usual buy and sell system. As near act 4 the profit system became waay to easy and it just turned me having so much profit but no loot to gain levels. This feeds into the overworld system which is definitely better than pathfinders weird overworld army simulator. But it still never engrossed me with the colony management system that they put into this game. It felt like just wraiths system but no army mini-game just management. I think they just needed something like space combat battles where you assembled your own defenders in ships and faught different factions and pirates.

Story/Plot is a mixed bag (Very Minor spoliers). It starts off very very strong with you basically becoming a rogue trader which is basically like a emperor. Act 1 is great opening. Act 2 is a fantastic entry into the overworld systems and the overall world of the expanse. But act 3 the game drops off. Act 3 is like the underworld in wrath its fine but it feels to disjointed. The issue is that when you come back to the overworld in act 4 the game gives you very little new content. Everything feels samey and it is. Act 5 is a much sorter version of act 3 but it feels very rushed it has this weird small overworld segment that makes very little sense. So yeah the plot is much worse than wrath, i felt little care about the plot in 4 and 5 and just felt like i wanted to keep playing because of the combat. 

Many companions felt kinda boring and generic. I would say 4 of the 9 companions were outright bland because we have seen their type of character 5000 million times in rpgs. Many companions dont have any agency at all. You can be a heretic for 3 and a half acts and they wont bat an eye. Its very sad because once again the Lich path in pathfinder had such a great and meaningful agency that worked so well because companions who were against the path you were on consistantly warned you and your personal relationships really mattered when it came to how they treated you. In rogue trader it never really matters and i was very surprized to see that when i went on the heretic path the characters that i treated with the most kindness still left me anyways and i was given no options to convince them like pathfinder. Some companions however really do a great job at ether exploring the different types of people/cultures of the world and some are just great personalities. While some of them are interesting they do end up lacking personal emotional moments with your character which was very odd. About 4 or 5 characters who or not romancable just feel like they are conduits for the culture that they are from rather than actual people. 

While the actual combat is solid. You have to get past a bunch of weirdly designed systems that try to drain the fun out of the game. For one the injury system which is in most tactics games is god awful in this game, you cant heal most injuries and because alot of the games have long ass dungeons you are just sitting there with a bunch of injuries and expecally on hard mode its legit impossible to win some fights because you have way to many injuries stacked. This was an issue with pathfinder but its way worse in rogue trader. 

Music was kinda a mixed bag and while it was very good early, it felt very repetitive in acts 4 and 5.
Bad/Bugs:
There are also 3 different types of morality systems which basically chose which faction you are part of being Inconiclast ( morality good guys) Dogmatic ( very religious crusader type guys) and Heretic ( very bad guys). The issue with these paths is that the system that they used for them just doesnot work. Its a points system and certain ranks are capped at points but if you dont have the correct points you cant roleplay. Its moronic how such a binary system could be implemented in a roleplaying game. The points system also forces the player to consistantly pick the choices that give them the points. In wrath when i roleplayed my Lich character i felt like i had so much agency over my choices so its dissapointing that owlcat took so many steps back with this system.

Game is buggy and needs way more patching. Performence was actually fine but the quest bugs cannot be overlooked. 
Many abilites ether lack proper visuals or proper sounds. There are way to many times where the games ui during combat said i could do something but when i did the action it never actually did anything. 

A massive amount of non voice read lines. I dont care about reading in games, my favorite games of all time consist of pre update disco elysium and Pentiment. But there are just so many damn moments in this game that require the voice acting to really sell them. When they didnot have them it felt like such a weird moment you have this really agressive music blaring over while your trying to read a book lmao. 

Overall, i enjoyed 40k rogue trader. I really liked the tactics gameplay, i loved the world and the sound. I really enjoyed some characters while others ether had 0 personality or were too generic for me to care. Acts 1 and 2 are fantastic while act 3 was meh act 4 was contrived and act 5 was rushed. Game needs voiceacting for alot of the important parts, and music is meh. Morality system is anti roleplaying and is terribly designed, you never want to force a player into roleplaying a certain way and owlcat did it. Game is buggy with many gamebreaking quests bugs and combat bugs. I really love this game in so many ways and i also am very dissapointed with how this game failed in so many ways.

Pros: 
-Warhammer 40k
-Rich character development system with numerous ways to play multiple builds
-Turn-based TTRPG inspired combat
-You get a Space Marine companion
-Isn't an 80 hour dating sim
-A great way to learn lore about 40k that isn't a british asmr video.
-You have a space butler that introduces you to everyone.
-Space Combat

Cons:
- 1/3 to 1/2 of all the talents are broken (though they have fixed many)
-Acts 3,4,5
-Multiple quests are broken the further you progress into the game
-You get a Space Marine companion, but it's a Space wolf
-Can't breed Argenta
-Space Combat

First and foremost, it is a great representation of the Rouge Trader setting in Warhammer 40k. You can tell that Owlcat are fans of Warhammer who care about the lore. The story is well done, it follows suit in the classic tales of the Warhammer universe. Does this game have bugs? Yes. This is a small studio making 100 hour long rpgs, as of now I've reached chapter 4 with very minor bugs, and no crashes. The bugs were mostly graphical, with purple boxes showing up on one npc, and some cut-scenes played twice. Some people have mentioned some skills not working correctly, but I've not noticed it. 

I believe in supporting Owlcat, while they continue to patch the game. They are one of the few studios willing to take franchises like Pathfinder, or Warhammer and make traditional CRPGs out of them, and they are doing a great job of it. This is the first real Warhammer CRPG, and it's fantastic!  This game as is, is playable, and I'm having a great time playing it. 

For people new to Warhammer, but who are fans of RPGs, perhaps coming from Baldur's Gate 3. Warhammer is more of a niche universe, it's admittedly not for everyone. It's called Grimdark for a reason.

It will forever remain a flawed game in its final two acts, but it's still a solid cRPG and a great 40k game. The characters and their dialogue are astonishingly good. The writers have relied way too much on pet names to get character voice across, and in general there is simply way more exposition in dialogue that necessary, but the personalities are defined well enough for this to be a pretty minor drawback. The story itself ends in Act IV then starts all over again for no reason, but I otherwise think it's as good as could be expected, and there are some great moments.

I don't even know where to start with combat. I think it's bloated, ridiculously contrived, terribly balanced, stupid, and barely works. I also find it aggressively addictive and have spent nights staying up contemplating builds and talents. With the exception of way too much repetitive clickage (Yrliet uses the same four abilities every. single. turn, before she even takes a shot), the obscene bloat does create depth. 

I have a lot of problems with Rogue Trader. I could write a huge essay dissecting it and making it seem like it's a mediocre, disappointing game. 

But it isn't. It's so much fun. I barely understand why, but whatever it is that makes games, and especially RPGs, so impossible to put down--Rogue Trader has it.

Edit: I've now played this game for 33 hours and have completed the campaign. I ended up cheating a whole lot with the help of some mods, as without them the game would have genuinely been unable to be completed. Here's a general list of issues I've encountered.

- Combat will get stuck if a character's animation fails. This will cause the combat to lurch to a halt, forcing you to load an older save and loose progress as you cannot save while a character is taking an action.

- Characters will disappear, often. For the entire last act of the campaign, the secret heretic companion was invisible, couldn't equip anything, had no equipment, and was generally worthless.

- Colossal walls of text that ramble on and on, usually repeating worthless information. Extremely little voice acting, which is a pain as it would have helped tremendously.

- If you decide heresy, prepare to do a 3rd of the game with merc companions. I didn't, thinking I could persuade my way out of being accused. There is no option for it.

In conclusion, this game honestly needed a delay to make it more stable. I've been playing with mods and guides, and would still have segments where I would get lost for 30 minutes as the instructions in the quest log are either blatantly wrong, not showing up, or the map just did not load the quest object at all.

And I do not want to spoil things but in act 3 when you make some ""friendly"" choices with a certain male dark eldar and then you choose to let's say get rid of that character then you literally CANNOT leave from The Pit.If you make different choises the bug is not present,but in other circuimstances you are stuck forever in the are and CANNOT exit.And from what I have seen there are many other similar soft locking bugs.I have made a bug report almost 2 weeks ago and it still is not fixed",1703639675,1703792004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The art is fantastic, and the music is memorable, and for fans of the setting, it goes without saying that these are amongst the most authentic interpretations of various locales in the universe.

That being said, for anyone who isn't interested in the setting and wants a decent RPG, this game is a hard pass. The writing is fantastic and beautiful, but it's in service to a plot which at best is limp and lacklustre - and at worst a series of non sequiturs like a dungeon master trying to show you his favourite parts of the setting. The companions to the protagonist, a crucial element to a party focused, story rich RPG, do not develop in any meaningful sense, and will, apart from quips and comments in the field, have two sets of dialogue: One when they join your crew, and another when they want something. The love subplot, at least in my playthrough was written by someone who had never touched a woman. Or it was written by a woman. Either way it was terrible.

The game dips its toes into a variety of elements, which sound like an interesting cocktail, but - much like the companions - end up being shallow diversions. Colony management and space combat had the potential to set this RPG aside from any other, but ended up being kernels of good ideas in an otherwise mediocre experience. Combat, whilst not the focus of the game at all, is horrendously imbalanced. The crew melee, Abalard, has established himself as a meme in the community days after release for his proficiency. There's also an unreasonable difficulty hurdle around the end of the midgame that is never again surpassed, not even by the final boss. Many players reported quitting at that point. 

Ironically for a game called ""Rogue Trader,"" there is no trading in this game, only a donation system, where players are awarded free items when they reach a high enough reputation score.

Finally, the game is utterly broken. Characters would resurrect and behave as if I had made completely different decisions. Servitors lay dead or T posing on my bridge. For the final third of the game, whenever I visited my bridge, I would hover, stuck motionless in a kneeling position. I had everything from missing assets, to assets appearing in places they shouldn't, like the starmap. There were quests that could not be finished without the aid of the developer toolkit. 

All-in-all, though the game had a strong first half, it's not something I can recommend, except for people who can use their imagination and technical skills to navigate a story driven game so broken, it feels like it was written by GPT.",1703790524,1703790524,False,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Sadly some of the problem are in the story writing, something inherent that cant be fixed with later updates.
So I can't even say 'wait 2 months until they fixed all the bugs'.

The only good thing are they atmosphere and the powertrip.
They actual hit the atmosphere of wh40k pretty good.
They also made it possible that every character you start or get has a couple of potential realy strong builds you can create.

Sadly the atomsphere gets destroyed by the at times terrible writing. Often actions make no sence, or you wanna take paths that should be obvious but the game dosent give you the option. They also allude to you that there are multiple ways how you can play the game but it is a lie and they are of next to no consequence.

And the combate and characterbuilding is also absolutly broken. Many weapons, talents and features are bugged, the combat encounter themselve are extreme unbalanced and extremly luck dependend. If you dont highly optemize your party you either have to consitently save&load or play at easy mod which give the enemies such a big malus that it is just boring.

For people who say 'go woke, go broke', it is not, its just 'meh'.

If you realy wanna play this game, because it is wh40k, wait until it is on sale and install toybox, a cheatengine.

Edit: Ok no realy this game is full of bullshit and bugs from Act3 onwards.

If you read other positive reviews it becomes clear realy fast that they only played to Act 2 or rushed on Story Mod. On Story Mod the fights are trivial with enemy debuffed into oblivion.
But starting at Act 3 most fight are just a sludge with Boss Fights that are pure RNG in favour of the NPCs. It is just realy shitty design and a generaly rushed unfinished game.

Some reviewers also give it a thumbs up for pushing out Bug fixes, and there are a shit lot of Bug. As a buyer of this game you effectivly pay for the privilege to do quality control.

Maaan have i been waitin for a good 40k game a long time.
And this one? Damn it's good.

Firstly, let's adress the elepthant in the room, the thing everyone's talkin bout - bugs. Now, yes, there r bugs. In typical Owlcat fashion, they release a game full of em, but honestly? I guess i got lucky, cuz i aint had no gamebreaking ones. Sure, i've seen a lot of frustrating little things (and spent a couple angry hours writin detailed bug reports), like status effects not workin, broken movement, gaining less AP than u should, gettin more AP than u should, game thinking u've got all 10 companions at once lol (srsly Abelard kept talkin to Idira even tho she's not in the party, and Cassia constantly gave enemies her passive debuff even tho i never had her with me). I did encounter some ""goddamit i have to reload this fight now"" bugs, but those were fixed in the first patch, so after it came out i finished the game without much troubles.
UPDATE: literally a couple hours after i posted this, they uploaded a new patch with fixes for the issues i've mentioned above, yay ;D
Now, with that out of the way...
This game is fooken awesome. 

- I love the setting (not a diehard fan, but 40k does have a special place in my heart, shame there werent no orcs in this one ;-;), but even if ure not familiar with the lore, it wont hinder ur experience. The game doesnt rely on player's knowledge, everything is explained to u.

- The plot is interesting, engaging and with a few nice ""OMG NO WAY"" twists. Personally i was very much into it, as well as the side quests and all those small optional locations with their stories that explore different aspects of 40k world. Good times.

- The companions r really diverse and cool, i had big issues with companions in WoTR, but i think they really nailed it with this game. Basically, all ur companions come from different places, different backgrounds and convictions, and throu their interactions u get a different outlooks on the world of 40k, i think it's pretty well done. Whatever ur own opinion about 40k is, whenever u stand, u will find a companion or two who share ur beliefes. (unless ure into orcs like me, they really did left us hanging ;-;). I especially love that they pumped up more interactions between companions in dialogues, they really do feel like ur retinue and not just cardboards behind PC in a cutscene. Sometimes they will even oppose ur decisions, so u have to either reason with them or, well, say ur goodbyes to each other.

- The combat is alright. There r some... Straight up OP builds (it costs 400000 profit points to fire improved heavy bolter for 12 seconds), but i wouldnt say there r any lackluster classes. Everyone has their time to shine, different situations and enemies call for different approaches, so in general, i wasnt bored, combat didnt feel repetative for the most part. Most likely due to Owlcat actually giving some interesting and unique abilities to certain enemies and bosses this time. Oh man, the boss fights... I hate em but i love em.
Which leads us to possibly my only major complain about this game... Difficulty spikes.
Now, i played and replayed Owlcat's games for years now. And in each game there r fights that just... Make zero sense.
Here, i said it, the obligatory ""Owlcat balance bad reee"". However, i do think they really improved in this game. I've only been stuck on two bosses, and one of those fights was only hard cuz of really bad starting position ([spoiler]Eufrates II im looking at u[/spoiler]). But for the most part fights were fair, sometimes even unfair cuz my party was kinda a lil bit op? ;D
Played on daring btw, never switched it.

- Void combat. Fine, one difficulty spike near the end game [spoiler]fook u necron ships[/spoiler], but overall fine. U do have to invest into Imperial Navy trade a bit tho, really makes ur life easier early game.

- Colony management. Ah yes, the obligatory Owlcat barony/crusade/colony management. I actually liked it in rogue trader. It's just a small background thing u return to for a minute every once in a while. Gives good rewards, doesnt affect gameplay much, doesnt take so much time as in other Owlcat titles. It's okay.

Now, im runnin outta things to say and this review is already messy as hell. Prolly will rewrite it after playin again, after more patches.
But as it is right now - i recommend this game. If ure into this kind of games and not scared of a few bugs, ure gunna  have a blast.
Thank u, Owlcat, for keepin up the great work and consistently making great, somewhat broken, but great games, ure on of the main pillars in this genre right now, luv ye.

Is it 10/10 game? is it another BG3? Well not quite lets get into it
This game is great its what i call mix of Xcom and bg3 and even tho bit expensive.. i think its worth it
You dont have to be the lore master of this series but i am saying it will probably make your experience greater then mine. As someone with 0 knowledge of Warhammer i read lot of the game explanations as the game highlights important names or things. But i kinda wish a was a fan i knew more about the series would make my experience better. My first run is complete and idk i might do just one more. Customaziton is great the origin of characters you can just spend hour right there. You will ecounter char with same class like you its very obvious but thankfully you dont have to get them in party. Combat is easy to understand (As Xcom enjoyer) still its super simple. Romances so far i found just one. As the chapter progresses its becoming harder and some locations for me were little annoying especially the one you cant skip. The ending is kinda scripted (Unless i choose badly) But thats just my BG3 complaining that i am not free to do whatever i want.
if you are begginer like me Go first run as soldier or warrior. 
Final verdict: 10/10 still eather way i enjoyed the game even with zero knowledge. It is not baldurs gate as i said even tho this game tries hard to feel like you have lot of freedom some stuff is sadly scripted.

I saw many reviews that seemed unfair to me so I decided to put my own. I love the game, I'm on Chapter 4 currently. I did one game as a dogmatic (chapter 2, about 40 hours when I'm writing the review), one game as a benevolante (chapter 4 about 60 hours when I'm writing the review, taking my time).

The scenario is great, I almost don't have any complain. No issue with pacing so far. A little bit sad that companions don't react more to things happening, but that's honestly a very light complain. I didn't know 40K before playing it and it was amazing to discover everything through the game. Love the gore, love the darkness, love the shades of grey and the threat of the Inquisition, the Void and everything. Wish the group discussions on the ground would be all voiced, actually, I wished more cutscenes were voiced! Voice actors are great, well choosen, play well.
Wished Pasqal after Chapter 3 would think a bit more about what happened to him during Chapter 3 once we're in Chapter 4. But that's very minor and it's because I like that character a lot.

The battle system is great, I think it's definitely better than the Pathfinder games (which I both finished despite it). There are a few overpowered things around and a few things I haven't yet found a way to really take to my advantage, but honestly no complain. It's a step up from Pathfinder system imo. Normal difficulty is a bit easy for me, which was surprising to me considering Pathfinder would beat me up and chew me off. But I love rolling over the mobs with Idira and Cassia. I feel strong, and that's fun in a game where you're supposed to be strong. 
The NPCs can be super dumb though and hurt you with guns when they shoot, or kill themselves, but it also works for enemies so it's kinda funny too. Sometimes the zone target you think you chose is not exactly the target you get, it happens mostly when there is a different of ground level, so it can be managed by being mindful of it.

Dealing with systems is fine, I like that it gives you upgrades, I like the little events too. There's nothing really impressive about it, but it's definitely an improvement from how Pathfinder games used to be with cities. It's not problematic and not costing too much time, accessible on the map too, with interesting stories and decisions. I like it!

The map system is very nice. I like that you don't have to go on the surface of every planet of all the systems. I prefer to have less places to go but with more interesting dungeons, rather than go everywhere. It's less overwhelming. If I had one complain for that it would be the Navigator points system, it's difficult to get more, at least I don't have much luck with that. I'm fine now tho so it doesn't last forever.

Spatial fights are fun. I really like them. Sometimes the little pathway you can use tricks you because it won't turn the way it shows it would turn. But other than that, very fun. Wish we had a full fleet to control!

There are a few bugs, some cinematics are weirdly paced because of the timing issues of speech boxes taking too much time or too little, but it's very minor and doesn't hurt the game much. I haven't had any problematic game breaking thing happening to me so far that wasn't resolved through a reload or patience. 
One complain that I have is loading screen times. Going from your ship to the map, then to the system, then to a spatial fight, it's a lot of loading screens. Even if my game is installed on a SSD, it's still a bit of a drag. But it's worth it!

It captures the ambiance of the setting beautifully. There are some narrated scenarios that are straight up chilling, and I am currently doing a double play through to see what the different choices and play stiles do. The story is fantastic, the ambiance, the design, the maps, the characters the visuals... Everything unrelated to combat is a clean 4 stars for me. 

>>>>>>THAT BEING SAID<<<<<<
The combat fucking sucks, just play in story mode. You will think I'm crazy until the end of act 1, then your eyes will be open to the aurora.

First the easy and least grievous one: the tech tree. It's a literal chore. The descriptions on many of the talents are vague as hell, and 90% of the recommended traits are either trash or simply too convoluted to pull any synergy off of. A lot of the active abilities require for you to activate them each turn, click on them, then click the target and watch the full animation play out, every time. All that just to give yourself a 5% extra chance at hitting the enemy or something like that. It just adds to the length and tediousness of the combat and the reward is rarely worth it if I'm being honest.

NOW the bad. The ""I might drop this game"" bad.
There are 3 kinds of encounters, the normal kind, the mob encounters, and the BULLSHIT encounters.

The normal kind are the most straight forward and most enjoyable, you are faced against a moderated amount of enemies of varying strengths, they tend to be balanced and merge well with the story, All good up till here.

The mob ones: For those whom don't know, let me preface this with a lore bit: a bolter it's a massive gun that shoots rocket propelled explosive rounds that can go through tanks, often turning the target and all his neighbors into jambalaya after plowing through a couple more on it's way in. Well in this game you can see naked hobos tanking several shots from a point blank bolter with more than 90% of their health bar left sometimes, based on the encounter. That's not good for your immersion. But now imagine you have to kill from 20 to 40 of those. On a turn based game. One. by. one. To be fair this is more often not the case, and a great deal of the mob encounters are actually quite satisfactory to play through if you have any form of area damage on your party. But then we get into the ugly.

The BULLSHIT encounters. For an example imagine the previous scenario. But now the hobos deal 60% damage of your characters hp with a kitchen knife or a bb gun. Now add an unreachable sniper nest that never misses at the other side of the battlefield, and a buffed up boss with a metric ton of hp, that can insta-kill one or more of your characters in a single turn. Now add to that a 3 turn timer to kill it or the combat ends and you lose. The scenario that I'm describing might seem like an exaggeration, but it's called aurora and it's the end of the first chapter.

Other bullshit scenarios might contain enemies with a 90%+ dodge chance, dedicated kill zones as the starting point for your party, infinite enemy spawns, infinite false life regeneration for all your enemies, insta-kill mobs hidden behind an ocean of landmines that only affect you, stun grenade spams that give your enemies infinite turns... The list goes on, and I'm just half way through the game. These scenarios are not necessarily impossible, but they will likely require A TON of save scumming and a specialized party if you want to play on NORMAL difficulty or above. These scenarios come out of the blue too, so you might find yourself completely immersed in the story, breezing through hours of easy encounters, then boom, you are dead and it's been hours since your last save, and the auto save is still bugged(as of the day of this review) and you have to re-do all that. 
F*ck me that SUCKS.



All of these things were definitely not enough to pull me out of the game, but the problem it's that sometimes it came close. I don't know who designs the encounters, but I know it's the same dude that did it in the previous games because I had the exact same problem. There is nothing fun with being repeatedly hung on a load screen, there is nothing fun in getting killed in a scenario specifically designed to kill you, there is nothing fun with being forced to savescum, with having to munchkin your characters, or with being forced to skip the combat all together with story mode because of the damage that this is doing to your play through.

I don't know why this is allowed or tolerated but this is the second time I've considered not buying an Owlcat game because of it, and there might not be a third time to be honest, which is an absolute shame, because the games are otherwise a fantastic experience. I hope this changes in the future, I really really do.",1703775588,1703776942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is a game that barely left that point of development, when you have all of the content you've planned in it and so you should probably spend the next year and a half to actually make it work. But the thing is... the content itself is the problem.

The story needs to be rewritten (everything past Act 2). The faction reputation system needs to be remade. Combat needs a redesign. There is so many deeply ingrained problems with every aspect of Rogue Trader (which you can't just *fix* or polish) that you literally need the Rogue Trade 2.0 to salvage whole situation. I don't even know if Owlcat will ever do something at all about this.

I really enjoyed Kingmaker although some of the puzzles gave me a headache. I liked WotR to a degree too. But this fantasy-demon stuff just isn't the setting I like.

From the story telling perspective Rogue Trader is a pretty solid game. I don't know that much about the 40k lore. I've read the occasional book, read a lot of wiki articles over the years and watched some of the countless  lore videos.
I also played some of the other 40k games available.
From the limited knowledge I have, it's well written and doesn't contradict any of the stuff, I already knew about the lore.

But oh boy, are there some bugs and unbalanced encounters. 
The acts 1-3 where alright. Great even. I also liked the ship combat that got a lot of criticism.  I really enjoyed exploring the Koronus Expanse's star-systems, developing the rogue trader's realm und upgrading the ship. Most quests were great, I liked talking to nearly everybody.

But holy Terra, I wasn't able to progress beyond act 4. The Devs threw balance out of the window and shot it right in the head afterwards for good measure.

I do NOT feel scammed or want to say that I did not enjoy most of the game I was able to play before act 4. But the experience overall leaves a sour taste behind when you're not able to finish a game.",1703772561,1703772617,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Tl;DR - Game's solid atmosphere, nails the 40k setting, but it suffers from bugs and just feels unfinished, would not recommend until it's in a better state.

I'm going to start with the positives from what I've experienced, mind you this is only from like.. just the start of act 2.
Owlcat hands-down managed to  hit the nail on the head w/ the atmosphere of the game, Architecture, sounds, armors, ect. are all amazing. Every shot with a Plasma gun feels great, you get that nice boomy sound with the Bolt guns. The combat is alright, I've heard it gets weird in the later acts but I can't confirm that so it's still in my positive area. The companions I have met have all been pretty great with their stories, quests, and design. Overall? Solid foundation.

Now for the bad. Bugs, constant bugs. Can't tell you how many times my audio drivers have crashed because of the game but it's fairly common, it's annoying but an easier fix. The big bad was the above mentioned bricking of my save. Forced into a cutscene while on my ship caused my game to crash and when I tried to load back in none of the save files would work. I guess it's better that it happened to me at the start of Act2 instead of in a later one because then I'd just put it on the shelf and never touch it. Co-op isn't great, can't have a friend make a character w/ you when you start, gotta wait till you can make a merc for them. I get that it was a ""bonus"" but with the current state of the game I don't think it should've even been shipped. Away from the technical side of things the combat does have some issues, mainly when you get a higher enemy count it can take forever for all the pawns to take their turns. Another issue is with the movement in combat, you'll have to fight the camera and the game sometimes just to get to a tile you want, and even then you'll have to move one tile at a time for a few spots. Void battles as a whole are another dislike for me, having a smaller ship just stay in mine's blind spot, being unable to be hit for 3 turns while they can just pepper me and I have no answer isn't cool or fun. I'm also still not a fan of the portrait systems, mainly because it feels like an excuse for them to make the character creator as barebones as possible.

Overall I really want to like this game, it's just Owlcat still doesn't have their jank from their previous games sorted and now it's brought here. With Owlcat's brand of Jank when a bug happens it will /always/ be the most catastrophic version of what it could do. Here's hoping that either Owlcat fixes it, or their modding community does what Bethesda's does and fixes their game for them.",1703772323,1703772323,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character creation process isn't without it's quirks, but it IS certainly more lore-focused than most RPGs, and that ultimately works best for a game that leans so hard into its roleplaying elements.

Wonderful game if you are in the Warhammer 40k Universe - if not, you can step into. The mechanics are very nice, it's an immersive experience to play the game. You can decide how to interact with other characters, depending on your skills. If you haven't played any games by Owlcat, it's your chance to do so and get an awesome RPG with endless hours of exploring (the first part took me 16 hours).

Several issues even early on with enemy AI breaking and combat freezing up for minutes at a time because of it, camera bugs staying fixed on enemies in combat so you cannot progress combat at all and you need to reload a save and it has only gotten much worse past chapter 2. 

I've ran into broken dialogue triggers,  broken quest triggers, you characters loading inside of terrain or getting stuck outside the map and a consistent game breaking bug where my character would load into the wrong map making it impossible to do anything and I've had to install mods to fix this.

1) Bugs galore (quests not working, skills not working, etc.).

2) Backgrounds are pretty much irrelevant story-wise, which isn't something that should have place in an RPG.

3) Creating party members cost Profit Factor, so if you want to run with full Heretic party you're penalized for it. I guess it's the developers' way of soft-forcing players to use pre-made companions? Either way, I don't think it's a fun idea.

4) Retraining (after 3rd time) costs Profit Factor. This hits new players in particular as you can easily end up with a weak build for your characters. It also hinders experimenting with different builds.

5) I like space combat. I don't like how limited scrap for repairs is and how you have to actually engage in each combat to see if you can beat it or not (turning it into a puzzle game of sorts), which essentially means the game is wasting your time between loading screens, because it can't make it more pronounced which systems are ""easier"" ones to explore first, despite having a perfect way of suggesting this (the difficulty of Warp routes).

6) Similar to 5) - you can easily find yourself in a situation where you are exploring a space vessel that has way too hard encounters than you would think at first. If you don't have many save games you could easily screw up your entire run.

Second playthrough.  Oh boy, now i'm running into problems, both personal and what others have experienced.  I thought, awesome, i've been good, time to be an evil heretic.  First couple of acts went by wonderfully.  By act 4 though you start getting so many bugs that either break the narrative or even prevent you from progressing unless you take a certain route.  Then the alignment system also starts to become a BIG problem.  Many things specifically REQUIRED to do a pure heretic run are dialogue locked behind the higher heretic alignment levels.  It seems only possible to get these levels if you picked every single possible heretical option possible.  Annoying and immersion breaking, but doable yes?  Well no.  Because there's so many bugs that some heretic options throughout the game are bugged in a way that prevents you from picking them, because if you do you can't progress anymore.
Now maybe i'm a bit of a more casual player and maybe there's a chance I missed some opportunities to pick up some points.  Good argument.  But I scoured that damn Koronus Expanse for every single planet and made every choice I could (which wasn't inaccessible due to some bug) and built up all my worlds choosing the heretic buildings.  Even if I did miss maybe one thing and IF the game wasn't even bugged, why on Earth is it a good idea to build a game in a way you have to do every tiny thing, every playthrough just to progress the story decently.  I can imagine it just makes a lot of people not want to replay it.
Combat has its flaws, but like I said i'm a bit more casual than some and on lower difficulties, it's just fine if again a little buggy.  Only had to reload a few times in comparison to the narrative bugs.  But honestly some fight are far more poorly deigned than others and it's noticeable.

Back to the story though.  It's honestly amazing.  Among the best games i've ever played in that regard and the reason I have the hours that I have put into it.  Honestly how a game can have such masterful writers, yet the abysmal mechanics amazes me.  Writers deserve plenty of praise.

Played nearly 75 hours and I'm barely into the game proper. The combat is fun but is also very frequent and drawn out. Random difficulty spikes are a big problem as well. You'll be doing just fine for a while but then randomly run into encounters where enemies are vastly overpowered compared to you. This applies to space combat as well in which there is no preview of any kind before starting the combats. This is all ""early"" in the game as well. The space combat is also pretty bland. The gear system i feel is a miss. Gear is quite limited and new gear feels like a very minimal power boost compared to how much harder combat becomes. I don't care for the whole reputation/gear acquisition mechanic either. The story is alright but the writing is average at best which is kind of a death knell for a Warhammer game. One compliment I do want to give is a detail that made me smile. In one of the first combats I blew a guy up with a critical and his arms rolled down a set of stairs making a squelch with each step until they hit the bottom. A weird little detail but it was very Warhammer and it made me smile. I will say I had fun for a while but just got to the point where I'd rather play something else. This game also still has a lot of bugs which I was able to overlook for a while but again with the length it starts to become pretty annoying.

To elaborate: the game's depiction of the universe, choices, characters, situations and story is quite good. If you are acquainted with Owlcat games then you might not be surprised at the fact that this game feels like several packed into one. This is because of the numerous systems that are integrated into the game, it's not just a CRPG experience but also has some strategy and tactics aspect to it when it comes to Void battles and the management of your colonies and extraction of resources in different systems; outfitting your ship, upgrading it, etc. Personally, I love this kind of game development because it gives me a lot of options to my activities, truly makes me feel the scale of the power I wield within the game, something that also was very well done in Kingmaker and Pathfinder: WotR.

However, many aspects are buggy as heck right now: animations, hit chances calculations with some weapons, some quests, etc. which result in frustrations when it happens. There is no worse feeling that doing a lengthy quest just to get a buggy outcome on completion...

Moving on from the bugs, which [strike]hopefully[/strike] will get fixed sooner or later. The game also suffers from clunkyness. This doesn't mean difficult stuff or anything of the sort but some aspects, particularly in combat and character building that could use some quality of life improvements... 

For example: in the game, every character class (archetype) has a few unique actions which can get modifiers later on, as you build your character; an Officer's ""Voice of Command"" action can get additional bonuses at certain points during progression, but those added bonuses aren't really shown or listed in the UI. This can be a game breaker for me. There is no way I'm going to remember all of the added stuff into an skill, specially if I'm running with multiple characters using the same archetype but different bonuses. Another feature affected by this terrible design are the heroic acts/desperate measures which suffer from the exact same issue, basically leading you to open character screen mid-battle just to remember what modifiers certain skills have in some characters. [b]This is incredibly frustrating, specially when a lot of your actions will have modifiers one way or another.[/b]

This leads me to the next point which is combat being fairly confusing, and I don't know if its due to the lack of descriptions and terrible UI which leads to this constant confusion or just a design issue. I'd like to know in an easy way the differences between weapons, their cons and pros as well as having an easier time with enemy resistances and skills. Previous titles were a bit confusing in this regard but somehow, this one is the worst of the lot when it comes to it. Is it too difficult or too much to ask to add a line of text stating the possible benefits of using Bolt, Solid, Las, Melta, Plasma, etc. weaponry? Specially when there's so many kinds of choices and also enemy resistances.

Overall, the game is a great experience for the story and universe, basically all that encompasses the RPG and, oddly enough, the management and decision making is fairly great as well. Even so, so much of the bugs and this clunkiness feels like it drags the game down constantly, not letting most of its valuable features shine, like the combat, which I'm a fan of.

I'd say the game is ok if you can grit through the annoyances. Whether you can or want to, is a different matter. I love Warhammer 40k so I guess I can put up an effort, for now.

I've always loved the setting and the lore, and Owlcat did an excellent job with that. I don't think it's a BAD game, but there's a lot of things that someone could give it a bad review for and I wouldn't blame them. I want to love this game so badly but man, I keep hitting things that make me want to go play something else.

The dead horse of ""so many bugs"" has already been beaten to death here. Will Owlcat fix them? Probably. There was even a tiny update on Christmas morning (it may have been pushed out the day before) that fixed all of my visual tiles/layers/icons that were missing. But how long will bug-quashing take? I could see people waiting for a future sale and only buying it then, well after the bugs are fixed.

But what has made me want to quit multiple times are only what I might call 'potholes'. They're things that you hit (or see other people hit) and you end up sitting there wondering what is even going on. One of the first ones was the notorious Derelict Hulk. I think it was well made and overall was a fun encounter, but running into that very early on was an eye opener. Was it a conscious choice? Was it just an early game party and build check, maybe? Or was it just overtuned for when people tend to run into it? I left and came back much later, which seems to be what a lot of other people did. But I had no idea until I Googled a number of discussions about it, and saw I wasn't alone.

The mechanics behind Navigator points...I thought I understood what was going on under the proverbial hood...up until I hit the mission where I had to find a path to a system without a pre-existing path, and I had no navigator points left (you need 3). Once again I was off to Google, and found myself combing through various threads and discussions to try understanding what was going on. Did anyone else happen to notice *THE LITERAL FIRST TIME* they moused over a system, and seeing a message explaining how to create paths and such? Because I certainly don't remember seeing anything, but a number of people online insist that it is there but it only shows up ONCE. So in the end I learned about some random orange/red encounters giving out navigator points, reloaded a previous save where I still had a couple of points left, then warped back and forth until I got such an event (this took a while) and was able to reach that system. But none of this was obvious from within the game...it took some searching online to find a solution. 

The most annoying for me was Act 3 and trading a stimm (?) for a pistol I did not need (it's a completely blind dialogue exchange where you don't know what you will even get anyways, or that you will need the original item later) and then playing around in that general area for hours before wondering why I couldn't manage to rescue a specific character. If you don't have VERY GOOD specific stats you can fail 2 dialogue checks (I was at a 0% chance to pass either of them, with Argenta who was also zero help), leaving me my only option...to use the potion/stimm that I had traded away hours earlier, and hadn't found more of...so that option was grayed out. So off I go to Google YET AGAIN, and sure enough...you can lose certain characters permanently in that part of the game. And of course I didn't save between all of the cutscenes/dialogue and trading that stimm away, sooo...I had to reload all the way back to before that storyline even picked up. Is there another solution? Maybe? But I didn't find anything and I 100% didn't want to just up and lose a character PERMANENTLY...so /golflap to Owlcat for that specific design choice.

I ended up talking to a few friends who by this point have all quit playing, and there seemed to be a somewhat common thread in the game for everyone: they all hit certain things that either weren't well explained, they were forced to reload and had to go back more than 30m, or were hit in the face with something that came completely out of the blue, and they all literally just exited out and went off to play other games instead. And FWIW, almost all of them have beaten BG3 (at least once) as well as having played all of the Pathfinder stuff. 

Now add in all of the bugs, especially in the later acts, to ship combat that's really just a minigame (that not everyone likes, though I kind of do) along with a skill system that is just a rats-nest of junk that encourages premade cookie cutter builds for certain characters...and I don't know if I can honestly recommend it, even if I will likely go back repeatedly and stubbornly keep playing. 

I'll change my review to 'recommend' at a later date if Owlcat goes back and fixes a lot of stuff, but at this point in time I'd tell people to just hold off until it's either on sale (next Christmas, maybe?), or Owlcat fixes a lot of the issues people are currently having.

Currently the game taxes your GPU heavily regardless of settings, and the combat jank is incredible. 

Combat very quickly turns into tedium. Instead of fun fights it's always a swarm of nameless goons. The entire first chapter is basically how many no-hitpoint mooks can you kill in a round. The answer? Lots. But there's not auto resolve or party AI so you have to manually kill a swarm of ants just to move from map to map.  The first time you do this it's kind of fun abusing your abilities and watching stuff die. The 10th time a bunch of guys with crappy gear jumps out of nowhere and force you to kill them just to move on? ...yeah. Not so much.

Also ship combat plays like something from 20 years ago and also has no auto-resolve button.

Enemy scaling is a joke (random mook now has more hp than the heroes), loot continues to be incredibly useless, I can't use my so called ""wealth and influence"" to buy so much as a heavy bolter. Space combat is incredibly terrible. Planet exploration is tedious. Story doesn't matter anymore because I don't believe my character is a Rogue Trader when I have to worry about little things like basic health packs. Narrative says I'm powerful and in command of thousands, game mechanics say I'm a low level adventurer in a world with enemy scaling. I get the worst of both worlds and the advantages of neither.",1702775176,1703716288,False,4,0,0.54980015754699707,0,True,False,False

It's a janky CRPG that was clearly rushed to market. The first half or so is fun for the most part. Beyond that, it becomes increasingly likely that you will encounter a bug (or poor design choice) that blocks you from progressing certain quests or even the main story.

It shows promise, but I recommend waiting until they patch everything and release the ""definitive edition"", which is what Owlcat usually does. They've basically released an Early Access game without calling it Early Access.

If you're just looking for a fun tactics game set in the 40k universe, I would recommend ""Mechanicus""; it's a lot more polished and stable. I think ""Chaosgate""(?) is another one that might be good, but I haven't played it yet so I'm not sure.

[h2] Long Version [/h2]
The following is a summary of my general experience with the game.

I almost gave up once because I thought the saves of my furthest progressed character got deleted by a bug. It turns out that, after making several new characters, the game started consolidating the saves of my older characters in the folder of the newest ones. A bizarre bug, but not as bad as I initially thought.

After discovering that, I started playing again. I enjoyed it for the most part. I love the tactical combat. I even really enjoyed character building and progression despite the cluttered presentation, typos, and confusingly phrased skill and item descriptions.

I built an Arch-Militant who could obliterate enemies with a Multi-Melta with 95% accuracy. THAT was really fun to play. It seems that if you can sift through the jank and know what you're doing, you can build some really OP characters.

However, I thought voidship combat was repetitive, tedious, and frustrating. I set the difficulty on that to easy so that I didn't have to spend so much time on it. I appreciate the level of granularity in the difficulty options which allowed me to do that.

I wasn't a fan of how travelling around the Koronus Expanse works. I found it much too slow and tedious. I spent all my Navigator's Insight points (a resource which allows the player create routes between locations on the ""world map"") in Chapter 2 in an effort to make travel between my colonies more convenient.

Little did I know, this would bite me in the ass later.

In the beginning of chapter 3, I was told by one of my companions that I need to go to a system that is crucial to progressing the main story. I can't get there because not only did I spend all my navigator points in chapter 2, I also already explored and scanned everything that was available. And exploring and scanning planets is one of the few ways in which you earn Navigator's Insight.

The codex/manual says you can also get Navigator's Insight from warp-travel events. So, I jumped back-and-forth along ""dangerous"" and ""unsafe"" routes to trigger a few events. Not a single event gave me any Navigator's Insight. Maybe I just wasn't triggering the right events, I don't know. But I'm not going to waste my time clicking around the map hoping that something random is going to allow me to progress further.

Basically, I'm stuck.

I can't progress Chapter 3. I'm not going to see what the story is leading to, and that's rather disappointing. Although, from what I've seen people say about Chapter 3, maybe that's for the best.

Oh, and on top of all that, as soon as I entered chapter 3, an NPC aboard my voidship who enables you to easily buy and sell stuff from the differently factions, suddenly lost the ability to do so. I have to go directly to each individual factions representative if I want to trade with them. That's enormous pain due to how spread out they are and how many loading screens you have to sit through to get to them.

So yeah, I think I'm done with this game for a while. I'll probably come back to it after they release a few more patches. But for now I think I'll play Mechanicus instead.",1703712435,1703712435,False,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

This review contains no spoilers, and there is a TL;DR at the end.

Overall: 6/10

This turn-based strategy rpg game contains a large amount of content spanning a mimimum of 100 playtime hours for the average player, as well as plenty of additional content, introductory looks into Warhammer 40k lore, and solid replayability. 

Sadly, it is with regret that I must recommend not playing this game. I suggest waiting for a respectable few patches to come out fixing the glaring issues with this game. Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader suffers from being released in a horrifyingly buggy, incomplete state. Large sections of this game either cease to function, are riddled with bugs, or are horribly broken to the point of unbalanced. My exploration of the first 2 acts of the game was only managed due to the awesome story-line, wacky interactions, and fun gameplay, which muted the pains of playing this buggy mess.

Act 1 for the most part runs extremely well. Most animations, cut scenes, dialogue, and even mechanics are well polished. The game is fun, introduces the major plot points, and has wonderful sub-areas to explore. The game's dogmatic/iconoclast/heretical system is extremely fun, and I could see myself wanting to play this game 1 or 2 more times to explore the seemingly wildly different experiences of these role-play tropes. I fell in love with this game early, and was enjoying my time spent a lot.

Act 2 is where some cracks began to form. First off, multiple ability descriptions are either misleading, or the abilities they are tied to broken. I have found multiple exploits and bugs within the mechanics of the game itself, and one of my characters are outright broken due to the poor state of the game's 2nd archetypes. I could solo this game with a single character (maybe 2) with how broken some of these abilities are. To clarify, I mean broken in both the buggy sense, as well as the overpowered sense. 

Additionally, the further I went into Act 2, the more buggy animations, cutscenes, interactions and mechanics I ran into. In an early Act 2 fight, I counted a minimum of 8 unique bugs happening on screen  during that fight, ranging from mechanics, to stats, to archetypes, animations, ai, etc. Later on, quest lines started breaking. They simply wouldn't complete or move on to the next stage. One multiple occasions, my crew randomly teleported mid conversation, abruptly ending the scene and the exploration of that section of content. This is where I started struggling to enjoy the game.

Act 3 was a whole other beast, and I have decided to put this beautiful game on hold until it is fixed. Almost every cutscene is buggy or broken. Animations aren't working right. Some questlines were just straight up broken. Part of the game's mechanics were heavily annoying, though through oversights or bugs I'm unsure. Personally, I don't much like the approach Act 3 took for the game, but that is not the focus of my review. The game is at a state of broken that is completely unacceptable for a fully released game.

Conclusion:

This game should not have been released in this state. It is obsessively buggy, broken and almost unplayable. Owlcat has been known for it's awful bugs in it's games for a while now, but that doesn't make it okay. This game should've been released early access, or had some sort of disclaimer to it's state of broken. This is unacceptable. When you release a game in this state, you are telling the players that their money matters more than their opinions. I'm sure the rest of this game is wonderful, but I refuse to play through your mess of a game. The gaming industry deserves to know that this game is broken after the first 50+ hours.

TL;DR - First Act is great, but bugs start happening as you progress through act 2. Game is almost unplayable in act 3. Otherwise, game is great. I STRONGLY recommend waiting for multiple patches before buying. Give the game a year or 2.

Enemies run away so you end up chasing the last two shooters into the open to get one decent shot. the AI is brutally stupid with aggressive friendly firing NPCs who will run behind your character and burst fire into their back repeatedly and several missions have you fighting with NPCs. and seem's like cover is purposely placed out of your movement range forcing you to camp or sit in the open for a whole turn while every enemy with a gun burst fires over and over. it's fun enough there is a good game here somewhere but so far it's been a bit of a 11 hour slog waiting for better weapons or something to do on the ship other than run around on the deck doing nothing.........EDIT, Game got better after leaving the first areas and you actually get a few weapons choices.

Rogue Trader is not Wrath of the Righteous, which I adored, but it is much better than the dime-a-dozen bad WH40K games we've been plagued with in the past 10 years. (WH40K: Mechanicus being a fun exception!)

[b]I'd rate it at a solid 7.8/10 at release. (Better than Starfield, certainly!) There are a few game-breaking bugs (I am completely locked out of a romance because a quest chain failed to trigger in Chapter 2, tons of people are reporting issues with Chapter 4. You'll be rolling the dice a bit) so buyer beware at this stage.[/b]

if you like owlcat/CRPGs and 40k: buy it
if you like 40K: probably buy it
if you are unfamiliar with either: wait for the bugs to be ironed out, or a sale, whichever happens first

Details below!

[h2]Pros:[/h2] 
+ feels like 40K, and the rogue trader fantasy is well-supported with lots of dialog options and story choices based on your alignment
+ does justice to the setting's tone and lore, even references some pretty obscure fluff
+/- some builds and party comps are super fun and effective (while many others are decidedly not) 
+ art direction is on point, everything is very grimdark
+ respec available from the get-go, thank you thank you
+ void combat rules are engaging, even if the execution is a bit janky (ship kills / cameras being wonky and not well synced) 
+ charting routes through the warp to discover new systems is really great; the resource management aspect of deciding whether to reduce danger of minor routes vs. opening up a major one to connect far-flung systems feels weighty in Chapter II. 
+ i chose something in her leveling that has made Cassia an absolute powerhouse 1-shot kill machine and i am terribly afraid it's just a bug; she is deleting enemies and it rules but also feels unintentionally busted. she does not feel optimized enough (by me, a fool) for this to be the case.

[h2]Cons:[/h2] 
- i chose practical male voice at character creation and it instead assigned me the firebrand preacher which is in direct thematic opposition to my RP choices. i cannot change this unless I turn off all PC responses. (please let me change all aspects of my character within the game if you're going to let me change basic appearance options)
- for every 1 fight that rules, there are 5 more that tend to be a slog in the early game / feel like filler 
- in the first two chapters of the game your characters' toolkits open up a little slowly for the rate they throw levels at you, (which is paradoxically maybe too frequent to keep making me spend 10 minutes judging what i should take at level-up?) 
- weird lack of voice acting even for an Owlcat game (which is dense with rich text you're going to read yourself)
- SO many bugs, but most are being fixed quickly
- supremely jank in-engine cut scenes they should have just done via descriptive text; they just yank you right out of the experience.",1702759511,1703702068,True,4,1,0.538965940475463867,0,True,False,False

Good: Great story, great characters, great gameplay. I was immersed and invested immediately. These points alone make every hour worthwhile. I enjoyed exploring and reading everything I came across in the game. For people unfamiliar with 40k, there are links in the text the give lore tidbits so you can understand what's being spoken about without there being unnecessary exposition for 40k nerds like myself.

Meh: Reputation and the rewards tied to it aren't balanced well. If you spread the rep points instead of focusing on 1 faction the gear you get will either be the same as what you have or obsolete. It takes way too much rep to get anything meaningful and takes a large amount of Profit Factor (currency) to get good items. 

Space combat while done well, is more unforgiving than the standard combat. It gets better once you have a second ship to help out and soak some hits, but by the end game it will usually be dead after 1 or 2 turns because you can't upgrade it or control it. If it was controllable and could be upgraded it would perform better.

Bad: This game was not finished. Broken quests and links in item/skill descriptions. These kinds of bugs are completely unacceptable because you find them just by playing the game, they are not obscure occurrences. Some people have complained about game breaking bugs, but I never encountered any. The ones I encountered were related to side quests tied to companions which soured the experience. The issues were the quests not even firing or not completing when finished. A minor annoyance is the party you last disembarked with is the ""party"" you are using as you fly through space. This affected Yrliet's quest early on because even if you recruited her if she wasn't in your party when you disembarked, it would bug the completion of her side quests which were resolved in space.",1703700387,1703700387,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It thankfully avoids a lot of the pitfalls of the other IP games that have come out over the years. All the lore, none of the real world drama.",1703698663,1703698663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe higher if the Expanse game proves interesting. I have only just got in to the expanse so I may have to update this review based on what I find.

First, im a huge 40k fan and I also read the books, the writing style in this game is not the same as the books, it lacks that dark forbidding universe feel that I have come to expect from all things 40k. Its a little nice basically. But that is the worst element of the game, by worst I mean its only Okay. Not bad, not good, just Okay. 

This is a character RPG, heavily reliant on turn based combat. You get to recruit several characters and make them part of your squad. All are interesting and diverse. For example I have an Admech character that favours working with machines in the name of the machine god, a Navigator with her third eye, an inquisitor and a number of other characters. 

Also not all lines are voice acted, a vast majority are not in fact, so you really have to like reading to understand whats going on. 

The Journals are basically titles of quests you have to finish, not very useful and the quests them selves are written in such a way you can often and all too easily miss doing something such as destroying an ancient anti aircraft battery, that you have to return too later and finish the job if you miss it whilst doing your sweep. There are a few issues like this. As a quest maker in my own right, the first thing you learn is to think ""how will the player bugger up my quest"" and then make sure he cannot do it. But even when thinking that way, its all to easy to miss one or two things. So im not holding this against the dev team. It is an easy fix and im sure they will be attentive and fix these annoying issues over time. 

Difficult levels take a very sharp turn upwards at the end of the first chapter, even turning down the difficulty to story does not help much. Those who tried it before release reported it was easy, I think the devs have over compensated and made a game for those who are prone to exaggerate in their reports. After Chapter 1, I would call Story Mode Hard and go from there. 

Tactical combat is basic compared to games like UFO and other similar games, with cover only counting as cover if it has a cover symbol next to it and you are stood beside it. This means statues, large objects etc can be shot through as if they are not there. Cover literally is only applied if you are stood on a cover symbol.

The idea of first learning to control your squad, then learning about your Rogue Trader ship, before heading out in to the universe and fighting space battles and battles on planets against xeno, heretics, chaos and other things is a really cool one and it works really well as a game. 

The expanse element that comes later is a mix of short simple missions you randomly get whilst scanning planets and resource gathering. Or missions involving chaos, elder, pirate or imperial space ships. With a fair number of unexplained events along the way and spacehulks. 

You can build up a picture of the 40k universe from these smaller missions which are closer to the actual 40k than the longer missions have been so far. Truly dark and foreboding. 

The trading and resource games mystify me right now, you might expect it to be easy to understand being a well established element of most games but not this time. It seems to be a way to increase reputation, there is nothing straight forward about it. 

I am looking forward to a Rogue Trader 2 if they ever make one, where they will take this formula even further. 

The game is fun right now and so far I have not found a bug that could not be worked around by reloading a save, adjusting difficulty levels etc. But it is my hope that the devs address all of these over the coming year.",1703072549,1703694738,True,1,0,0.516574561595916748,0,True,False,False

This game is unfinished, buggy, unbalanced, and jumbled. The story is buckling under the weight of trying to connect player choices, contradicting itself throughout the entire campaign, culminating with endings that make sense about 15% of the time. For reference I did an iconoclast pyromancer run and it was the most miserably anemic fire wizard gameplay I've ever seen. Even after I looked up how people build pyromancers it was 90% shooting guns and 10% optional flames. I was annoyed with how little damage throughout the entire game it did and pyromancers are essentially useless because everything they do gets outclassed by just shooting guns.

This game is not worth full price and with another horribly buggy and inconsistent launch from owlcat games I will never buy a game on launch ever again. If you love tactical rpgs I would pass. The ship combat and ground combat are remarkably dull, tedious, and lengthy. Seriously, if they put in a fast forward option or keybind toggle I would've cut about half my playtime off of this game. There is holding space bar, but that is largely inconsistent and requires actively holding down the key the entire time while 25 grunts and their leader all take their turns.

This game's ending slides left such a bitter taste in my mouth, not because they turned out all bad or all good, but because they made no sense, conflicted with each other, and conflicted with the growth of the characters, actions, events throughout the game. Act two and beyond are where the game starts falling apart. This studio keeps releasing games way before they should, turning players into glorified beta testers. I've lost so many saves to crashing during a long fight that I started quicksaving every round to try and mitigate whatever bs was happening, making combat even more tedious.

Encountered quite a number of bugs, some are harmless like visual bug that can be fixed by simply reloading the game, some are almost gamebreaking, like certain enemies kept running into a wall or just refused to end their turn for some reason, and some of these kept repeating even though I already reloaded the save file to a point before the fight even begin.

Act 3 has this huge difficulty spike that forces you to actually learn the mechanics and buffs, or straight up looking up for builds. This can be good for those who actually want to learn but can also act as a filter for those who are impatient.
Act 4 felt like a mess and by the end of heretical path, no one (not even xavier the inquisitor) acknowledges that you have the big bad following you around in your retinue, and he doesn't even get any dialogue or interactions with npcs / party members, he just stands there like an oversized goomba and says nothing. This felt like a massive afterthought by the devs to compensate the cool kids who parted ways with the rogue trader.

Can't say much about the music since I played it with BGM off but the voice acting, while top tier, is too few and far between. Wish they add more of that.
Graphics are servicable, nothing groundbreaking but not that ugly either.
The skill / stat system is quite confusing for newcomers like me so I had to look up a bunch of things but it's still manageable on normal difficulty, if not too easy even for first timers once you have the knowledge of burst fire weapons.

The story, companions. and overall setting and aesthetic that Owlcat has created is amazing. I am fully in love with this game and so excited to continue many playthroughs.

So why am I giving this a negative review? the game starts falling apart starting in act 3 due to bugs. I had two game breaking bugs in act 5 with companion quests that could not be resolved.

I'm honestly very surprised and very disappointed by how jarring the quality shift from Act 1-2 is compared to 3. The first two acts were relatively stable and incredibly fun, filled with a ton of cool and immersive lore, awesome trials and travels through the Koronous and relatively few bugs (aside from the double officer bug that was more fun than annoying). 
Act 3 changed all of that. In the 3-5 hours I've spent in it, I've encountered more bugs that the previous two chapters combined and even doubled. It's ridiculous that the only way I can get through this act is to walk away from Rogue Trader for 6 months to a year in order to let Owlcat fix their own game. If this was an early access game, it'd make sense. However, at full release, and this being their 3rd CRPG, at this point it's completely unacceptable and ridiculous that they think this is okay.",1703644016,1703644016,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While BG3 is tacky, Rogue Trader is a straight forward turn-based RPG.
BG3 has character models that look like Balenciaga by AI trash, while Rogue Trader just has solid and pleasant to look at character art.
In Rogue Trader I can just read satisfying dialogue and I don't have to stare at my character striking stupid faces at the camera every time an NPC gives me a quest hint.
The UI in BG3 is garbage minimalist trash with caveman drawings for icons. The UI in Rogue Trader is satisfying and - while not perfect - is much more ergonomic and skills have proper, legible art for icons.
There is also no multicultural, woke garbage in Rogue Trader. My crew are mostly caucasians, not a hodge podge of race mixed turds who are created to fill diversity quotas instead of being organic characters. 40k is also generally a vastly superior setting than modern D&D. Baldur's Gate is basically just New York City or Los Angeles in a fantasy setting. Who thinks that's appealing whatsoever? 

As far as negatives, there's definitely a bit too much jank. After two similar games made recently, I would have hoped Owlcat could release a game with less bugs and better performance than this. While I run the game fine (bugs not withstanding), a game of this visual level should not need the PC requirements that it does. This is - visually - a game from 2012. Why can't a PC from 2012 run it? 

As is typical of 40k games, you encounter every faction they can think to shoehorn in, but in a Rogue Trader setting, it actually makes some decent sense and doesn't feel too wrong.

The music is a far cry from Darktide tier but it's still above average. It feels good to listen to ambient dark mood music and Gregorian chanting while reading 40k dialogue.

I can not comment on the co-op as I haven't tried it. I'd suspect it to be extra jank.

Overall, I sure wish this game had BG3's production values, for under the jank, it is vastly superior to BG3.",1702239699,1703641682,True,2,2,0.402432471513748169,2,True,False,False

Almost 100 hours in. Acts 1 to 3 are fun and almost bug free, except for quests/rumours in journal not updating and some visual glitches resolved by saving and reloading. 

Act 4 and space exploration as a whole - totally undercoocked. Massive bugs and scripting errors all around the map. Events already done re appearing. Empty dialogue windows showing up. It's a total mess. 

What's worse - Act4 quests for major companions do not start at all, the story quest doesn't start, you run around an empty map with broken scripts. This is a total joke.

Rogue Trader takes its source material very seriously, in what is, in my vast experience -having played every WH:40k PC game- the best rendition of the eponymous setting.
Set around 39.000 years from now, in the far reaches of the Koronus Expanse, in the fringes of the Imperium of Man in the Via Lactea -or Milky Way galaxy- it shows you a “grim dark” reality where there is only war. Humanity is spread in more than one million worlds, across over a hundred thousand light years, ruled by a theocratic fascist State headed by the comatose God-Emperor of Mankind. Our species is besieged by rampant mutation, that threatens the sanctity of form of humanity; the heretics, anyone who stands against the half or blatant lies that pass as the “Imperial Truth”; and the “xenos”, any member of the intelligent alien species, that range from creatures with cultures millions of years old, to relative newcomers. Also, we have to deal with the dangers of the Warp, an alternate dimension used as a corridor by most species to achieve FTL, a hellscape where all the hope, dreams and sensations from every living being coalesce into a biome of “psy” energy that brings info form the “Chaos Gods”, “daemons”, and other denizens of this dark place.
As a Rogue Trader you are the leader of the hereditary trade dynasty of the von Valencius. With almost limitless freedom in an otherwise oppressive society, you are given command of your very own warp-capable “voidship”, that allows you not only the right, but the might to become a true business mogul/de facto sector governor.
Imagine, for a second, a dystopia that takes the worst of books like We, 1984, Fahrenheit, Handmaidens Tale, Foundation, Dune and Starship Troopers. Only this time you are the protagonist and can choose to be something akin to a benevolent dictator. A plasma rifle totting, power armored, psyker dictator. Or maybe you want to roll full dark side with the boys, girls and whatnots from the Immaterium. The choice is yours.
Build your ragtag party of misfits of up to 6 members, ranging from various members from the human factions, such as the Inquisition, Tech-Priests of Mars, Space Marines, Sisters of Battle, Navigators, and some xenos as well.
Delve in a tactical, but fast paced, turn-based squad combat, get also thrown into space-ship to space-ship battles, and also partake in the planetary administration of all under your domain.

I love this game. It really delivers on the feel of the Grimdark of the 40k. It's got some absolutely fantastic story telling, really shining at certain points, but at no point is it weak.

I really enjoy the combat.  My primary character I've been playing is a heretik psyker who I eventually went warrior with, after a few false starts, which is definitely the way to go though at first it may not seem like it. One of my criticisms is that it seems like they didn't go out of there way to create an archetype that really caters to a psyker character; at first glance you think Operative, but nah, that's trash. You want as many extra actions and turns as possible for your main damage dealer and the path there is Warrior to Arch-Militant. Being a monster in combat is fun, and I recommend telepath and later picked up pyro. With two officers to feed turns into him he chews through opponents.

Second character I've been tinkering with is a dogmatic noble officer type, far less fun in combat, but I'm trying to roleplay him as an actual leader of the Empire, and having extra officers makes your other characters more devestating. Especially Cassia. Owlcat, please don't nerf her, she's perfect.

So here's the but. This game, honestly, really, and this is painful to say... is basically not finished.  

At the very best you could say it needs some polish, but yea, that's giving it too much credit. It's got some glitches. As the game progresses I'd say they get more frequent, and is it just me or do the load times start to get longer? There's at least one game breaking situation I got caught by where you can't progress the story to act two if you pick the wrong dialogue option. What's more the reddit boards say the fault was found in beta and they still haven't fixed it in it's released state. For a game I love as much as I do that's quite unfortunate. Anyway that one glitch forced me to replay two hours of content. The more common faults are underlings interrupting you with dialogue then they don't say anything else. I have another broken quest where I'm supposed to talk to Nomos after a Malatek of the Mechanicus shows up and Nomos only presents with one new dialogue option that doesn't progress or complete the quest objective.

Currently I decided to stop playing until they can get a couple more updates out. Like I said my main playthrough is heretik, but the morality system is deeply flawed, with not enough points available to progress your character to where they should be. In act four at Quetza Temer I'm roadbloacked by needing a fanatic level heretik to choose the heretik dialogue option. I'm nearly a hundred points shy of reaching Fanatic and I've chosen heretic options every time I've been presented with them with only two exceptions I can remember. Once when I thought I'd lose a follower and once because I wanted to explore more dialogue options.

Owlcat, if you're out there listening I""m eventually going to come back.  I enjoyed the one playthrough I could stand of Kingmaker, and I LOVE WoTR. I hope you keep making content for this game, I'm definitely going to pick up everything that adds content to Rogue Trader. If I might be so bold to make a request, please, please, please make more heretik content for this game, and fix the content you already have.  I noticed both the upcoming updates will add characters, but your heretic players, and there are more than a couple of us, would love to have more heretic inclined followers. Thanks for the great game, but please get it polished up. I believe in you Owlcat.",1703611979,1703611979,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

*update after playing more*: If you don't like math of crazy complexity in abilities JUST GOOGLE OP BUILDS. If you have some premade builds other people came up with, the game is WAY more enjoyable imo. 

They took a great setting, writing, and characters and decided to hide it all behind a system made up of hundreds of different formulas you have to figure out.

This game has secondary quest breaking bug. Multiple visual and gameplay bug fixable by reloading or opening and closing a menu. Some of the most important bugs were fixed during my playthrought for other I used ToyBox. If you don't like bugs and  don't want to find workaround for them. Give some time to the developer to fix their game.

I find it a shame that a game is released with Quest breaking bugs and the only reason I recommend it is because the Game is good.

I was not familiar with the Warhammer 40K univers, and I liked the setting of this game even if the more dogmastic approach and philosophy take some used to. Note also that text and story wise it is one of the most violent game I have played, as it give you the ability to play as a tyrant. Some choices allows to destroy whole planet and the ""good"" choice in the setting can be to do it.

The other gem of this game is the combat system. At first glance it can remind a bit of xcom with the movement point, cover and one attack that disallow to move after gameplay. However, you can use other buff ability. Because of this it make the fight more interesting than just attacking. The second strong point is that there are no limited ability where you need to rest to reuse them like you find in a dnd or pathfinder based game. Even if the basic of the fighting system is simple the details are complex and the majority of description are complex and based on condition.

Both in-universe and out, a big part of the Rogue Trader mystique is being the only humans in 40k who are the masters of their own destiny (Chaos worshipers might disagree, which greatly amuses their masters).  And yet, in chapters 1-3 I've been the pawn of 5 different people/groups that I know of.  [spoiler]One of whom is a Harlequin, to make it worse.  I [b]know[/b] that if I ever stop going along with his meddling it'll mean siding with Chaos.[/spoiler]  If you were gonna yank the PC around you could've made a game based on DH, or DW, or OW, where that wouldn't undercut one of the game's core fantasies.

Aside from the setting-specific problem, at least for me this also ruined my suspension of disbelief.  A big draw for any open world video game is the ability to go where I want, do what I want.  I know that I will actually be limited to what was programmed in, but a good game will help me forget that.  When someone tells me ""go here and do this"", or blatantly blackmails me, or brags that what I thought was my choice was the result of their manipulation, it makes the invisible walls that narrow my path very visible.

This game is phenomenal, even if a bit bugged at the moment during the last two acts, which happen 60h in your first playthru probably. Most of the bugs i got were cosmetic but i did have one companion storyline spazz out on me and softlock itself. On the bright side, so far Owlcat has been doing rapid fire patches, i don't think most of the ""big"" bugs will stay alive for long.

Pros :
- The Ambiance is superb, it sounds, look and feel just right for a wh40k game.
- Art design is top notch, and while the graphic engine isn't really anything to write home about, it still manage to capture the grand scale of the imperium, or it's horros. The units are really, really nice too, especially bigger bosses, they look great.
- Going in blind, the kind of units, factions and environnements you encounter are really surprising. The game doesn't hesitate to use a boss type only once just for the ""wow"" factor, and the further you go into the game, the crazier it gets. The very last ""room"" in the story, when you know your lore and see... *the thing in the middle of the room*, it's really a ""god dayum is it what i think it is ?!"" moment
- Especially for the act 1 to 3 (4 and 5 being much shorter and a bit more streamlined), the amount of dialogue and action choices you get is really good. Being an old school type RPG, you aren't hand held either, you can fuck up and if you do, well, deal with it, no returns.
- The combat is decently satisfying if you don't mind turn based gameplay, and it feels like pretty much every class can be really ridiculous at higher levels

Cons:
- For now there are a bit of bugs lying around especially during act 4 and 5. Not many bugs impact gameplay but if you're unlucky and anger the owlcode, you might have a secondary quest or two softlock themselves. Given the current patching speed, i have some hope it'll get much better relatively soon, but let's see.
- Performance can be quite rough for absolutely no reason. I do not know if a certain multi phase fight in act IV has a memory leak or something, but i did had to restart my game a few times after dying and retrying for a while.
- Not a ""true con"" per say, but more of a warning, There are no difficulty spikes, but difficulty space lifts instead. Even on normal mode (i am NOT a crpg player usually so i went the ""let's discover this type of game"" route), some bosses just skill issue you pretty hard by killing half your team before you even get to play your first turn and seeing how you do with the remaining heroes. Most boss encounters in Act IV are crazy, and while some just check your spatial awarness (the monster on the balcony fight can be so fricking easy if you pay attention), some just throw some mean hands turn 1.

All in All, It is a fantastic and very unique game when it comes to 40k, and the first time we experience that universe in such a way, definitively worth a try, even with the current ""fresh release jankiness"" let's call it.

Yes its buggy as fuck, the quests are incomplete, some things were not properly play tested.
But still its a better experience than BG3, I think this franchise will be expanded further, there is potential for even genestealer infestations ( much like the swarm-that-walks ), branching paths for Heresy, unlike other 40k games you are not forced into ""the emperah"" gameplay play.

Combat is better than BG3, the only point against is that character builds is somewhat difficult as there are lots of talents and perks that are not properly explained so it makes it difficult for a new player to build a performant synergistic party ( please add search functions to talents )

The trade system is an improvement over the traditional RPG formula of bags of endless gold coins, you pump up reputation with factions and build an economy, its still underdeveloped but its an interesting innovation in the genre.

Naval battles are fun but unremarkable, It would help if you could actually build a fleet instead of investing in a single ship, its not gothic battlefleet armada but it is still a fun addition.

Character development is at odds, the writting is better than BG3, no albino bisexual vampire doing bestiality with bears while weaing female outfits, but there are things that were not playtested or underdeveloped, [spoiler]you can romance the inquisitor being a heretic but he still betrays you because ""teh emperah""[/spoiler], there are also secret companions that are not listed in the marketting material but are also underdeveloped.

That doesn't make sense.

To better illustrate, there's a skill that comes with a lot of  the range weapons that's a burst fire attack that fires multiple shots in a 3 by infinite line. See the problem? So, the enemies are just moving further away and just spamming this and rolling the die hoping to hit. There's no tactics involved with that, and when their is no line of sight and they're still hitting? Yeah, no.

Alright... Updating. Ran into a bug that literally takes choices back to act 2 (despite them being correctly made as far as progression) and it's killing off party members... What in the shoot-dang. 
As far as novel story telling, fun... I love 40K fluff. 
Game's choices in implementing consequences or actions... Well, as the saying goes... Never trust a fart.

That said, as much as I've enjoyed the environment and fluff provisions, I gotta let this one cook for a bit. Hope for fixes or a player coming along and giving a more clear understanding on my 'WTF'. Given my grief with my own situations it caused me to read into beta & post-beta discussions and that's all I'm going to say about that.

Update on top of previous update... 

So, I took some time to reload and get to the same point and carried forward with some interactions that I wasn't expecting and they panned out to the same point I was already at... I was confused. 
That said from that same point I then reloaded where I thought I borked things up... Same issue, what was going on, so I progressed the story and all is well. I think.

The major flaw for me is the soundscape, which it is utterly flat, i feel like i am playing never-winter nights or BG 1, the lack of voice especially for a 40k game is below sub-par , I don't mind a bit of reading presented in a decent fashion , but the almost log based way it is done in RT, i find cold and detached.

After recent titles like DOS2 or BG3 , your companions never really spark to life in anyway and i feel like i am flung back 20 years ago because of it , the text based dialogue never really lands any feeling  or even anticipation of what comes next.

Combat is another area which needs attention , large Mobs usually end up killing more of their own then you do .

The Customisation is good , the game size is good , the dmg system is good, The ship combat is good, the trading is good, building your own little empire is great, the graphics are decent , the UI is fine once you learn it's ways but the soundscape and lack of voice are below poor for a title of this price and in this day.

4.5/10  not a recommend , honestly only if  it is on sale  for less than double figures.


EDIT.

1. This Game has a lot of bugs, to many to list .
2. They obviously rushed it, act 3 onward it is Bizarre , not enough to fill out the map, time to finish so lets put tropes and rush it.
3. Act 3 is by far the worse Act of any game i have ever played ,  I could write a Theseus why, but it is so bad , i wont waste my time explaining it.
4. Owlcat are now on my dodge all titles list.
5. Act 1 and 2 is the game you were told you where buying, Act 3 is Hersey and requires an inquisitor visit Owlcat , Acts 4 and 5 are bugged and mere shallow shadows of Acts 1 and 2.",1702340391,1703570675,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Is it Baldur's Gate 3 level? No. And honestly it doesn't have to be. It's fantastic on its own merits. The companions are awesome and VERY well done (Looking at you Argenta). While I haven't gotten as far as I would like as of yet (Hey its hard to game with two kids), I can tell already that there is something special here. While some places it's very linear other areas I've found a great degree of freedom in exploring. 
Now for the bad. There are some bugs, nothing game breaking but there are minor glitches such as some items not showing up after you've picked them up in your inventory. Or other times saving over a save game just brings up a pic of your last save instead. But like I said: minor.

[b][u]EDIT[/u] AFTER FINISHING THE GAME:[/b]
I had a blast with the whole story and enjoyed finishing the game alot. Unfortunately alot of the side content / companion quest are currently bugged and despite doing every single thing i could find i ended up barely finishing any of them. Literally all companion quests except Idira / Pasqal broke on me - which is a huge bummer after getting so invested into the game. Apart from that i had zero issues following the main story/questline, everything worked. 
I would still recommend the game if you are a fan of the Warhammer 40k Universe. The game has issues, but overall i would even up my score to a 9.0 if the quest bugs wouldn't have happened. 

If you are uncertain, maybe wait a couple of months until more patches have rolled out and the majority of the quest bugs are fixed. :)

[b][u]Positives:[/u][/b]

- Fitting and beautiful art direction. 
- [b]DEEP LORE[/b] content
- Great and Unique Characters as companions
- Easy to Play (combat, exploration, mechanics)
-- (Context: It is a lot more streamlined than the previous Pathfinder games. Thank god! No need to watch hours of tutorials and use character guides - just pick recommended traits/talents, read through them, pick whatever sounds fitting to your current skills and playstyle.. and thats it. normal difficulty shouldnt be an issue. Additionally the game (so far) is way less bloated with stats, buffs, debuffs, spells in general etc like the Pathfinder titels were. Which was a huge turnoff for me to continue playing them, so i really really appreciated this change)
- [b]MANY settings to adjust DIFFICULTY[/b] change the settings to whatever you feel comfortable with for your first playthrough! :)
- the little voice acting we get is great - would love if they could expand on this in the future.
- Good Graphics / Effects for a CRPG (loving the gore/dismemberment! Very Grimdark!:))
- Decent Exploration (there are hidden things to find in almost all levels)
- Interesting Itemization 
- Multiple playthroughs with different outcomes for choices possible(!)
-- (Context: You are offered three lifepaths to follow during your playthrough. Dogmatic, Iconoclast and Heretical. Dogmatic for example being the choices closely relating to the pious, rightouse, loyal follower of the Emperor of Mankind, and Iconoclast are choices that more so focus on the general people and their safebeing. Following these lifepaths awards you with certain abilities (that you can check ingame before hand if that would influence your decision), obviously shapes your character in the ingame setting and unlocks the ability to utilize certain items. Some powerful items in the game are lifepath locked!)
- [b]FUN turn-based Combat[/b], that utilizes mechanics of games such as XCOM (for me personally this is a HUGE upgrade to the real-time combat thing they had going on in the previous games. This feels way more controllable and overall fun:))
- [b]Overall good performance !!![/b] (CoreSpecs: Ryzen7 78003XD, Zotac RTX 3060 12gb - Highest Settings, 90-100 FPS, no crashes yet (longest session ~8h of gameplay))

[b][u]Negatives:[/u][/b]

- [b]ALOT OF READING[/b] (In comparison to Baldurs Gate 3: A dialogue that lasted a couple minutes in BG3 with reading/listening to the voicelines etc, is VAGUELY speaking double or tripple the time in this game. There is ALOT to learn about everything in this game and sometimes you can spend like 8-10minutes just reading what a new character you meet has to offer as information on various topics. To an extend this is optional tho, you can skip just skip through things if they dont interest you. (which is the least you should do, so that your character has all the knowledge, might be necessary for other conversations or so)
- not a lot of voice acting :/ (i would guess around ~20% of the game so far has been voice acted, if i consider every single dialogue i encountered)
- old engine(?) 
-- same old character models / animations whatnot that the previous Pathfinder Games had, which does look  ""lifeless"" at times. (I don't care personally, im here for the story/experience, but this could be a deciding factor for many)
- [b]some Bugs[/b] --- to be fair to the game, i have encountered one [u]singular[/u] bug. and unfortunately it is combat related/getting stuck on a character. which blocks the end of the turn, essentially locking a character in trying to do an animation. Funnily enough, submitting a Bug Report (button top right corner) forces a refresh(?) on the game after sending it and resolves the bug.
- [b]hard to get into, if you aren't an established fan of the Grimdark Universe ![/b] (they tell you ALOT about the world in dialogues, so i'm confident just by playing the game you will end up knowing a huge amount of Lore of the Warhammer 40k Universe BUT it might be overwhelming and therefore easier to play if you already feel familiar with all the factions and such.)

Thats all i can think of of the top of my head. 
I hope this helps some people or friends of mine if it [i]could[/i] be a game for them. I definitely recommend watching a Stream of the game for 30-60minutes just to get a glimpse at the general gameplay to decide if that seems fun to you. Reviews that highlights on the systems/characters/lore etc.etc. might be misleading. If you dont enjoy the general gameplay, all of those things won't save the game for you :)
also it is to be highlighted, that this is the most bugfree/smooth release of Owlcat Games so far! And if the continuous support of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (literally got a new DLC recently + frequent updates) is a benchmark for what to expect for this game, then the updates we will receive over the course of the next 2-3 years definitely warrant the full-price title!

1-LOADING SCREENS LOADING SCREENS LOADING SCREENS. you might not feel it at first, but I have a very fast high end SSD, 8k speed ram 14k intel cpu and the game does not instant load.
The developers could have made many zones, like every zone in the ship, loadingscreenless.
2-Is this on the newest unreal engine? because I could have swore at some moments I was getting bad lag, jitters, and oh, more loading screens? wait the game forces you to load screen into an area that you need to load screen OUT of this area(like captains quarters) and it does this very frequently?
3-Rolls values are garbage, many times at a 95% chance I have instead of hitting an enemy, veered off to hit an ally. SAVE AFTER EVERYROLL IF YOU WANT TO MIN/MAX.
(side note, i'm ok with some bad rolls, but holy shit is the game based on PURE luck, even down to engagements where anyone can go first)
4-Initiative means nothing. you can save before a fight and infinitely reload until you get the characters on your team to start the battle first. Sometimes an enemy or groups of enemys starting first in a fight means the difference between literally winning or not. prepare to waste your time with more loading screens.
5-because of everything stated above, RTS skill means very little, infact with enough bad luck your skill means absolutely nothing, game is a roll for luck to win, waste your time with loading screens.
6-I had to take a break from playing the game because I clicked an area next to a console and my character not only went the opposite way, but also put himself in danger of immediate death and doomed my entire encounter to a loss. because the game is RNG, I should have saved before I moved, obviously. what good game have I ever felt the need to constantly save, to combat really bad RNG? I cant remember the last good game to make me feel like I had to save before every single thought crosses my mind.

TLDR-Ending with the good;
Its like playing every other rts, xcom, divinity original sin, baldurs gate, pillars of eternity etc
Its not all just turn based with classes, there is also a turn based ship battle
You can upgrade your ship as much as you can your own gear
Leveling is not reduced to just 12, classes and abilities have much to choose from.
Story is not so bad, but its difficult to fuck up a warhammer story as you have so much to choose from
You don't have to buy it for $50, you can wait for a 50% off steam sale and buy it for what its actually worth.

I don't have much experience with games from Owlcat, but apparently this is pretty par for the course. And it's a pretty low par, in terms of bugs. Very low. Like maybe the lowest par I've ever seen in a video game that functions. Everything from broken quests, bugged items, to giving the lady navigator a Habsburg jaw if you equip her with a two-handed gun, to your voidship doing the cha-cha slide instead of turning during combat, to a space marine that dashes directly away from combat when his social anxiety acts up, to an Aeldari weapon that cannot be use unless you are an Aeldari that doesn't know how to use Aeldari equipment. A lot of the bugs are kind of hilarious (I'd go so far as to say they're surprisingly realistic in regards to giving your noble mutant navigator a Habsburg jaw), others are a little more frustrating.

Bad:
- Bugs.  There are a lot but none were game breaking for me. Devs seem to be active in squashing but you may be more annoyed by this than me. 
- Too many levels.  I got up to level 50+ and by that point I felt more along the lines of ""Ugh, I have to deal with this now"" more  than ""Yay, I get to make my characters stronger"".  This is compounded by not generally feeling like most levels were meaningfully changing my playstyle.
- It felt like there were ""right"" answers in how to fight which lead me to just doing the same things every round.  It got boring clicking the 3-4 skills for each character each turn.
- For trying seemingly leaning in to exploring there, IMO, is an issue around penalizing you for doing so in that you would get random encounters.  These were not generally hard (I could usually win them without the enemies ever getting a turn) but they were tedious.  For that reason I don't think I explored as much as I otherwise would have.
- The economic system is weird in that the best rifle in the game has roughly the same value as the worst.  Wish there was more gradiant.
- AI - They ALWAYS seem to want to do a spray and prey attack that tends to hurt their allies more than their enemies.  Generally if I had ""allies"" in combat they would do more harm than good.

Good
- I liked the Warhammer 40k grimdark setting and I thought it was well done.
- Good story (IMO)
- I liked the reputation/PF system... kinda.  Liked the novelty at least.

It's quite a bit less open world and more direct to the mission combat than Kingmaker or Wrath of the Righteous, nowhere near as DEEP.  But it serves just enough story to get your butt into the next battle and keep your blood pumping.  Trading is a little muted, as are extra weapons and such.  You mostly rely on your class and build abilities and your tactics than any uber game changing gear.  Kind of like if Pathfinder maxxed out at +2.  I am about 20 hours and 12 levels into it, and note that there are three dialogue paths between dogmatic, iconoclastic and heretical.  As far as how the missions and areas change according to this, I shall have to f around and find out.  Right now I am playing Mr Bean as an artillery-heavy gunner, basiclally the same build as Argenta.  I don't feel too bad about it, because two gunners are better than one, and unlike pathfinder, you don't feel totally unbalanced not having a certain type.  Ypou have their class and archetype, so a psyker that explodes heads and add that to an operative that studies weaknesses.  Or maybe a warrior good at melee mixed with a navy man who is good at taking hits.  Or switch that navy to a rogue type who does better damage on the flank.  You get one or two options every level.  It's kind of like stats, skills or feats in D&D, but the ""feats"" work a little more directly for the things you do on the board vs building a huge web of stats and boons.  There is very little pre-buffing.  Your buffs will usually cost an action point in the turn, so you dive into it on the fly.  The X-Com facto comes in when you totally should hit something and miss 3x in a row.  So far I am 20 hours in, my only real gripe is I want more xeno and space monsters to fight.  It's kind of like this game is still in its 1st stage barebones portion, similar to Dawn of War I, where we mostly have Space Marines vs Space Marines that have angrier voices and happen to be heretics.  Maybe saw two warp daemons that made our party poop their pants though, took a few rounds to bring down.

Overall, I consider this the best Warhammer game since Dawn of War.  Very good mythos, true to the setting. I really want it to do well so that DLCs will see them adding more Xenos and possibly even Xenos-centric campaigns.  I would absolutely LOVE a Waaagh version of this game with it's own insane campaign.  I got the game for 50 and I am very pleased with the value.

+The combat:

- Very satisfying with a appropriate builds. Main focus of the combat: [b] You must always have the Sister of Battle in your party at all time [/b]. Spec her for Arch-Milatant and lean heavy into Bolter Burst Mode. Give her your highest fire rate Bolter and with the correct team comp she can mow the entire encounter in turn 1. You would say that sound boring, but I would counter with how Owlcat balance difficulty and enemies per encounters and how much HP to kill 1 enemy.

- Owlcat difficulty return with a vengeance. Expect your tank in early game to be insta kill in 2 turns if the encounter favor the enemies turn order. Mid game the same and End game they may even die faster. Which is normal since tank are there to let Argenta to ramp up anyway. Encounter either have to end in turn 2 or expect an already hard to turn worse.

- Enemies per encounter always expect you be getting a 3V1 with you in the minority.

- Effective HP. I add effective since what you see on the mob HP is not that simple. This game use % armor = % dmg reduction, dodge nullify dmg and defection -dmg on direct hit which effect crit dmg. 200 HP enemies have average of 30% armor and some 30% of dodge for normal mob. If you can't strip defenses expect to grind through a trash mob like he's a raid boss.

- Bosses are true vision of horror which while not much different from trash mobs that always accompany them, they have the distinct honor of having the power of extra turns. Expect your entire party to wipe in round 1 when you meet a boss.

+ The 'Grandmap':

-Warp travel is cool and exciting for the first several encounters but then begin blending into the same. The fact that your can't get the resource to make Warp Travel have reduce chance to spawn combat encounter beside a very rare event is a criminal over oversight. You can auto resolve it but the fact that the resources you use to auto resolve is also the resources you use to gain favor for your shop is a criminally short sighted decision. You can do these encounter manually but it get boring real quick after 3 jump. They should have made it a supply meter where it get reduce per auto resolve but get refresh everytime you return to your colonies.

- The SHOP. Who ever decided on how much Rep it take make rank all 5 expect you to be mono focus on 1 shop and nothing else. In the end of chapter 4 I barely manage to get all 5 to 1/2 their max rank. This was after finished all possible companion quest and side quests. I fully support getting the Mod Bag of Tricks so you can just skip the hours you would need to farm warp encounter to get enough loot to trade for all max rank. This system is flaw from the start they should have just make it so you can buy anything as long as you have the Money. I legit got to a point that I have x3 the Money to buy the Item but don't have the rep resource to unlock the rank up.

- The Colony management: Nothing to talk about standard bare bone just to be there to develop your character and gameplay on the side. If you want to pump a stat pump Security it make it so a lot of bad stuff can be leverage to be positive.

- The ship combat: It's there to break up the normal ground combat.

+ The small encounters (Planets, Warp events):

- Planet side eh, almost nothing is there it feel like. The universe is somehow less interesting then Kingmaker and Wrath map. Some dungeon here and there with some neat text adventure but that about that.

- Warp Event CONSTANT PURGING of the lower deck with the abundance of deamon possessions. They lean very heavily on Warp event since it's the largest part of the game you gonna interact with via constant judicious attack with deamons and possessed. Now while that's the good old bandit encounter at least those bandit have the decency to drop their gear so I can go and sell. Deamon have less decency then bandit since they drop no loot so manually doing them give nothing beside a small amount of exp.

+ Conclusion: A flaw game but can be polish and will be polish since they did stick out with their game still the end like Pathfinder and Wrath.

Thank to the people over CohhCarnage who made this and now shall share it will you so you can play on Hard and not immediately destroy when you get to the end game.

And it's been forever marred by the fact that the game has shipped to fans woefully unfinished and broken. 

The solid parts of the games in early acts give a complex, interesting, and well paced CRPG with plenty of well-thought story lines to follow, quests to do, companions to meet, and areas to explore. The core is extremely solid. The story and writing stay top quality even in the parts of the game that shipped incomplete meaning that this game WILL be good with enough TLC from the devs (but that's no excuse for shipping it in such a broken state).

After Act 3, the game becomes nearly unplayable and the systems of the game are broken beyond repair:

- The Reputation system was broken and gave very little wiggle room in Acts 1 and 2 but was still functional. There were a ton of ranks that I couldn't mathematically get to (and I explored the entire galaxy and did all quests) so was under the impression these would be available upon my return. Yes and No, all the items I didn't get were still there along with new quests to get tradeable loot but each faction had more than 10 new ranks added and almost nothing in the way of ability to raise your reputations beyond the slow process of delivering goodies. This means that there were dozens upon dozens of interesting items in these shops I had no ability to try out or even work towards because there is not enough pixilated corpse starch or hyperweave to give to these factions.  Some of the items descriptions were clearly broken and just said [draft] in the ability description, we're beta testing the devs new toys in a full release.

- Those aforementioned items? The ones you get from playing the game? The ones you grind for? Several of them straight up don't work or don't do what they say they'll do. I found so many items that just straight up broke or didn't do anything and that's just the ones I could figure out. Honestly, my other problem is that there's so few calculations done that the only time you can see even SOMEWHAT accurate numbers for your stats is during combat. It's otherwise impossible to, y'know, BUILD YOUR BUILDS when items just straight up don't work.

- Quests are broken in several places to the point where guides are mentioning that you just might not be able to complete it based on a bug. I had several quests sit in my quest log or had to skip entire steps because one of the outcomes led to a bug that locked the game permanently. 

-Visual bugs are constant, the biggest I had is that character models and environments vibrate constantly like someone took a hitachi to my monitor. The rogue trader turning around on his throne is funny because he always moves and I could never guess what stupid way the model was gonna turn this time. The game constantly turned areas pitch black so I couldn't see them. My rogue trader kept turning invisible in Act 4 after conversations and requipping his clothes only showed his armor.

- Gameplay bugs also suck. Enemies will just randomly stand still for 90 seconds and then skip their turns, torpedos won't go off as they target an enemy ship, boss abilities won't register properly making the fights artificially 10 times harder. (I had to reload several end bosses because they're set up in such a way that no matter how tanky you build your party, you either survive the first round by luck or you don't. Positioning matters little)

I love LOVE this game. Which is why it gets a thumbs up. I don't want to tank the score here as I feel might happen once people get past the most polished parts of the game but sincerely the devs better get their ass in gear and fix the portion of this game that's a broken mess and several systems so that they allow for more player freedom and experimentation. Otherwise? This review will become negative very soon and a game I love will go down as the game I once loved.

____Summary____
Technical: Chapter 1-2 was a great experience. Chapter 3 was OK. Chapter 4 broken (and didn't want to spend more than an hour or two trying to fix it). Had to stop playing this game at chapter 4 - the amount of bugs where insurmountable (The bugs literally prevented me from progressing  and I could not get the mods to fix it working). 
The space combat is quite simple but I also found it quite enjoyable. Decisions matter a lot and cannon salvos hit hard. 

____Gameplay____
The gameplay and core loop is what is to be expected from a TTRPG. Its basically a more complex and detailed Baldurs Gate 2 in the Warhammer 40k universe. The amount of skills and abilities as well as skill/ability interactions/combinations is a bit too high imo. but not really an issue as you can adjust the difficulty to match your playstyle. 

____Story and quests____
I enjoyed the story - strong 40k flavor being flexible enough to suit any playstyle. If you like epic fantasy and sci-fi you will probably enjoy the story. Story/gameplay integrations becomes weaker after the first 2 chapters. Quest design starts to become very unintuitive in chapter 4.",1703283573,1703524963,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]This game is better:[/h3]

[olist]
  [*] [b]Smart Choices[/b]: In Baldur's Gate 3, most of the choices boil down to ""do you want to be a good guy?"", or ""do you want be a disney villain"". Picking the latter would reward you with having a lot of missing content. Here, the choices are much more nuanced and complicated to make, which usually boils down to a choice between freedom, goodness, or power.
  [*] [b]Choice Payoff[/b]: You will actually feel that choices you make throughout the game mattered, especially with regards to your companions. As opposed to in Baldur's Gate 3 where all your past choices did not matter, only the final choice matters. The epilogue is also very good, with some slides only appearing when two companions reach a certain ending.
  [*] [b]Party Size[/b]: Party of 6 feels a lot nicer than Baldur's Gate party of 4.
[/olist]

[h3]Your Mileage May Vary:[/h3]

[olist]
  [*] [b]Much darker world[/b]: Baldur's gate 3 feels goofy at some points in the game, which sometimes ruins immersion. This game's tone is way more serious throughout the game.
  [*] [b]Complex character building[/b]: There are a lot of skills to choose for when leveling up, and there are lots, lots, and LOTS of unique weapons and armors...
[/olist]

[h3]This game is worse:[/h3]

[olist]
  [*] [b]Bugs[/b]: The biggest negative of this game. This happens much more often in Arc 4 and 5. Hopefully the studio will fix them.
  [*] [b]Story Continuation[/b]: Unlike Baldur's Gate 3 whose story is interweaved together throughout your play, this game's story feels very disjointed from arc to arc. The final fight, for example, feels like it comes from nowhere.
  [*] [b]Budget[/b]: This game's budget is clearly not as high as Baldur's Gate 3, e.g., very limited voice acting, somewhat worse graphics, etc.

The fact that this game is comparable to Baldur's Gate 3 means it's definitely a good game in my opinion. Mayhaps the game will be even better after these bugs are fixed.",1702065493,1703524660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- A solid story, at least until chapter 3. 
- A solid alteration of the Rogue Trader TTRPG system that manages to capture much the same feeling whilst shedding some of its clunkiest parts. 
- Fun combats that are well balanced, until the start of Chapter 4. 
- Perhaps the most lore accurate representation of the 40k universe I've ever seen in a game, a real delight for the old hands and the new out there who want to sink their teeth into something substantial. In fact, the attention to such things almost made me recommend the game. Almost. 

Now we must list the bad points. 
I can't actually give you a review of the full game, because on two separate runs I've been stymied by bugs at the start of or during Chapter 4. However, with almost 150 hours in the game I think I can offer something in regards to an opinion on its quality. 
- The combat, which was previously very well thought through and engaging appears to have been taken from whatever skilled hand was working on it and instead given to a monkey with a degree in Faffing About. Combats swing from trivial and utterly unmemorable to nut-flatteningly hard seemingly at random.  
- The story. It picks up the pace and starts becoming genuinely interesting and then Chapter 3 happens at you, and all that momentum falls out of a window, tragically breaking its neck and dying. After Chapter 3 has finished happening at you, you're thrown right back into it. With absolutely 0 momentum behind you, and all the driving force of an angry Sunday motorist. 
- The bugs. Emperor offer my soul salvation! The bugs! From maps lacking the ability to leave them, to quests not completing or simply duplicating. I've helped one companion get her damned papers signed three times in a row, and then I helped her find her gang. And then she left to save her gang. Then asked me to help her with her damned paperwork. I think she may be an agent of Tzeentch. Or Slaanesh, no one can enjoy the pain of that much pencil pushing drudgery but the deranged chosen of the Prince of Pleasure. 
- The quantity and quality of content also falls off very hard after Chapter 3. The cynical amongst you may believe this is because its an attempt to front load the game and make it appealing at first glance. I believe the team was abducted from their offices after completing Chapter 3 and only managed to return with a bare week before the game was released and worked their hands bloody in service to the God Emperor to give us what they could. Because if it is that first thing I'd feel like a bit of idiot as I've bought the game for friends too. Luckily though, as a devout follower of the God Emperor I can't ever be wrong. 

To conclude then: 
The game is Very Good, until it becomes Not Very Good. In the future, I hope the updates and patches that Owlcat is putting out with some solid regularity already make me recommend the game. However, given the state of the last half of the game, I can't in good conscience. It is, however, a very enjoyable game in the main. If it were not for the never ending parade of techna-nurglings in the worky-gubbins I'd recommend it without a second thought.",1703519415,1703519415,False,984,70,0.923605799674987793,28,True,False,False

However, from act 3, the game starts falling apart in all areas: battle balance, progression, companions, dialogs, choice reactivity, story, colony management, and on top of that, there are lots of bugs.
I don't even want to start on some design decisions, sometimes it feels like the devs hate the player.

This game probably needed a bit longer in the oven to bake out those critical, late-game breaking bugs, to be honest...but it still gets a recommend.

PROS
- A Faithful Warhammer 40K story and setting, that is deeply immersive and choice receptive.
- Interesting and diverse range of companions and notable characters to meet and blow up.
- Fun, methodical and messy ground combat! You feel like the character you play.
- Lots of quests to do! Game lacks little for narrative content and has many interesting side quests and well written companion moments.

CONS
- Currently many (some game breaking) bugs in the late game that shatter immersion and lock off story content - many of which can only be corrected with the Toybox mod...sadly.
- Ship combat is poorly designed and slows the pace of the game down enough to be somewhat bothersome.
- The world/warp map could have been designed better in terms of navigation and random event triggers.
- Dialogue and some text based rewards are broken in unexpected places and times.
- WAY too many load screens - would be fine if not for the slow load times.
- Minor visual bugs that illustrate a lack of polish, such as glitched character models and random T-poses.
- Not all of the backers were properly credited at launch.

OVERALL
- Despite the glaring cons, It certainly IS worth it IF your a 40K fan. The story and setting will capture your attention and the freedom of choice will keep you invested for many hours - as it has me. But the large number of bugs will eventually wear you down and break your immersion at times. The fact you currently need a mod just to advance some quests or even access them at all...is very disappointing for a full release game.

But the developers are currently hard at work addressing and fixing many of these issues, the worst of which are quickly being looked at - so possibly very soon this may be a non-issue :) Considering the game has not long been out this is a good sign, but it should never have been the case in the first place.

Despite initial bug fixes, the scope of features to be reworked is staggering.

The good: 
Aesthetics, lore accuracy, first 50% of story and writing, translation of pen-and-paper ruleset, graphics and sound design, mix of RPG and management mechanics are really great, fantastic even, and constitute to Rogue Trader having the [i]potential[/i] of being the best W40k game I've seen.

[h3]The rest can be summed up as ""Owlcat release"" - and the worst so far at that. [/h3]

The bad: 
Multitude of ""questionable"" design choices, e.g. having to pay a limited resource for character respecc, inability to completely respecc companions, balancing occasionally completely off, unique companion abilities range from must-have to utterly useless, a [u]lot[/u] of loading screens

The ugly: 
[b]It's a broken mess mechanically[/b]

That said, with the amount of bugs, softlocks, and broken quests currently in the game, I can not in any way recommend this game for purchase until substantial patches and/or a steep discount have been made.

If you want to play exclusively acts 1 and 2, you can enjoy a relatively bug free experience, with only 10-20 reloads due to broken audio or characters running in place eternally at the end of their turn, thus preventing the combat turns from progressing.

In Act 3, the bugs begin to accumulate in horrifically obvious ways, with many quest or follower recruitment options not triggering when they are supposed to. Other dialogue options will result in black boxes of death possessing the majority of the screen. The absolute worst part of all of this is that the end of Act 3 is 100% inaccessible due to a bug. The elevator will not work, and even with an hour fiddling with the ToyBox mod, could not progress.

So now I have a game with 50+ hours that is unplayable unless I want to either start a completely new save, reload previous saves to try every possible variation of the steps leading to the softlock, or wait days to weeks for the game to actually be in a playable state.

This will become a hallmark example of a game with massive potential, an at it's core greatly enjoyable experience, that is completely shackled by the choice to release this game in a broken, unenjoyable state that will forever weigh down it's reputation.",1703508166,1703508166,False,4,0,0.501845002174377441,0,True,False,False

There are some weak links, like characters in the game using words and metaphors that aren't appropriate for the universe, but hey, I can let that slide.  It's not that big of a fragging deal.  

What really makes me not recommend this is the fact that it is pretty clearly unfinished at this point in time.  You hit Chapter 3 and things break.  I have no quests telling me where to go or what to do in my log, have explored everywhere it's possible for me to explore, talked to everyone I could think of trying to advance the story, and I have come to a conclusion -- my savegame is bricked.  Without mods, I don't think I can advance.

Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous pulled some similar shenanigans, and I just have to say, I don't think I trust Owlcat to release a finished game at this point.   I don't know if it's Unity being a pain in the ass to work with or their ambition being larger than their available working hours or what, but I'm not happy to have again paid for an incomplete mess of a game.  

What you'll find right now is a bunch of likable characters, some interesting plot threads, and some fun tactical gameplay (that doesn't really scale all that well and has a lack of gear diversity to support different builds) but it's a facade.  

I don't mind that you've sold me an early access title, Owlcat.  I just wish you'd said outright that's what it was.

The bones of a very fun and enjoyable 40K game are there, and I've had my fun so I recommend the game to people who like the 40K universe, but overall there are many systems that are either very poorly implemented or were clearly scrapped or curtailed prior to release. This combined with some Bethesda style bugs creates an experience where you really lose out on some of the fun of the game trying to do things like navigate archaic and unnecessary skill lists (there are no clear skill progression trees), deal with an entire chapter (10 hours) of the game where it is borderline impossible to heal your party so every fight gets progressively harder but not more fun, or spending several days IRL doing every side quest possible hoping they will patch a main quest characters dialogue so you can progress without losing a follower.

On top of this the big boss fights are less of fun, mechanically interesting fights, and more 15-30 minute slog fests watching everyone use the same ability again and again while you try to chunk through bullet sponge bosses and deal with having 6 stacks of unremovable debuffs on you from earlier in the dungeon.

Levelling is convoluted, unfulfilling and annoying, basically a big long list of half page skill descriptions like ""while wearing a pink tutu behind cover, if you recently flapped your arms there is a 10% chance your shoe size will grow by the square root of one squared all over one...... But when you dig into what actually happens ""+1 damage to your range weapons vs spider monkeys""...... In a game where mid game bosses push nearly 1000 hp! Most skills either suck or don't work. Pathfinder flashbacks, 500000 options with only 4 workable builds past cheese difficulty. 

Too many traps on maps and too much garbage you need to pickup. per map you spend what feels like lifetimes traversing every nook and cranny for a bunch of garbage. Ooooh a secret room with 4 boxes garbage, garbage, garbage.....garbage. Ooooof how exciting. Oh yeah and don't forget to disarm that trap every two steps cus that be gameplay yall.   

Enemy damage is the same as yours. This wouldn't be a problem if the enemy hp was the same but a homeless guy in act 4 has 130 more hp and stats than your space marine. You at about level 40 maybe 100 hp, bosses beyond act two will one shot half your crew with a single pistol shot with a base damage of 3-7. 60-100 damage per pistol shot FOR THEM. You on the other hand with a maxed out pistol build will do 4-11 per shot to his 1560 hp with a 95% hit chance......to hit one of your own guys. Diabolical. 

The AI is literally insane, sometimes a battle starts and before you get to fight the enemy, the enemy has managed to burst shot kill 80% of his own guys trying to shoot you from 6 screens away. Fun right? Not really because the AI controlled allies backing you up also burst shot your crew down to your last guy. Usually a buff/healer armed with a tea spoon. Now you have a healer with 2 hp vs 2 snipers you have to run across 6 screens and melee with a spoon.

Conclusion - The skill trees are simple but so convoluted they are difficult to navigate. Descriptions of said skills rarely do what they claim (buggy af). Combat is a buggy mess from AI to dumb combat scenarios. Too much map filler like garbage pick ups and traps. Inventory is an absolute nightmare mess of garbage you CAN use but probably won't. Trade system is diabolical, free random garbage every now and then after giving away all your garbage pickups. You cannot as a rouge trader order weapons, someone who literally owns a f----- forge world cannot demand 6 bolters and 6 power armours.

At least then I could point to the sign and say ""There's a Disclaimer, there will be bugs, you paid for it."" But they didn't. Riding off of the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3, Owl Cat is selling Rogue Trader as a completed project. Nevermind the buggy and missing tooltips, nevermind that some of the buffs have placeholder icons, nevermind that the game will not tell you what you're doing until it's happening... This is being sold as the [b]FINISHED PRODUCT.[/b] So let me say this:

There was, until a few days ago, a gamebreaking bug that would make you unable to play the game into Act 4. There are other persistent and pestilent bugs like the crew continually being unassigned from their posts on the ship (making upgrading people's skills incredibly difficult because they stop doing their jobs) Conversations are also going to be flatter than BG3... which isn't a major issue, just don't go in expecting motion-captured scenes with intricately detailed models.

Those complaints aside, the base game itself is honestly the funnest cRPG I have played. I mostly say that as a fan of the Action Point Economy over the simpler Action Economy of something like Baldur's Gate or their prior Pathfinder titles. Being able to do more than two things in a turn is just far more enjoyable. The characters, while cliche, do brighten up the experience, and on all but the absolute lowest difficulty, there is a genuine pride when you fit the pieces of the combat puzzles together and make something that works really well. Above all else, Rogue Trader does not fall into the obnoxious [b]""WAR EVERYWHERE, WAR ALL THE TIME, FOR THE EMPEROOOOOR!!!""[/b] trope that most Warhammer games are, but is intent on actually exploring the setting. This is the most Genuine Warhammer game you will find, and while their choice of Astartes are... Lacking Imagination... the game will otherwise give you what you want out of a TTRPG: A complex, interwoven story that will have actual consequences for anyone who thinks it's funny to just run around zapping everyone and not properly respecting and engaging it's setting.

I [b]WANT[/b] to give this game a thumbs up, because at it's core, it has significantly better combat than Baldur's Gate 3 (Unless you're a Barrelmancer, or one of those kinds of people that file in your party to sneak attack one by one) However, it's still buggy as hell, and until they put out all of the fires a year from now, I have to give this game a negative review because it did something that Baldur's Gate 3 did not: It ran on the train before it was done preparing, and now it's here, with mismatched socks, some boxerbriefs, a dirty shirt and the obvious smell of alcohol.

In the interest of being fair I will start with what I liked, which is quite a lot. The writing is very strong. I've read some posts that heretical playthroughs stretch credulity quite a bit, but on my iconoclast route I felt like I was immersed in the Grim Darkness of Warhammer 40k, making hard decisions and trying to be good in a galaxy that sought to break such Ideals. Few stories have been able to make me feel a betrayal as hard as I did in this game which speaks to just how invested I was in the story. The combat is mostly pretty fun (though it has issues that I will get into later) and you have a lot of options of how to build your characters. 
So having said this why don't I recommend it? Well, unfortunately this game suffers from the same issues that WoTR did. Bugs abound leading to broken quests, unequipable gear and at time of writing, I cannot continue with the main quest due to a bug. And from what people are saying on forums, it sounds like acts 4 and 5 are barely playable due to the technical problems.
The combat I said was fun, but it suffers from a persistent bug in displaying damage ranges. Frequently you will find your attacks hitting for far less than the minimum projected, or sometimes no ranges will be displayed at all. Also like WOTR the combat suffers from balancing issues. Sometimes, there will be fights that will be entirely undefeatable because your characters aren't built right. This would be fine on high difficulties, but on normal this feels pretty lame. 
Also as an aside the romance options are pretty limited especially based on your sexuality. (If you're a gay man all you have is Marazhai which might just be worse than nothing.)
So in the end it seems the game was rushed to market by a bunch of executives months before it was ready just like OwlCat's last release. So will the game be worth buying eventually? Probably. WoTR downright works nowadays. Thing is I didn't pre-order the game for access to a beta. I bought it at release and the product is faulty. When I played Baldur's Gate 3 at launch I didn't even notice any bugs. That comparison might feel unfair, but Larian and Owlcat are companies of similar size so in theory Owlcat should be capable of reaching that standard. So why don't they? Almost certainly because of company leadership, but I think digging any deeper into that is officially too much for a steam review, The point is we should not put up with a half functioning game at release.",1703475185,1703475185,False,57,0,0.743415296077728271,0,True,False,False

Fun time. Three notes if you pick this up.
1: Profit Factor is NOT money. It is not consumed or gained in shops, and is instead used to determine which items in shops you can acquire. (Aka, if you have 20 Profit Factor, and an item says 13, you can get the item with no reduction to your Profit Factor.) It is gained and lost via actions you take in gameplay, while loot items you don't use are used purely to get reputation with factions.
2: Grab the ToyBox from the workshop. Relatively easy to install, grab it purely for the free respecs. This game is WEIRD, you will not build a proper class your first time through, and while they give you one free respec, that is not enough to learn. Grab Toybox so you can dive into the game without needing a guide to stop yourself from brickwalling yourself.

Such a great concept and rich universe and they manage to come out with a buggy, unbalanced, and convoluted PoS. If you are playing on the harder difficulties don't expect to have your characters, or your voidship for that matter, lasting more than a turn or two. It blows my mind they actually thought ""yep, combat makes sense and people will enjoy it"". 

Let me break down your typical Rogue Trader experience. Before you even get into it have fun reading nonsensical talents for hours since they wanted at least 20-30 options for each ""archetype"", 80% of which have such nuanced conditions or offer such little statistically that you'll never take them. When you are in ground combat have fun fighting through ~15 enemies, most being random chaff to tie you down the first round or two, with only one or two enemies being truly interesting or flavored, like the occasional sniper, leader, psyker, or warp creature/daemon engine. Then after barely pulling through the higher level combats, enjoy taking a short walk back to the voidship loading screen so you can clear any of the extremely punishing injuries your characters can receive after getting one-tapped by that sniper or blown up by the three grenades lobbed your way. Combat becomes so tedious you can actually soft-lock yourself in later chapters. So tedious in fact, I ended up just dumping all my AP into the navigator's Lidless Stare, the only reliable and arguably overpowered AoE, or slap a scoped lasgun on your battle sister to spray deadeye shots at the chaff and pesky 95% dodge-chance Aeldari. Combine those with as many Bring It Down's, the officer ability to give a character an immediate turn with 2 AP, and you might have a fighting chance. Don't even try melee. Even if you manage to kill something with melee being out in the front and open is typical a death sentence, unless you are slamming so much Toughness, armor, deflection, and temp wounds to soak up the attention. Later combats seem to revolve around staying as far back as possible and layering all the random abilities you get to the best of your limited sight line. That's another personal peeve of mine. If you pick up the Master Tactician, have fun fighting the terrain and sight-lines more than enemies just so you can get the zones placed as best as possible. So many fights I found myself wishing to get the zone one more square in 'x' direction but was denied by that railing or barrel. 

Then you have void battles, which by their nature should be a large scale tug-of-war's where ships can take a beating and fight through the battle of attrition. At least, that's how it is in the books... In Rogue Trader almost every battle starts with the enemy taking their turn first and regardless of the size of the ship you can bet you are losing 60+% hull integrity before your first turn because in Owlcat's infinite wisdom they thought it best to start the enemy ships so close they can fire most, if not all, their guns turn one. Which really does that ""large-scale tug-of-war"" or the feeling of out ranging your opponents justice. You are often a larger class ship with longer range guns, but good thing you often can't out-pace your enemies nor get the opportunity to out-range your opponents since you start in such close proximity, mind you this is all in response to you engaging the combat since your augurs picked up any hostile void-crafts on the map. And you don't have access to better upgrades from the Navy until later, so have fun save-scumming each turn so you can confirm a ship kill each turn. Void-warfare was such an obvious afterthought its painful. Just play keep-away with your torpedoes.

Luckily the story, dialogues, and atmosphere are spot on. Honestly, these elements are the only redeeming qualities of this game and the only thing keeping my frustrated self from playing this half-baked game, but in all reality that's likely more due to the iron-grip Games Workshop holds on its 40k lore and universe than the care and attention from Owlcat...

This game is really excellent! With a LOT of caveats.

PRO:
1: Writing and player choice is top notch. Very much fits the 40k setting to a T. This is a great introduction to the setting by comparison to many other places.
2: Combat is generally satisfying in terms of sound effects, choices, vfx, music etc.
3: Worldbuilding and sense of scope is excellent. Possibly the best out of any CRPG I've played, and I've played a lot.
4: Companions, side stories, and main stories all have interesting twists and conclusions. I enjoyed almost everything here.
5: Surprisingly well-done romances, albeit limited in number of companion options.
6: There's a lot of game in this game. Worth the money, to be sure.

CON:
1: Bugs, bugs, bugs. Not bad in Acts 1/2/3. But dear lord, the game is (as of the time of writing) very clearly in beta in Acts 4/5. Close friends also report this. Everything from quests not resolving to graphical glitches to dialogue freak-outs. Many reports of soft-locked runs (and I can see why), but I did get to do basically everything I wanted to do without too much issue.

2: This is an optimizer's dream/nightmare. By endgame, bosses have thousands of health, skill checks are made at -100, and you've got 50 levels to figure out how to get there. You WILL NOT complete the game on even normal difficulty if you don't understand how to fundamentally break the game's action economy or number economy. My friend group's experience with the game is that, after a certain point in Act 2, every fight is either won before the enemy takes a turn, or you're just going to get slaughtered. I want to emphasize this: After Act 2, I literally never had an enemy take a turn that was not as a result of them reacting to my turn.

3: It's 40k. If you don't know what to expect, you may get taken very off guard by some things here and might not understand why you can't make certain choices or why other choices are ""good"" compared to others. Veterans will get way more out of the game than new 40k players.

4: There are some... really questionable gameplay decisions here (looking at you, Quetza Temer). Several points in the game make you go ""what? how does that even work?"" due to lack of explanations. Random stealth missions in a game without stealth mechanics. Storybook narrations where you can die if you roll low on a nearly impossible skill challenge you couldn't predict. Etc. It's Owlcat. There will be problems with these sorts of things. And, of course, there is a secondary gameplay mode (void combat). It's better than crusade combat but damn is it so slow. Please speed up void combat by 2x. Not to mention reputation being boosted 3x slower than it should be, heretical/dogmatic/iconoclast options not giving enough points to max it out, etc.

5: This is repetitive, but it's true. Goddamn do the bugs hurt. Argenta got the wrong ending slides because her companion quest never completed. Yes, you can fix these with the Toybox mod, but I shouldn't have to mod your game to make quests resolve.

TLDR:
Gameplay, vfx, sfx, music are all very solid. Exploration, writing, worldbuilding, and characters are all top notch. However, numerous bugs, 40k-specific references, problems with number inflation, and generally questionable alternate gameplay decisions bog things down. 

In the end, things might improve in the future. I fit the intended demographic for this game disturbingly well. If you don't, you might want to be cautious.",1703465445,1703465445,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 (I'm not too interested in them.)

I am also not very knowledgeable on 40K, as I just recently got into it. 

[hr][/hr] 

[h3] DISCLAIMER (As of Dec. 25, 2023) [/h3] 
Currently riddled with bugs especially towards the end. (Act 4 and beyond). Although it would have been ideal to fix these issues before release, devs seem to be patching them at a relatively fast pace. Everything up to Act 3 seems to have minor issues at worst. (~60hrs)

I also have not finished the game. I am at the end of Act 4, waiting on a patch that would fix some of my side quests before I proceed with beating it.

[hr][/hr] 

[h2] PROS AND CONS [/h2] 
+ You can literally not know anything about the franchise and some dialogue choices can reflect that. The characters will be surprised at you lacking what is supposedly common knowledge. 

+ [b]Immersive storytelling [/b]in the already strong setting of the 40K Universe. Game got me hooked, despite its buggy state on launch.

+ [b]Fun combat [/b]that blends mechanics from XCOM and classic CRPGs. With some caveats, the combat mechanics in this game are generally enjoyable.

+ [b]Companions[/b] have meaningful depth and character. And almost all of them are really likable, which is surprising because I expected to hate a few of them just from their looks and initial impressions.

+ Fair variety of enemies to encounter, though I certainly hope we will get to see more in upcoming content. 

+ Very [b]flexible difficulty [/b]settings that let you tailor-fit your game experience to your own comfort. (Although the game seems to be balanced around Daring/Core difficulty)

+ [b]Co-Op[/b] seems to be implemented more smoothly somehow than most other games I've played. Plus, it adds extra enjoyment in a session when you """"accidentally"""" commit some friendly fire. 

+ [strike]Cassia[/strike]


o [b]Combat[/b] is hardly balanced. There are a few points in the game that feel like sudden spikes in difficulty, with very little tools for you to fight back. For the most part though, you can get by without an 'optimal' build and team comp. 

o [b]Space combat[/b] in general is a bit of a mixed bag. In your first few ship battles, you are going to take hits and possibly even lose before you get your turn. It doesn't get really engaging until you level up enough to get skills to play around with.

o [b]Reputation / Trading[/b] is really difficult to progress. There are some systems that can help you; but without grinding, you probably won't even get close to maxing more than one faction. 

o [b]Alignment[/b] seems like an afterthought sometimes. First, you get so little alignment points for most related dialogue options. Second, characters never seem to acknowledge your alignment for the most part. The most it does is provide some gameplay bonuses and let you select some dialogue options exclusive to a certain level of alignment. 


- [b]BUGS.[/b] Owlcat should have probably released this under Early Access..

- I had entire companion quest chains ruined because of things not triggering or getting marked as complete. 

- Some talents do not work as described.

- Sometimes damage previews are wonky as hell. Game will show you that your attack will hit, but it will completely whiff. This issue is more common with AoE attacks.
 
- Game isn't clear on certain mechanics. Some skills can be used both before and after giving someone an extra turn. Some skills cannot. 

- [b]Balance issues[/b]: Some encounters are borderline impossible to beat without using some strategy that involves megabuffing one party member and having them delete the entire enemy lineup before they can act. Because if you don't, they will.

- Certain quests were really disappointing, to be more specific [spoiler] Argenta companion quest [/spoiler], which really felt out of place with how good most of the writing is. I suspect that this was a product of a rush job.


[h2] CONCLUSIONS [/h2]
Overall, I would still recommend Rogue Trader. It is a solidly fun CRPG especially as someone who is relatively fresh to the world of 40K.

It's extremely buggy, to the point that at least 2 companion quests (Argenta and Ulfar) are not completable and stuck in some weird state. Starting Chapter 3 you'll get a plenty of graphical, logical and quest bugs. Some markers (like combat zones) persist through level changes only to appear on top of space map. If you return to some story areas you'll find that they are in the middle of cutscene (including your character being prone, but able to move).

Balance is super weird. Some combats (end of Chapter 4) are waaay harder than anything before. Also, last fight in Ch4 will slow your PC (decent one) to a halt, even though there won't be that many enemies, no idea why. Assassin snipers and psykers for the win.

UI and inventory management is inconvenient, since cloaks, pendants and rings are all in the same category and even look the same sometimes. Hard to find what is useful.

Skill checks are weird, basically you'll miss half of the game and lore (the best thing in this game) unless you save-scum.

Space combats are random hell, clunky and annoying. 

I've spent 100 hours here just because I like the story and first two chapters were tolerable quality-wise. Chapter 3 was interesting but buggy. Starting chapter 4 game became more of a chore.

I couldn't slog through another encounter of enemies having 500-1000hp, while all my characters have less than 100. Having them 1 shotting everyone unless you play through the encounter in a very specific way and dropped the game near the 3/4 mark.

Bug-wise, it's nowhere near what Kingmaker was, and they've been releasing several patches a week, so I imagine it'll be a non-issue soon. Personally I had to use the Toy Box to trigger a quest for a companion -- and I only knew about that quest because he refused to come with me to the final area unless I had done it. Who knows what else I missed?

I'm not the biggest WH40K fan, but this has made me more interested in the setting. At the same time it highlights just how silly the setting is. It's funny to make moral choices when everything is so terrible. There is a ""nice guy"" path, which I feel should have more negative consequences -- but then I never even got to rank 3 with any of my ideologies.

There is an ""alignment"" system, but it works more like reputation. You can advance all of them at the same time, you just won't get very far on any of their paths. You get powerful abilities from the alignment paths, so in that way it's a bit like the systems Obsidian implemented in Tyranny/PoE2/Alpha Protocol.

There's a colony-builder part, but it's pretty barebones but it gives you great gear and buffs, and the game you play when not running around this time is space combat. It's far better than budget HoMM from WotR.

The character creation choices are (naturally) much more limited compared to the Pathfinder games, particularly WotR, and  there doesn't seem to be anything that changes the game as dramatically as the the epic paths did in WotR.

Also, I get the feeling that this game had a tighter budget than WotR. There's a large section near the end of the game that is presented entirely in text. I can understand why, as it depicts a full-scale 40k battle for a world but it is slightly jarring, and WotR had bigger setpieces.

Amazingly, this game has turn-based combat AND a pause feature. So you can keep your idiot companions from traipsing all over traps if they're detected. 

TL;DR though, I really liked it. Maybe wait for a few more patches before diving in, or get ready to use Toy Box to fix things. Maybe my favorite CRPG of 2023 (it's between it and Phantom Liberty) but it is barebones compared to other big-name CRPGs out there.",1703434083,1703434083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I won't lie: there is quite a lot of fun to be found here, but the bugs and stupid narrative decisions make finding it a struggle.

- skills not being checked against values of correct character, but seemingly at random
- items/talent that should grand re-roll on skill failure not working correctly, or not working at all 
- all skill check are done with stupidly high difficulty like -60 to -120 in act 3 (of 5) core difficulty. It seems the exception was that you should invest in talents that grand rerolls, but those rerolls are not working so you just see fail after fail after fail on skill that you concentrated on since beginning of the game and are core to your roleplay. 

Apart from that after act 2 you just see stunning lose of quality in every aspect of the game:
-constant visual bugs and glitches 
-cutscenes either bugging out or having f**** transitions (like hanging for 60+ seconds without anything happening or just being skipped completely with a single blink) 
-narrative ""deus ex machine"" with stuff happening to you without your character being able to react to it
-parts of conversations that should allow you to solve some problems just not appearing

And as a authority, to resolve an emerged crisis, the main character has a lot more freedom to choose any position on the alignment chart without causing major logical contradictions. Because of that Owlcat's stories are much more coherent and immersive, pretty much the best in a genre today. And the Rogue Trader is their best effort so far.

Unfortunately it inherits all other Owlcat's signature features - unbearably buggy state on launch, addition of tedious and straight up bad management/tactics mini-games, traversing on a global map is a pure torture (RT has the worst by far), a difficulty balance has been made by a psychopath. On a top of that, not a fan of RT ruleset (or how it was implemented here), but its more a subject of a personal preferences.

But still its a very good roleplay game. Every line of dialog and every screen background are oozing with a personality and atmosphere (it comes from a person who don't give a shit about WH40k in general). A rare game, where you want to select a dialog option according to a roleplay, even if it will obviously lead to a harmful consequences.

== Writing
Exquisite. The team behind it deserves any and all praise. Everything oozes with atmosphere, the game actually feels like a portal to 40k universe with its own rules. In this universe, life of a single person is worth less than nothing and getting turned into a mindless mechanized slave is actually a decent fate compared to what others usually get. I've decided to start my tenure as a benevolent ruler, giving people of the planet one additional daily ration - and that actually made them ecstatic. All in all, it's an actual ROLE-playing game experience. And a brilliant one at that.
Oh, and the ending slides are awesome. Looking at you, Larian.

== Technical condition
Really, I can't give enough praise to writing, as it's the only thing that kept me going. Currently, the game is basically an early access title, though branded as a full release. Bugs, bugs, bugs, everywhere, ranging from ""eh, the models are glitching out"" to quests not starting, quests not completing, getting softlocked in locations, game forgetting about certain events, abilities not working, statuses having wrong descriptions, statuses having descriptions and icons from another statuses, statuses having no description at all, achievements bugging out, the game outright refusing to start, bugreport button breaking, I could go on and on. One has to wonder what the entire QA team was busy with. The game clearly needs at least half a year more in the oven.

== Sound design
One of the stronger points. Music is ranging from ""eh, it's decent"" to ""OMG THIS IS SO AWESOME"", where the former is like 10% of the tracks and the latter is like half of them, the rest are somewhere in between. Not a single bad or boring track, and all of them contribute to the atmosphere a lot. Voice acting where it's present is spot-on as well, imo one of the best voice actings of recent times. Weapons sound extremely satisfying and impactful - like one character says, ""each strike is a prayer"".

== Game mechanics
Really ambivalent about this one. Abilities and perks are in desperate need of heavy pruning, most of them are something along the lines of ""once a month if the stars align and Emperor himself gives His blessing, you might or might not get a +3% damage on a stunned, blinded, prone and bleeding foe for two rounds"". There are so many perks that you pretty quickly forget about what your character has picked, they all blur into +n% damage per round (looking at you, Bounty Hunter). On the other hand, we've got some pretty original stuff like Officers, who are built around giving extra turns to allies. 
Psykers are close to being absolutely worthless. 
What this system really could've benefitted from is a dedicated psyker class and more flavor to companions' classes, like, everyone could use at least the same treatment as Cassia and Pasqal got. 
Space combat is... well... there. Got nothing good or bad to write about it. Fairly simple but monotonous. 
Reputation system is at first glance interesting but extremely grindy, by the point you get enough reputation to get this sweet heavy bolter you've already looted a dozen weapons that are overwhelmingly superior to it. The Imperial Navy reputation is straight-up broken, it's the only faction that sells ship upgrades and you can only up their reputation by selling trophies from space battles (and a couple of colony projects which give negligible boosts anyway) - but there's so little trophies that they will almost always lag behind. Also you don't get highest-tier trophies for them until the moment you can't trade with them at all.

== Graphics
Mostly nothing to write home about, but pretty decent overall. The environments are pretty diverse with a few gems here and there, animations are fine, VFX are okayish. General artstyle is dark and gritty like a 40k game should be. All in all, (almost) nothing fancy, but looks pretty enough.

== Verdict
Despite the terrible technical condition and arguable mechanics, the game is really saved by its gorgeous writing and presentation. It really is a vivid representation of 40k world. In this aspect, I'd compare it to VtM:B, both games are built upon the existing franchise, both games came out undercooked, both games have phenomenal writing. VtM:B never had any support from its developer and still eventually achieved a cult status. Here the scrapcode will be ironed out, the balance might probably get fixed (I sure hope so) and in the end we might be looking at another cult game. If you're a fan of 40k and not scared of bugs - get it now, you will love it. If you simply like CRPGs - let it cook for a while and then get it anyway.

Original review after about 11 hours of playing:

So far, so good. Mechanically sometimes feels weird and counter-intuitive (really, screw the d100), but overall decent - xcomish combat with deep customization of builds. A bit buggy sometimes, but nothing game-breaking so far - just minor graphical glitches here and there - welp, Unity can only get you so far. Love the voice-acting, even coming from BG3 it still sounds amazing. Great music, great atmosphere, interesting characters, excellent writing - the spirit of 40k is all over the place. Already planning on a couple more playthroughs, even though I'm still around the beginning of the plot. Hope both Owlcat and Larian will keep on perfecting their art, these two make damn good games.
At this moment, I'd recommend it to any CRPG lover, we'll see how the game holds up.",1702260840,1703419966,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

if you've played owlcats previous games than you'll know how detailed the systems they adapt are and this one's probably the silliest (there's a lot to learn!) with all the options available.

Absolutely butt chapped some of it is just outrageously buggy.

Really fun game but i would recommend waiting on playing the game to be updated before playing. The amount of bugs starting in chapter 3 (halfway in the game) makes the game frustrating to play and in my experience; game breaking. The majority of the bugs are nothing serious by  themselves; sometimes items like clothes and weapons don't sync up with the character's model, indicators for quests sometimes stay on the map after completion, etc. But then there are also some more serious bugs that occur on top of that; quests don't complete after completion, some side quests don't start after triggering required events, items can't be equipped by characters with the required requisites, etc. The real issue of the bugs is the amount I experienced at the same time; a death by a thousand cuts. 

At this time of my review I submitted a bug report for an issue that prevents me from starting cutscenes  on the bridge of your ship; a problem considering many of the game's cutscenes are in the bridge. 

I won't say that everyone will experience the same bugs or the same amount as I did; but forums show many players experienced many of the less serious bugs, so I would recommend people to wait for a couple months for updates to come out before playing. The core game mechanics, story, soundtrack and art are amazing and so it would be a shame for other players to have their experience deteriorated by the volume of minor bugs like mine has. 

I definitely plan on playing multiple runs once the game's many bugs are cleaned up but will take a break for the moment.

Animations and effects are super janky and it shows that the engine is ill suited to XCom style combat. The camera is really bad and is sometimes out of focus when a cut scene plays. There are tons of skills that seem useless and are just a distraction from the better builds. Everything is a chore, from gearing up to scavenging maps for loot, there are tons of boxes full of materials to collect and I always wonder why my character, who has a crew of 25K people at his beck and call, has to do that. Scanning the map for tiny secrets and manually steering each character to avoid damage fields is no fun. 

The combat in the first 2 acts, even with all the jank, is still entertaining, despite the often awful AI - in some fights your party gets additional npc allies and they just open up on full auto, not caring if they shoot your characters in the back. At least this also happens to the bad guys.  In a later mission you have a space marine npc on your side. His first move was to stand behind my techpriest and open up with a heavy bolter downing my priest in the first round. Thank you, sons of Russ. 

In act 3 and beyond everything takes a turn for the worse. The generic enemies have more life than your heroes and the bosses are 800 hp and higher, while our single space marine has something like 110 hp at the beginning of act 3. At the same time the baddies hit superhard and if you made a small mistake in setting up your group, you will get punished. At that point you need to start min-maxing if you want to progress and that's not even at max difficulty. The build the developers want you to use, is to get as many heroic actions and extra rounds out of your characters as possible. Don't even bother trying a different approach. 

*SPOILER AHEAD*

The thing that kept me going so far was the story and writing but act 3 ruined that. At that point we find out who killed our predecessor, which should have been a big deal. Instead it's a side note and we move on. 

There are also some serious bugs. For example you can miss recruiting a character if you progress the quests in a nonlinear order. There is no warning, quite on the contrary. Once the galaxy map opens up you can go anywhere you want and that screws up certain things. 

The game needs a lot of patches and work and I cannot recommend it in this state.",1703384812,1703396218,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mostly, though, the word ""clumsy"" comes to mind. So much of this game makes me wonder why on earth they chose to do things that way and not knowing if I've stumbled onto a weird design choice, a bug or just an very rough edge on an obviously far from finished product.

There's a great understanding of the source material, a lot of effort to create a great atmosphere in which the game takes place and an interesting story with decent characters. There are a number of pleasant ""quality of life"" choices that very nice to see, like how you're able to reposition your characters in a small area around them at the start of combat and how looting one corpse will show you the loot of any other corpses close by.

But in ""technical terms"", for lack of a better description, the game is far too often utterly frustrating. Some examples of this follow:

The game has a plethora of different game mechanics, but most are quite bare-bones and bland after you've encountered them just a few times. This includes the colony management, the space combat, the economic and reputation system used when trading with the few factions in game (the whole faction system seems pretty basic and unimpactful).
In contrast, the class system is absurdly overdone and needlessly complex, with a ridiculous amount of skills where the vast majority are mostly useless, so choosing what you want becomes 90% wading through the obvious crap looking for the rare bits of useful abilities and buffs. This is NOT helped by the fact that most tool tips don't include the number you buff your stats by, but rather the equation used to arrive at the number... So you get sentences like ""increasing their characteristics by +(5 + 2 x Officer's FEL bonus) for 1 round"" instead of showing the number. Sometimes it actually can't, because the number might depend on who you're using the skill on, which is fair, but on many skills this is not the case and yet you still get the equation instead of just showing the number. It makes an already cumbersome UI even worse to deal with.

The camera controls are a bit stiff and restricted and to make matters worse your view will quite often be obstructed by various buildings, platforms, pillars, chains, banners, trees etc. in the foreground that the game for some reason doesn't fade out. This will even happen during scripted cut scenes, where you have no control over the camera, so it can't have come as a surprise to the devs. Some things do indeed fade out, so it seems to be a case of the camera system being very poorly polished.

Most areas are quite small, even cities or similar large venues are broken up into smaller bits. Moving between two such areas requires loading, which is remarkably slow for a modern game of this quite modest graphical quality. This causes the game to come to a complete halt much too often, and the game itself has this problem in a number of other ways, as well. Playing this feels like playing a table top RPG with a DM who constantly stops everyone talking with a ""Wait, wait, I have to check my notes"" and then has you sit around doing nothing for 30 seconds while he reads. Enough small breaks makes the experience too fragmented, this game suffers greatly from that problem.

Continuing along those lines, cut scenes occur constantly, where your control is completely taken away and a you're watching a cumbersome and poorly animated little display with no voice acting, but instead a bit of text floating somewhat nearby the speaker and mostly staying on screen for an annoyingly long time. You can't skip to the next bit of dialogue when you're done reading, only option is to skip the entire cut scene, so unless you read at the speed of an 8 year old, you're watching the slowest, most poorly animated cartoon of your life. It's tedious. EDIT: I found that you can in fact skip to the next line of dialogue using space, my bad. The cut scenes are still mostly a bland and forgettable waste of time, but at least you don't have to wait 10 seconds after every line to hear the next one.

Inventory management is just horrible. That's par for the course for crpgs, but even so this game does it worse than what is reasonable. The part of the inventory you can see at any time is horribly small and you can't select multiple things at once, something which is baffling in a loot-focused game like this, so managing your inventory is a complete fucking mess.

The UI is bad and obviously not done. The vast majority of skills have no icon. The more important ones do, some classes/characters have many more icons than others, some icons are re-used liberally, so this seems like them just not having had enough time to finish the artwork needed, feels like a game still under development.
There's a log, but it's tiny and keeps shutting off, so you have to bring it back up.
Generally most things in the UI feels cramped and poorly implemented.

All of this is without even touching the subject of bugs, of which there are MANY, both graphical and gameplay-related. Most are minor, though, but they are there by the dozens at least. But the game has much bigger problems than bugs, so I don't feel like going into details about them. Completely bug free I still wouldn't recommend the game.

I am quite fond of crpgs and the WH40K universe, so I'll probably keep trudging through this and hope for many more and extensive updates to the game (because it honestly feels like they were NOT done, but had to release now either to make money or just because of pressure from executives), but I cannot recommend this game at all. It's way too clunky, rough and honestly just far from a finished, polished product for me to do that.

It feels like trading and moral choices should give you anywhere from 2-4x as much points as they currently do. 

The first 2 acts are pretty good, but most things after act 3 feels like it needed more time in the oven. The game also has some difficulty spikes with the bosses for Act 3 and 4. I wish the difficulty was more spread out between the regular mob fights and the act boss fights. Two problems with these difficulty spikes: 

1. The game doesn't allow you to re-spec your characters before the boss room. Act 4 doesn't even let you change your party comp, and Act 3 only gives you a limited ability to change comp. You're stuck with what you bought to the fight, and if you have poorly built characters you are going to get tossed around like a ragdoll. Which isn't necessarily a problem if not for the fact that:
2. The game doesn't teach you to build good characters / good party comps. I don't mean that it doesn't show you how to level up or change your party, it does all that, but there's never a reason to optimise or really pay attention to how you are building your characters, because asides from these boss fight difficulty spikes, the rest of the game (regular mobs) are very easy. Act 4 was a literal cake walk, where I was winning most fights in 1 round at one difficulty level above normal, and then the boss comes and demands you actually know how to play the game. However, the encounters you fought in the rest of the game didn't make it seem like you needed to be meticulous with your build choices, so obviously you're probably not going to have a well built party if you've been playing the game in a relaxed way. And again, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if you were able to respec at the boss fight, but you're not, so you either reload a save an hour (or three) earlier, use a modding tool to respec, lower the difficulty, or bang your head against RNG.

Playing recording:
""Where to fucking begin with this...

Combat: it sucks. I have had fun with tactical combat rpg's and tactical grid combat hybridized grand strategy for DECADES. The encounters and mechanics simply aren't fun in this game and many of the mandatory encounters are a complete and utter chore to do. On release the game has many issues such as your characters receiving trauma from minor damage without having any old or fresh injuries, and walking to their opponents to point-blank cast something that you clicked to do at range. The bugs are very frustrating on top of how uninteresting the combat often is.

Archtype system
*Its fucking AIDS get rid of it
-The archtypes are not well packaged and defined in a way a new player readily understands, being incredibly ambiguous for some conceptual-class roles. They are also poorly designed and not engaging or interesting in the least as they actually play. 
-Have to drill in to every archtype tree requiring multiple clicks for comparative analysis instead of having one massive branching tree like in path of exile where you can view everything at once. Bad design here. You'll be needing to write down the names of traits as well because you are locked out of viewing them if you don't have the necessary origin and archtype selected.

Psyker
-Many of the iconic spells and abilities for psyker are for whatever reason removed. 
-Most pyromancy spells revolve around casting ignite / proc'ing off already burning enemies and do underwhelming damage (pyromancy has for whatever reason been made a melee build). Melee is fine, but at least offer players the ability to blow shit up with their minds. I cant even cast a fireball or call a pillar of fire. Very lame. 
-Force staves grant powers (bio-lightning) which is NOT how the lore works. In the CANON, force weapons are simply psychic cruxes/augments/conduits that augment your powers, you dont get spells/abilities from them unless a Daemon is trapped inside it. The whole notion I can only cast bio-lightning/smite from having to hold a staff is fucking DUMB and NOT lore accurate. Especially considering theres other damaging AOE abilities you can cast in the game REGARDLESS of what you're holding. There's no logical reason for this.
-You start with psy rating 0 making all of your spells suck cock but every psyker companion you meet has a starting psy rating of 1 already. To add insult to injury, the progression system is bugged and as of writing this, you cant even get psy rating 1 at level 10 like it says you should in the tree. IT REMAINS LOCKED UNTIL 12.

Irritating mechanics:
-Buffs don't need a character 3-5 second animation for them to activate. A colorful graphic that blips into and out of existence is enough. Having to sit there and wait 9-15 seconds while you tediously click through all your buffs and wait for the adjoining character animation for ONE CHARACTER is FUCKING HIV POSITIVE. Seriously what a horrible design decision. Whoever came up with this needs to be shot. In the balls. And THEN shot in the head to rid their filth from humanity.

*Closing Statement*
-All in all I am only playing this because I like 40k. I am desperate to play a 40k game where I get to command a ship and exercise my authority as an agent of the Imperium. Most the fun I have from the game is being able to mine a diminutive fraction of the experience i ACTUALLY want from this horribly made, shit tier, boiling hot garbage, abomination of a game. Don't buy it, absolutely awful. I would have rather paid to get kicked in the groin by a Sister of Battle than play this awful shit again.""

Effectively all the negative reviews are just complaining about bugs and glitches, which do occasionally happen but not even close to enough to actually detract from the quality of the game. Quality which this game has in droves. It's packed with content, a great intriguing story, interesting companions, well-written characters, perfectly fun combat system, varied locations. It's got colony management, ship combat, faction management, I expected a lot and honestly it exceeded those expectations. 

With turn-based combat this game plays very similarly to Larian's games (Like Baldur's Gate 3), which is different from the usual CRPGs but generally seems to be more accessible and understandable to people who play other genres.

 I bounced off the Pathfinder games from this developer extremely hard, started Pillars of Eternity multiple times but never got more than 3-5 hours in, same with Tyranny, all games I wanted to like.

Divinity 2 and BG3 were great, as was Encased and Shadowrun Hong Kong( two smaller but awesome games) 

There are more games on that list but the point is I love this game, so if the games listed above seem to match your preferences please do yourself a favor and get it. I know the developer has a history of overly crunchy, complex RPGs but this strikes the perfect balance. Some aspects such as the economy could have used a little more explaining but the combat is fantastic, and each encounter is tough enough to actually having you consider your plan of action( reminded very heavily of Divinity 2 in this case) and the cast of characters is everything you want from something based in the 40K universe. 

Speaking of that universe, this is probably the best interpretation of the Grim Dark Future we're gonna see anytime soon and the fact you get to actually explore and interact with it to the degree you do is amazing. If you've read the Eisenhorn series of novels, it's got that feeling.

Support a smaller developer and great game, buy today.  

Cancel that.

Updated, unfortunately I can no longer recommend this game, at 15ish hours in was awesome, but once you get to chapter 4 there are numerous soft locks with no way around them, mostly involving cutscenes that do not trigger properly leaving you with no quests to do. As far as I can tell this issue hasn't even been acknowledge by the devs, its s shame, the game is a lot of fun, the story is great and the overall production values are there, but so many late game bugs literally break it. Knowing that 70% and dozens of hours in you're more than likely going to just get locked out of that fun game though, don't buy it yet. 

Update to the Update: Game is mostly fixed of serious progressing breaking issues as of now, so I am reverting to my initial review and going back to recommend.

With limited options in how you can adjust the autosave and nothing regarding the frequency of the autosaves you can be at times left with the infuriating prospect of having to undo an hour or more of progress. 

This coupled with the segments of the game that prevent you from returning to the ship to heal traumas. Can leave you in what feels like a near unwinnable situation with heavily debuffed characters and at times no supplies.

The lore here is fantastic, and it is such a good story with tons of twists and turns, and the story elements have me sucked in. I care about some of my companions and make decisions for my character that align with the 40k universe. I'm not a big fan of Act 3 because as I was getting more comfortable with one set of rules and finally making headway, it yanked me out and threw me somewhere else for the time being. If you know Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous and how you are thrown somewhere else midway into the story, you will understand what I mean. I am writing this review and I still need to finish the game.

I finally had a firm grasp on the space battles, and I was figuring out how to mesh the different components of my team in the tactical combat scenarios. Then, one of my prominent members was bugged out and removed from the game. I knew where and how to get them and bring them back to me, but when I went there, they weren't there. The dialogue options for me to get them were there, but they were not. It was super frustrating, and because of it, I had to make a decision that I was not too happy about making storyline-wise that did not fit with the character I had in mind. 

I was just in a combat encounter where I had a member in my party for a battle, and he was also an NPC in the area supporting my struggle; there were just 2 of them! The BUGS!!!

I like this game and recommend it. But I am also super disappointed in this buggy mess released in the state it was. This is not early access, but here it is. I suggest waiting a year before buying it when all the bugs are ironed out. I will still finish it and update this review if anything changes.

UPDATE: I am in Act 4 and finished one of my companion's missions, and it permanently reduced my party size to 5 instead of 6. if you know about the difficulty this game provides, then a 5-person party is impossible.

I have seen beta tests that are miles more stable than this.

The game is riddled with bugs, some of which are cosmetical and interrupt the flow of the game some are complete gamebreaking - Let me list the personal favourites I have encountered so far.

- Ship combat being bugged and not ending
- Combat zones designated by the grand strategist persisting on the screen
- bounty hunter heroic ability breaking the game forcing you to reload
- several abilities simply not doing anything
- audio being completely bugged, the void ships bridge has some sort of slamming sound that just wont go away, companions voices are cutting out in combat
- the game sometimes kills my monitor forcing me to plug it in again (this one is impressive tbh)
- talents not working

According to other people in the community there is several points where your game straight up breaks, venturing beyond chapter 3, I have no clue how people managed to get there, because I am still in chapter 2 and the issues have become insufferable.

I have no idea why Owlcat decided to release the game now, a 50€ game that puts EA releases to shame.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updating this since I have now finished the game.

I have to say that despite supposed hotfixes things did not go better

Something that kept coming up is how companions that left me acted in certain situations like nothing ever happened, the game kept getting things wrong, like people that were dead were still around, or people that I fought at like we were never at odds whatsover and even called me allies, characters kept thinking my character is a woman for some reason? This all seems really sloppy.

but disregarding the bugs there is another bunch of issues that rob the fun out of the game.

- Just like in Wrath of the Righteous, this game expects you to know exactly what youre doing and is going to punish you for not knowing things, for example you can get a fifth colony but can lock yourself out of it very easily - visiting planets in the wrong order or making one wrong choice? Haha you fool, no fifth colony for you!, you might think this is not a big issue? Unfortunately Colony projects depend on previously completed Project, and some of those are depend on Projects being completed on other Planets, losing this colony means you wont be able to finish certain Projects on your other planets and you will never find out why unless you research that online.
Speaking of Colonies, one of my Colonies had low Security which is assume is lead to a Cataclysm on the planet, said cataclysm reduced my profit factor(money) by 700 which means i was at 0 with almost no opportunity to get it up again.

- That brings me to the next point, the economy, equipment for your characters is usually obtained one way, you need profit factor(money) and reputation with certain factions, if you have enough reputation and your profit factor is above a certain threshold, you can obtain items from these traders.
In order to raise your reputation you have to give them trophies, different factions are interested in different trophies. Now heres the issue, I made sure to pursue anything optional I could and loot everything I could loot and at the end of the game I was maybe ~30% of the way in with these factions, I thought the game would go on for a while longer but no, that is how it goes, I assume they want you to entirely focus on only one faction? Either way im not a fan of this design and youre being punished for not knowing that.

A similar issue are the Convictions, there is 3 ""Karma Paths"" you can go, full emperor, humanist or chaos.
All of those have levels, ranging from 1-5, giving you certain boni for each level and important dialogue choices depending on how far you are into your conviction path.
The issue is, if you want to - lets say go heretic, you need to mindlessly pick 
EVERY
SINGLE
OPTION
and even then you are likely not going to get enough points to progress far enough into your tree, so youre going to miss out on certain choices, which is interesting because the game introduces the conviction system telling you that you can go up to level 2 for every path but can only go to level 3 or beyond for 1 of them, that is a trap if anything, you either go all the way or youre going to miss out, this seems again, not playtested in the slightest.

- Another thing is combat, which seems all over the place
I have to say I really like the basic concept but the values seem all over the place, my melees crit for maybe 90 damage in the end whereas my heaver gunner blasted a 7.000 HP boss dead in 2 turns, I feel like some modifiers are not calculated properly.
Some talents are clearly not working, or not working the way they should, Some items are also not working properly, for example some pistols are treated as two-handed weapons and cannot be used in close combat which is vital for some classes, other two-handed rifles can be dual-wielded which is completely insane.
I dont understand how a game that went through months of beta testing can release in such a state.

- Another issue is the fact that the game is made in unity which leads to a variety of issues

Setting the game to 4k makes it run rather poorly, so you want to stick to a lower resolution.

The game is absolutely RIDDLED with load screens, zones are rather small and switching between them will result in a load screen which takes rather long, Baldurs Gate 3 or Total War Warhammer have a fraction of these loading screens which are also faster.
If your party has to jump over a cliff, youre going to get an interaction button, upon pressing the button you enter a small loadscreen and your party will then teleport to the other side, I dont know how much of this is an unity issue but if you charge 50 bucks youre going to be held to the standard of a tripple A studio aswell.
Owlcat decided for some reason to have a tile based combat system which I honestly dont quite understand, since Wrath of the righteous had turn based combat with a ""free"" movement system.
Maybe thats because they wanted to implement a cover system, but theres plenty of games that can utilise cover without having to rely on tiles, this seems like a really dated approach and is sometimes rather frustrating to deal with.

All these are points which should have been addressed prior to release, yet owlcat priotised things like removing the Space Wolves' line about there being no female Space marines which seems like a rather weird thing.

For the Warhammer interested I can say that youre going to find quite the amount of fluff in this game, its really cool that youre able to peace bits of the story together by having lore knowledge.
You will find quite a lot of Imperium/Mechanicus content here, some interesting Eldar/Dark Eldar content, a bit of Space Marines in the form of Space Wolves, decent Chaos content if you choose that Route.
There is no Tau or Tyranid content, so if thats what youre looking for youre going to be disappointed.

All in All I can say I would not get this game again for this price, infact with my current knowledge I would not have gotten it at all, get it on a sale in maybe 4-6 months when they have patched and tweaked a lot of the issues, I will reassess the state of the game in that time.

Hopefully, all of the issues will eventually be fixed but in it's current state, playing beyond Act 3 will simply be a terrible experience for you.

The writing in act 1 and 2 is very good and faithful the 40k universe, the gameplay can be complicated at times but that's to be expected for a crpg. I overall had a great experience playing the first half of the game.

However, after act 3, everything goes downhill in terms of quality.
I had to use mods to trigger / fix every companion questline in act 4 except for one.
Act 4 barely adds any new side-content, having done everything available before progressing to act 3, act 4 felt very empty and rushed.
Gameplay-wise, there seems to be something clearly broken with the balancing, the Arch-militant archetype simply scales way too fast in combat, paired with two support oriented officers and i could clear every single combat encounter starting in act 3 before the ennemy had the chance to play a turn in ""hard"" difficulty. At that point, i was simply in it for the writing and just wanted to get it over with honestly.

Narratives dont fit together (If you killed someone, but the dialogues with relevant characters still are as if the said character is alive, if though it is completely changing the story.)
Lots of bugs. Be it interface, named characters coming back to life.
Item descriptions bugging out and showing only symbols.
Badly written descriptions of choices, i could only contribute to a lot of copy pasting.
Skill in space fights being on the same cooldown you were at before you loaded the lost fight, or outright not doing what they are supposed to do.
quest progression not updating, so that you run around tripple checking everything for it to randomly complete after time passed.

some of them are obvious bugs. some are minor inconeniences. some are just confusing and kick you out of the immersion. In the end, there are so many little things, i found myself being unsure wether something is not working because its not supposed to, or because its bugging again.
it feels increasingly flat and slapped together.

best i can describe it, its as if an inexperienced game master ran out of ideas 3 hours into your session, and constantly forgets decisions, enforces unpleasant and out of place choices and is railroading in a weird way with passages of thought out scenes and things that are supposed to happen, that are only vaguely/badly connected for now.

The later acts are, at the time of this review, very buggy. Balance in space combat is off by a lot, making encounters much harder or easier than they should be.

But the game is also exceptional. It represents the universe of 40k pretty much perfectly. The characters are excellently voiced (especially Jae and Ulfar) and the story itself is compelling and exciting. There are twists, there are turns, and there's plenty of blessed bolter fire and annihilation of the Emperor's enemies.

At least i like how canon bugs are: Animations>classic T poses everywhere and elongated pixelated hands all over the screen, pink and black sprites popping up here and there
Mechanics: some skills dont work at all BUT! the other skills are so bugged that u can end practically any encounter in 1 turn not letting enemies do anything at all on hardest dificulty
Dialogues: NPCs are talking about dead NPCs like they are alive here and there, and they are not afraid to answer with the SAME lines to 2 absolutely different questions u ask them,
QUEST: OLD SCHOOL STYLE BUGS like u cant finish this quest bcuz u didnt collect all clues in the only order the nightmarishly famished with lack of sleep gamedev brain designed. Stuck in locations, stuck in combat, stuck in dialogues you name it - this game has it all. 
Area attacks are sometimes not registered, differences in height are not calculated correctly, opponents just freezing and missing turns for no reason making any boss fights anticlimatic.
Even save and load pictures are bugged and show u random screenshots from the game, not the screenshots of your save! this shit is seen with naked eye and fixed within 1 day of working on errors if u have 1 beta tester in ur staff, but apparently they dont have 1, not anymore. Save got corrupted for me once and didnt load> was fun to lose some time :D
Btw area effects on the ground dissapear and appear in new places when u save and load mid combat. same with combat zones. sometimes it feels like u are playing on soft mode hardcore where u can only save before the fight, bcuz saving and loading mid fights can fuck this game up easily.
It gets worse after act 3 > its practically an alpha test.
Still i like owlcat games too much. the boyz just need more time for development, but must be the circumstances that forced their hand on dropping this on the market this raw. ill change my review on positive one after a couple of monthes of patching i bet, this game needs like 3-6 monthes more in development.",1703360780,1703361628,False,3,0,0.515192389488220215,0,True,False,False

Normally I would recommend it, except...

Game suffers from usual issues. You create your character with your chosen class, just to find out that half the story characters you get have the same class...and you can't change class for anyone. Story characters join with a fixed lvl and their lvl ups already distributed..often to junk skills you don't want. Primary class limits what 2ndary class you can choose and 3rd class is the same for all, i guess the developers couldn't be arsed.

Lvl up is a pain. You get an unsorted list to choose from, 1 of the 5 lists has predetermined filters, the rest isn't even sorted by anything. Sorting, searching or filtering not possible and the lists show all entries, even those you cannot get.

Game has no difficulty, no AI. Melee mobs run straight at you, ranged burstfire from the first tile that offers a line of fire..commonly killing more allies then enemies. To make the game look remotely challenging the dev stoops to the crutch: unfair advantages. End of chapter 1 you start in the face of a chaos marine with a heavy bolter who can actually wipe your whole party before you get a turn...rest of the game  is fighting 6 Vs 60, having to charge down a trapped corridor without cover to reach snipers etc

Economy doesn't even exist..in a game with trader in it's name. You have no currency, instead events and story gives you ""profit factor"". This lets you buy (grab?) anything with less value then your current profit factor without loosing anything. To make that work the game doesn't have a single trader or vendor, instead you get 5 factions that need reputation. To further make it work, the factions ""sell"" every item in limited amount, usually one. So almost every single item that does [b] not [/b] drop of generic cannon fodder is literally unique. You mostly get reputation by trading in cargo. Every piece of equip can be turned into cargo, all other loot is cargo by default (makes exploring truly rewarding /sarcasm). So 1 Lasgun is 5% ranged, means 20 Lasgung can be turned into 1 ranged cargo to be traded for rep with one faction. So far if you loot, farm and trade in every single item in the game you [b] struggle to max 1 faction [/b] let alone multiple...truly genius design.",1703354814,1703354814,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lots of gamebreaking bugs, poorly animated cutscenes and extremely linear corridors. Story is alright, but does slog a bit in the middle parts.

Having just finished my first (and only, at least for a while) play-through, clocking in at a smidge over 114 hours I'll keep my review mercifully short and just give you the key pros and cons to consider if you're thinking of dipping your feet into this beast:


[h3] PROS [/h3] 
- Beautiful world and a rich story are a given and almost every aspect of the larger-than-life 40k verse is at least mentioned or briefly touched upon if not shown. From the time-before-time ancient creation myth of the war between the Old Ones and the C'tan all the way to ""modern day"" Big Bad Thing; from the easy-going feudal life of farming serfs on an agri-world to to the depraved excesses of Comorragh'an high society. All of it is likely to go over the head of a non-fan, but makes the game a gem for someone who is into 40k.

- Relatively low barrier to entry.  The great many 40k-isms are helpfully highlighted and disambiguated with tooltips in plain English. 

- Solid and enjoyable combat system. If you like X-com in its modern incarnation - this is effectively X-com in 40k so you won't go wrong. That said be prepared for frustrations - Hit Chance is capped at 95% so situations where you have stacked 5 skills on a operative shot to disable and debuff a critical boss only for it to go ""pew"" and hit the bulkhead are.... more than present.

- No Tau. Freakin' space weaboos.

- Companions are compelling and act appropriate to their lore and setting overall.  Though that does come with a caveat of a bunch of them being aggressively racist and classist. Though hell, if kicking peasants for darign to look at your boots and throwing feasts in your own honour is a thing you like - you'll be happy to know there's almost always an option for that.

- Choice is present and not without consequence. You're not limited to being ""Emperor banzai!"" all the time. You *can* be if you wish, but you can also choose to be a Heretic. Or an imperious a**hole. Or, god-forbid, the worst one of all.... a decent person. Though you better make sure you minmaxed those stats for that one - being a decent human being is punishable by horrors beyond your imagination in the 40k verse, unless you manage to pass rolls at -100.


[h3] CONS [/h3] 

- BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS. First two Chapters are good. Chapters 3-5 are a nightmare. The Chapter 5 companion quest *appears* to just be bugged, but if forced to launch you'll realize it has no artwork done for it - it's just not finished. Do yourself a favour and install ToyBox before embarking on this 100-hour journey - You'll need it.

- Class progression is j-j-j-jank as h-h-h-heck.  You really need to plan all 2 archetypes in advance the moment you're picking your background or else you're going to get the rug pulled out from under you. Oh you selected an Officer for your RT and went heavy into Fellowship? Good, good. You want to continue down this lien and go into Grand Strategist? Well sucks to be you because that scales off Intellect instead. Or What? Bounty Hunter? Lol unless you were dumping hard into Perception and Ballistics you're SOL. Oh and did you also pick a Psyker background? Hahaha, hope you have that Willpower as well my dude. Please Owlcat, just let us mix'n'match abilities between Archetypes ffs!

- No Ork companion. Missed opportunity.

- Low equipment variety. A lot of it is hyper-specialised and rarely outweighs the bog standard +% armour/dodge/hit chance until wayyy later in the game. The issue is exacerbated tenfold for xenos and astartes companions. Yrliet literally has 4 equip-able armour in the whole game and only 1 set of gloves she can wear (because of a bug, she's not supposed to) and no boots. Even worse for Ulfar who only gets a helmet outside of jewellery.


[h3] IN CONCLUSION [/h3] 

Overall the game gets a recommendation from me. It's already more than worth the price of admission as-is, and with a few months of polish, mods and dlc it'll be an absolute no-brainer buy for any fan of CRPG's or 40k in general.

Notes at the time of this review.

Pros:
- finely crafted CRPG with a good story.
- fun gameplay.
- character build customization has lots of variety.
- the music is really cool, it does a good job for setting up the overall theme of the game.
- it does a good job at portraying the warhammer 40k universe.

Cons:
- you will need a certain resource in order to advance in the story, at the time of this review there does not seem like there is a way to replenish this if you use it up by accident like I did. i had use Toybox (a cheat engine) to replenish it. This was the most annoying issue I had encountered. Seems like a bug or a design issue. In any case it almost made me want to make this a negative review because of it so keep that in mind.
- quite a few bugs, both visual and technical (weird highlighted objects in the environment, some character perk/abilities do not seem to work properly)
- no option to scale the UI, it can be hard to observe some visual elements like character buff icons for example.
- too much flavor text in certain cases in my opinion, sometimes the lingo makes no sense, making it hard to understand the plot of quests. (thinking of companion Pasqal's questline)",1703346454,1703346454,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are random and insane difficulty spikes and at least once per time i play, i ask myself ""what were they thinking jesus christ"" e.g. the heralds of corruption giving bonus 36 wounds to all enemies every round including other heralds of corruption. They made this game like a tabletop DM who has no interest in letting you play the way you enjoy playing, but rather forces you to play how they think you should play. there is no flexibility in encounters and if you don't have characters built for optimal cheese strats, you will get killed again and again and again.

Personaly i have liked this more than the the other Pathfinder games. 

What i liked:
- Plot is deep and realistic.
- World design is great
- Cool new setting and mechanics with the void ship
- nice xcom type combat
- Item design feels great and tied to the warhammer lore
- nice graphics & runs great
- The game feel HUGE
- Lots of novel mechanics
- Low/no sandbox element (personaly i love this)

What could be a bit better
- The class progression and mix-match system is a headache and if you compare this with respecs costing a finite resource this is very annoying.
- There is a huge ammount of mechanics that you got to learn and adapt to, its very hard to figure synergies and understand what works best.
- Level design is a bit shallow at times, would love if some maps had better depths, riddles etc.

Advice - Put your headset on and immerse yourselves into the WH40k universe. Do not bother with class builds, guides and mechanics, choise impacts. Instead go with what you feel you wanna play lore wise and the game is going to reward you for that.

""Haha, what if we just threw like 15 dudes against the player at once. And what if we made it so that the enemy A.I actively cheats every combat encounter. Who gives a shit about the rules, fuck the player.""-OwlCat's motto for encounter design.

Some of my favorite highlights.
-Getting sniped, the enemy sniper not moving a fucking inch, then the exact same person he sniped is cannot snipe him back. Over a dozen times I've had a situation where some bullshit A.I literally shoots through walls, cover and deals a buncha damage, doesn't move and then either my MC or Yrlet who was the one shot cannot shoot them back with a fucking sniper rifle.

-Enemy having basically a 100% chance of hitting at least 2-3 shots from burst fire, but with almost 80 Ranged weapon skill and my party member can't hit one. Okay, cool thanks. High cover? Haha nope go fuck yourself. More fucking times than i can count i've had an enemy with literally 0 cover burst fire one of my units who are in high cover, hit 2-3 shots, deal a quarter of my units hp then not move. But when I return with a REALLY good weapon skill on an enemy out in the open. ""UwU Sowwy, you miss all your shots."" Only then to get burst fired by the same bullshit again.

-Parrying just doesn't work. Oh? Did you parry an attack? Take 18 points of damage anyway. I have used the vangards defensive stance, returned the attack because it was a parry and still taken damage more than fifteen times.

-Enemies literally moving into the walls, shooting my units like they don't have cover, then staying in the walls so I have to restart the fight. This one i'm sure is a bug, but it's happens several fucking times, the first god damn chaos marine, ran INTO the fire of the ship he destroyed, gunned down three of my party members in cover with one volly, hitting every single one of his shots, then when I try to return fire FROM ON TOP OF ONE OF THE BODIES. nope, can't target him. He can target me, but haha go fuck myself i can't target him. He didn't leave the fire and literally not a single angle i got on him with the three remaining members I had could shoot him in the four turns i lived and I had all three of them in very different angles all of which stated he was in sight and I repeatedly moved them to try and get an angle on him. Or my other favorite, I'll be above an enemy, unable to shoot them because of the angle, but they can still shoot me just fine. Lasgun, meltagun, shotgun.

-""Making encounters is hard, lets just put five or six enemies in a room with you having minimal cover and jack their hp to 100+. That's fair right?"" Boy, I love having several enemies who just have 100+ hp, that can then rush you down, deal 1/3rd of a units hp while unless you choose to cheese it, you are basically pissing in the wind at them.

Absolute dogshit encounter design and whoever designed most of these arena's and populated them unironically needs to be fired as well as anyone who looked at them and passed it off. I'm on normal by the way.

Literally almost every other thing they get right, the visuals are fantastic, the story is well done, the universe is richly designed, but jesus fucking christ, it should not feel like every god damn encounter i'm facing off an A.I that only knows how to cheat and couldn't play fair if it's life was on the line.",1703321913,1703321913,False,7,6,0.555046379566192627,0,True,False,False

It is my recommendation to anyone who enjoys video games NOT to buy any of Owlcat's products. They do not sell quality. They are sneaky and shady. They do not listen to the people they ask to test their games. If they did, Rouge Trader would still be in development.

I have had a declining opinion of Owlcat for a while now but this is the nail in the coffin. In 6 hours I have encountered a plethora of bugs, including one that completely broke a fight and lost me over an hour of gameplay. As someone who runs two businesses and doesn't get a lot of time to enjoy his hobbies anymore if I pay for a $70 title I expect it to be free of glitches and bugs that prevent me from playing the game properly when it is being sold as a genuine fully finished product and not an alpha, beta or early access environment.

This game NEEDED to be an early access release if the release date was unavoidable. It is clear Owlcat in their infinite greed couldn't conceive of missing out on Xmas sales and so rushed this out early. 

6 hours is about as much as I can stomach and this is coming from a guys so in love with the 40K setting that I fall asleep every night to lore videos on it. From what I can see whoever was in charge of getting the Lore correct did a pretty great job overall but the actual game itself is just a mess. I am assuming this was a decision made my Executives and not Game Developers but considering I haven't seen any Owlcat developers trying to distance themselves from the game on Social Media I honestly don't know, maybe this was a dev decision and if it was have some shame.

You people don't deserve to be a games company

EDIT: After a few patches I can still confirm this $70 fucking title still doesn't even have finished combat. I don't know who is directly to blame at Owlcat whether it is lazy devs or a stupid group of studio executives but if it was up to me I would be sacking whoever the fuck was responsible for this god awful release.

Review in Full: (Spoilers)

So this game is really something special and i wish i loved it more than i do right now because it does so many things right when it comes to the setting. But at the time of writing this im just exhausted with it. Let me explain.

On Story; 
The game is really good at story telling as youd generally expect from Owlcat. Each character has good reasons for being how they are and youre interactions with them given your standing and theres makes sense. The progression from a nobody to a guy thrust into a position of unknown responsibilities to a Lord of your own Domain is done well and there werent very many points in the story where i felt like i wasnt free to choose my own path in it all. Youre for the most part free to choose in every situation exactly what kind of man you want to be even that of a Heretic (Emperor have mercy on your damned soul). However, everything starts to break down right about the time you hit the end of chapter 3. Once i got into the Dark City i lost my grounding with the story as a whole. Aside from the fact that a trip here should be a game over screen, escaping should be almost impossible much less killing your way out. After this part of the game i couldnt get back into it, not even because the Dark City shouldnt be survivable, but because the rest of the story after that seems less fleshed out, random even, or maybe just less cohesive. I felt like after my return, the entire story was written by 30 different writers all going in a different direction.

On the Combat;
The game does things very well and its the xcom 2 style warhammer game i had hoped for. I had an overall great time with the combat system as far as how its used by the player. However, the game like many of its cousins has no concept of the phrase action economy. A term a learned as a writer for DnD campaigns, its making sure that the amount of actions the enemies can take does not so overbearingly outweigh the amount of actions your players can take, otherwise the player is watching the game play itself and a game is about how fun it is to be played by the players, not the NPCs.

There are ways to level this scale a bit if you run 2 officers with the right builds you can take 3 even 4 turns before the 2nd round has even started. But heres the catch, to do so you either have to take one of the pre built companions with this archetype even if theyre abilities do not match your team, or build one from scratch and miss out on those companion specific dialogues and choices. Then theres the problem with the enemies youre fighting. Most of the time youll be fighting mobs of low health low skill enemies, and i do mean MOBS of them even early on in the game you could be outnumbered 20 to 6. So given that you only have so many actions and are so often surrounded and outnumbered youd think that you should build your team to deal with that problem effeciently, as its 90% of your encounters. Youd be wrong. Very wrong.

This game will throw difficulty spikes at you that are almost insurmountable odds if you dont have the correct builds to deal with them. One famous example is the Chaos Space Marine fight, your first real skill check in the game. At first this fight infuriated me because even on Normal difficulty the way the fight is set up will delete you in just a few turns. And if like me up to that point you had built to deal with the 90% of your problem, that being outnumbered by mobs, youll have no chance at wining this fight. The amount of health this boss has and at the stage of the game he is, youll be very hard pressed to deal with him if you dont have some way of doing high single target damage and granting extra turns. If he wasnt enough you also have multiple mobs spawn in the fight as it goes on, while youre on a time limit to kill the marine and theres a sniper outside of your reach that will 1 shot your weaker characters. This is just the first example of many i could point to in the game that give you zero options. Such as the fight in the throne room against the Drukhari.

And it only gets worse as the game goes on, enemies will have health bars that seem randomly generated theyre so high. At the time of writing ive just completed Chapter 4 and found myself dealing with multiple boss fights stacked way against me and with health in the thousands while even my Space Marine companion was sitting at less than 400. Not to mention the Chaos Space Marines just get randomly more health in this chapter, 7-800 a piece and theres more than 1 along with the boss. And when i saw a health bar that numbered at nearly 7,000 hp on normal difficulty and he had mobs. I just lost all ability to take this game seriously. It starts out slow and gradual but be warned that you will be constantly outnumbered, under leveled, and over fucked in most of this game.

Overall;

I would recommend buying it even with the many many bugs, but its with the warning that you risk running into the same wall of disbelief that i did. With health bars in the sky and so many enemies around that even a Krak grenade cant deal significant damage to, it becomes a game thats punishing the player for playing. I genuinely dont believe the last chapters of the game were play tested at all. We are the guinea pigs for that, evidenced by the included bug report button. Play it and enjoy what of the game you can, but right now i can only play so much of it a time before taking a break because its just exhausting to deal with.",1703238942,1703316990,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is fun, the main problem is it's early access, and clearly rushed out the door. The game mostly functions until the end of Act 3, then as other people have said, it turns into a buggy mess. I finished Act 4, quit at the beginning of Act 5, because most of my playtime is having to reload maps or restart Act 3 entirely due to bugs that literally soft lock your game. I.e., some Act 4 quests don't trigger and you can't move ahead, apparently based on some conditions in Act 2 and 3.

So in essence, the thumbs down is because you're paying to be a play tester. In fact it's literally baked into the experience. There's a big ""report bug"" icon right there with the rest of the game icons, and a report bug loading screen tip. They released the game partly finished, so people can play test it live, and in a year or two they'll release the ""definitive"" edition for more cost with most of the bugs fixed.

Just a few of the bugs I've run into:

- Game soft locks in combat, when an enemy ranged unit tries to move back, runs into a wall mid-movement, and the game then sits there with the enemy randomly running against the wall. If you sit for 20-30 mins, it will eventually skip the enemy's turn. But that enemy can no longer take damage, so there's no way past the combat.

- Some talents and passives in the skill tree don't work as intended, and you can end up doing less damage or taking more damage, by picking skills meant to do more damage or take less damage.

- They didn't balance the faction and colony stuff after Act 3. You require massive numbers to do new colony projects, but there's no way in game to reach the reputation you need, so you're soft locked out of the higher tiers of colony development.

- The reputation system doesn't work. Some dialogue choices don't give you points like they're supposed to, and after Act 3 the skill checks double out of nowhere. So even focusing your character to min/max in certain areas, you're soft locked out of dialogue options for the rest of the game, because there's no catch up mechanic for rep, and start failing stuff like trap skill checks.

- Skill checks don't work in certain key events. There's some events that give a instant game over if you fail skill checks. If you pick the skill checks that are green (you meet the requirements) you fail and it's game over. If you pick the skill checks that are red (you don't meet the requirements) you pass for some reason.

- Your character can turn invisible, so there's just your equipped weapons floating in the air. Luckily this can be fixed by restarting.

- Quests are a mess. Even ones you complete won't flag as completed, or will gray themselves out, including main story quests, so you have no way to tell if you did them or not. Some quests simply stop working, depending on what dialogue option you pick. There's also no information for some quests, with no idea where to go or who to talk to. During quests, dialogue can bug out and end your run. For example, you start a dialogue, the camera randomly pans over to the middle of nowhere, and no matter what option you click the dialogue never advances.

And on and on... so giving a thumbs down, because this was obviously a design choice. The fact the bug reporting is built into the game the way it is shows that they knew the state of the game when they released it. I haven't reported a single one of the bugs I ran into and encourage others to do the same. As a paying customer, the product either works or it doesn't.

Many people are reporting game breaking bugs in chapter 3 and beyond. I was only in chapter 1 when I wrote this review. While I still believe this game is awesome, it feels like a Beta and not a full release. Really disappointed. I wish there was a middle thumb - as I want to recommend the game, but the developers releasing the game in this state is a business practice I do not want to encourage. You may want to wait for patches.  Leaving review as positive in hopes that patches will come.

Original Review:
Shaping to be one of my favorite CRPGs of all time. The setting does so much to make it interesting, and the story so far has been a lot more captivating than Pathfinder: Kingmaker (haven't played much of Wrath of the Righteous, so can't compare this with that game. I loved Kingmaker, but got burnt out after 80 hours). Your choices seem to really matter. I also like the companions a lot more in this one. I had my clear favorites in Kingmaker, but here I struggle to decide who to take on a quest. Combat is awesome and designed to be turn based from the ground up (unlike Owlcat's previous games). There are a lot less trash mobs and combat encounters are fewer but feel more engaging and interesting than Owlcat's previous titles. I feel I've barely scratched the surface of the story, this game is huge! Hopefully I don't get burnt out with it, as I definitely want to see how this one ends. I have encountered bugs, but trust me, this game is worth getting now -- especially if you like Warhammer 40K.",1702704700,1703308776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first half of this game is amazing and just hooks you in while the second half is just horrible. So many bugs that prevents you completing quest, meeting party interactions, or even just playing the game. It is super disappointing and just the state of this game is horrible.

Meanwhile other classes hit just over 100 damage if they try really really hard.

Rogue Trader is deeply ambitious but also deeply flawed. There's about 25-60 hours of solid gameplay before everything breaks - I had an absolute blast up until Chapter 4. But right now it's physically impossible to beat this game without modding tools to brute force your way through.

Kingmaker is a genuinely unfun game with little interesting characters and an over world map that is akin to teeth pulling and cbt. Wrath of the righteousness however is an excellent game oozing with character and an over world map that manages to be only kind of annoying; and at worst it makes you feel like your tripping up stairs. So after the improvement that pathfinder found i had so much hope that they would take the good from their previous titles and keep running with it but this game goes 1 step to the side and 2 steps back. 
The Story and Characters:
its told beautifully at first. The stakes are immediately high and the villain is clearly laid out before you so that an object of hate can be dangled on a string to keep you coming back in to take another swing at it. After the intro though it isnt told beautifully at all, in fact it isnt told what so ever. Besides for the brief encounters with your retinue aboard your ship the game is eerily silent and everyone feels like a mute. Doesn't matter if a bomb shell is being dropped on you or a new villain is cutting the throats of those closest to you not a single new person says a word... Why? Wrath of the righteousness was perfectly inter spliced with characters in your party giving their mind on the situation or having personalized dialogue in the middle of gameplay, where did that go? It added so many layers to the cast that it was a treat to hear and made the choice between resting to get your health/spells back alongside getting to know your companions more interesting as you had to balance out how much corruption would spread to the world and how much time you would lose, as you were on a time limit. Now everyone just stands around and says nothing or very little. They dont even have the brains to question any action you perform in the game, even when those actions are clearly heretical and have obvious and instant ramifications. Everyone is just your yes man. I dont feel like i'm travelling with a party of PEOPLE, who all have there own opinion on what it is you are doing. They all just feel like a sheet of paper for me to doodle over and occasionally get told by the narrator that i wasnt allowed to color over there because it was outside the lines. I am 4 acts in and know so little about these people besides for their obvious character trait i.e angry military guy, devout sister of battle, rogue psyker. Besides for those things i learned that the start nothing new ever/rarely ever comes to light about anyone you know; and i would love to talk about new people you meet outside of the party but they only fall into 1 or 2 categories. 1. They will die very soon after meeting them or 2. They just spout exposition at you to get the story moving forward and besides that they tell almost nothing of who they are. How am i to get invested in anyone if half of them just die immediately anyways and the other half dont care to have an actual conversation with me? It is so frustrating and boring all at the same time. 
The combat. 
My god have we fallen far... It is easily the jankiest it has ever been while simultaneously being the most restrictive. They give you so much movement, i think 8, and so much AP, i think 6, a turn but let you do nothing engaging with it. Want to play a melee class? hope you like attacking 1 enemy and then losing all movement so that you cant go and attack more enemies. Oh but that didnt matter anyways because you only get 1 attack per turn anyways, barring 1 skill you can pick up.   So no going around and indiscriminately mowing down the enemies of man and delivering righteous retribution for your fallen comrades, instead you get to kill 1 a turn and look bug eyed at the 4 that have now surrounded you. You want to be a run and gunner slinging steel and shooting holes through everyone on the battlefield? well lets stop you right there if you attack, i must reiterate, NO MORE MOVEMENT for the rest of the turn. Oh also you only get 1 shot a turn... you could use your fan the revolver move but you have about a 40% chance to hit at best against 2 enemies and will do about as much damage as a spitball spat through slightly sharp straw, so not much. What about playing a sniper that lays death to enemies from planets away? congrats you have picked the best weapon hands down no contest. As you only get 1 shot a turn you might as well make it count with the highest damage possible and your movement being ripped from you wont matter as you are already in the most optimal position, a million miles away. Before you ask about psyker abilities just dont, DO NOT LOOK IN THAT SECTION. it is hands down the worst thing in the game and provides 1, count them, 1 benefit over all other things you could be doing. That thing being the weakest damage in the entire game turning your character into the biggest loser in the entire imperium, that is your benefit you become the laughing stock have fun. I am a pyromancer 4 acts in and my MAX damage per turn with MAX stats is 11. Sniper lady does 60-70. Have fun.
The over world.
My god they fucked it. Almost every time you jump anywhere on the over world you get into a fight. This would be ok if i could just travel from point A to B with out any hassle, i would be fine with a battle. But you cant just go from A to B like in the Pathfinder no no no you have to make 14 pit stops before arriving at your destination; And every single time you do you might have a fight so your 10 second trip that might have 1 battle taking maybe 4 minutes has now turned into a 45 min bathroom break. That you will have to do TWICE once to get there and once to get back, or to wherever else you go in the galaxy. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS OK? please tell me. The worst part about all of these games is the random unscripted encounters. Why would you make 40% of my playtime be those, they arent fun and add nothing. 
Conclusion.
If i hadn't have played wrath of the righteousness first i never would have picked up this game or kingmaker. There is so many more tiny issues i have with this game that just keep adding up making it such a grating experience. I would write more but i just cant bring myself to bother. im glad i got this off my chest so i can finally uninstall the game.

If you have played BG3, this is like BG3 pre-alpha.
Lots of recycled content, and a super dated low effort unity engine cut and paste art style.
In the city theirs this background noise like background radio chatter or something, anyway I don't know where they got the sound from but I seriously hope it has a public licence because I have heard it before. 
Kinda lacking in content and imagination. 
Characters level up every fight, but its just busy work. Characters don't really change or get anything new.

99% of your fights is just one tapping people at range.
1% moving your melee characters within charge range so you can charge one dude, then melee another.
And 99% of your enemies are just one tap meat sacks, of no threat.
I had to look up a guide for the prison fight, not because it was actually hard, but because it was so buggy I couldn't figure out how to actually kill the mirrors. The enemy shoots them and does damage, but you don't...
They then reuse the mirrors in another fight.
The most interesting thing that can happen in fights is when your own psychers crit perils of the warp, and a random event bless you from the warp and breaks up the mediocrity. It was disappointing seeing how low effort cut and paste the Demonette was though, but it was sure exciting actually seeing a enemy that wasn't exactly the same as the previous 1000.
So its like click to move, then press button to activate an attack, then click on enemy to apply attack.
Theirs zero automation and as you get higher in skill levels you just get more and more of these rubbish skills that actually don't do anything of interest except for soften up the enemy for dice rolls.
Each character type I think gets 1 actual attack that isn't just shoot or stab.
Like fighters can charge (extra movement and attack)
Shooters can 'charge' (extra movement and attack)
Officers can 'charge' (give someone else a half turn)
These are all just slightly different from the why am I doing this combat style of having to press the melee button then having to click on the enemy you want to melee
Of course they could have designed this to be smarter automatic and less mind numbing but that would probably halve the content for the game and the play times.
Magic characters get 1 interesting attack either chain lightning, or warp spray.

At least you don't have to go around picking up rubbish, I hate rubbish picking up simulators, this solves that problem by letting you 1 click loot an entire area. Of course they could just be different and not make a game with any amount of rubbish picking up simulation, but its a tenant of the games industry so I guess you can't get too radical. 

Overall it plays like some unreal mod from 2000's era...
Like none has actually played the game and given feedback except for some dude doing this as a side project.

Aside from the game play and the presentation.
The lore/story side of the content is very nice.
No idea how a normie would feel about this game, but for a 40k junkie this is very nice high grade main vein.

The fact that garbage like this can get so highly reviewed is indicative of a permissive degenerate society, the same society that lets a French patisserie keep a +4.5 review on google maps, despite them admitting to not using butter in their pastries, after I returned what I purchased because it smelt rank. Do you know how old it would have to be for fake butter to go off? Try leaving a tub of margarine outside, it will last as long as the Emperor on his golden throne who has clearly forsaken us.

Lastly I'm currently stuck in the city and can't take off. They haven't actually coded for it. Because I guess they didn't except or play test, someone finishing most of the first city.

First things first; The game in it's current state is quite buggy. Some quests are broken (or force you to make choices you don't want just to be able to progress), some talents interact in strange ways and there's a bunch of small issues in combat and space combat. Most of these will probably be fixed in 6-12 months.

For the actual game and story: it's really good. An uncut gem in it's current state. If you like 40k you will love how this game portrays the 40k setting. It's very on point and you really feel like a rouge trader in the dark millenium.

My main complaint is that the game wants you to go down certain 'morale routes' and always pick those options when avaliable. If you don't earn a high enough 'rank' in your chosen morale, you get locked out of the option of even pocking those choices. At the end of the game I couldn't choose ANY of the morale exclusive dialogue options which was kinda dissapointing.

Gameplay wise: the game starts out kinda difficult but around the penultimate chapter you'll probably have one or two characters carrying your entire team. The last chapter my Arch-militant pretty much cleared out entire combats in the first turn (played on standard difficulty).

However it feels like some of the classes are kind of.. pointless. The operative in particular doesnt really do anything for the team and I never felt they had any impact. Soldiers/Warriors/Officers going into Arch-Militant/Vanguard/Master Tactician are pretty much the bread and butter of your team imo.

I also found it kind of sad that psykers and navigators weren't really classes per say, but rather backgrounds that just gives you some extra options beside whatever your class gives you.

The maps in general are cool as hell, well designed and a viasual treat. However some maps are narrow and cramp, which literally locks your space marine companion from moving around while in combat. It feels kinda bad to have to reload and engage the enemy from s different direction because there is an oil-barrel in the way of your space marine buddy.

Another pet peeve I have with the design is that sometimes there are areas with hazards (like hot steam, fire or magic) that hurts you and the 'gameplay' boils down to selecting every character individually and navigating them through these traps one by one. Imo, that is just busywork and completely pointless.

Beside all the bugs and some odd inconsistencies at times (like how I killed a major character that randomly shows up right before the last mission like nothing happened) - the game is actually really good, the story is very compelling and I do recommend you play it. Maybe just wait a couple of months so that the worst bugs are ironed out.",1703292799,1703292799,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I am currently dead stopped in chapter 4 as I have enountered,  yet another game breaking bug, but Toybox can't fix it as it's a quest progress issue. Every time I try to launch the last remaining quest in my log I instead am treated to a replay of the very first event that happens in chapter 4, I'm then dumped into the captains quarters with no progress, I can go back out to space, try again, happens again. 

Validating files doesn't fix it, reloading from an earlier save doesn't fix it, leaving the system and coming back doesn't fix it, relaunching the game doesn't fix it, reinstall doesn't fix it, nothing I can conceivably do has fixed the issue.

Let me start by saying whomever owlcat hired to make their advertisements that made this game look like a cheap mobile game needs to be fired. Seriously you almost never got my purchase because of the ad. That being said everyone else that touched this project deserves a bonus. It is a flawless execution. I'm not usually a classic team RPG fan, well that is to say anymore; I played ALL of them from the SNES, Sega, Early PC era and at a certain time the magic of that game play wasn't there. This game captures that. If you never liked that format of game you might not like this one. But if you ever liked them, I think you will get hours of fun and plenty of replay value as you try out goofy character builds.

The next and honestly most important part. I have followed and loved GW IPs for about 25 years. This game captures the 40k feel PERFECTLY. Usually, other media around 40k turns up the edgy grim dark to 11 thinking that's all it is, or ignores the grim dark entirely and tries to make it scifi with some weird steam gothic punk vibe. Owlcat nailed it though. It's grim dark its horrible and freaky but theres humor and parody in it. It hits the flow without taking itself too seriously.

The good. So far after getting through most of the game it seems that the characters are really well done the prologue introduces a good start but chapter one will introduce the majority of the cast and they are all really well done, their voice actors are amazing and the characters are built with intrigue and charm. 

The player character has many options but three main 'morality' choices Dogmatic, Iconoclast, and Heretic
making the thought of three replays instant in the game. The warhammer 40k title is really well represented in this as we get to look through the lens of the grey area that is the rouge trader, taking any cuts in order to make order or chaos in the expanse.

The Bad. So far the character creator is by far the limited compared to the current modern standard, their main focus is portraits which all are done very well but are stuck to a limited quantity, Mostly each portrait covers generally the background options like Noble, commissar, psyker, ect. and a male and female variant. 

generally combat feels real hit or miss early on but much better later on, but I feel that is due to the archetype classes which can feel weak until hitting a sweet spot later into the game the easiest I can think of is the operator and solider archetype which feel weaker early but hit their stride around level 16 when you get another archetype to further specialize making both much more powerful. However operator combos still feel weak unless you go hyper single target focus like a certain companion you get on Janus early into the game. but the two companions you get at the start, Pascal and Idira never feel that strong more like skill jockies to pass certain kinds of skill checks in the game.

The Ugly. The game doesn't have much of this until the later sections where I started to notice straight up bugs that would prevent me from progressing though most of the time a simple restart of the game would fix it up it certainly was annoying and as of the time writing this I cannot progress to chapter 5 due to a bug that loads a space combat early and stops loading the game. so until some bugs are smoothed out it might be worth it to wait to buy if you intend on doing a long sit through the game.

There was a part in the game that had a check for 'morality' later on in chapter 4 that required a point that was far above what I had even though I felt I had made every single Iconoclast option I could pick, the only thing I can think about is missing one companion and ending another companion which both could have contained Iconoclast decisions to boost the 'morality' to a high enough score I imagine that this would not come up often with players as most people will probably collect the companions and not try to kill them, but there are plenty of times where the option to kill a companion does come up in dialog. overall a small tweak increase the 'morality' gain might be nice to allow for those end game dialog to be easier to obtain.

tl;dr

Theres more by the way, most quest dialogues are bugged out so you have to finish quests certain ways. normally the worst ways, if you can even finish them at all.

They dont make it clear that warp charter points are needed to chart routes to new systems so you have to fly back and fourth to get an event that gives you more, constantly doing boring battles in the ship in the meantime.

Quests bug out. get this right, one quest bugged out when I had 90 percent of my profit factor taken. I compelted the quest but it didnt actually complete so now I have like '10' PF for the rest of the game. So I am locked out of all the items you can purchase for the entire run.

Develop a game with all the makings and show of a real gem, only to have it fall apart on the later half due multiple game breaking bugs. As someone who has played both pathfinders that were developed by Owlcat, I was really hoping this cycle of releases would end. Unfortunately, this isn't the case, and just like Kingmaker and WOTR I'm going to have to shelve the game for another half year to a year before attempting a play though them again. I say this but fun fact, I never actually have finished any of their games, because by the time their games are at a playable state I would have attempted multiple failed playthroughs before just giving up on the game entirely. I wish I was exaggerating but this is now 3 for 3 for my first play through of a new release from the devs being stopped by game breaking bugs. Several hours wasted because I gaslit myself into thinking it would be different this time. At this point they should just release the entire game on EA, as the content contained in early access is the only reliable part of the game where I don't have to fear content loss due to the game borking (ie. quests failing to continue, cut scenes failing to start, abilities/items just not working as intended). At least then those who pay for EA games can do some more thorough unpaid (negative pay?) QA  and prevent the general consumer base from buying a half baked product.  

This is not constructive criticism. This is more of a warning for anyone wanting to play this game to its fullest potential. Don't. At least not as of 12/22/23. I recommend any prospective buyers to monitor discussion forums/Public Discord of the state of the game. There are dozens of posts regarding multiple things in the game not working, and multiple more people confirming them. Ignore the claims of official patch posts stating things are fixed. They aren't. Wait until the complaints die down and it becomes universal to the player base that the game is ""playable"" to the end .  Don't be me and assuming the devs got it right this 3rd time around. They didn't. the game needs more time in the oven. And when its cooked good I'm sure Rogue Trader will be one of my favorite warhammer games of all time bar none. 

In the end of the day I do still want this team to continue making games. I really do. Developers making CRPGS are to far in between, and their post patch work always delivers (after several months after release of course) But for right now,  nothing has changed since kingmaker.  With this release going forward, I think I'm going to be more cautious with Owlcat's future endeavors. And you should too. 

P.S will update once the game is playable and I finish it.

I have GM'd multiple campaigns for the Rogue Trader 40k roleplay game and was super excited when this game was announced. 40k games can be very much hit and miss but this is a hit.

I am 30 hours in and am loving this game. The art style feels grim dark and the dialogues are a lot of fun. There are a lot of nods to the existing lore of the Koronus Expanse which I appreciated and for the most part the game respects the lore of the wider setting. I am not so sure about the romance options in the game but they are easy enough to ignore (no thank you mutants). The game goes out of it's way to make you feel like a Rogue Trader and I love it. People announce you in a pompous style if that is your fancy (yes) or you can be boring and low key if you want (boo). 

At 30 hours in I have not seen too much of the story unfold but so far I am liking what I am seeing. It is a pretty standard 40k plot with a Koronus Expanse twist and I am here for it. 

The combat system is recognisable from the TTRPG but slightly different, particularity in how levelling up works. It works for the computer adaption and combat scenes feel cool and tactical.

This said, Rogue Trader is everything I've ever wanted in a 40k game. The scale? Immaculate. The combat? A blood blender. The aesthetics? Worthy of the emperors glory. All of this packed into Owlcat's always delicious and exciting choose your own adventure storytelling. 

For anyone who isn't a purist that only huffs Space Marine farts, this game is a no brainer.  The freedom of choice has been desperately needed in the 40k universe for ages. Owlcat has finally capitalized on everything other studios can never understand. This universe is massive and full of color and life. The savagery is always accompanied by humanities endless desire to live. Whether that's pure survival instinct, or to live every moment as deliciously as possible. You are always supplied the temptation of heresy at every opportunity.

This is the most interesting the 40k universe has ever been (in a video game.) It would be an absolute travesty to not support this product. If you need to wait a year for bug fixes, that's okay. But for those who grew up with 40k, and have only had our little skull sacs to paint this vast universe, this game is exactly what you've been waiting for.

It's incredibly easy to be a hater regarding the rushed release. Owlcat doesn't have the budget nor do I think they could have supported the absolute years of love and patience Larian put into BG3 prior to release. Its worth noting however, that Owlcat has already shown incredibly work ethic and progress in less then a month. They still have been supporting their last pathfinder game with new content updates and DLC.

The future is very bright for 40k right now. I hope Games Workshop recognizes the success of BG3, and are able to see the absolute goldmine Owlcat is sitting on.

I've been trying to level up me ship so I can actually stand a chance in these ludicrously unfair battles. Every damn time it's 3-4 ships that attack you before you get a chance to act, leaving you with (if you're lucky) half your hull and then you need to somehow kill 2-3 of them on your first turn otherwise they'll just finish you off. I am so entirely tired of it being that way every time. It's exhausting.

Then there's the ground fights, which are so hit or miss it's stupid. For example, as of writing this I'm stuck on a fight with a bunch of druhkari. They've got 10 troops, 4 of which are these gunners who can, in a single turn, down one of your party reliably 90% of the time. I've tried focusing them, I've tried getting to a more advantageous position, I've tried hiding my troops behind a goddamn wall, I've tried it all. The GREAT part is, because they're space elves, they usually get initiative before I get a chance, so I'm on average losing 2-3 of my party before I even get a chance to damage them. On TOP of that, half the time my abilities just... don't? They do the animation, but nothing happens. They don't even roll to hit, they just *poof*. The game balance is all over the damn place. It's either you're chewing through mooks that can't even scratch your party, or you're getting pancaked by something that one shots your whole party, with very little in-between.

This game, despite being about a guy/gal who can buy legitimately whatever they want they're so rich, is excessively stingy about giving the player better equipment especially when compared to the enemies you have to deal with. It would also be nice if there was any indication that you're in the wrong neighborhood so I don't spend half an hour completing a puzzle just to get run over by an encounter I didn't see coming.

Furthermore, sometimes the characters will chirp out events that haven't even happened yet to characters I haven't met yet.

I'm only playing on Daring and I loathe to think what the higher difficulties would require.

Continuing this Review after playing a bit longer:

Absolutely do not buy this game right now. If you do and get to chapter 3, you'll know. Seriously this is the worst ""meta or die"" crap I've ever played. There is no room for fun unless you're playing on the lowest difficulty setting. I wouldn't know. This third act is so bullshit unfun and you can permanently lose companions from not being built for that specific shit. Also, enjoy not being able to heal, Traps taking away half of your stats and to top it all off, more unfair combat scenarios where you're outnumbered 3-1 with enemies that 1-2 shot your crew. OH AND EVEN MORE FUN!!!! They take all of your gear away and give you absolute garbage to work with. OH AND SOME MORE FUN ON TOP OF IT!!! I only found 2 of my companions, so I'm working with half of my retinue against fights that would provide a hard challenge even if I had everything in my favor.

I'm uninstalling, and I'm begging people not to give these idiots any more money. Yeah, I got plenty of time invested into this game trying to find the fun. I thought I almost had some in act 2. All of that time wasted. Absolutely 100% wasted. Bad game, made by useless devs.

So I am a Warhammer noob. Know next to nothing about the lore. With that said, there is a story here that is engaging that you can follow without knowing everything about the universe. The tactical combat and cover mechanics are cool and feel appropriate for a sci-fi setting. 

Disappointingly, the game is very lacking in several areas:

1) It's still pretty buggy, to the point where sometimes I can't tell if something is a bug or that's how it's supposed to be. 2 of the same character showing up in a cutscene, getting trapped in an area, questlines and dialogues not working properly, etc. This game seems like it needed a little more polish before release.

2) The character progression and leveling up system is at best overly complex, at worst provides you with a bunch of formulas for how ability effects are numerically calculated. Leveling up feels pretty meaningless when most levels only offer you a +5 or +10 to a skill or some ability that just influences one of your other abilities. It's especially glaring/disappointing in the psyker progression. You get like 1-2 actual psyker abilities every 10 levels or so (essentially one every act) only to see that some of them don't even have FX (laserbeam supposed to shoot out and my character just waves their hand and the enemy takes damage >.>)

3) There are sections with weird difficulty spikes? Feels like sometimes the game just gets whacky hard out of nowhere. (e.g. fighting aledari or drukahri who have like 170% dodge? Then the whole fight is debuffing them, nuking, rinse/repeat - not very fun imo) Later acts you fight mecha bosses and they have so much armor, do so much damage, and it doesn't feel clear about why my attacks are so ineffective even when I'm debuffing, have all the best equipment I've been able to get, have builds that make sense, doing the fight mechanics (e.g. destroy these battery things, etc.) I don't shy away from difficulty but if I'm gonna die at least make it clear why/what I should've done, y'know?

Has potential to be good after purging all the bugs and finishing the game (you can't call all the broken talents bugged, they just didn't test or finish them; in many cases it seems two different teams worked on the coding and the description of the talents).
Seems to limit the player heavily in his option to play the game, limited standard equipment for your party (example one heavy armor for your team (at the beginning) -> so you never skill your other team members to use the same skill/weapon/armor type if equipment is so tight). I would understand if equipment was random but it isn't. The game favors knowledge of where and when you get certain equipment.
Mercenaries and reskilling of your characters cost profit factor (money), especially annoying because of all the broken talents and not needed because the story companions already get extra talents and are stronger than your created mercenaries.
Enemy skills/talents/equipment descriptions are lacking. Most fights feel scripted (or perhaps bugged) and not organic. You wonder if the enemies play by the same rules as you (because of lacking information and arbitrary buffs instead of better equipment and/or skills).

 Great for 40k fans. Lore is ABUNDANT. 
 Also great for new people to 40k. The game takes its time to explain the fascinating lore through highlighted texts and dialogue options, so that makes it this game half video game half book. (There is alot of reading.)

Highly recommended if you like a deep turn based games with depth and a franchise with decades of rich lore.

It saddens me that, at least for the time being, I do need to cautiously recommend it. Rogue Trader is a lot of fun and is one of the few Warhammer 40k experiences that really seems catered to my tastes. However, it is still a bit buggy. I also found my first few hours very confusing as the character-building isn't very intuitive. Just as an example, I was really confused by how the character's health pool is referred to as ""Wounds"" in a system that also has entirely separate semi-permanent injury status effects.

Owlcat delivered an amazing world that is fun, engaging, and worth my hard-earned money. [/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]
-Familiar Owlcat artistic and mechanical styling (a pro for people who enjoy that, at least)
-amazing music; definitely suits the atmosphere
-a WOW factor when exploring new areas
-a feeling of morbid curiosity when learning about the dark world of the game
-You can definitely be evil. Evil path isn't just, ""Oh look! Fear my evil laugh and mean words!"". 
-The purchasing and inventory systems are great! I can loot EVERYTHING and everything has a use - whether for building rep or wearing. Nothing really has to sit around taking up space if you don't want it to.
-Nice touch with the character creation mirroring the profile pic. If you pick a photo, it makes a character with the same physical appearance for you.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Very complicated combat system; overwhelming at times, even for an experienced gamer like me who generally prefers complicated games. I imagine it wouldn't be as difficult for people who are familiar with Warhammer, though.
-The camera is kinda weird sometimes. It feels like there's too much ""world"" and it can't weave through it properly to let you see your people. Maybe a bug? The camera is just like the Wrath camera, but worse, so I'm hoping it's just buggy and will end up as smooth as Wrath at some point.
-I'd love more brown people portraits for character creation. Luckily, some people are already making portraits that you can import without too much fuss.
-PLEASE let us change archetypes when we retrain. PLEASE. This will save me from endless new character doom. I'm still learning the system, so I have to make a brand new character and re-do alllllll the things when I finally understand how a certain archetype works and then decide I hate it.

Even as someone who loved both of their Pathfinder games this just isn't doing it for me. I'm going to keep waiting to see if it clicks, but about 15 hours in and it just hasn't. I think a large part of this is going to come down to if you vibe with the 40K universe. This was my first foray into it and it's just not for me. Pretty much no character is likeable which isn't to say that there aren't cool moments like having Abelard introducing you is always fun. I do think it's well written and if you do like the 40K universe I do think the writting and narrative will really gel for you. However, what the warhammer universe needs isn't the God Emperor it's OSHA. 

Then you've got the owlcat problem. Their UI continues to leave a lot to be desired, it's still kind of a buggy mess I've had a few hard crashes already. This is where owlcat really needs to focus on their next game. The ship combat is straight trash and much like the crusade management in WoTR feels tacked on and is really unfun. The are the near constant trash fights that server no purpose, and little challenge. Because this game is full on turn based it's unnecessary padding and it takes way long that it should. This is in stark contrast to the main story fights that are really well done, but those consist of about 25% of all fights.

Owlcat is very good at being a rogue trader. They release games that you fall in love with but when you get about 40hrs in you start to release they you have been suckered. Their first game Pathfinder was epic until you got to the 3rd chapter. After that you realize that you are now a beta tester. The same thing happened with Pathfinder 2. I thought it was just tough luck, but this game again demonstrates their incompetence.

Im getting close to 100hrs and Im struggling to finish the story. They excel at story telling. However, just like the Pathfinder games everything went to crap after the 3rd chapter. For our convenience they have a little icon of a bug on the corner of the screen so we can be their beta testers. Basically, if you buy this game right now you are paying them to be a beta tester. 

Just like their other games, I’m sure this game will be great in a year. I really want to love this game. I spent about 30hrs reading all the lore that’s in the game. I’m invested and I’m still struggling to get to the end. I just wish I did not have to hack the game to get there.

I am at a lukewarm state of enjoyment, but sadly recommend waiting ~6 months for development of mechanics can be improved/finished up before others pick it up.

The bug with tiles being blocked has not been solved, and I have no way to determine if a move is possible if my current character can't reach the cell.  This has resulted in a number of extra injuries - which waste time by forcing you to reload to your ship and return to repair.  No actions mind you beyond mandatory extra loading.

The maps themselves need an overhaul, with such an emphasis on cover what is available is awful for a lot of fights, making them frustrating against hordes.

Overall implementation of tactics are also rather subpar- there is no difference for range beyond being in/out making your positioning on these maps not matter much beyond line of sight.  Unfortunately, the UI is garbage at displaying who you have line of sight to with thin lines that are easily obscured by any number of effects.  Also along this line there is no indicator for when you've flanked an enemy in cover beyond checking the value to hit to see if it's higher (hope you have an enemy out in the open for a comparison).

Even worse, the lines that appear are only for ranged weapons, so make sure you have a pistol on a caster or you have a much harder time previewing what line of sight melee weapon characters have.

At this point, if you don't mind a few (or a lot of) eye-rollers, the game is worth buying without wasting your time - it's playable to nearly the end in its current state without major issues hampering (or completely rolling back!) your progress.

I know Pathfinder (which is what Owlcat bases their combat off of) has funner combat despite being less complex as DnD aka BG3/Larian's combat design and the marketing if you've gotten it is kinda fishy or has an air of suspicious practices since Games Workshop tends to have a bad attitude when it comes to 40k money so how does that lead anywhere to my thesis?

The side content is a slog to trudge through (bear in mind I immediately ignored the main story ASAP), making me feel like I'm going to fall asleep at the entrance of the warp even getting your ship's nameless crew killed in a workplace 'accident' feels like a slog even more so than reading 70% of the game which I KNOW for most people they will have someone else read it for them or just do the Bethesda 1 Int answer of funny button and now Idira is dead *Spit* disgusting Psyker.

Combat is actually the best part in a universe that ONLY KNOWS WAR. But also Pathfinder combat is fun especially if you have a gun. Yes I play as a crazed gunman planning out my next terror attack and I will say rolling for each individual bullet is amazing because bullets like in reality can punch through people if they are close enough and if you're a terrible shooter every bullet will hit at least 1 person (maybe) through luck. Melee is okay but I mean it's there and it kills everything in 3 hits average if you're good with most attacks being 100% hit chance to include AOE.

Story wise 40k NEVER has any good character-centric stories in my experience MINUS the Space Marines to include Chaos, it makes sense when you consider the BLOAT that is 40k. But to outsiders, every faction legit has 20+ character for what feels like every sub-faction I'm being hyperbolic but having non-Space Marine characters is hard when they have become the flagship of who steers the world building. If you haven't figured I'm quite xenophobic to having normal humans be the MC because there isn't a normal human (that isn't a Psyker) I can think of in recent times who can measure up to being a reluctantly compliant Facists yet still commit the Holocaust kinda like the Night Lords. But yes I forget what I'm doing right now for the main story nor do I feel like it is my responsibility in fact being a crazed domestic terrorist (school-strelok) is actually funner currently.

Companions, kinda a mix bag waiting to romance Kroot man because funny birdman who eats people is funny to se-xxx fiend dark elf. At least I heard there was a Kroot follower still waiting.

Finally Leveling up. This game and probably every other Pathfinder game OVERLY EXPLAINS 1 skill that it feels like you bent yourself over so hard that your neutral stance is now face to ass and end up re-reading the skill again until you eventually say ah feck-it give me a skill improvement or proficiency upgrade. I don't know how but I understand that if my character is Smarter I make everyone stronger with my buffs, also sitting at the edge of the map makes my armor harder just because I exist in combat.

For mage lovers great news since this is WARHAMMER everyone is automatically a Warrior/Fighter/Ranger/Archer. Mages though exclusive club, only downside no real passives but hey I mean you can blow up the battlefield with 'Fireball' and cause the battlefield to suffer a warp phenomenon whatever that means.

It's awesome storytelling, but it does need some love.

Edit:

I guess i would warn people about the amount of stuff in this game. I watched a review (as i was playing) and it said it's over 100 Hrs.

There's not a lot of voiceover to this,  and it can be tedious with reading (if you aren't an avid reader), so be ready to read a lot of descriptive stuff about the situation, the room, etc.

If you can handle the above, knock yourself out. As i said initially, there is an AMAZING story in all this. The combat can get tedious, especially with the risk of using warp powers (JFC).

Wait, just a little, the game is fun but the bugs drag it down. Owlcat are working on fixing some of the issues and are hotfixing, but it does but a damper on things.
What i like:
40k world and setting are great.
Combat is challenging and itches the xcom tactical turn based itch (until it does, anyone in act 4 using cassia and argenta know what i mean).
A good mix of tactical turn based space combat, simplified colony management, world exploration (typical owlcat style) and well spaced out battles.

What i dont like:
Bugs - quests dont complete, cut scences play but the camera is out in the void somewhere, talents/abilities dont perform as intended.
Loading screens, who ever designed the quetzal temer mission... please have a word with yourself, 
Cost of respec, given the sheer amount of options, its very easy to gimp yourself and very expensive to respec -  advise the use of mods to repsec and play around with what works, either that or you have to look up builds online which i think ruins the experience.

Don't come into this expecting Baldur's Gate 3 levels of polish. As someone who loves CRPGs with surface level knowledge of WH40k universe, the learning curve is steep with this RPG. The ruleset is quite different from previous Owlcat games based on Pathfinder which is much more similar to D&D.

Having said all that, the worldbuilding in the game is excellent, characters are well hashed out and the story is pretty good so far. The combat is a bit boring at first but gets more fun as you level up and your characters become OP, unlocking cool synergies to demolish entire battlefields in a few short turns.

The ship to ship combat is fun and ""empire building"" mechanics are pretty straightforward but a step up from previous Owlcat games.

The heartbreaking thing about this is that the game is really good, the characters are interesting and the combat is fun when it works. However, that being said, the game is absolutely ruined by bugs. This is especially so if you want to play at harder difficulties. A lot of AOE abilities just won't proc, or your abilities will buff the enemies in addition to your characters. Quests don't work, and cut scenes will fail to trigger. It's absolutely awful.

The level of jank, bugs, uneven difficulty and other extremely frustrating elements in this game are inexcusable for a purchased game, let alone a 49.99 USD one. Even if the bugs were mostly fixed I still wouldn't recommend it because it desperately need balancing and difficulty spike smoothing. The difference between 'regular' and 'easy' (i.e. story) are like night and day in the later chapters. You can tell the second half of the game was rushed out.

However, the point where I knew I was done with the game was (mild spoilers) when you meet not one, not two but THREE evil twins of your character. For very flimsy reasons. That's such a hackneyed device I feel they were just running through a book of cliches towards the end.

All this is kind of a shame because there is a DAMN fine game lurking underneath all of this shit, but Owlcat knowingly served it up half-baked...

In case anyone from Owlcat is reading this, I would get a refund if I could. Since I can't, I will never, ever purchase a game from you ever again. Ever. Even if it gets stellar reviews. Even it comes out with no bugs. The only way to teach developers and publishers NOT to put out buggy betas and charge gamers for the privilege of testing them is to hurt them financially. I encourage everyone who reads this review NOT to purchase this game or get a refund, if possible. 

***

Fun, addicting game, massive in scope and detail; you can tell the people who made it care about getting the setting right...

...That said, I would strongly recommend AGAINST buying this game, at least for the time being.

First and biggest issue is the bugs. We're talking Bethesda level of bugs here, many of them locking you out of quests or are outright game-breaking. Don't make the mistake I did and buy it right away. Wait until the bugs are cleared up or, better yet, tell the publisher you'll buy it WHEN the bugs are cleared up. It's probably the only way we'll get them to stop releasing games that are basically still in beta. I'd get a refund right now if I hadn't played too long. The only reason I'm not madder is because, frankly, the game is massive, and so debugging it must be a nightmare.

Second, this game has some major difficulty spikes - very uneven challenge, which is apparently one of Owlcat's signatures. Fine if you're into that sort of thing, but frustrating. There are some boss levels that basically demand you mini-max to the nth and exploit the bewilderingly complex character builds, even on regular difficulty! Again, some people love this level of crunch - and the sad sense of superiority they can feel over those who don't munchkin everything, Excel Spreadsheet style - but I just find it exhausting and, more to the point, not fun.",1702796188,1703122030,False,4,0,0.545224308967590332,0,True,False,False

They fixed a number of game breaking bugs, but there's still much work to be done. Most notably having 2+ characters with seize initiative talent and either not having one of them in the party or they fell in combat will cause the game to be stuck in an infinite loop. There's still issues with some quests not triggering or being marked as complete as well, but much better state than in launch.

Old Review at Launch:
Great story and characters, but unfortunately can't recommend in its current state for many reasons. Everything seems smooth at first, but you'll soon likely run into the realization that the game is insanely buggy to the point of unplayable at times. 

The combat bugs are the worst. Unlike the Pathfinder series, if the turn based combat gets stuck, you can't switch to real time to debug it. Multiple times I was stuck waiting for a unit to finish their turn, but they never do forcing me to reload an earlier save as the only fix. There's also a bug with taking extra turns where it lock you into the unit that took the extra turn in an infinite loop. You'll develop an obsessive compulsive need to quicksave because of these bugs. 

On top of this, there's a number of quest bugs namely Yrilet's quest bugs where one of the bugs involve using a Persuasion check will bug out and lock you out of her ENTIRE quest chain, but she'll still complain to you about you not doing her quest. 

Not all passive skills work properly. Some don't work the same way as the text says they do and others just don't work at all as in you just wasted a skill point because the skill actually doesn't do anything. Other skills are poorly worded and have you scratching your head on what it actually is trying to do.

There's also visual bugs such as enemies fidgeting/glitching back and forth during combat(very annoying, but honestly just kill them) as well as some textures that aren't properly colored and just come out as a shade of magenta. 

I've played the early game (up to near end of Ch 2) in a few playthroughs due to me changing some decisions and remaking my MC and these's bugs occur every single time unlike launch Wrath of the Righteous at launch where I didn't notice any game breaking bugs until near the end.

The space combat also has some ridiculous difficulty spikes and you can't scout the enemy fleet to see how strong they are, but you can just turn down the difficulty if you don't want to deal with it. While in the land combat, resolve and extra turns stacking is unbalanced and overpowered. (Master tactician class can use class specific stacks to build resolve on other characters indefinitely which gives them momentum to refuel the stacks. Problem is you can build up resolve infinitely on characters that just takes extra turns and since you're getting momentum even on extra turns which makes this strategy insane. You'll end up with hundreds of resolve on every other character which funnels back hundreds of stacks. The class can then use a skill that straight up increases damage based on the current stacks, so you end up doing hundreds of critical dmg off of a single hit from a burst shot of a heavy bolter literally 1 shotting anything in the way including bosses and your own teammates.) Also one of the companions gets bonus main stats from any character taking extra turns which you might think is hard to do, but the Bounty hunter class has a skill that literally gives the character a free turn for every enemy you kill. Absolutely broken and hilarious, but gets stale quick since it's now more optimal for you to stall and skip extra turns just to build up for the finale. 

I hope they can at least patch out the majority of game breaking bugs. Until then I can't recommend this game as much as I like it.",1702552380,1703121562,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

- The builds and class design of this game is absurdly fun, if you combo stuff right the numbers can go bonkers, but the enemies are bonkers so if you're op you're keeping up!
- The game's difficulty settings make everything so customizeable. With some tweaking you can change a lot of mechanics you don't like, and it's easy to mod to turn anything on or off as you want.
- Dialogue is super complete, the lore and immersion is absolutely top-tier.
- Deadass my favourite CRPG I've ever played.

Cons:
- Buggy, nothing gamebreaking but I have an unequippable weapon with a bugged ability sitting in my inventory, some cutscenes have buggy camera settings.
- The warp travel is super fun and exciting, but by act 4 it's a little bit of a hindrance and a time sink. I used the difficulty settings to make it easier so I wouldn't worry about it, but just used a mod to give me a way to bypass the travel altogether and it made the pacing a lot better.
- The characters are too fun sexy and smart I wanna kiss all of them

I wanted a game like this since I got into Warhammer nearly 20 years ago.
This is hands down the deepest dive into the world of 40k of any game so far. I have not finished it yet but it already taught me a lot of new lore and it respectfully and accurately showcases many facets of this universe. Somehow the game even manages to stay true to the grimdark nature of 40k, but with enough levity and relatability to not become depressing or draining.
Playing this game I really feel like I am in 40k. Like Arkham Asylum makes you really feel like Batman, this game makes you feel like a Rogue Trader through and through. As for mechanics you have solid rpg mechanics with deep, tactical turn-based combat, exploration, rich loot, interesting space combat, smooth trading and resource management that does not overstay it's welcome and whatever else I have not encountered yet. It very much feels like a complete experience and then some.
Pros:
- best, broadest and deepest Warhammer 40k lore representation in a game to date
- fun and deep tactical combat (although I recommend playing above normal difficulty) and satisfying RPG mechanics
- Engaging story and characters
- Companions have their own quests, goals, join in conversations, also take part in multiple systems outside of dialog and combat and just overall are well integrated into the experience with mostly great voice acting.
- Good art style that captures the 40k essence while keeping enough warmth and color to be allow for long playing sessions.
- Great music
Cons:
- Very limited voice acting. A lot of reading which is fine for this game but the high quality of the voice acting that is there really makes me wish there was much more of it.
- Tech overall is very dated which becomes most apparent in rather awkwardly animated ingame cut-scenes with elements frequently not timing together, like someone getting shot in a dramatic twist but the character reacts about 2 seconds too late. It adds a certain charm actually and does not ruin my experience but it feels quite old for 2023.

Highly recommended for any warhammer 40k and cRPG fan. If like both it's mandatory.

I've been playing the tabletop RPG for over a decade and to have the first 40k CRPG come out with this level of reverence and respect for the setting and everything that comes with it made me so happy. Owlcat really do understand the world and its a delight to take part of their vision. 40k is an absurd setting full of satire and it really shines here. 

Everything you's want in a rogue trader experience is there: Don't want to talk to the person who is beneath you? Your seneschal has your back. Want to create a cold trade empire? You can overthrow the mafia and place yourself at the head. Want to go full for the emperor? He protects. Want to side with the ruinous powers or xenos? Sure, why not?

This game is very text heavy and while some of the companions are partially voice acted, there will be a lot of reading but its so engaging. There were so many moments where I laughed out loud or had a difficult choice that I sat for minutes pondering the ramifications of or some truly heartfelt moments that really made me connected to the world. If you aren't a fan of reading then probably pass on this game because that's where a lot of the game's strength lies. What at the time I thought were small decisions kept coming back to have repercussions later in the game when I was least expecting it.  

The combat can be very crunchy if you let it. Some classes more so than others and it does feel like officer is a touch overturned with how it interacts with the action economy but Owlcat did a great job adapting the old 2009 rules into a fun new system. I did leave wanting for more options when it came to psychic abilities and it often felt like my psykers were forced to take a class for the sake of having one when all I wanted was to make their psychic powers better. I would recommend playing on the default difficulty if you want to avoid most of the crunch and opt to up it if its too easy rather than the other way around. Despite that it is extremely satisfying when it clicks. Having your party work together to take out the enemies of the Dynasty is a joy and very fun to learn and toy with. 

Now for the elephant in the room: the bugs. I experienced (or rather noticed) three different broken quests that I had to install a mod to progress correctly. I experienced enemies running in place for 2 minutes only to end their turn having done nothing. My player model vanished. I once got stuck in my chambers and had to reload just to be able to click the door (though I think at the time of writing that one has been fixed). I can only assume these bugs will be fixed as Owlcat has stated they're going to support the game further with more DLCs and they've been patching bugs but its sad that they're there and so numerous. If you're able to its probably best to wait for at least a little bit to play the main story while these get patched. If not, install toybox and you'll be able to progress the quests correctly at least. 

Overall probably my favorite game of the year but that's because in a lot of ways I am the intended audience for this game. If you're a fan of CRPGs and want a new one to sink your teeth into playing in its current state is very fun. However, if you're patient and wait for the DLCs and the bugs to be fixed you'll probably enjoy it all the more.

 I have a feeling that this game is going to go down in the annals of CRPGs as one of the GOATS.

Pros:
- Interesting combat system with a lot of depth.
- Engaging characters with involved back-stories.
- High-stakes, difficult choices to make in the story.
- Excellent job of evoking the look and feel of 40k.

Cons
- Buggy as all hell. Especially in the late game.
- Presently many important quest-lines can't be completed.
- Continuity is too often a bit weak.
- Menu system is extremely inefficient.
- Minimal voice acting
- A couple of weird little canon conflicts.
- Exciting set pieces too often replaced by story-book sections.


Conclusion: Feels like this could have done with another year in development. Feels like the devs knew that too because this is the first game with a £40 price tag that I've seen with a bug report button placed prominently in the main UI.

The freedom and replay-ability common in other CRPGs feels like it may be limited by the current state of the game.

However, would broadly recommend. Fun to play. Best suggestion would be to wait a few months for some big patches to drop. Maybe even the first major DLC if you want a really pure experience.

There is a lot of missed opportunity during exploring, which mostly is uneventful.

It feels as if the game is half baked out of the oven, with a lot of bugs(t-pose characters is a dead give away and the constant space battle freezes), and too few quests and areas to explore. I get why this game got a bad rating (from some of the established critics), not so much about the D&D kind of mechanics that are extremely convoluted, but lack of content.

The expansion packs should have been part of the base game, which tell me that they launched to early. Having viodship mechanics should have been part of the core experience from the get go. The added content with more ""empire"" management should also have been part of the core experience. This is just greed, plain and simple!

Yes this game needs a serious tutorial due to the D&D mechanics (a comparison) are novel to the point that I still can not get a pyromaniac-operative to work properly..

If you are a dedicated follower of tactical, turn-based combat (within or without an rpg-environment) reaching from (very) old school (Pool of Radiance), Jagged Alliance and Fallout Tactics over X-COM or Xenonauts to modern day BG3, Jagged Alliance, Expeditions: Rome or Wartales, then THIS IS - imho - AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!

I was in the middle of BG3 when Rogue Trader popped up and although I am not a fan or follower of any Warhammer 40K storyline, I got it (on sale I think). 

The whole universe that is thrown at you - and of which I do not understand anything, but I am curious to find out - seems so deep and vast, that I do now understand what one commentator on YT meant, when he said he'd be in the game for 100 hours and has done/understood 30 % at max...

Of course it is not BG3 when it comes to optical and audible perfection, but it doesn't need to hide neither. It has a few minor flaws, but it is hard if not impossible to compare two well done pieces of art anyway. 
The encounters – I’m playing second hardest level – are challenging but doable, as it is not only up to the right usage of your party’s powers and weapons, but using the environmental opportunities that are offered. Enemy npcs are massive, special skills are notable and they even seem to know what needs to be done to use them – like a sniper getting into a higher position. 

The graphics are neatly pixeled, if that description makes sense, the ambiance is nicely engineered and the stage as a whole fulfills it's purpose at least to my needs. This reflects to the first few maps you can wander with your party of course, and the main ship interior of course, but one can imagine what glorious battlefields await one in the chapters to come.

The music is well composed and 'performed', although I have to say, I usually have the music turned of in games, as I prefer enjoying (well done) sound effects. Which are there ofc. Voice over in cut-scenes is good, the whole 'acting' sounds, like npc voice messages or similar are average, but do their job. And if the repetitive ""I will smash the planet like Chuck Norris!""-comments of your party members get annoying, you can turn them off, I guess...

Starts very strong, I really enjoyed the first two acts especially. Some of the best work done by owlcat. Writing, mystery and combat were all done really well. The planet you are on for Act 1 was a really fun journey with the final boss of it showing you what Owlcat games are all about. 

Act 2's exploration was really fun. Some of the places you end up were so challenging. I loved it.

Act 3 was good too but it had its flaws (though minor). I enjoyed the change of pace it brought in and the exploration in to that... place.

Act 4 was where I felt a bit let down. I expected more of the map to open up as so much of it was empty during my travels (Act 2 was the bulk of the exploration of the star systems, like 95%). Felt a lot shorter than I hoped for too. Final mission was fun though with probably the most intense battles in the game.

Act 5 was even worse, at that point I just wanted it to end. Its strange the ending kind of just reveals itself as the final act without any true precedent so it felt very anti climatic. 
 
Bugs started showing up in those last two acts as well but I managed to finish the game with them just fine. 

Only thing I wish was the impact of the paths (dogmatic, heretic and ironcast) had a bigger impact during the game. Kinda kills the replayability for me. 

But for the hours I got out of the game, it was a really fun adventure for some one who has never played anything 40k. I do recommend it if this is your genre. Maybe wait a bit for them to iron out their bugs.",1703091606,1703091606,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll start by saying that this game nails the atmosphere. Everything from the environments, to the dialogue, to the UI is full of character and really fits the 40k aesthetic. I've been enjoying the writing and the companions thus far, though one or two of them seem a bit less fleshed out than the others. The combat is fairly intuitive once you get over the initial shock of how many different mechanics and numbers there are.

As for downsides, there are a few. So far, I haven't had any issues that have ruined the experience for me. The game runs smoothly and hasn't crashed once. I have encountered a handful of visual bugs like NPCs walking in place. I have also noticed a few times when it seems like the character's dialogue should be voiced, but the audio is either delayed or doesn't play.

The game has a bit of a slow start, and there are A LOT of tutorial pop-ups throughout the first chapter. The tutorials are very helpful, but there is a lot of information to take in. Every character has multiple abilities and can do a variety of things every turn in combat. This can be somewhat overwhelming to start, and I think the game actually manages to give the player TOO MANY options when leveling up a character. Seriously, you'll be picking from a list of dozens of abilities every time you get a level. On the plus side, you can spend hours customizing your build to exactly how you want it.

Lastly, this game involves a LOT of reading. This isn't really an issue for me, as I'm used to games like Morrowind. There is voiced dialogue, but only for certain lines from certain characters. There is seems to be some degree of inconsistency whether or not a given dialogue box will be voiced over, and it would be nice to have more voice lines to fill in some of those spots. In addition, the lines from some of these characters can be very verbose, so you can expect a few walls of text. If you're not someone who likes to read dialogue, this might detract from your experience.

Update:
Oh boy. My previous review definitely is correct, about chapter 1 and 2, but the game takes a turn for the worse. The last 3 chapters seem very rushed and, quite frankly ... not that great. The excellent writing steps aside to leave room for seemingly endless forced combat gauntlets with little room for meaningful dialogue or choice. Chapter 3 is basically just one long, oh so long corridor of tedium and annoyance. Chapter 4 is slightly better, but it feels like the game has lost it's soul and the amazing writing from chapter's 1 and 2. Chapter 5 is tacked on, so incredibly stupid and, thankfully, very short.

I'm kind of torn on whether it's worth the buy right now or not. I'm *personally* not experiencing any major bugs, just some issues with cutscenes having weird delays or improper camera positioning, but I seem to be an outlier. Overall I think it has pulled off the 40k vibe well, I already like the characters, combat seems pretty fun although difficulty seems inconsistent. Really think about if you're willing to deal with bugs before you buy.

edit 1: okay, now I've got ~60 hours in, and the issues are starting to add up, changing to negative review. The game works *in general*, I'm not having crashes or soft locks or anything too severe, but do not count on it working perfectly for you. So far I am still getting people T-posing, I'm getting the game slowing to a halt when a ragdoll bugs out, I'm getting weird audio bugs. Some talents just don't work, sometimes damage isn't calculated right, the balance is really all over the place. I've gradually increased difficulty as the game feels too easy, I'm up to hard now, and combats are either a total stomp (most often) or you instantly lose half your team.

Naval combat balance seems all over the place, I ignore the non-essential ones, since so many of them the enemy gets to shoot you before you even get a turn in and you start at 10% health even with tier 4 or 5 hull upgrade. Maybe I'm missing a way to find upgrades, but it seems impossible to upgrade since you can only gain reputation with void cargo, which you get from winning fights, which are hard to win with your crappy upgrades.

I won't lie, I'm still having a TON of fun with the game, decisions seem somewhat meaningful, I like the writing, it's got the perfect 40k vibe. When the bugs get sorted and the balance improved it will easily be the best 40k game to date. But that's when, or possibly if, all the bugs get sorted. Unless you're as hyped for the game as I am just don't buy it yet, it's not in a great state, and if you're easily angered by the things I mention just 100% hold off.",1702280649,1703063744,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The writing is well done, the voice acting is very good, and the adherence to 40k lore is accurate but still comprehensible for people who don't know that much about the setting.

The turn based combat is, honestly, a little too crunchy for my taste.  I'm playing it and enjoying it, but I really wasn't looking for anything this complicated, and I don't enjoy spending that much time looking through the talents and all that to see how it all works - and I say this being someone that enjoys XCom, Stellaris, and the Total War series.  That being said, this is still overly complex as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe that's a faithful adaptation of the pen & paper RPG rules - i dunno, never really played it.

Still, I'm having fun.  You can have crew executed for speaking to you disrespectfully.  You can make your Senechal introduce you in grandiose fashion every time you meet someone new.

Coming off [i]Wrath of the Righteous[/i], one of the best games I've ever played and the only true successor to [i]Baldur's Gate II[/i] in decades, I was expecting Owlcat to smash it with another classic. I'd stayed away from any pre-release chatter or early builds and picked it up day one to see for myself.

I'm not that familiar with 40K and I'd be the first to admit it, but on paper, this game should have been a dream come true. Another RPG from the studio whose previous title I've put 600+ hours into and dozens of playthroughs? Turn-based tactics in the vein of [i]XCOM 2[/i], a game I've long joked was my equivalent to crack?

Hell yeah, sign me up. Right?

As much as I'd love to say that Owlcat has pulled it off, that this is the game Warhammer fans have been waiting for, I can't. There's too much wrong with [i]Rogue Trader[/i] and while, sure, the bugs and stability will be fixed with time, there are a lot of issues underpinning the whole experience. And it's a shame.

First off, this game could give even [i]Pillars of Eternity[/i] a run for its money in how [u]not[/u] to handle frontloading exposition. This is a long game which should come as no surprise, but right from the get-go, you're flooded by wall after wall of text and... [b]why should I care about any of it?[/b]

Again, I recognise that I'm coming into this as an outsider, that the extent of my knowledge of 40K was a half-dead guy sitting on a throne and beefy Power Rangers shouting about heresy, but for as good as the writing is, it lacks restraint. (And that's especially ironic, coming from me of all people.)

You could argue that the worldbuilding assumes some prior knowledge from players, that this was one for the fans, but... that's not really good enough, is it? This is a solid, interesting setting with tonnes and tonnes of things to pull from the source material, but it doesn't make for a good experience for those coming into it for the first time.

It's overwhelming, to the point it's almost... hard to read? While it's not anywhere near as egregious as the pointless, Kickstarter backer segments that [i]Pillars[/i] awkwardly stuck into its world, those crucial first few hours felt like I was trying to make sense of a half-finished wiki page, rather than the world slowly revealing itself over the runtime.

This leads into what's probably my biggest criticism, which is how little [i]Rogue Trader[/i] values your time. Everything is so, so slow... I can't believe some of this made it past playtesting. To illustrate this point, I'll compare it to [i]Wrath of the Righteous[/i] which is a similar game running on the same engine.

Map traversal in the former was straightforward: pick a point and watch the party move in realtime on the world map. Routes were easily drawn out and you could change direction on the fly. Here, every single jump has to have some level of risk through navigating the Warp, more buttons to click on, more pop-up scenarios or, if you're really unlucky, you'll get pulled into combat before proceeding.

Insight is available as a resource to help mitigate some of this, but charting routes is unclear or where you're even supposed to go half the time. Maybe you'll get from point A to B, maybe one of your crew will pull you in for a conversation. So much stuff getting in the way of... actually playing.

Space combat is a huge downgrade. Despite having never actually played [i]Might and Magic[/i] before, I loved the army management in [i]Wrath[/i], although I seem to be in the minority with that. (Shoutout to my man Setsuna Shy.) It played into the feeling of leading the Crusade, enemy movement was clear and it all came together on the same world map.

If we compare it to the ship battles here, it's... not good. Navigating the grid is fine, I'm not asking to swivel the ship around like a toy car or infinite movement, the tactical element is actually really interesting with the need to manoeuvre your ship into the required angle or range.

But when each unit takes so long to complete their turn, that there's a pause between each attack as the camera slowly zooms in... it all just drags on. It feels like a chore.

Even beyond that, the whole colony management system feels like a massive step back to the arbitrary resource gathering and text-based errands of [i]Kingmaker[/i]. Isn't this what one of your underlings would be responsible for, not royalty bearing a Warrant for the Imperium? Is this the grimdark future of the 41st millennium, or a Facebook browser game? 

Then we get to combat itself. No doubt this is going to drive some people insane, but... I miss real-time with pause. Because combat forms a large chunk of the game, it's compounding the numerous time-wasting issues already there when you run into a mob.

Even ignoring how some feats are bugged, that animations can get stuck when moving from tile to tile or just refuse to work at all, first you have to slowly set up your party members and, much like space combat, then watch each enemy slowly take their turn. Each and every time.

I'm no stranger to tactics games and [i]XCOM 2[/i] can be guilty of this as well. But when I want to play a role-playing game and it ultimately ends up feeling like I'm bashing my head against the wall, there's not much enthusiasm to continue. It's been almost two weeks now and I'm still in the second chapter.

[i]Wrath of the Righteous[/i] consumed my life for months after it was released, something that's only ever happened with a handful of games. I genuinely wish I could say the same, but this game ain't it... and I feel like I've hardly gone anywhere after 30+ hours.

To be clear, I don't want this to sound like I hate [i]Rogue Trader[/i] but at the same time, I was expecting more. After already being letdown by [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i], the most disappointing game I've ever played as evidenced by patching in major content for Act 3 and fixes months after release, I was looking for a rich, deep RPG to dive into.

And this [i]is[/i] a good, well-made game. The writing is pretty solid with a great cast of characters, choices are well-developed, quests and locations are interesting to explore and for long-time 40K fans, this must be a dream come true. This is life, with its highs and lows, in the Imperium and a chance to live and breathe as a character in that world.

The art team has gone all out and, as a former game dev who was trained on it, I'm impressed this is running on an engine as terrible as Unity. The lighting in particular really nails the aesthetic.

But then it all starts to fall apart. This is the most buggy game I've played in ages... [i]Wrath[/i] was personally fine at release and even [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] before it was broken by subsequent patches, although I didn't pick up [i]Kingmaker[/i] until a year or two later.

One of the more memorable ones I've encountered so far is turning invisible during romance scenes, then watching a bandolier float through the air. Some of the power abilities don't work because some kind of condition isn't met, other times an ability just won't work at all. Or the turn will inexplicably end. Or be skipped on loading saves.

A major patch has already improved things which, for what it's worth, demonstrates Owlcat will be continuing to support the game. I haven't encountered anything game-breaking or quests unable to progress so far, although you should expect the later parts to dip in quality.

The character build system took a bit of time to get used to, but it's okay. To the game's credit, it did introduce me to the Sisters of Battle, although it's a shame Argenta can't be romanced. Guess there's no room in her heart for anyone than the Emperor.

Ultimately, [i]Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader[/i] is... fine. I still recommend it, especially if you're a fan, but it speaks volumes that I can't bring myself to play it.

I just want my playthrough to be over now and once that happens, I doubt I'll be coming back.",1703054138,1703054138,True,3,0,0.506731212139129639,0,True,False,False

It's wonderful that Rogue Trader added that much, as many modern titles straight up neglect them entirely, but compared to other CRPGs (not just Baldur's Gate 3) it is extremely difficult to read the words. The size option for the writing doesn't get very large, perhaps it’d break the UI, so I am forced to use the crude Windows Magnifying Glass tool to pan over ONE WORD AT A TIME. If you don't know, there's a LOT of writing in this... so you see why I'm giving a negative review for now.

It took me 8 hours to reach the end of the prologue, of which I enjoyed the combat, atmosphere, and the story that I obviously read quite slowly. But what's the point if it'll take me 300 hours of squinting and eye straining to complete? No worries about the lack of voice acting, that's a very expensive part of development, but Pillars of Eternity, Tides of Numeria, Tyranny, Planescape Torment, and so many others are enjoyable experiences because the meat of the game, the reading, is the easy part.

I’ll keep my eye on the patch notes and rewrite my review accordingly.",1703042507,1703042507,False,2,0,0.500468194484710693,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
Atmosphere is 40k goodness
Story seems quite interesting so far - If slightly disjointed in places

Cons:
Combat is terribad. hopefully it gets better later on but its just nonsensical at the moment.
So heavily special skill based leaves no room for just dedicated gunners. Another game that
decided special skills should be everything.... forget normal attacks.

UI is pretty bad as well. Hazards are hard to spot.... why mark traps but not other hazards? General interface leaves a lot to be desired.

Edit: I don't know who decided the combat should be like this but they should be banned from all game design decisions for life. 
Lets see... Are you well away from the enemy and want to do something like RUN to catch up with your party... nope, not allowed in this game. Only time you can ever run is if you are a warrior and charging in LOS.

Want to spend your action points attacking? Nope 1 attack per round each max.... unless you use the momentum power and then can do 5 and take out whole squads instantly.

My main regret is not realising the combat system is this bad earlier so I could of refunded the game.

Bugs: For a brand new launch the bugs arent that bad. Needs a little polish for sure but nothing game breaking.

Graphics: Surprisingly good, could use a little love but it isnt the worst. Some purple textures (broken textures) exist but it isnt all that bad. I want better character models personally. But I am a cosmetics whore and I want more of that.

Price: is accurate for what it gives. I am almost 100 hours into the game and I just cleared chapter 2. It felt like the longest intro to a game I have ever played.

Lore: I will definitely say that this is the most lore complete digital game that I have seen in the Warhammer game library. But that is just my opinion.

Otherwise, it is an amazingly fun game. The story is solid, atmosphere is great and game play entertaining. If you have played any other Owlcat game, then you'll love this one because it is a straight upgrade from the previous one.
Combat is more interesting, since there isn't a daily limit on your abilities so there is no need to resource manage that, but dangerous enough that failure is a possibility. Failure is punished, but not by costing you several minutes of time or making a character unavailable.
City management is easier and more entertaining since they incorporate it better with the theme of the universe and with better overview.
There is no good and evil options, since the seemingly ""good guy"" option is burning a village to the ground or terrorize a planet to prevent the chaos gods from taking hold.
The only real problem with the game so far isn't necessarily bad. There is a lot of story and therefore a lot of reading. I know this is because the 40k universe is not a standard fantasy setting, but sometimes I would go an hour or two reading without any combat to spice things up.

+ On daring combat is about the perfect level for experienced RPG fans who like challenging combat. Most fights require you to think and position quite carefully. Some optional ones I had to leave and return to much later than I discovered them.
+ Lots of crunch and ""a ha!"" moments when you work out good synergies in your builds. I eagerly look forward to each level up (smart choices of talents can really turn a previously weak character into a killing machine)
+ Perhaps most to my surprise they nailed the 40K tone. Even on a 'good' playthrough you have to make lots of tough decisions and be an asshole (for the greater good). The universe feels dark and dangerous. It's also nice to have an RPG where most characters recognise you're a badass due respect and not to be trifled with.
+ Bang for your buck. I'm 60 hours in and only feel like I'm about halfway through the game.
+ Likeable companions. Well-written and no one annoying (well one was but wisened up when I threatened her).
- Yep there's some bugs. I haven't encountered anything game-breaking but some things have required a reload to fix and you get the feeling not all talents/abilities are working like they should be (though there's so much maths going mid-battle it can be hard to tell sometimes).

But at the time of this review the game just is not complete. It is completely bug ridden and broken. It's a game in Alpha levels of unfinished that should not have been released in this state. There is a fun game underneath the issues, and hopefully in a year or so I can come back and replace this with a positive review, but this game cannot be recommended in its current state because it just does not work.

The first two acts work well and are fun, then in act 3 the cracks start showing, and in acts 4 and 5 the game breaks down completely. I suspect many positive reviews come from people who are still in the first two acts.

Some examples:

Several of the companion quests in the game simply do not trigger or fail to complete, you have to use a cheat engine to actually do them. The same happens to side quests. E.g. Ulfar's quest in Act 5 simply does not start without using a cheat engine, and Argenta's Act 4 quest never gets marked as finished (it stays on 'go to this location' even after you've gone to the location and done her quest there).

Even the main quests break sometimes, making the game literally unplayable because you just can't progress them.

Half of the abilities in the game are bugged and are useless, the other half are bugged and do a lot more than they're supposed to. E.g. extra turn abilities frequently cause infinite loops, several +damage buffs only give +1 regardless of what number they're supposed to, most abilities that give an effect whenever a heroic is used only trigger on the first heroic of the fight, a bunch of abilities (e.g. psalm of heroes, strange vitality, inscribed soul, rigrous training to name just a few) have literally no effect whatsoever. It's genuinely easier to list the abilities that aren't massively bugged.

I had the option of recruiting a companion, which I declined. They then joined my party anyway, and everytime they started talking in party banter the camera just banned completely off the map. They always engaged in party banter even though they weren't travelling with my party (I left them on the ship).

After a dialogue, one of my companions turned hostile. I killed them. After the fight they turned back to my team, revived as companions do after a fight, then instantly turned hostile again and triggered a new fight. Once I'd killed them again the process repeated indefinitely until I had to load an earlier save and take a different dialogue that kept them on my side because I was hardstuck.

I recruited another companion, and they cloned themselves and two of them joined me for the next fight (one was AI controlled).

I recruited a different companion, they agreed to join me, then they just glitched out and stood there T-Posing aggressively at me. I couldn't even click on them. They were never mentioned again.

A bunch of narrative flags are broken too. For example, there are several dialogues with the interrogator companion where clicking the 'iconoclast' options will raise his counter for 'heretical options taken', and vice versa. A bunch of similar issues exist for other flags.

Spoiler:

There is a section where you get kidnapped. After escaping, you can return to where you were kidnapped. The person you were kidnapped by is still there, but they are uninteractable and stand there doing nothing. Your characters also instantly switch to the unconscious sprite but you can still move them, so you just drift around the map face down. Oh, and the 'leave area' button does not work here- hope your last save wasn't too far away, because you have to reload.

I am a huge fan of the Pathfinder series. They nailed CRPG system and character and world building was superb. Despite the awesome change of scenery, none of the best parts of the Pathfinder series carry over, while the worst parts do. Gone are the 20+ classes with 4+ subtypes (and endless mutliclass combinations), and is replaced by 4 roles, with 8 sub types. Spoiler alert, its really only 4 worth playing. Choosing the other roles are more of a self-inflected handicap than a play0style choice, The whole magic ""psycher"" system is total meaningless and completely unnecessary. Even melee is pointless really. You just have one soldier and 5 x officers to spam the 'gain an extra' turn ability, and you roll through anything.

The combat isnt the only problem, because the 'roles' or classes arent really differentiated since they are all still just dudes with guns, they try to make this deep and annoying talent and ability system where at level 35, I have chosen dozens of talents and abilities yet somehow still using the same skills from level 4. Progression has become meaningless with more than half the game left. I finally abandoned this game once I googled the end game content and found out there isnt some amazing new power and abilities that reveal itself (much like their Mythic Ranks from Pathfinder). While the first 20-30 hours were fun and new, I have found myself on a joyless slog for the last 40-50 hours. 

Lastly, while the equipment is plentiful, it is mostly useless. And while I have dozens of unique boots, capes and accessories, there is merely a small handful or unique guns actually worth having. My main damage dealer is just using the current chapters Laser gun, which is the same as every chapters laser gun but slightly stronger than the previous one.

A beautiful world with a pretty great story and miserable mess of combat/CRPG system, poor range of items, and joyless progression. The first Owlcat game ive played less than 100 hours of. Whoever says the combat is good, must still be in chapter 1, by the end of chapter 2, I was already saying there better be more in the next archetype.

The game masterfully weaves familiar narratives and themes, providing an immersive experience. However, it's worth noting that early versions were plagued with bugs, which initially hindered game play. Thankfully, the developers have shown a commendable commitment to resolving these issues. As of this review, the most disruptive bugs have been addressed, significantly improving the overall experience.

What particularly stands out to me is the realisation of a fascinating lore that’s often not given a second look, which showcases the game's belief in the source material as an opportunity to tell some gripping stories. This, coupled with steady updates from the developers, earns my solid recommendation.

Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the 40K universe, this game offers a captivating blend of lore-rich content and solid game play. If you can overlook the remnants of its earlier technical struggles, you're in for a rewarding experience.""

Crpgs are about their stories, their characters, and their rich character/class customization. This game doesn't shy on any of those regards. You level up some like, sixty times in a run. My current party is a single-target dps and another character to clear fodder. Everyone else just exists to make them stronger, it's great.

Games Workshop is inundated in below average literature and storytelling, it's not a secret. I'm happy to say Rogue Trader is not included in that. At least in Act I and II, the story is actually quite well written, and characters such as Argenta or Pasqal are the most faithful (pun intended) representations of their occupations. Argenta and Idira have Lae'zel and Shadowheart levels of banter. Player dialogue is also great, varying from ""Suffer not the xeno to live."" to ""It's ok I trust you,"" twenty seconds after meeting it, which would get all but a handful of people in the Imperium executed immediately. Just uh, remember that Warhammer is a universe built on war and suffering. If you're a good person, sometimes that's the reward for itself.

With the genre having such 'fluid' narrative and gameplay, it's bound to have bugs. The thing is, though, these are not bugs that take 70 hours of game play to reach, a lot of them are seen right from the beginning. If you played the Pathfinder games before they got definitive editions, you know what to expect. Though, honestly I don't have THAT many problems with Rogue Trader. 
 
[*]You can't rotate regional abilities.
[*]LOS is cooked and your long ranged units will suffer from the invisible walls everywhere
[*]Sometimes you just can't move the voidship in combat, which can screw you over
[*]YOU CAN'T ROTATE REGIONAL ABILITIES? AN ENTIRE CLASS IS BASED ON THEM
[*]Sometimes you use an area ability and it literally does nothing with no combat log info
[*]You can remove like 25% of the fights in each area and everyone would be ok with it
[*]While you're at it, do it in your other games, and your next one, preemptively
[*]A billion talents and no way to search for the one you want is diabolical
[*]Mid-combat/scripted spawns occur in the middle of the battleground and often act immediately, usually resulting in a party member being killed without any counterplay
[*]Yrliet unique ability into Bring it Down doesn't work lmao[/list]

Anyways. I think it's a great game, and honestly, the game is much easier than Owlcat's Pathfinder titles. No pre-buff, no healing pre-batlle (you heal after each engagement), and most enemies have the same tricks in their sleeves as you. Actually, they spend a lot of their time killing each other. You will be fine if you play now. You'll be better if you wait. If you can wait, I'd probably do that.

So, should you get this game? Yes! With a caveat. But being binary in yes or no, much more yes than no.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

Does it [b] feel [/b] like Warhammer? 100% They did not stray away from the vibes of 40k. Everything you own is grand. Everything the peasantry owns? Utter garbage. Your retinue? They look at you in confusion, disgust, or down right utter bitterness if you even DARE to think about speaking to the common rabble as if they are human.

Abelard downright dismissed the rest of my retinue when we were in a safe location then started BERATING ME for (Very light spoilers in the first act) [spoiler] Telling the below deck crews that if they work with the enforcers and turn in any heretical findings or persons... that I would do the UNTHINKABLE... and not have the enforcers beat them all for the crime of existing! [/spoiler]

The sheer decadence that you get to live in as a Rogue Trader, with the freedom that comes with such a title, It is all on display. Your retinue is not some ""Unique goodie two shoes gary/mary/larry sues."" They are horrible people by our standards today. Sooooo.... PERFECT! You can also be a Heretical Rogue Trader. I really wanna try that path. 

It thoroughly reproduces the Fantasy Flight TTRPG (my beloved) into a CRPG format. It was on display with their work on the Pathfinder games, and it absolutely shows here. If you ever wanted to get into 40k some more and wanted a solid game? Pick it up. 


[h1] Neutral: [/h1] 

[b] UI/UX and the Presentation of the system. [/b]

By aggressively following the TTRPG, they also have some UI/UX choices that are understandable, but unfortunately make my brain bounce off it. For example, when you hover over Precise Attack, it gives you the formula. -(5 + PER bonus * stacks of exploit)% reduction in cover efficiency. Okay, perfectly fine. But PER bonus is written as such and is hyper linked. Mild annoyance. Doesn't say what the bonus is at that moment, I'll just click. It will then hyperlink to what PERCEPTION does. Not what the number is. Why can't the bonus be a number in the formula, highlighted to expand on hover over what stat is that bonus? 

I have to then right click my character and look directly at the PERCEPTION stat to see what that bonus is. It gets annoying having to right click the character for their stat bonii in an ability. Especially on ones where the stat changes far more than Perception. 

I have played a lot of Dark Heresy (the Inquisition sister book to Rogue Trader. All in same game system so can be combined) and Shadowrun. I'm no stranger to crunchy formulas. But with long covid making all my normal problems much worse? I bounce off the constant checking of stats. It makes the combat go slower, especially as you fight a lot more chaff enemies in combat. I'm tempted to go down to story mode just so I can enjoy the excellent story telling without dealing with the combat as much.

[b] Voice Acting [/b]

Yeah, I got spoiled by BG3's constant voice acting for all the NPCs. Owlcat aren't in a position to follow that, so I don't expect that. BUT, having the companions sometimes only have voice acting while giving random one off NPCs that aren't important to you get some? Throws me for a loop. But that's why it is in neutral. It's something that sticks out at me, yet isn't super pull me the heck out of the mood. 

[h1] Negatiiivesss [/h1]

Oooohhh, how verbose will this slaanesh loving, only infantry guard army collecting maniac's negative section be.....?

Very minor actually. Not verbose. (I lied) 

It runs well enough performance wise. It does have some weird delays sometimes when you shoot, or someone moves. Almost as if a human was physically rolling the dice and checking if it succeeds or not. Sometimes enemy NPCs will get to their spot, only to vibrate as if they sat on a de-toothed chainsaw and coaxed the machine spirit to go into overdrive. 

When playing as a Leader and you can designate zones, you can't choose the rotation of the 2x5 zone so when you get to cover, it changes to go across the cover. Not lined up with it like a gunline is using that cover. 

Nothing really game breaking I've run into so far. The cutscenes very much have a Warcraft/Dawn of War vibes to them. Sometimes with that exact jank too. Brings me back, honestly. So, technically a negative as it wouldn't play SFX or mistime animations, etc. But EH. 


My only true negative (and it isn't even contributing to the ""Yes but with a caveat."") about the game is something I can't really say succinctly. If you looked at my character sheet, my fellowship score is pretty low. So, when you read this opinion, do so in the good faith of: I'm still recommending this game none the less. I'm just being a catholic trauma'd dork.

The romancing in Rogue Trader is eh. Mediocre. There is no Lesbian or Gay only choices. Just Straight or Bisexual. An odd choice that I am not going to bother reading into it past a couple minutes. 

But, I'm a firm believer of every romancable companion in an RPG should just be Player Sexual. Non-Companion NPCs or Non-Romanceable Companions? Sure, have their sexuality be what evs. Argenta and woof boy not being romanceable is understandable, makes sense! Even if I am lesbian with A LOT of catholic trauma and Argenta makes me feel things. It's fine keeping her not romanceable. Why else would she dedicate any of her time NOT to the Emprah? Bah! Foolish!

THAT BEING SAID, HOW IS CASSIA NOT BISEXUAL?! IF SHE WANTS AN HEIR SO BAD AND MY CHARACTER CANNOT GIVE HER ONE, WE CAN HAVE A THREESOME WITH ABELARD (my beloved). I COULD EVEN GET TO SAY. ""Abelard, impregnate this woman."" with a serious face!!

Joking aside. Get the game. It's a delight, and I'll probably go as a Soldier or something for my new path. Just so it ain't as brain heavy with the Operative line.

If that's the case, these people have either never played warhammer tabletop, never read a Dan Abnett or Aaron Demski-Bowden Black Library Book, or are commenting on the fact that this is the only videogame of its kind, and is therefore automatically ""the best."" 

I like Owlcat in general; they did a phenomenal job with Pathfinder; Kingmaker, an ok job with whatever the second one was called, and they are willing to take risks, which I will say is a MASSIVE compliment. The problems as I see it are myriad however; the writing is universally AWFUL, AWFUL NOSE-BLEEDINGLY AWFUL. I am going to assume, since this is true of all Owlcat games, that if I could speak greek (they are a developer from Cypress), the writing may be really good, but as it is they use so many adjectives and anachronisms  (like weird conversational ""oh man, that blinding brillant ghost of a daemon made my bowels flip upside down, dinit' sir?"") its actually an exhausting game to play because I know warhammer writing can be very, very good. Next, they adapted a mixture of several fantasy flight games RPG systems to create what is -I'll admit- probably one of the better blends of starting material they could make from an obtuse and poorly made RPG system. That part isnt their their fault; I have played Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader, and the rules are badly made by fantasy flight. However, Owlcat's own proprietary imagining of these two games blended kinda also sucks. I hate their classless archetype system that still has attempts at being classes, they made psyker's poo poo as far the fantasy that playing a psyker should represent (psykers ARE still very GOOD in the game, but they are not a wizard substitute as they are in warhammer TT or the RPGs).

Ok, so I have been very  critical, I will end with some of what it does well. The game is beautiful for an Indie developer, truly. They get the Grimdark of the visuals down really well while understanding and working with their financial limitations (read; using a cartoonish engine to cover up lack of AAA graphics capabilities), that is actually pretty hard to do. The writing ruins it, but they nail the visual aspect perfectly. I also love  the risks they were willing to take with letting you have a drukhari and eldar NPC party members, and of course, be a heretic -even if the trilinear morality system which amounts to neutral good, LN with a nazi bent (the Imperial morality), or Chaotic Evil makes any roleplay impossible. 

I will say that I was SUPER dissapointed with DARKTIDE as well, another WH40K game that was supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. However, FatShark has started getting its S**t together and turning that pile of crap into something that may eventually be a game worth playing long term. I believe Owlcat can not do this with this game, mostly because of the writing. I do think they should make ANOTHER, NEW warhammer 40k CRPG and do a good job with it though, which I think they definitely can. They need to hire Dan Abnet or Demski Bowden (NOT Grahm Mcneil for the love of GOD) to do their writing though.",1703013645,1703013645,False,4,0,0.501846790313720703,0,True,False,False

One where I talk about how the atmosphere is great, but the plot choices don't seem to matter much or how the combat is innovative, but the morality system seems half-assed and token. One of those.

But the truth is that all of those good and bad details disappear beneath an avalanche of bugs.

Here are some of the things that have happened so far (by no means a complete list):
- Enemies bugging out and flying in a straight line for the duration of the combat.
- Enemies gormlessly staring into space for a minute before ending their turn.
- Abilities working differently than described.
- Abilities not working at all
- Abilities marked as fixed in the last patch, still not working at all.
- Characters not loading their models into a combat, reqiring a reload.
- Not being able to leave a location, as exit icons have not loaded (despite this being marked as fixed).
- NPC's becoming pink cubes, when talked to.
- Straight up game crashes.

 All of this keeps happening repeatedly.

LOTS OF BUGS, WAIT 6 MONTHS!


I want to start, by saying that I adore this game and it's interpretation of 40k. 

The roleplaying experience is excellent.

Music's fantastic, gameplay is solid, combat is fun, writing has been incredibly good so far.

However, there are a number of bugs in my proverbial videogame soup.

I am in chapter 4, up till the end of chapter 3 these bugs were minimal. 

Most prominent bugs were graphical, and a few involving quest logs and scripting issues. I could ignore those.

However there are serious and quest breaking bugs from the end of chapter 3.

Unfortunately this puts me in the position that I don't think I can recommend playing the game now, even though at the time of writing this I've gotten what I consider my money's worth. ( £1/Hour + )  

In 6 months time, this game will hopefully have it's bugs ironed out.

This does seem like as issue of rushing a game out the gate, and also the endeavour of bugfixing in a game this long is no small task. I hope the team fixes quests like Rat hunting and others which seem to have softlock breaks which prevent completion.

Sure there were points where an NPC T-posed, or dialogue skipped a bit, but all in all I could put up with it as jitters here and there, small speedbumps in an otherwise thoroughly enjoyable experience.
HOWEVER. The problem REALLY ramps up in chapter 3. Here the wheels start to come off the story, mission flags bug out or seem to pop without warning. Character dialogue skips whole segments, or replays itself coming from random places, including from random NPCS.
Worse still is if you DO manage to finish chapter three, then chapter four is broken... Not just bugged, broken. I'm talking unfinished, I'm talking an absolute shitshow. 
Infact the few people who have managed to complete the game have had to utilise a mod called 'toybox' to auto-complete quests that don't work, or set flags as finished.
The fact that they had to release a patch to even let you view a cutscene in chapter 4, is pretty telling, and incredibly damning.
The game isn't finished, and could probably have done with at least another six months in the oven.
I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt because of the lengthy test period, and how surely they would have caught any issues with a wide test array... but no, it seems Rogue Trader just joins the ranks of games rushed out too soon to make a buck, which is a real shame because under the mess, there's could have been a real gem.",1703000140,1703000140,False,3,0,0.545896053314208984,0,True,False,False

Awesome game so far. Big Fantasy fan myself, love Warhammer III, but have always been interested in 40k but couldn't really find a game I could get into. This is that game. I've played multiple playthroughs of Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous and I will be doing the same with Rogue Trader. If I have any complaints it would just be that sometimes I'm not sure if my decisions on side quest stuff matters. An example: I forced some kind of daemon to submit to my will and become a servant on my ship. I haven't seen or heard from this daemon since. I'm only in chapter 2 so maybe this decision will have consequences later. But if that's the worse I can complain about, that says a lot about the game. As for bugs, I have only noticed a few minor ones, the inability to exit your private chambers bug, and turning invisible after romance scene with Jae. Both of which were easily fixed by reloading the save. I also have noticed visual bugs while in combat such as enemies gliding across the battlefield instead of using their legs, and weapons not being raised to fire out of cover, but these don't really bother me. As for Cassia's visual bug, this should just be considered a feature lol. Again I'm only in Chapter 2 so I have a lot of time to run into more.",1702998233,1702998233,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+The Setting, writing and atmosphere is stellar
+Interesting combat and narrative systems
+Great companions. 
+The VO (the little that there is) is superb and I wish all companion lines had VO.

BUT this thumbs up come with a few caveats at the time of this review that will most likely be fixed in 6-12 months.
-As fun as the combat is, It is incredible broken and you can either lose on the first turn OR you have a set-up so powerful you win on your first turn, regardless of difficultly.
-Space combat is boring and its systems are divorced from the rest of the game so I wish it could be skipped entirely.
-Holy cow the bugs. Over the course of my play-through my patience was slowly whittled away by the bugs. The player will constantly be playing, ""Is the game broken, or did I do something wrong?""

The main criticisms are spending a lot of time building your character, there's a lot to read, and it's buggy. All of these are true. But, it's got a ruleset that is unique but still feels intuitive to Warhammer players, it captures the spirt of the Warhammer universe better than maybe any other game I've played recently. It's respectful of the lore, but seems like it would be fun and interesting to someone who didn't know anything about warhammer.

 I like character building, character planning and new abilities, so I very much enjoyed the many advancement levels you get, I also feel like as compared to many CRPG's the progression system is a lot smoother because it's broken into lots of impact but not game breaking progressions instead instead of the other main source of this type of CRPG -D&D/Pathfinder ruleset which has like 5 game changing advancements (double your hp at lvl, 2 for example) and about 15 filler levels where you are lucky to have anything to choose. 

If you don't want to read the text it's hard to recommend, but I would say the same about most of the classic, CRPG's with the potential exceptions of Icewind Dale, Solasta which is fun inspite of the writing feeling like an original highschool play, and the New Baulder's Gate, which are all enjoyable enough as pure combat romps. It's probably only taking this heat because of the splash that Balder's Gate III has made recently and the fact that it's getting directly compared to that game. 

This brings me to bugginess. Yeah, it's buggy af, but the thing is they usually aren't that serious and mostly work if you either reload or realize why they are happening and fix yourself. I'm sure this sounds like an apologist, but despite all the bugs I've experienced, I've never had a hard crash that cost me progress, I have alot more tolerance for frequent issues like chaos models not showing their melee attack animations or the dynamic value display inappropriately showing the underlying formula instead of the resulting number when examined than a hard crash to desktop and a painful reminder that you should have manually saved.

Overall I think this is a great game, it's got good writing, a high amount of choice and consequence (or at least the illusion thereof), lots of interesting new mechanics - including serviceable space battles, good scaling and progression, one of the most lore rich setting in existence - which it respects, but doesn't demand that you are versed in, unlimited inventory space, and it's very very fun to gib cultists.

Yes, there are some noticeable bugs, mostly to do with combat, like how occasionally one of my guys refuses to fire when ordered. However, I save often via quicksave and so I haven't found a bug that has actually truly halted my progress. With a bit of bug fixing (which they appear to already be hard at work on), I think this game will shine for the gem it is.

Now, onto the better part. The fact that the game freely allows you to choose Dogmatic (intense religious fervor for the Emperor, suffer no xeno, etc), Humanitarian (belief that there is hope and that humans can in fact eventually overcome these dark ages), and Heretical (basically being tempted and or submitting to the forces of Chaos) choices freely is frankly amazing, and a really good addition to this RPG. It also is fairly easy to import custom portraits and make secondary party members so I can roleplay as my favorite commissar and his faithful aid from my favorite 40K novels/audiobooks. The choices I had to make before even finishing chapter 1 was... (deep sigh) OOF. Really good, and sets the tone for the rest of the game, especially for those uninitiated to the 40K universe. The combat is fairly simple, thought I admit that some of the finer details kind of slip my understanding as my characters progress in levels.

Nocturne then slowly advanced several meter toward another guy, that at that point was too baffled to even fear for his life, and annihilated his as well.

Unsatisfied with his performance, he then proceeded to pull out a gun which he then promptly inserted into a solid rock wall to fire a storm of magic bullets that immediately killed my RT, hidden behind a tall wall, few meters in tickness.

At this point all my others characters on screen were just hoping to be graced by a clean shot from the aldeari rangers to avoid the same fate. Wish that was promptly granted for some of them.

When you finally kill him, he cloacks, says his goodbyes, and runs away when the haste pace of the previously mentioned uruk-haai finally eyeing the latrine.

Ship combat has some good concepts but seems to lack the incredible umph that the normal combat has. The aesthetics of the game actually remind me a lot of the original FFVII, especially when running around outside of combat. It's really well done.

I find it difficult to understand what a lot of the buffs do - this is annoying in the case of not knowing which buffs / debuff should be used in combat. Especially the stacking of ""exploits"" and using ""expose weakness"" has me clueless as to whether I'm doing something productive. Related to this, I made my character an officer and I don't think it has good gameplay. Especially when you have two of them. A lot of the time you're using their powers to allow your other combat focused classes to take extra turns. This is effective but it feels clunky and almost immersion breaking.

The game feels huge. The lore is great, as are the choices you can make and unexpected consequences. The guys who made this either love 40k or really did their homework. I never realised how huge space marines are compared to normal humans! Nice to finally get the scale.

-Catches the atmosphere/ vibe of the Warhammer 40k universe well!
-Graphics fit the ""gothic"" feel
-Interesting NPC/ characters
-Writing feels mostly very good
-Combat is good; many cool mini-bosses with unique mechanics

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
-Currently unfortunately still quite buggy, e.g. many talents don't work, quests bug out, infinite loops during combat (officer, I am looking at you); this gets worse in the later acts 3+ and is so bad I cannot recommend the game currently
-Convoluted and overly complex character development: you level frequently with tons of minor abilities/ talents requiring strong synergies with other talents- while some complexity is fine and even wanted in this genre here you have to keep an overview of roughly 10 characters with unique specific mechanics which is just way over the top
-Partly poor balance
[list]
[*]No scouting in space combat/ no indicator about space combat difficulty requires frequent reloads
[*]In some quests you are separated from your party which can generate huge problems when your main character build is on the talky/ support side and not focused on combat and the required skills [spoiler]one warp event places you on your ship in your apartment with tons of enemies including some demons[/spoiler] [spoiler]in act 3 you are stripped of all equipment and start alone which makes many skill checks and combat a huge reload feat[/spoiler]
[*]Some buffs are stackable to silly extends (e.g. arch militant combat stats, Cassias navigatorpowers) and overshadow other builds 
[/list]
-Some writing problems: character whining all the time about their personal choices and problems (Yrliet!), obvious ambushes your PC still walk into ([spoiler]capture at onset of act 3, seriously?[/spoiler])
-Heretic choices way to obvious and make no sense in universe: some or even most of the heretic moral choices are not borderline cases which might be considered acceptable for a rogue trader but obvious heresy which will get you (at best) a you quick visit from your friendly neighborhood inquisitor or (more likely) would be grounds for summary execution as worshiper of chaos

For those who don't know, the game drops you into the deep end of the 40k universe, putting you in the position of a Rogue Trader - a noble commanding their own voidship and operating at the fringes of the Imperium of Man, essentially with a mandate to explore and extend the Imperium's influence. How you do that is left up to you. Much like Owlcat's previous titles, you command a cadre of heroes in traditional crpg encounters in between a broader management game. Instead of a kingdom, you're managing your Voidship, and through that adding to the worlds that pay you tribute or owe you resources.

My main complaint is with the leveling system. You level up fast in this game, and there are a dizzying amount of skills to choose from. On a first playthrough it's nearly impossible to know ahead of time what skills will be most effective, though I should mention that the game does allow you to respec easily.

That being said, it got to the point where I dreaded leveling up, which is something I've never experienced in an RPG before. Most of the abilities have long-winded text descriptions including the formulas for their exact numerical effects, which is great, the problem is that with well over 50 choices at each level, it takes ages to go through every skill in detail, which usually results in giving up halfway through the massive list and picking a skill just to move the game along. Another problem with this is that many of  the most potent, class-specific skills are listed at the very end of this massive list of mostly irrelevant and useless skills. And don't trust the ""recommended skills"" too much. Some of them are useful but most of them are lies.

I give it a recommend if you're a fan of 40k and don't mind wading through the skill interface. Owlcat, if you're listening, please find some way to make the leveling-up process a little more user friendly.",1702972218,1702973398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, the rest of the overall design, compared to modern standards in UI/UX design is terrible. There are also some HUGE red flags in regards to good game design 101 with so little explained in an effective manner that the player is constantly blindsided by something new every few scenes, tempting a scum save. 

The player and the difficulty curve is so extremely unbalanced that the designers responsible should be embarrassed, with daring mode and below being a complete breeze and Unfair still being fairly easy but becoming so RNG heavy it becomes unbearable.

Then theres the fact that the game is so incredibly janked with half the talents and abilities not working as intended, with end turn cycles being so completely out of whack. Its clear the dev team either didnt even do a polish pass and expected us to deal with it or they fucked something up so fundamental to end turn cycles that it will never be fixed.

The game can really suck you in with the depth of its character creation but honestly, for all the time and effort that is required to understand how it all works and what does/doesnt work? It really isn't worth it.

Pros:
-Very engaging characters, might be the first time in a game that I found myself enjoying the writing of everyone. 
-Owlcat were very meticulous in their research of the setting, I've seen some very obscure lore references that I wouldn't have caught if I had not been familiar with the lore of both the general franchise and the particular TRPG that Rogue Trader is based on.
-Turn based system can get a little long with multiple enemies, but overall far preferable to the real time with tactics in Pathfinder and I overall enjoy it. 
-The minigames here are better than Kingdom management from Kingmaker or Path of the Righteous 
-If you're someone who adores Warhammer 40k this is a game you should definitely buy

Cons:
-Lots and lots of bugs. In the first two acts they're not noticeable but Act 3 and after they are a detriment to the experience and some of them outright spoil the plot or wreck your walkthrough.
-Final acts have a decline in the writing and content. Suffers from the usual problem with CRPGs where the earlier acts have the most content while the later acts are more sparse and railroady
-Gameplay can get tedious for someone who does not enjoy turn based X-COM like roll based combat. 

I really like this game, and would love to see the bugs ironed out, but if you're not a serious W40K follower than you might have a more mixed experience than I. The writing, atmosphere and artistic direction is some of the best ways you can immerse yourself in the 40k setting. The bugs however, are absolutely abominable, and unless Owlcat fixes them within a reasonable time frame then I advise you wait for when things are ironed out or when the game is on sale.

Ok, don't get me wrong. The game is pretty good up until Act 2.

Act 3 has a lot of bugs but it was still enjoyable.

But Act 4 is literally unplayable. Here's a brief list of some of the bugs that i've found:

- Dialogue ending out of nowhere, stoping you from being able to continue quests
- Can't continue ANY of the companion quests i've had in this act up until now (Cassia, Abelard and Hendrix)
- Ulfar getting permanently stuck on terrain, requiring me to load an old save and lose considerable progress
- Kiava Gamma requests for The Rogue Trader's presence disapearing out of nowhere

There were many more, like dozens of active abilities and passives not working properly. But the list above is of the most impactful, literally stopping me from being able to progress through the game (haven't tested main story, but i gave up on Act 4 after getting permanently stuck on Hendrix quest).

Act 4 also had a giant leap in difficulty out of nowhere. Not listing this as a bug, cause it could be intended. But it certainly didn't feel so to me. Examples:

- 90% of enemies being able to act before me and kill 4/6 of my team, leaving the other 2 with like 20% life (that was in Cassias quest). Had to reset like 4 times until i got lucky with initiative.
- A voidship combat out of nowhere against 6 megaships where each of then had a ton of health, add summoning and 3 attacks per turn. It was literally unprogressable for me, even when i changed voidship combat to easy and reloaded a save.

I'm all for the game being difficult, but the jump came kinda out of nowhere (playing on core difficulty as a pathfinder/crpg nerd)

Please do not release unfinished games. We're tired, it's the end of 2023 and we've had like thousands of games like this the past years. It's unexcusable, doesn't matter how good those early acts were (even with a lot of abilities not functioning properly).

Take your time, polish your game. This literally could've been my game of the year, tied with BG3. But now i'm left frustrated and i'm probably giving up on the game until thing are actually working properly. Maybe i'll start another run and play until act 2, don't know. Still pretty disapointed tho.

Yes, patches. As the game is like a Russian roulette. Some people find little to none bugs and have a great time. But some encounter game breaking bugs, get softlocked and frustrated. Like I said a classic Owlcat release. I'm sure that in 6 months to a year the game will be stellar. Right now, it oscillates between unplayable and really good.

Another case of needing a ""maybe"" option, rather than a simple yes or no.

I was on the fence about purchasing as I'd read about all the bugs and issues this game apparently has. I'd been lucky with previous OwlCat games and hadn't experienced most of the bugs others had reported and figured I'd take a chance again with this one.

I played for about 7 hours last night and didn't encounter a single bug. Made if through the Prologue and a healthy chunk of Act 1, and this was while taking breaks regularly and not being particularly quick to do anything in game. Loaded up the game this evening and now can't really progress my game.

Tooltips now show no information - not for skills, not for items, not for anything.

Dialogue windows open but are empty. It makes progressing further through the story a guessing game.

No amount of reloading is fixing this. Tried verifying my game files, tried uninstalling/reinstalling, the bug persists.

I really enjoyed Kingmaker & WotR, and I am sure I'll really enjoy this game too. But the bug really took the wind out of my sails for my enjoyment of this playthrough, so going to shelve it for a couple of months and give OwlCat chance to fix the issues.

If you like Kingmaker and WotR, and like the WH40k setting, you'll likely enjoy this, BUT buy it knowing that it needs some TLC.

*EDIT*

OwlCat having released a big hotfix & a number of small hotfixes, I've been able to play some more & thought I'd update the review.

In 40+ hours I've now experienced one CTD & no further bugs (that I've noticed). Doesn't mean there aren't still bugs, or that there aren't still game breaking ones, but given the improvement thus far the experience has changed significantly enough for me that I would now recommend the game.

I got hit by bugs out the gate that caused sound and camera settings to get zeroed out and would fail to persist.  Those bugs seem to have been addressed, cautious yay.

It's clear that there are still bugged storylines and your experience of bugs may differ quite a bit depending on which story/morality a character follows.  I've not run into major story bugs but I'm also now proceeding very slowly and with fairly short sessions while I wait for more patches to roll out.

There are also still some minor visual bugs such as animations occasionally failing to load, but I've only noticed a couple of issues thus far.

The actual story and combat fit the IP well.

My sense of humor and tolerance to horrific situations are pretty abnormal. Some of the stuff I've seen thus far have made me grin like a sociopath.

      The combat is ok, even looking ahead at professional gamer's videos, it does not look like going to get as good as hoped - TBD.  You had so many great builds in Wrath with even variations of sorcerer and so many spells - very cool.  I think wasteland 3 had better options in combat , so far this is very basic game with some nice visuals ($30 game range).  At end of ACT2, more than half way through game since Act 3&4 are small .... but still just a basic XCOM type game that gives illusion of many choices when really most of those If-Then conditions are so constrained, get little benefit ... smoke&mirrors.

So anyway I have got to a point where I have seen enough of the combat, ship mechanics (no space battles yet) etc to give a recommendation.

The main good points. Like other games by owlcat they have taken this project seriously. This is not a game made for teens (like chaos gates cartoon depiction of the imperium) this is made for adults and teens will enjoy it too. The combat seems deep enough and the class structures deep enough to keep it entertaining throughout. The stories are good depictions and help immersion into the war torns realms of the 41st millenia and theres no handholding to break that immersion.

Again only 16 hours in but this is the type of way I wanted other Warhammer projects to be, gritty and realistic within their game system. They seem to have nailed it far better than TWWH3 and of course chaos gate. Good job Owlcat.

Will update later if this changes but unlikely

Ok required an update: This is buggy, do not buy for awhile until they sort it out. Quests are often bugged and in this kind of 100 hour game you dont want to get 70 hours in and have your favourite npcs questlines be unable to be completed. It sucks majorly.

Also the combat system is not good. I dont feel like im making a character I want to make but getting railroaded into archtypes. So not for me in that respect. Ship combat is also pretty basic and needed fleshing out.

However, it really isn't a playable product in the current state. 5 acts, 1-2 are buggy but playable, act 3 is a bit less stable. Act 4 and 5 are so bugged even the main quest line doesn't work without external tools (and even then you're only ever one move away from another thing being completely broken). The fact that the point where the game completely breaks down is so far in is doubly frustrating as by the time you reach it you're quite invested in the playthrough.

It's one of those needs time in the oven deals.

The combat can be fun and is mostly fit for purpose when enemies don't bug out. But the game mostly shines in it's sticking to the lore and really good characters and writing. It's genuinely enjoyable and can be pretty funny at times too.
The one thing that does often seem off is the heretic choices in conversations. It's not so much subversive choices which would lead to you being corrupted and turning away from the dogma as they are just being a murdering psycho and yeah sure that can work but there's often no subtle heretic choice. 

The issue is it's just a bit frustrating to play at times.
I've had a range of issues from 
- A space battle where a planet under my control was attacked and I was forced into a battle vs 6 light cruisers when you yourself only have a frigate and was on my own. That's not going to end well as they each had about twice my health out gunned me all deployed bombers and then just reduced me to wreckage almost instantly. Loaded the last save and said event had vanished from my planet. 
- I've had items that can only be equipped by Eldar but at the same time anyone with Eldar equipment proficiency was barred from using it? so? Who is this for?
- A character in my party also showed up in a room as an ai controlled helper effectively cloning them. Twice the Space Wolf twice the fun.
- There's side character (let's call him Bob) which I spoke to then left the planet and headed to an event, which I thought was a character side event however it was actually the main plot which railroaded me into a section where I lost access to the other side content etc and had a party member tell me they were the one that murdered Bob like it was some kind of revelation for me. Despite him being fine when I last spoke to him and not being informed he had been killed. 
- Oh and the one which made me write this up in which during a section where I had to rescue a party member I had the choice to take them with me in my party or just keep them in the retinue etc. I didn't add them into my current party as I was trying out a new character I just got. Carried on playing and when I tried to swap said rescued character back in they had just... vanished gone. No idea what happened to them. I didn't kick them out of the retinue or kill them etc. But nope they're just gone. And the last save in which they were around was... a chapter and a half ago. Yay.... Okay partially my bad for relying on quick saves and autosaves and not backing up my main save file. But urg. 

I'm gonna give it a while and come back to the game and see how it goes. This isn't so much as a don't ever get this game as a don't get this game right now. It's got a lot of promise and is really fun I've been hooked but the glitches and weird issues are slowly putting me off.

Honestly while the bugs are really forcing the ""save often"" rule to the limit, what will and does grind a lot of players gears is the class / combat system. In short, it's a massive in your face U.I. that is closer to World of Warcraft than it is to the actual table top RPG the game is based off of.

Owlcat should have just ported over the original Fantasy Flight Games Rogue Trader combat system instead of the convoluted mess that is the combat / class system in Owlcats Rogue Trader. This is a example of a game developer wanting to build a system they are familiar with instead of one that is suited for the game they were making, and it shows.

Long story short, you're better off playing the Table Top over this game, because this game is not true to the spirit of 40k or RT. Rather it is just Owlcats version of the game that does not honor the original.

To Owlcat, when has it ever worked out well for a games company to take an existing game and change the rules entirely? Right, it never has. Don't re-invent the wheel.

Combat is not engaging. Somewhere in Act 2 I got to the point where I was able to complete every combat encounter in less than 1 round.

Despite the well-crafted story, atmosphere, and companions, the sheer number of bugs and flaws is staggering. Let's go into specifics:

Positives:
- Great story and companions
- Diverse locations
- Interesting and uncomplicated space travel system
- Excellent atmosphere
- Space battles!
- Lots of hidden and additional content

Negatives:
- A significant number of bugs, both small and large
- The cooperative system was poorly executed
- A lot of desync issuses
- Some character skills don't work or cause bugs
- Respecing characters is costly, which, considering skill issuses, should be free
- The game contains errors that completely prevent the completion of certain quests or story

Regarding cooperation: In this mode, the number of issuses is even greater. If you're expecting cooperation similar to Divinity or Baldurs Gate, forget about it. This mode is very primitive and only allows control of assigned characters on maps and during combat. When a host player is on their Void Ship, other players can't even move. Also be prepared for a fair amount of desync.

Ofcourse BG3 is better with graphics and so on, so it might seem like a step down.
but if you can get past the graphics, this a gem of massive value.

this is definatly one of the good ones.

there are some bugs in it, and i wanna tell yeah... DO NOT TAKE DEATHDEALER TRAIT ON YOUR PSYKERS!!!!!!
Idira a unsanctioned Psyker of mine killed someone with a Long Las and deathdealer triggered
but she decided to use her AoE Cone Psyker on her team mates almost murdering them.
Poor Pasqal the Tech Priest Magos was flabbergasted by this.

Deathdealer is however extremly good on any none psyker/navigator team members. But on Psykers omph... that turned ugly more than once before i got to respec Idria.

Also Idria being an unsanctioned psyker you should not make her your main psyker of the party unless you want it to be highly risky to use the powers, from spawning Tzcentch Blue or Pink horrors that are hostile instead of buffing up your allies..... on the highest difficulty thats murder.

I want SO bad to love this game. It gets 40k perfect. The feel the dialogue the story all of it is great. If this was a movie or a book it'd be one of the best. But its not, its a videogame and thats where it fails. To start off with the game system it is based off of is farrr more complex and numerical than the OTHER big crpg released this year in BG3. For me it was only a minor issue but theres a lot of ability reading so if thats not your cup of tea id just steer clear for now. But the system IS much easier than pathfinder 1e which is what kingmaker was based off of so if that was ok to you this game will be fine.

But now on to the dirty, the bugs. Now im not too picky when it comes to bugs normally, I play a lot of paradox and bethesda games. But with those games you have mods, dlc, and an EXPANSIVE console to fix just about any issue you run into. This game has none of these, for the former 2 its due to its young age and the latter is just the devs didnt implement one. And the bugs im complaining about aren't your basic visual bugs like purple squares, sex turning you invisible, or abilities making you run across the entire physical map. No the bugs that ""bug"" me are the ones that gut your story. No spoilers but when you travel system to system in your ship ""travel"" events can fire. These can be minor to major, with many companions and planet quests relying on these to continue their stories. But Today alone I had FIVE of these events start, but fail to fire the cutscene for them, effectively failing each one. This is not counting the multitudes of actual quests ive bricked and had to reload constantly or having to break quests with cheat mods. And I cant even tell if I missed an important romance option cause it failed to fire or if that was inconsequential cause I wont look for spoilers. 

This hurts so much because i WANT to keep playing. I ADORE the story and I want to keep at it like I did with bg3. But unlike bg3, RTs bugs hurt the one bit of the game i really care about, the story. Im just missing content I PAYED FOR.

There is lots to like about this game, after 100 hours i want to play more, but at too many points in the game i just can't. 
This game is a buggy mess and releasing it in this state is borderline criminal; there are small bugs along the first couple of chapters, but these are easily forgiven in a branching narrative story, game-play glitches are few and far between so all in all it is easy to keep playing.

Chapter 3 is where the cracks start to show, the dialogue breaks alarmingly often and quest hints become frustratingly obscure. The game ceases to be fun because you are spending hours running around the same area looking for plot movements that have failed to trigger.

Chapter 4 falls apart. Difficulty makes no logical sense, being piss easy on one location and nightmarish on another. The general feeling in the story is that everything is breaking down and going to hell, and the state of the game mirrors that perfectly. Quests are broken and entire plot threads are blocked off, quests are completed and then marked as failed, quests are completed but remain open and fail to trigger any further steps, the plot moves forward but dialogue options never progress along and still reference motivations/places that no longer exist. The game can break entirely during this chapter requiring a long trip back to previous chapters to try again in the vain hope that you can progress normally after.

Chapter 5 is a sh*t show. It does not seem to have been tested at any point. Characters threaten to leave unless their quests are completed, yet their quests never start. The reward for making it this far in the game is to have Owlcat spit on your face.

I played for a couple hours, and have watched some videos/streams of people playing it. This game really does seem pretty solid. Was excited about it for a long time. Owlcat has a great history of games with the pathfinders, I jus don't like real-time-pause so this game as a turn-based and set into a very big universe with lots of lore seemed solid to me.

However.......... Baldur's Gate 3 just came out. And I kinda laughed at the fact a lot of *companies* straight up said they think this game is gonna ""hurt them"" because they ""can't compete"".. well. That's the truth in my book.

After putting a couple hundred or so hours into BG3, I started playing this game and it just felt like something was missing. I didn't feel immersed. It felt a bit flat. But then I look back at pretty much every other game similar to this like XCOM, Phoenix Point, etc, and I really now feel the same way about them. I think this is a pretty solid game. I think perhaps they drop you into a spot where ""yeah you're level 1 and have this huge experienced past"" is a bit weird but that's probably just my TTRPG roots coming out. The game play in this is pretty solid, mechanically it's very standard XCOM style game, but adding in a lot of cool features around your character building gives this a solid +1 in my book.

I just.. Couldn't play it. I no longer want an RPG where I do not feel fully immersed in it. I'm not a fanboy of the 40k universe, so I'm sure that doesn't help. If you love the 40k universe you could probably really settled into this right away. If you're here for gameplay first and foremost and a immersive story second, you're probably gonna love this. As a huge story/character driven TTRPG player, I don't feel as if this is for me at the moment.

I might circle back to this and grab it on sale a year from now or something when I can play it as a co'op game if it works out to do so. For now though, back to BG3! And maybe Wasteland 3.

The combat is complex but fun with buildcrafting being super in depth. [/h2]

This game is exactly what i wanted and more from an RPG set in the Warhammer universe.
I've been a Warhammer fan for the better part of 4 years and i'm pretty deep into the lore of things, I'm a huge fan of the books (and Luetin's lore videos) and a collector and builder of figures. So it suffices to say i'm a pretty big Warhammer fan.

The game is a beautiful representation of its source material, from the prayers, procedures and hierarchy of the Adeptus Mechanicus down to the smallest details of the chaos gods and cultists, everything is perfect.
Every area is a joy to explore and captures the setting of warhammer without fail, ships are industrial with pipes and cathedral aesthetics and cities are often grim and impoverished in some areas and wealthy and well established in the more noble areas (this is even shown inside your [b]OWN SHIP! [/b] )

The combat and levelling systems can be quite a lot to understand but in my experience you dont really [b] NEED [/b] to understand it. A lot of the things will just work behind the scenes but there is a lot of buffs and debuffs to keep track of at times and it can be pretty overwhelming. [b] BESIDES THAT, [/b] the combat is isometric turn based combat. The loadouts and builds are up to [b] YOU [/b] and can be changed at [b] ALMOST [/b] any time. (Requiring you to go back to your ship which you can't always do.) Each companion has an unchangeable archetype but they really work well with each character so you wont find me complaining. This does mean if you want a meta or balanced team you might have to use characters you don't like as much but i don't see that as much of an issue because if you like a character enough to be upset by this you will probably use them regardless! (Argenta my beloved.) There are so many abilities and passives to choose from so there is no lacking in the diversity of builds.

There is a [b] LOT [/b] of reading in this game make no mistake, I'm someone who struggles to read due to a lack of attention span [b] BUT [/b] this game has kept me reading for [b] 40 HOURS [/b] and i'm still going. Let that be a testament to how well written the dialogue is in this game. [b] REGARDING YOUR DIALOGUE OPTIONS; [/b] They are phenomenal, every choice you make in the dialogue may not be important but each options [b] OOZES [/b] personality and its up to you to choose the one that [b] YOU [/b] feel like [b] YOUR [/b] character would say. If you want to be the Emperor's own asshole, there's dialogue options for that. If you want to get straight to the point and be a no nonsense man of business there's dialogue options for that too. It leaves so much in your hands in terms of letting you experience the game and let you [b] ROLEPLAY! [/b]

Finally, an above average Warhammer game.

                                                                   The Emperor protects.

Terrible english ahead.

   What is good? Writing. What is bad? Almost everything else. Like, i love both turn based games and WH40K universe while this game makes it tiring to play itself despite being both. I don`t even know where to start. Let it be technical things first.

[h3]Where is optimization?[/h3] 
   It fell of while traveling in the warp?Held hostage by Dark Eldar? Executed for  being too heretical for Owlcat? Don`t get me wrong, i don`t have top machine by any means, but i was able to play Cyberpunk, BG3 without completely killing graphics and games like Dota 2, Warframe etc. on top one`s. Why i have to turn off almost anything to have normal FPS in WH40K RT? Game is not ugly by any means, but there is nothing to write home about, locations are pretty small with something like 30-ish NPC`s at most (in comabt locations) with 1-2 text bubbles for each one. 

[h3]UI and QOL.[/h3] 
   Why are character specific talents are in bottom of the list? Something like ""+ 5 Fellowship"" for tech-priest above his unique ""Gets +1 to deflection, MP, wounds and d*ck size while in heavy armor"" or ""+5 to Ballistic Skill"" for Psykers above their ""+1 lvl to Psy-rating"". Why ship cargo doesn`t go to cargo automatically like any other cargo? Why respecing costs non-renewable resourse and costs more EACH time you use it, in the game where UI sucks and half of talents either don`t work or doesn`t work as they should be. Why can`t i go to my palace from the orbit of the system without loading in system then, running through the square and THEN loading in the palace, same with your room on the ship. You can`t go to the room without loading on the bridge. Skills randomly deselecting. Psykers not showing LOS, no one showing their LOS in the deploymet phase. Enemy skills not having descriptions, enemy profiles not LISTING enemy skills.Quess what this demon do when he drops to certain amount of HP? Teleports to other side of the room and casts mindcontrol around him. What happens when beastmaster dies? Chimera gets another turn. What half of this servitor buffs do?

   Sometimes you fall asleep while ""Cultist group № 33"" gets annihilated by 2 of your party members. Sometimes you ponder should you load 2 hours long save because game have just thrown 6 dark eldar cruisers in your face with the choice to fight them or essentially lose a colony (but actually it isn`t a choice cause you can`t win anyways without finding and beating every other space combat before).

[h3]Bugs.[/h3] 
    I don`t know on what planet, people which say that the game have minor bugs, probably on some tyranid infested world. Quests not starting. Quests not finishing. Quests soft-locking the game. Quests hard-locking the game. Didn`t lvl up character? His cut-scene is bugged now. Didn`t have this character in party before the space encounter? Woops, quest is now in permanent limbo. Eldar unable to use eldar weapon(wut). NPC giving up on live and skiping turn just because. Talents not working, or working incorrectly. Music randomly disappearing in combat. Slow-mo lasting too long after some kills. Ship having cooldowns from last fight(?). I don`t about this one, but AI is dumb as hell. Both allied and enemy NPC indulge in FF like they using blood of their comrades instead of butter. In some battles so called ""allies"" are more dangerous then the enemy. Sometimes enemy range fighters run in to your melee`s and then run back to be slapped by attack of opportunity. Dudes killing themself by repeatedly attacking counter-striking fighter. Ship praking in front of your torpedoes. In the grim darkness of far future there is only circus.",1702856526,1702856526,False,4,2,0.491051435470581055,0,True,False,False

With that said it's by no means as ""in-depth"" when it comes to decision making (The main options it gives you are almost exclusively Pro-Imperium zealotry, Iconoclast/neutral yet emphatic or selfish heretic/Pro-Chaos) or graphically pleasing as BG3 but its probably the best Owlcat game yet (Or at least that I have played.) and they somehow pulled off the Warhammer 40K dark gothic sci-fi/pseudo-cyberpunk vibe pretty well despite me not bring a huge fan of Owlcats art style. I was also surprised by how much i enjoyed the Reputation/Trade system and the more complex combat system, they can take awhile to get the hang of but once you get used to it, its an absolute blast!

My only complaints are that some of the companions are pretty lackluster in both story and dialog after their initial introduction and personal quests are completed (I haven't fully explored the romance mechanics so I'm obviously missing some more content there.), it is still somewhat buggy (I've been locked out of making any actions mid combat for no reason resulting in me having to reload a previous save at least 6 times now and I have had the exit icon disappear in both the Captains Quarters and Void Ship Bridge twice which I fixed by consolidating my game files and restarting the game.) and lastly the the tutorial could be better; some aspects of the combat can have a annoying learning curve at the start if you have never played a game by Owlcat and are also playing on a higher difficulty option - if this is your first Owlcat game maybe start on the easiest difficulty - Yes, all of the cultists in Chapter 1 will be mostly one hit kills, making it not even remotely difficult but you will thank me when get bum rushed by Chaos Spawns or you face [spoiler]Aurora[/spoiler] for a second time.

I was excited about this game when i first heard of it and wanted to find out more i was a bit wary of the fact that Owlcat games was behind it, considering that they made the Pariah of my games library, Pathfinder:Kingmaker. I decided that for the sake of the hope of it being a good 40k RPG, i'd try it out.

It is run through with the same issues i had in Pathfinder:Kingmaker. I love the story, i love the characters, i love the idea. I absolutely hate the mechanics and design of the game. I don't know if it just needs a ton of patches, as this is an early launch version, but it is frustrating to a degree that makes this game infuriating to play.

On one of the starting planets, the fights regularly knock down two or three of my party members, which causes us to rack up permanent wounds that reduce them to nearly useless in combat. At the same time, the only way to restore these party members to their full health is to get to the voidship. But unfortunately, that's not a possibility, because i'm trapped on planet. Which means that any significantly difficult fight was an immediate party wipe with no chance of sucess. I later found out that you can  have more party members than i had. Which would make more sense about why i was losing so badly. But my issue with this is that in order to correct it, i'd have to start a whole new game and basically begin again. It would've been great to HAVE BEEN INFORMED that i was in an area that would likely stomp me flat. 

Add in a few more issues just as easy to solve, but paradoxically unaddressed as this, and this is my issue with the game. It watches you make a mistake that you can't predict, laughs at your for falling into it, then kneecaps you while you're down and drops you into a fight with an alligator, crippled, bleeding, and holding half a stick. 

Maybe the mechanics and design will shape up in the next few months as they add in patches and changes. If it does, i'll happily change this review.

The closest comparison I've played would be the Shadowrun games by Harebrained Schemes, the X-Comish style and story delivery, with a great deal more quantity of story than any of the Shadowrun games.

But the state of play right now is frustratingly broken to the point where I'm going to pause playing and sit back to let it get patched a bit more. I'm in the midst of Act 3 right now and managed to dodge any of the main quest breakers that others have. However, my side/companion quests have been a mess. I had one companion quest introduction get interrupted mid-dialogue with a sudden break to a main quest scene in a totally different room, thus losing that companion quest altogether. I just finished another one (an obnoxiously fussy stealth quest) only to have it abort without explanation at the final conversational step, apparently taking the companion with it.

If you enjoy the setting, the vibe is right there. The moral complexity of a universe were doing the ethically right thing may result in horrifically bad outcomes is very much there.

It just does not make sense and is frustrating.

I mean even if a team works on writing should they not... you know...  align stuff like that? Inconsistent, immersion ruining, very unfortunate.

Lightning damage area denial zones that can not be mended or influenced and even outside combat the characters do not avoid them but run in and through, just stacking mountains of injuries unless you meticuously micromanage everything with a clunky and unwieldy UI?

They've managed to remember how absolutely screwed up the Imperium is, how it makes a lot of it's own problems, and how it's incredibly hypocritical, backward and counterproductive in general.  And it lets you decide if you're going to go along with that, or try your best to steer things to as decent a direction as you can given the circumstances.  Or just decide 'screw it, i can make the universe even worse'.

So lorewise yeah, I'm liking it a lot.  Story also, so far at least, it's really got me hooked.

That said the gameplay is where I have some trouble - this may just be because I'm so much more used to D&D and Pathfinder, and so this system confuses my stupid old brain; but combat, which is frequent, often feels a little flat.  And kind of ridiculous given how frequently I've seen enemies accidentally shoot their allies by trying to burst fire from behind them.

I mean that is in a way pretty true to the source material but... what's darkly funny in one format can feel kind of deflating in another, if that makes sense?

It's also had some occasional game breaking bugs where stuff just... won't let me progress.  That *seems* to have cleared since last patch for me;  but I figure it's worth mentioning.

At the moment there are too many technical bugs to fully enjoy the experience. You'll run into infinite turns, sequence breaks, some of your abilities won't work (but you'll spend AP on it). I've run into a fight where there are unit models missing. I can mouse over and see their names, they show up in the turn order, and they can fight. But I can't target them, so 80% of my abilities and attack can't do anything to them.   

I like Owlcat and I'll change this review. This isn't a maybe, I will change this review in the future. At this moment, I wish I could go back in time and tell myself to give the game some more time post release before trying. There are enough bugs and quality of life issues that would make waiting a much more enjoyable experience after stuff gets fixed and streamlined. This is actually pretty par the course for Owlcat. They've made great strides in their Pathfinder series when it comes to bug fixes and QOL improvements. I expect the same for Rogue Trader, just a few more months down the line.  

Bottom line, if you try this game and you're in love with it keep playing. But if you're not willing to save scum because of bugs,  not willing to restart entire dungeons and sequences because your choices bricked your game to a certain point, not willing to discover some equipment, items, and abilities don't work to the point of having to redo all the skills of a character, and not willing to use up consumables and weird abilities to 'repair' fights that don't work as intended, wait. For the sake of your time wait. This game needs more time in the oven.

Update: 
I’ve stopped playing the game. There are just too many bugs and sequence breaks. This game was rushed out. It’s the only reasonable explanation for it. I got to chapter four and there are too many moments where I know I’m missing something. For example I’ll be warping around in my ship and all of a sudden one of my crew tells me they have something important to tell me and I’m snapped back to the bridge. I’m in front of the captain’s seat and nothing happens. Then I wander the bridge talking to all my party members, officers, and random bridge crew in hopes I trigger something. I wouldn’t bring this up if it didn’t happen three times in a row. Something similar happens with half-dozen other things. 

Another frequent issue is awkward in-engine cinematics that don’t work properly. The camera will snap to the wrong place, having your player character and party be awkwardly out of frame watching something happen. There’s no fixed dialogue location for this, instead it’s speech bubbles that come from the characters, so you’d get partial dialogue or none at all. Or you’re in frame but nothing happens, or half of it does. Really awkward as your lieutenant yells “Get down captain!” at a door that opens and nothing’s behind it. Or you see an NPC say “I’ll kill this hostage” and there’s no hostage. Or just watching your party pause at random to stare at nothingness for five seconds. 

I bring this up as a “buyers beware”. The bugs and problems grow exponentially between chapters. In other words, a lot of the polish went into the first chapter and then massively fell off as you proceed. That’s what let me get so far into the game and the contrast is what has me stopping and warning others to wait. You’ll be missing out on content and having a more frustrating, time consuming, and overall worse experience as you go deeper into the game. 

I’m not even mentioning the good and bad design choices they made. I’ll update this review again (again) to talk about stuff like combat, ship to ship battles, colony management, the overall story, companions, the UI, dialogue, graphics, and asset designs but that all has to wait because if I did it now it would be like reviewing a restaurant that is still under construction. Sure I can talk about just the food, but when you’re asking me to ignore the power tool noise, the dust everywhere, and just spit out any nails I find in my order, I’ll just stop eating and say I’ll come back when construction is over.

Without knowing pathfinder systems I decided to play on hard (kingmaker on hard made me quit after few hours in), and I found game not that difficult. I needed three tries for the last boss which I think it's good enough. I expect that to change in Chapter II.

I like combat overall, I even read everything because Warhammer lore is awesome and I know nothing about it. Also it keeps me interested in the game.

Bugs are there but I hope they will get rid of most of them soon.

Are classes optimized? No, hopefully they will optimize them better in the next patches.

Coop is a big plus.

Leveling Up looks very terrifying and confusing for a new player, but until around lvl 8 which comes pretty fast you will probably READ out most of talents MULTIPLE TIMES and by that time you will know what you want.

Is it worth playing once the bugs are fixed? ABSOLUTELY 

Time is valuable don't waste it replaying content that is buggy, losing hours of game play will never be fun. If you don't want to wait for the patches that fix this stuff, I recommend quick saving EVERY SINGLE TURN. Fights sometimes can take 15-20 minutes on harder difficulties, enemies have more HP and RES. they also need to move and you need to reapply buffs EVERY SINGLE TURN which requires animation time. SO when you get a black screen after beating a boss you struggled with for an hour and then have to do it again .... is preposterous. All that being said i still put 70+ hours into it because; the game is cool, I enjoy the universe, they don't hold back, and it feels like it honors the source material.

Bugs I've experienced:
1. Loading screens and critical hits lead to 10 random achievements spamming in the corner (that I've already unlocked)
2. You will proc achievements ""score 500 critical hits"" after landing 1, Scanned 1 planet got ""Scan every planet in galaxy""
3. First boss fight end of chapter 1 he/she can walk through objects and PC's if you have them boxed in (Intended?)
4. If combat ends with enemies dying to burn, there is a 50/50 chance game will freeze
5. Multiple fights post chapter 1 lead to a black screen, I had a fight go for almost 30 minutes to then black screen.
6. Many abilities don't work as intended (a patch was released, it doesn't address all the issues but it does for some) 

This is Owlcat we're talking about so they'll fix this, the game needed to ""bake"" a little bit longer but they're a respectable company and should release some awesome patches and DLC's.

Combat encounters are common to the point of tedium and make me want to take breaks from the game.

The boss battles so far are more challenging, but are still just fundamentally a DPS check to see if you can burn through a huge healthbar.

As expected with an Owlcat game there are also dozens of small bugs constantly. Random sounds playing in the background, NPC models randomly disappearing in the middle of cutscenes, bits of the UI disappearing forever and requiring you to reload a save to fix it, I could go on.

Nothing game-breaking, but constantly immersion breaking.

EDIT:
I've played on, and just to add that the game completely falls to pieces on a technical level from Act 3 onwards. What were once annoyances, become soft-locks, and crashes to desktop.

The narrative has also completely fallen apart for me. The game spent a huge amount of time setting up a political conflict between rogue traders, the inquisition and various pirate factions, only to throw all that out the window and force you to go to Commorogh and take you back to square one.

(Also, whoever decided to put a compulsory stealth section into the game is a perverse sadist)

That's here in Rogue Trader. However, the Rogue Trader system is less mechanically compelling than the d20 system - a +10 percent conditional dodge bonus here, a rare verb here, a flat percentage reduction there. They choices on offer in this system is not meaty, and sadly, not compelling.

What Owlcat does poorly is its writing. It's bland and without incident. Warhammer really lives and dies in its closed-minded ideologies and in its brutality. Warhammer is like a fever dream, but the world depicted here is so banal and soft. In a setting as dangerous as 40k, every conversation should have been weighted with severe consequence. Instead, you have dialog where there's no consequence to exhausting every tertiary dialog choice and where the points of articulation are lampshaded so hard you'd have to be completely genre blind to be surprised by them.

But, in its current state, I am forced to leave a negative review due to the abhorrent situation concerning bugs, this product was not play tested past the beta and it shows.
I can take having to reload once in a while when something breaks mechanically, I can deal with that, but when my companions quests get stuck and fail, with no solution to fix it barring using a mod, that's too much.
Even then, I was willing to take it, it's just one companion right?
Wrong, the moment you leave act 3 and enter act 4 the game completely loses it, I immediately had everything broken the moment I returned to my ships, with 3 of my companions quests bugging and not triggering since they would disappear the moment they approached me to tell me about their problems.
It is immediately apparent where the open beta ended because any semblance of polish just disappears past act 3, it's jarring.
The game should have never been released in such a state. I will wait patches, and of course I will continue playing, but this negative review is totally deserved. When and if the game is fixed I will consider a positive review due to the many positive things about it.

This isn't a finished product, this is an EARLY ACCESS game and should be labeled as such.

Like every game owlcat released previously, the early chapters are finished enough to be plyable, so you can get some 40 hours of decent gameplay, but past chapter 3 this game is completely broken.

There are numerous quest breaking, soft locking and hard locking bugs in this game. As an example, in the dark city you'll find two characters that can be recruited, and if you have them in your party, once you reach an arena with a big fight there will be a copy of the first character and the second will be uncontrollable, soft locking the game.

Also, this is the first owlcat game in which the secondary gameplay system is decent. As you retake your roguetrader states you travel through the systems and engage in ship combat, which is kinda cool, BUT it's filled with bugs are annoying things. One of those things is how slow the combat is. There's a animation's speed option for ground combat, but not ship combat, and that makes it awful to replay it, when the combat should be 5, 10 minutes at best and the game forces you to watch slow motion after slow motion of the ships firing tiny orange slugs at each other, making you easily waste 30 minutes per fight.

Still in ship combat, the game actively lies about your ship movement, sometimes simply not allowing it to make a turn as tightly as the movement grid shows and keeping the enemy ships out of your guns firing arcs. The enemies never meet this problem tho. Even your weapons reach is a lie, when you launch torpedos they become they own suicidal unity in the map and you can control them. You can either drive the torpedos on top of an enemy ship or explode them in a 1 square radios to hit multiple enemies, BUT your ship takes damage even if you are outside the explosion radios.

Then comes the stupid, that in ship combat you never start first. So when you engage with 5 enemy ships, and you have no way of knowing how many they are before getting into the battle, they all attack you, strip your ship shields and take out more than half your health before you can even make a move.

Even on the ship skill descriptions the game lies to you. There's skill for example, that let you fire 3 salvos of torpedos every other round, or let you board the enemy ship every turn. These are very strong habilities that any player would gladly take them, but the game doesn't tell you that they are on a cooldown of more than 10 rounds each and the cooldown doesn't reset between fights. So you'll use them thinking you're now much stronger than before, but in the next 6, or 7 fights you won't be able to use them because of the 10 rounds cooldown.

Like everything that owlcat makes, the idea is great, the main gameplay is loveable, but it is broken as hell and some parts are actively hostile against the player.

Have had to restart twice due to npcs bugging out, and combat is incredibly dog shit. Spending entire rounds buffing and debuffing before actually attacking so you can take out some of these enormous hp bars that get tossed in with 20+ trash mobs. Some enemy encounters are incredibly rng dependent and ruin the momentum of the game. There's a boss towards the end of chapter one that started the fight one shotting one of my characters in full cover, and an enemy sniper that also did the same. That's two characters down right off the rip, reloaded the fight, the boss missed, the sniper missed, and I killed the boss without taking a single hit. I'm not playing on unfair, but i'm not playing on story mode either. I think i'm on daring? Ridiculous the amount of variance in combat. Space combat feels incredibly clunky with default weapons. 

I restarted after trying the evil path for a few hours, because the motivations seemed some myspace ""rawr xd im evil"" level of writing, but the imperial loyalist path has been fairly decent. I've enjoyed just about every companions dialogue and motivations for whatever that's worth. 

It's a shame, i've always wanted to pick up WOTR, and i'm glad I didn't. To put it lightly, I wouldn't be playing if it wasn't 40k.

No one cared to add narrator voicing all the descriptions they dumped into dialog, so you either read slower then listen(unlike usual) or re-read after replica. No one marked movement through dangerous environment in combat, so you have to guess based on unclear effects. No one cared about fast return from missions - so you have 3 loading screens to return to the ship. No one cared about consistency - you can initiate encounter with rebels by you sniper shot, unless they are scripted to ""ambush"" you and are invulnerable before that, you are offered auto-loot system and immediately there are narrative consequences for not looting manually. No one cared to change movement for huge enemies - and huge chaos spawn stuck in a corned blocked by 1m tall box.

And boy, am I glad I went with that trust and purchased this game.
Warhammer  has all the pieces of the Owlcat Pathfinder games, but takes each one and spins it on it's own. The increase of quality each game has seen in gameplay, voice acting, graphics, you name it, has been amazing to see and the developers deserve applause!

The game itself features really in depth lore made easy for people who have never read a thing on Warhammer. The hyperlinks + encyclopedia not only gives you what you need, it entices curiosity to research the world lore on your own. It takes all the expectations of typical grim dark gaming and allows new fans to come in and enjoy the rich world building in a personalized way.

The voice acting at times had me gobsmacked, a specific scene that has Idira cry out in anguish gave me actual goosebumps! To me, the character writing + voice acting is what makes these games stand out among the rest, and they didn't let me down. Each game takes the theme and really goes to bat in the language and diction of characters. Some people may get turned off by the long text boxes, but I enjoy the hell out of them! So much character in each paragraph, whoever is the writer for these deserves a raise.

Coming from the Pathfinder games, I was weary over the limitation of the archetypes (since you had 1 million class choices in WotR), but I honestly like this one. It doesn't feel so overwhelming and like you have to have an idea of your build ahead of time. I like that it baby steps it out, it allows me to explore a bit better.

I finally got to this games specialty travel fighting, the SHIP BATTLES. At first I was like ""hmmm"" but the moment I got a few shots off and had the other ship fleeing in fear, I was sold. It ain't much, but it's honest work, and i can't wait to see what upgrades do for those.

My only complaints so far (that could be remedied in the future): I wish it was more obvious on the ship map if there are places to discover dialogue or quests (I just finished chapter 1, so if it's better chapter 2 and onward, I take it back). Bugs have NOT been game breaking to me, I have only had to restart  once, but it was an obvious bug that was easy to get rid of with a quicksave/load. I wish there were more routes (dogmatic, heretical, iconoclast) but I also recognize the limitation of lore. Having a 9 grid for pathfinder spoils you a bit more in versatility.

All in all, I look forward to the predicted hundreds of hours I will spend with this game, and all it does is make me want to put even more hours into the other games. :)",1702805768,1702805768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Space travel: Well not bad, but many times your travels are interrupted by events, and after 20+ occasion it will be annoying. 
Space Battles: This part is nailed. Fast fights, with cool abilities.
Enemies: The game represents a wide spectrum of enemies of the Imperium. Chaos (Heretek, Slaneesh, Tzeentch, Nurgle) Eldar and Dark Eldar, Necrons. 
Fights with characters: Well this is the worst part of the game. You level up for nothing. The enemies overpowering you many times. Many of the enemies have 150-400 wound points, that mean 2-5 times more than your characters. And some fight mechanic are world breaking (speakers that give temporary wounds to enemies???). Also a bolter (a well known deadly weapon) is a toy compared to xeno guns. Unbelivable. I begin the game on Normal difficulity, in Act 3 I changed to Story mode, and after that still wiped on the chapter boss (Dark Eldar Archon) more than 10 times!
Psykers: The game transforms the psykers and their abilities into a clown. Every fan and gamer knows, the psykers are the most dangerous creatures of the universe. One psyker alone capable to destroy a planet, or can cause trouble in a sector. But not here. You use one ability, and cause 20-30 damage to an enemy (with a psy rating 3-4), who have a hundred or more wounds remaining after your attack. Funny as hell. In Total War Warhammer, when you use an attacking spell with a caster, there are a minimum of dozen dead enemies. 
Injuries and Traumas: This game mechanic nerfs your characters to useless state. If you go to fights with this curse, you will spend a lot of time with reloads and replays. And you can heal them at your void ship only. Congratz developers, your stupidity is limitless. 
Colony development and trading: This is quite good, and enjoyable, with interesting ideas. 
The Story: Well , Act 1 and 2 is bearable. But Act 3 is a great pile of fecal matter. The developers brings you the old stupid and hated cliche: after you earn some power, resources, items, and followers you lose it all. You will be weakened and tormented, and try to escape and regain everything. Some cases it will work, but not with an anointed and faithful Rouge Trader. Not in the Warhammer 40K Universe. If the Dark Eldar really abduct an important person, the Imperium sends his best...not regards mate, but the Space Marines, may be with a terminator librarian support, and good bye Dark Eldars. And not only because they abduct the person, but for revenge, and for a lesson to all Dark Eldar. The Imperium of Man is a serious matter. 
Overall Warhammer 40k feeling: Something is there, but clearly the developers cant understand the whole picture. They dont immerse themselves in the universe and the lore, and because of this they botched it. May be if the devs read more Ian Watson, Dan Abnett and others, then they will understand what is the Warhammer 40k world. 
Verdict: D-, the game needs a huge repolishing.",1702653072,1702803768,True,3,0,0.522717297077178955,1,True,False,False

First off, this game absolutely nails 40k.  The devs know, and obviously love 40k.  It's the reason I love this game.  I want to see it all.

Really, the only downside of the game is it's absolutely arcane mechanics.  I'm no stranger to in depth mechanics, but this is just absurd.  Unnecessarily complicated system of buffing, debuffing, marking a bunch of areas, searching through reams of talents (Do you like algebra?  Because you'll be doing A LOT of simple algebra on level ups), abilities and talents that are very circumstantial, so much minutia, and half the time, you'll be doing it all again the next turn because everything only lasts that long.  More often than not you'll have no idea why one character give you BIG huge numbers, and the other slaps with a noodle.  In most games I play one step done from its hardest setting.  This one got so frustrating I'm playing on EZ mode.

And, yes, I still love it.  Because Commisar hat.  The flavor of the game is that good.  If you don't know what 40k is, I both envy you, and fear for you.

Edit 17 Dec 23: there's a lot of complaining (bugs, missing animations, ...) in the reviews.

Let me start by highlighting that 215 hours in, all I got was an amazing and deeply enjoyable Warhammer experience. So thank you Owlcat for that.

That said, I also had a stellar time with Cyberpunk at release. Either I'm a very lucky person, or it simply boils down to not being a whiny little *female dog*. Of course devs are going to promise the moon, they're making an ad because otherwise no funding and then no game at all. I mean did you really expect that yogurt to fix you sleep schedule ?

Furthermore, Owlcat track record is known enough at this point that everyone knew exactly what they were signing up for ... bug-free, outstanding, at release; pick two, you should know the drill.",1702739195,1702797528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It does the lore credit (for the most part), it's one of the few games like this where there is actual reason why everyone around you listens to you and does what you tell them to, and the soundtrack is great.

But the bugs...

Being on the high ground, but being unable to shoot at an enemy on the lower ground because you don't have line of sight; but they have no problem seeing and shooting at you.

Not being able to shoot around an object even though there is nothing but clear space next to it; (Believe it has something to do with there being no walkable cell to step into?). Also not being able to shoot over a full cover chest-high wall.

The animations are janky; cultists charging you, then dropping to their knees next to your character. The cinematics being very stiff and honestly awkward to watch. 

There are some instances of the text not really lining up with what's happening; prompting you with hints and suggestions that someone is lying only to reveal that no, actually they're being honest in spite of not indicating it.

So far I haven't been able to get out of Act 1 because in spite of being on Hard mode, the fights felt well-balanced and fun and challenging, but then you get a Chaos Marine thrown at you with five times the health of 95% of the enemies you have faced up to that point, who can easily wipe out one or two party members in round one of a very open zone swarming with cultists, who can destroy your escape shuttles in about ten rounds to force your loss.

I'd give this game a pass. It really seems like it needs a lot more polish and balancing. (Also please tell me why a Sister of Battle is so squishy and bad at aiming...)

I think the game is mostly enjoyable, and I think the story was good, but there have been multiple bugs that either cause me to reload or just make quest dialogue make no sense. The first two chapters are good story-wise, and perhaps you won't find two many game-breaking bugs so you'll be able to enjoy it.

In chapter 3, however, things that a big turn for the worse, in multiple ways.

This is not just speaking about bugs - they get worse in this chapter, with quest bugs, dialogue about companions who aren't even in my party, constant unnecessary cutscenes, combat just bugging out and forcing me to reload. But no, I'm mostly referring to the left turn the story and gameplay takes. Without spoilers, it utilizes a certain trope in RPG games that are just about one of the most frustrating things to deal with and that I have rarely seen done well. Owlcat also has done it in every one of their past games, but both instances were done much better than here, which is not saying much as it is a complete unnecessary gameplay and story device. Plot wise, it also isn't good, as the events leading into chapter 3 involve a complete character assassination of one our companions, and I honestly can't wrap my head around what the writers were thinking.

Even if you're not a Warhammer 40k lore enthusiast, just interacting with this companion in the way they are presented will leave you beyond baffled and confused about a certain thing they do. There is no world where the writers can possibly find a good reason for what they did, and sure enough, the explanation provided still makes no sense. There are also multiple dialogue options in this chapter where you're just forced to do something, and if you refuse you just die. Granted, you can turn back on the quest givers later, but just being forced to pick an option where you basically give up resisting against these horrible and evil beings feels incredibly lame. Maybe if there was some qualifying dialogue saying that you are lying, or that you're just going to bide your time, these would feel better.

This plot twist alone has turned me off from playing the game. I haven't gotten too far into chapter 3, so maybe there is an improvement on the story, but I also know what awaits ahead on chapters 4 and 5 are another deluge of bugs, some of them game-breaking and can screw up your entire main questline.

So this is what I'll say, if you want a complete and smooth experience, do not buy this now. I have confidence the game will get better, the same way that their Pathfinder games did as they were also buggy messes in the begininng, and maybe they will even touch on some story beats to make them more cohesive, if possible. This, however, may take months to a year, as it did for their other games, so don't hold your breath. Just come here every few weeks and check the reviews again, until you can be sure they have fixed all the major problems.

When the game stops being a buggy mess, I will be changing this review to positive, as despite my misgivings with chapter 3 I think they can be glossed over if you really like the game, though I still hope they might change some of that. Regardless, I will also be stopping my playthrough here until I can confirm I can have a smooth playthrough to the end.",1702795182,1702795282,False,5,0,0.531191051006317139,0,True,False,False

But hot damn this game is awesome.  There's politics, subterfuge, compelling companions.  There are true choices with real consequences that will influence the story.  The combat/ruleset can be hard to learn but is very rewarding when you make well built characters.

Utilizes the Rogue Trader lore aspect to its max to still deliver a ""grimdark"" universe, faithful  to WH40k, but not so oppressive that it becomes an intellectual deadweight (a problem that plagues much of WH40k). (Most of ) The characters are interesting, relatable and their backstories engaging and believable. Someone spent more than the usual two minutes and two brain cells writing.

Then there is the game play. More systems than you can shake a stick at (and the game does a reasonable job at introducing them slowly to you) and, somehow, they work. Even when they shouldn't really! Of course the core system is the combat and the character progression. I found the combat a bit... different and somehow hard to wrap my head around. Even now I am pretty sure I am not optimized for it and the pacing, where everyone seems to handbag eachother until the various subsystems reach critical mass and people (or xenos, or demons, or...) suddenly start exploding, takes some getting used to. But take a step back and you realise that the difficulty actually works. There have been many battles that needed several playthroughs for me  and all needed to be approached thoughtfully but it has never been... unfun or tedious. The character builds can be equally bewildering with the different ""archetypes"" (essentially classes) and the myriad of options and their internal synergies. You can go crazy worrying about min-maxing and the system takes a lot to master. However, you can also build characters that ""make intuitive sense"" and they will also work well enough. There is some forethought needed to create sufficient coverage across skills but, well, that is not an unreasonable standard for an RPG.

In technical terms, I have had a few bugs, some CTDs but all has been a lot better since the last patch. Would I have preferred a more technically polished product? Sure. Has it really detracted from my experience? Absolutely not.

In a time when most gaming products are simply awful (even when they are supposed to be AAA). efforts like Rogue Trader are a breath of fresh air. Punches well above its weight and I sincerely hope it will become a platform that will be used for many Warhammer 40k stories going forward.

It honestly amazes me how many people you get the option of executing on the spot for one reason or another. Voice acting is reserved only for important moments, but in its place is text written in the typical rich, gothic description that 40k is known for. 

Combat is interesting and varied with a great amount of options to build with, almost to the point of a detriment as a good chunk of time is spent choosing what skill to get across your entire party. 

It has all the makings of a great game, but honestly I can't recommend anyone play it in it's current form as it is rife with gamebreaking bugs and some annoying gameplay. 

Quests fail to update. Skills won't work. Story progression queues are missed or in the wrong place, with important NPCs simply not existing in some saves compared to others. Dialogue randomly won't occur and you are left wondering what is going on. Sound bugs. Chapter 1 is almost flawless, but the cracks readily form as you go further and further into the game. 

Both enemy and allied AI will end up killing you or one another with friendly fire. It is to the point that I consider friendly NPCs to be an environmental hazard as they casually line up a full laz-barrage straight through your party in order to hit one enemy on the other side.

The Ship Combat mini-game kind of forces you to save-scum, as until you enter a combat zone you have no idea of what enemies you are up against. Until you have certain skills the first minute of combat is you watching your ship get blasted by every enemy as they all go first and are already in range of your ship. This is a detriment when you are often outgunned or out-geared, as you have no chance of pulling any sort of tactics. Additionally in some scenarios enemy ships can warp into combat with no warning and immediately get a free turn to blast you some more. Compounding it all is you need to fight in ship-to-ship to get ship experience to counter all this nonsense in the first place. It eventually becomes more enjoyable, but the start is rough and rather unfun. 

From what I understand Owlcat is known for patching over time. When these issues are smoothed out and bugs taken care of I will update my review, but as it stands it is saddening that enjoyment is hampered by a lot of issues.

I was immediately impressed when I booted the game up for the first time because as soon as I started it a window popped up WHERE THEY ASKED FOR MY CONSENT TO COLLECT MY DATA!!! 99% of games bury that in the terms of service and make you agree to play the game so they can sell your data. These guys ask for it and you're free to say no!!!

The combat will be fairly easy to learn for those who have played tactical squad shooters before but it is not easy to master there is an immense amount of depth and I spend five minutes on level ups every time because the game gives you a lot of build freedom and a lot of perks and abilities to choose from so you can make you're own custom build to suite your personal tastes.

The models and weapons character pawns and maps have a massive amount of detail and perfectly capture the aesthetic of 40k and no two maps are the same. The writing is incredible and you get emotionally invested in your followers they make you laugh and smile but they can also make you angry and frustrated at times but sometimes you become so protective of some of them you'll go out of your way to prioritize killing enemies that piss you off by attacking them.

There is an immense amount of respect for the lore and world of 40k it's obvious as soon as you beat the prologue these are fans of 40k just like you. The writing is incredible and even though only some of it is voice acted you don't even care in fact it's one of it's strength. The writing and imagery created by the words they choose enthrall you and pull you in with their flow and detailed description and making the player read them for themselves makes them take the words to heart and the power you have oh the power!

You will make decisions that decide the fate of billions you will get betrayed by some and others will die for you before they fail you. There is a constant air of intrigue and mystery and I've lost track of how many times I found the answer to one question only to walk away with several more. You always feel like a betrayal is around the corner and even when you do the right thing and show mercy there is a voice in the back of your head afraid you let a traitor or heretic escape or even join your ranks in some cases.

Unless of course you want to become a heretic and do the bidding of dark gods cause guess what? You can do that! You can be a saint or a sinner and there's so many deep mechanics. Sometimes if you have the right companion they can give you warning of an ambush or point out a detail that makes things click when you were once unsure and if you didn't bring them them because you took someone else instead you don't have that advantage. The companions don't just matter in combat depending on who you bring the story changes and you get unique dialogue options!

PLEASE BUY THIS GAME! I bought it full price and after 25 hours I know for a fact I'd have easily pay another ten dollars for it and I 100% want to buy all the dlc. The company shows care and respect to their customers and the games story and looks and just almost everything about it draws you in my sleep schedule is totally F***** because of this game. Baulders gate is next on the list and I've heard great things and let me tell you this game sets a high bar
I haven't had a single bug my whole playthrough 25 hours in at time of writing.

Remember as a consumer the only real vote you have is the vote of your wallet. If you care about quality games that are well designed and well written then you want to buy this because profit margins speak louder to companies than a rant on the internet. This game is a good example to the game companies that if they want happy players care, love and respect for your customers is were the long term profits are.

Bethesda can churn out crap all they like but their reputation gets worse every day because of it and sooner or later they're gonna loose the last of their fans. The role play potential in this game IS WHAT STARFIELD SHOULD HAVE BEEN! I haven't felt this much player empowerment, consequence and freedom in an RPG since fallout new Vegas a game that people who have played it hold as a holy relic of gaming and it's potential.

The game itself is standard Owlcat: lot's of choices, interesting companions, and in-depth character building.

Besides, there's a respec system in place, that is fairly generous at the start at least.

The combat is solid, however not as interesting so far. Most fights have felt samey. The bosses have been okay, but nothing too spectacular. This might be because I'm playing on normal difficulty.

It plays a lot like Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous when it was released, e.g. very buggy but fun and has a lot of potential.

The writing in this game is fantastic though, and is a cut above the Pathfinder gamers.

The atmosphere of 40K is captured exquisitely here, and there are lots of moral choices to make around the best thing to do when half your crew goes mad, etc - lots of difficult choices that reflect on you as an individual and adjust your alignments in the game.

It is easily my favourite Owlcat game so far, and I particularly liked the two previous Pathfinder games.

Yes, it is buggy and yes it needs further patching, but I have already got a lot of fun from it.  At the moment I'd still rather play this game than Baldur's Gate 3.

I hope that they put the same amount of commitment and dev effort into patching it as they did to Wrath of the Righteous.

Playthru #1 ended upon reaching act 5, where the big reveal cut-scene triggered a permanently black screen, ending the run until the patch the following week.

Playthru #2, I didn't even make it that far, because every time I return to my ship, it repeats the same cut-scene over and over from finishing Act 3, so when you attempt to ""Call a war council"" which is one of the main story quests in Act 4, the council doesn't convene and this cut-scene happens in its place. That's 2 playthrus back to back taking wildly different choices that could not continue due to game ending bugs. And that hasn't even touched on the multiple bugs experienced in other aspects of the game.

Officers getting into infinite turn loops, which is hilarious, but then there are fights where the round has to ""end"" for the fight to continue and the only way to end the round is murder your own officers to get rid of their infinite turn bug.

Animation glitches, which never bothered me too much on a new game launch, but in this game your character can get stuck in a ""ima sittin on mah throne"" animation while on your ship, and it makes your navigation next to impossible.

And then there's the combat. So many directions and choices you could make, but then you find out none of it matters because any build, any strategy compared to 5 support characters buffing Argenta and turning her into a 100+ attacks per round sniper machine gun is completely pointless.

Played in co-op with a friend, had our save get bricked multiple times and had to reload 2-5 hours back.
At some point we got a new party member and decided to not use the character as it came with the same build as our Rogue Trader.. played ~3hrs and reached a point at which said removed party member was supposed to trigger a conversation which is necessary to progress the story line and got locked that way, had to reload a save that was waaay before that even, as the game's auto saving is random, sometimes it saves when landing on a new planet, sometimes not.
Sometimes saving the game by overwriting a previous save doesn't really overwrite it, it just puts a different preview picture and playtime!

- They've nailed the Warhammer 40k lore and atmosphere,
- The companion characters are good,
- The story is engaging,
- The character builds are very in-depth and the gameplay/combat is fun (when it works). 

Now, having listed all the positives I must unfortunately say that all of the positives are ruined by a myriad of technical issues plaguing the game. I've played early access titles that are more technically polished than this purported full release. I can cut the developers some slack for some bugs here and there at launch, especially if its a smaller studio and not a AAA company. But sadly, Rogue Trader goes above an beyond of what is acceptable even for an indie team: 
- The performance is bad even on a rig way above the stated recommended specs, 
- The game crashes at random all the time,
- The combat turns glitch out,
- Quest completion criteria fail to register,
- Some combat abilities are broken and not working as intended,
and the list goes on and on. 

The devs have promised to fix the game, and, as of writing this review, have already released a patch (1.0.1) with alleged 400+ fixes. I've failed to notice any difference before and after the patch. A software/game release requiring 400 fixes post-launch with even more allegedly underway is crazy when you think about it. The game isn't unplayable, but having to deal with technical issues every 15 minutes and constantly reloading saves to circumvent all sorts of glitches is an extremely frustrating experience, ruining the enjoyment of what otherwise could have been a brilliant cRPG.

I REALLY hope Owlcat Games will be able to fix the all issues and turn the situation around. But in its current state the game is far from being finished and I can't recommend it to anyone.

The game is great. The combat is fun, with tons of build options and lots of strategy. The companions are ALL interesting and fun to bring along (and most are stronger than the Rogue Trader because of their unique origins). The story is cool and interesting to follow along with. Voidship combat is fun once you get the hang of it, albeit not my favorite part of the game for sure. 

The lore and setting is just *chefs kiss* and I say that as someone new to Warhammer lore. The soundtrack is so much fun to listen to, especially the combat tracks, and the graphics, while nothing spectacular in modern game standards, are still great and really capture the grimdark feel of Warhammer.

Lastly, the bugs. There aren't many bugs ive encountered. Mostly stuck character turns, weird animations, or cut scenes having odd camera angles or hanging for a long time. Also, many talents and abilities aren't working correctly thus rendering some cool build ideas non-functional at the moment. This is the biggest downside for me because I dont understand how Owlcat let so many talents slide by broken. But, if you are in the discord, you will know it is on their radar and will likely be fixed in the weeks to come.

The storytelling and voice acting is amazing. Theres no other Warhammer game that hits the spot like this one for me.

Bugs will be fixed over time so if they put you off then just buy the game after a few patches. But if you have doubts about the game play then I would recommend 10/10 this game is really good - coming from 200 hours in Baldurs Gate 3 I can still say that this game hits really well in its core foundations.

As a whole, the general premise and idea of this is great, and the game has a lot of really interesting and neat moments and goes into a lot of unusual 40k stuff that isn't usually brought up a whole lot. If you're really into 40k and have always wondered what that'd be like as a CRPG then yeah, for sure, give it a shot, you'll get a kick out of it. I was really hooked for most of it.
I sort of recommend it, and I sort of don't. If anything you should at least play it if it goes on sale.

The catch is that Rogue Trader also suffers from the infamous 40k game curse, meaning that it's actually not very good beyond surface level.

I'd write a whole thing, but I genuinely don't have the energy to think about this anymore.
The sweet short gist of it is that the first half of the game is fairly polished and strong, and that it massively drops in quality and narrative at roughly the halfway point. It is full of insane bugs, broken quests, broken interactions, unfinished content and has some of the most questionable and archaic gameplay design I've seen in a game released post 2010's.

Nothing was balanced or thought out, the combat is unbelievably easy because you are given such obscenely strong skills and gear that the game can't compete (and boy does it TRY to compete, some of the encounters would be ludicrous otherwise).
It's full of systems that don't make sense, or are completely pointless, companions that don't react to what you do or what's going on, an alignment system that feels like a mistake or an afterthought and so much other junk that should have had more care and thought put into it.

The game is also insanely ugly, which is surreal, because it makes high end systems cook.
A lot of love and care went into the environments, which is great, but not so much in the actual characters in said environments. The animations and models are genuinely horrible to look at, I don't get why they didn't spend more time on these.

It's super unfortunate that they didn't just let this game cook for longer because besides (slow) bug fixes, they are obviously not going to go back and overhaul and flesh out entire systems or rewrite the second half of the game.

Putting them both together for the glory of the Emperor? Divine service to the Golden Throne.

That aside, this lives up to what one would expect from Owlcat if one has played either of the Pathfinder games they made: deep lore, great atmosphere, interesting characters, engaging story, wonderful writing, and immersion into the setting dripping from the UI (with things like scrolls, books, candles, servo skulls, etc).

I've experienced some bugs ranging from annoying to inconvenient, but the first patch addressed many of them. I played the Owlcat Pathfinder games a little while after launch and never had issues, so I expect they will purge the bugs sooner rather than later.

Also, regarding this versus Pathfinder: Compared to the kingdom management in Kingmaker (which I liked) and the crusade management in Wrath of the Righteous (which I didn't like), the planetary exploration, colony development, and trading systems here feel a lot more seamlessly integrated into the core game and are a lot less obtrusive. You can ignore a lot of it if you want and none of it is very complicated or time consuming. You get some bonuses and gear if you advance these systems, but none of them so far lock the core gameplay and storyline from advancing. They're a nice additional layer to things without feeling like they're in the way or a chore you have to deal with to prevent negative events.

Finally, prepare to do a lot of reading to really follow what's going on and appreciate the full immersion in the setting and story. Again, this is par for the course for Owlcat, and I see this as a feature as it adds a lot to the storytelling and immersion. Also, the UI makes the reading experience pleasant. As a professional book editor, I can say the quality of the writing and editing is superb.

All the characters are fleshed out extremely well, and the choices you get to make with them is also very nice. I love games that make it so your actions actually affect the world, and given how WOTR was, I knew this game would too. I love the fact that after finishing this first play through, I'm gonna be able to go back and try out a whole story path with close to another 100 hours of game play.

I know the graphics may seem outdated given BG3 has been released and it's set so many high bars in this field of gaming, but once you get past the graphics, this game and it's mechanics and story are close to on par with BG3.

As I've already said, there's quite a few bugs in the game, so if that is something that drives you insane in these games, just wait a month or 2 before buying, as they are phenomenal at rolling out huge patches frequently to address big and small bugs in the game. They've already done the first big sweep and it's only been a week or 2 since release. So don't let bugs dissuade you from this phenomenal gaming experience.

Over the past few years, games have been lack luster for the most part and you only get anywhere from 20-30 hours (if you're lucky) to play a $70 game. But this game along with WOTR are worth so much more than the base price given that just a single play through takes close to 100 hours. I'm terrible at describing what's great about games, and can only say as a avid gamer that I give this game my 100% seal of approval. If you also end up liking this game, I ABSOLUTELY recommend getting WOTR next if you like D&D.

Combat is very satisfying, especially once you've got a few skills under your belt to let you make some tactical decisions. The enemy and encounter design makes them both a threat, and a surmountable one with clever tactics - I might be outnumbered 5-1 by mooks, but I also just got the achievement for killing five of them in the same turn, by combining a few skills and going full auto on the crowd. Most classes seem both viable and useful across multiple situations, I've yet to feel that any party member was a one-trick pony because of their class. The injuries/trauma's system is a really interesting way of both making it not too devastating for people to go down in a fight, while punishing constantly losing people in fights over the length of an adventure - Meaning you can make tactical gambles and experiments without screwing yourself over completely. All in all, Fighting feels really good.

The Non-Combat elements of the RPG are also excellent - Plenty of QoL regarding world interaction, loot etc, and plenty of novel mechanics regarding rewards, trade, etc - You're not gonna find yourself killing thugs to scrounge pennies to buy a new gun, and the immersion of being this grand rogue trader holds well as a result. The Dialog is meaty and expansive, with a good variety of skill checks, reputation checks, party member engagement, and accounting for additional exploration and knowledge you may have gathered up to that point. I've yet to feel like I've got some information my character should really be revealing that just isn't available to me. The quests have been fun and interesting so far - While I do feel like I'm playing space janitor for peoples problems, the game does often allow me to tell them to fuck right off because its beneath me. I've never felt that I'm dealing with an idiot stick situation though - Often enough a characters odd decisions or seeming incompetence has explanations, from arrogance to not being all what they appeared.

Overarching narrative is still a bit sparse 10 hours in - I haven't been quite set fully free yet, but thats also in no small part from me playing slow. I take my time, plan things out, read every bit of lore and explore every nook and cranny. At least one of the paths I've been offered hints at a larger connective story, but I feel like a lot of it is going to be about how and why you do the things you do exploring these fringe systems.

Party members have been interesting so far, I find myself actually caring about them and their input into events - they have their own tastes and preferences, and they're expressive about them when its relevant without feeling like they're berating you or judging you for your every action and step.

As for the reports of bugs - For at least these first ten hours, I've had absolutely zero issue beyond the occassional visual bug - Sometimes mooks get confused and just stand half in the ground rather than crouching, but it doesn't affect any of the combat mechanically, just looks funny. I haven't gotten far enough to be able to tell whether the reports of broken quests later in the game are accurate, but I can say at the very least that it doesn't happen early, and doesn't happen inside the refund period.

The writing is stellar. There was never anything I felt was filler. Every quest, every companion, I want to know more about. You get to see a lot of things in the 40k universe and exploring them as a rogue trader is perfect because for once you have the freedom to decide what to do with them. 

Combat is easily my favorite in any cRPG, ever. It's a little different but once you get the hang of the momentum mechanic, it's a blast. What you do actually matters and none of it ever felt like filler. Every encounter not only makes sense and it feels worthwhile. I never had the impression I was fighting ""trash mobs"" as is so often the case. There were a few times where I lost an encounter quite decisively and on the second try I won without taking much damage, not because I rolled better RNG, but because I made better decisions. 

I'm also happy to say that the obligatory owlcat minigame is good this time! Space combat also takes a bit to get used to but it is fun and engaging. While I loved their pathfinder games, the minigames in those were definitely not my favorite. 

Another thing I gotta point out is that this might be the first time a game makes managing loot more convenient. As you loot stuff, you can basically declare that all items of this type (a basic pistol, for example) are ""vendor trash"" from now on and then the game will remember that. No longer do I have to periodically remove all the long swords and chainmail I autolooted from my inventory! About time.

The setting is fantastic, the characters are well written, the story is your tipical Warhammer thing but enjoyable. And that's about it unfortunately. The other 50% of the game, the combat, is really bad.

Classes, talents, abilities... they are all boring. I don't know how much of this is because of the developer itself or because of inherited constrains from the tabletop ruleset it's based on. 20% of abilities and talents are direct damage related, 80% are passives, buffs and debuffs. THis is not necessarily bad in itself but the rest of combat does nothing to make that 80% interesting. Its just a ridiculous amount of passives that you need to read extensively to understand, exacerbated by the lack of variety in class and subclass in your party of 6, which brings a lot of overlaps in the passives that you need to monitor at all times. It is not surprising that the most interesting classes are those unique to the game that you cannot create as a playable character.

99% of engagements are exactly the same, the game trowing at you a huge number of low HP enemies to clear. There are ocasional boss type enemies, some of the unique, that break the monotony but not nearly enough to make it interesting.

Animations and sound design in combat are TERRIBLE. Pair this problem with the fact that 80% of your combat time you are going to be casting passives and you get an idea of how boring this becomes. My Officer is mostly casting buffs and debuffs that consist of him standing up and pointing to an ally or an enemy with no visual animation and no sound cues. Iv'e been doing 40 hours of that so far.

So, all the good things the developer does with the setting, the story and the narrative, the developer destroys with a half cooked combat system and really poor design choices. This woul not be such a big issue if this was the first game of an indie developer, but these guys developed WotR. WotR did a FANTASTIC job in terms of combat mechanics AND combat effects within the constrains of a very limited AA engine. THis is not the case in Rogue Trader.

I am disappointed as the comparison with WotR really compromises Rogue Trader. It is clear the effort put into this game, the passion, and the committment of the devs is really far from what they did with WotR - a shame considering the setting of Rogue Trader is far more interesting and full of potential than anything Pathfinder has to offer.

Which I assume it is, or you wouldn't considering buying the game. It has everything that is both good and bad about Owlcat games, so you know the score.

BUT. 

The game is not finished. There's a million bugs, ranging from minor silly stuff like NPCs walking in place to things that break entire questlines. And the balance is an absolute mess. You have to work REALLY hard to avoid accidentally breaking the game with one of the numerous skills and mechanics that are either bugged in your favour or designed without any kind of consideration for how they can be combined with other things. And since there's a pretty steep price attached to respeccing you are being punished if you want to spec out of one of the many *many* builds that makes the game so easy that you might as well have pressed IDDQD.

Also, they came up with this cool idea of giving all the companions special backgrounds, presumably to set them apart and make them feel unique, but the end result is that if you wanted to make a character of that kind then they are just strictly better than you. Wanted a dual wielding gunslinger? Yea no, all the things needed for that is gated behind a background only available to one of the companions. You wanted a psyker biomancer melee powerhouse? Yup, there's one that does that better than you are allowed to. How about a psyker damage dealer officer? Sorry, can't compete with the companion background that bypasses the warp mechanic completely and has the best AoE damage spell in the game. 

The player character is the unwanted stepchild, denied the tools that could make builds fun and interesting because those special treats are reserved for the companions. It doesn't prevent you from making strong characters at all, there are so many bugged and poorly balanced aspects of the game that it's hard to make anything that doesn't steamroll fights, but it's nonetheless frustrating to again and again be presented with artificial limitations on what builds the player character is allowed to have. At first it seems like there's a wealth of choices, but once you meet the companions you gradually realize that there's at best three or four builds that you are actually allowed to play without being restricted by key skills that are reserved for the companion. It's a baffling choice in an RPG, to take tools away from the player and then sell them back in the shape of a companion that can do all the things the player isn't allowed to. I have no idea how that one ever made it off the whiteboard in the first design meeting.

There's a lot of good things to say about the game. And a lot of bad things. A LOT! The good things will stay good and most of the bad things will probably be fixed over time. If the prior Owlcat games are anything to go by then this will be on par with a full release title in 3-6 months.

Just as they did a convincing video-game replica of the Pathfinder system for Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous, WH40K: Rogue Trader uses a replica - more or less - of the Rogue Trader RPG (may the God-Emperor rest its soul). It's not exactly the same, there's a fair bit of it that appears to be borrowed from the Pathfinder systems, but for you purists it's got WS/BS/S/A/ETC for your stats at least.

As you might expect if you've played Kingmaker or WotR, story begins, drama, action, and booyah, you're in charge. So far I haven't even made it out of the first system and I've fought cultists, rebels, traitorous Navis Nobilite, chaos spawn, recruited a Seneschel, Unsanctioned Psyker, a Navigator, a Techpriest, and a Sister of Battle. 

The maps capture the absurdly grandiose, gothic scale that is the 40K setting, the scripts are tight with Lore (and highlighted lingo will popup a brief explanation when you come across something specific to the universe).

I've pumped quite a few hours into this since I bought it, it is rather enjoyable, but with many setback/flaws that should have been addressed.
tldr; Play it if you are a big fan, wait and buy after they fix issues if not. Beware that you will struggle with loading screen for most of the game. I actually plan my routes around so I dont have to suffer the loading screen, and dread going into my ship for the same reason.
Pro:
-Captures 40k setting well enough, there are a lot of dialogue, and they are written well enough, not to the point where I started to be heavily invested into the story, but just enough for me to say to myself ""ah that's what it is""
-Personally I believe that it's quite friendly to newcomers of the setting, as skill checks reveals the lore and the nice highlight that can be opened by hovering over PoIs are nice. 
-Enjoyable tactical turn based combat, not spectacular and especially creative, but instead a refined classic approach to the genre.
-Companions have personality, and does sometimes clash and interact which is nice.
Con: 
Now I've ignored most of these cons, as I really enjoy the setting and would die to play an rpg in it. 
-Terrible, terrible cutscenes. Animations are poor quality, they usually are pretty empty and soulless, some are either a joke and is quite funny or it's just pure thoughtlessness, for example there is a scene where you have to watch an old dude walk for around 40 seconds just to say a few line, then walk away again, slowly.
-Bugs, many bugs, too many.
-Terrible ship combat, I could not bring myself to spend time on it, as ship encounters are far and few in between, but they are just annoyingly frequent enough, I avoid it as much as I could.
-I've been losing my patience with this, but the loading screens, there are so many loading screen, and they takes a while even on an expensive ssd.

Overall, the game isn't bad. But there are a few things to note:
-Too many loading screens even for the simplest of transitions, they really hinder the fluidity and immersion of the gameplay. 
-Quests lack intuitive pointers and will often feel stuck after lots of trial and error. 
-Occasional lore book minigames that are driven purely by RNG, and will end your game over and over until you ""roll"" well just feel bad and unnecessary.
-Dialogue can be so exhaustive, confusing and subtle that you can miss the one line of opportunity to acquire a new companion or piece of gear, or even accidentally tell someone to leave your retinue.
-Quetza Temer is a loading screen maze, designed by a total masochist.
-Bugged quests in Acts 3 and 4 that will brick your save.

This is a great 40K game. 

But, it is NOT a GOOD GAME at this point in time. (December, 2023)

My main save is stuck on a planet in Act 4. It is a planet where I cannot leave due to some warp magic (fine).
Yet the bug does not allow me to speak to the quest giver for the main quest to progress. I am literally stuck and all my quicksaves/autosaves are on this planet. (google Hunting Grounds quest if you're curious, multiple posters have the same issue)

Let's say load an earlier save? Well, my earlier save is 10 hours past, PLUS there is a chance I get to the same planet and suffer the same issue. (This is a MAIN QUEST. No some side quest that can be skipped!)

This should not be happening in the release of the game! For the haters who hated cyberpunk and bg3. The worst bugs I've had in cyberpunk is cars exploding randomly and the worst bug I've had in BG3 is people catching me as a criminal from far away when looting a body (big whoop).

BUGS THAT BRICK YOUR SAVE AND RUIN YOUR PLAYTHROUGH ARE NOT EXCUSABLE!

Not to mention the forced ship combat which can drag endlessly and weird reputation system (The high level items require upwards of 80,000 reputation when I'm in Act 4 and only have about 30-40K.

With the advent of Baldur's Gate 3, I have found myself with much more love for the CRPG genre than I ever personally thought possible. I was always more of a third person shooter, first person RPG kind of person myself, but as time draws on, I find the real depth in RPGs is found behind the keys of a computer. Rogue Trader is no exception.

The lore presentation and the in game wiki for those who are new to the series might be decried as overwhelming for the casual fan. However, as many of us are aware, Warhammer as a franchise is a love letter to those who do not wish to splash in the shallows, but dive head first into an ocean of content and the ever-lauded grim darkness of the forty first millennium. On this front, the soldiers of the God Emperor deliver with astounding gusto. Each interaction feels like it's torn from the pages of a Black Library book, each description dripping with the gusto and longevity the series is known for. The lack of voice acting may be a turn off, especially to players coming hot off Baldur's Gate, but if you don't mind a bit of reading, and a little theater of the mind here or there, you'll find yourself wholly satisfied with what this game presents and how it's presented.

The graphics are not up to par with BG, and while that may be an immediate deterrent for some, after recently taking a stroll through the plots of Fallout 1 and 2, I found it more than acceptable. Some animations may be a little clunky, especially in combat. Some sprites will look far less attractive than their complimenting models. Cassia is probably the most stand out example I have seen of this yet, as she carries herself like an old crone. Still, with what we know of how the Navigator's power effects their physiology, this is not exactly the most inaccurate.

All that said, this game is still hugely fun and very engaging, as a long time fan. It may not hold that allure for people expecting a Warhammer BG, or those who are completely new to the universe. To this reviewer, it feels quite a bit like walking through a world I have grown to love the brutality and glamour of, and everywhere I go, never running out of reminders that no matter how bad it is out there beyond the screen now, it could always be worse.

My major complaint is about the class system. When you hit the second tier of classes you end up with a lot of overlap between the skills of your characters, and they end up feeling kind of samey as a result. This would probably be less of an issue if the party size was 4, but with 6 characters you will almost always end up using the same skills repeatedly within the same round. 

I don't mind having a big party and lots of skills, but when I play this kind of game I want all of my characters to feel completely distinct from each other, and they just don't.

Or if I somehow end up disappointed by the story, which is the much less likely outcome. 

Outside of that, I must say I'm having a blast. I only really got acquainted with 40k after owlcat announced the game, but after binging several lore videos in preparation, I feel like this setting was even more fun to get into than Pathfinder. And I was already a fan of those games. But honestly, the studio did great by picking such a contrasting franchise as their next release. While the narrative is still as wonderfully constructed and atmospheric as expected from their games, the unique flavor of Warhammer makes for a completely unique experience than any other rpg I've tried. Wether your particular fantasy includes roleplaying as a kind humanitarian in a rotten world, one more cruel cog of the Imperial machine, or a psychopathic heretic with a taste for homicide (not that Imperials aren't known for that too), the game makes sure to reward sticking to either path with the mechanics that accompany each choice. 

Add to that a wonderful and distinct cast of characters (I have recruited all the companions but two, and I'm especially excited to meet the drukhari in act 3, who my Iconoclast character will probably throw all morals for lol), and I could see myself replaying this more than a few times already.",1702700978,1702700978,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's not even getting into the matter of numerous abilities and talents either having inaccurate descriptions or being entirely nonfunctional.

Classic RPG experience: I have little to no experience playing classic rpg games like Pathfinder or Baldur's Gate. Rogue Trader does well with its expansive tooltips to explain abilities, characteristics and statistics. At times it is a mountain of text to get through to better understand some of the mechanics, but Owlcat does a good job putting all the information to reference in game just having to right click to bring up more information without having to reference a wiki or other website for data.

Difficulty:  As a new player to the genre I feel the normal difficulty is going well as I move past chapter 3 of the game. The game offers a story mode all the way up to a “Painful” difficulty. You are capable of changing the difficulty preset at any time, but they also let you change all the little modifiers as well. For example you can change how easy some of the out of combat skill checks are or you can just change combat sliders such as cover bonuses or enemy damage. This genre does serve to specialize characters and not try to make all party members well rounded. Go all in character only being good at one or two things and that will significantly help your team perform better.

Visuals and Audio: The visuals are done very well. I play on a 4k monitor and use a Nvidia 3070. I play on the highest settings and run an average of 50FPS. When not zooming in all the way the details look distinguishable from one another showing nice transitions and edges. The lighting is well done with good light reflections from various surfaces. The dark gothic setting of the universe is well portrayed and not overdone. There are more vibrant worlds that still have that feeling of never ending danger. The voice lines are well done. I do wish there were a lot more voice lines though. Weapons sound authentic to the universe with bolters having a lot of bass and power behind their shots, swords have a nice piercing sound as the cut. The music is well done to fit the setting. It could however be timed better with getting quiet before a fight or when a boss comes out getting some heavier beats. I am comparing it to Darktide, which is probably one of the best soundtracks and timed sound queues for a 40k game I have played.

Combat: Combat is well done with many systems playing into it. The game being based off of 100% chance for success or a dice roll 100 system check, is nice. Coming from playing X-Com, Chaos Gate, and Fire Emblem games it feels similar enough to be comfortable, but not intimidating enough to turn me away from Rogue Trader. Owlcat again did a good job at providing all the information in an easy to reference way. You just have to get through the mountain of text in each of the tooltips. I enjoy the freedom of exploration each world has to offer. I can go and explore and find loot, solve puzzles for better loot, or just get led to a dead end.

Overall: I would recommend this game to anyone new to the genre, but already a 40k fan. I would also recommend this game to any CRPG fan who wants to dip their toes into the 40k universe. I feel Owlcat did a good job at portraying some of the many different factions of the universe such as, a member of the Ecclesiarch and their divine will and devotion to the beliefs of the Imperium, The Space marine feels fitting of how Space Wolves have been described in other Warhammer lore, and the limitless potential that a rogue trader has. Overall Owlcat has done well in the portrayal of Warhammer, for in the grim dark future there is only war.",1702697923,1702697923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the time of writing I have just about finished the second act. The Game is great and I could not have asked for a better studio to make a 40k CRPG its a match made in heaven.

But the game isn´t finished. In about 20h of Playtime I have been Soft Locked at least 3 times. The Amount of jank is impressive and QoL is basically non existent. Companions get stuck on terrain and stay in the instance you´ve just left. Meaning you can´t move from the instance you then find yourself in because your party inst complete.
More than once have i had to kill my officer because one of their abilities prevented anyone else from using their turn and essentially gave them infinite moves.

One other example being, to enter a district of a station from your Hub you go through one loading screen. To go Back you must usually go from the district you´re in to the start district of the location and then back to your Hub.
Other things are for example: You can´t go on certain tiles if your camera is facing the wrong way, or better said not facing a specific angle from the character to the point you wanna go.
Generally terrain barely works, Try casting an AOE on stairs. Abilities what usually have enormous depth now only affect one step. 

Animations break almost every combat. What abilities do and when they are in action is seldomly explained. And often times they dont work? Maybe thats an issue on the user level but if an ability states ""Targets in zone die if they take more than 10 dmg in an Attack"" but the bugger still stands after eating 15, well thats ´frustrating.

That really is the best word for it, Frustrating. The game breaks your immersion very often, objectives are often not explained while other stuff is overexplained.

As in: Why do you have a hand holding tutorial that explains what clicking does, but no even a simple introduction to what skills are necessary for what class while building your character? 

Owlcat have delivered great games with Kingmaker and WotR, I have no doubt they will polish this game to their usual standard given time. And in a way they acknowledge that the game is rushed, the bug report feature is permanent on screen and hotkeyed.

If you want a good first playthough experience wait a month or two until the first update is rolled out.

Also why tf do you force me to use LMB to move and dont offer an alternative WHILE MAINTAINING RMB MOVE IN THE MAP?

Will update review once QoL improves.

EDIT:
The first big patch dropped with some fixes. Some major ones remain broken and I´ve heard the infamous ""Dont play past act I"" a few times now. 
I am currently hard locked in an unskippable sequence because of the ""Seize The Initiative"" Perk. I have infinite moves but cant do anything, I cant attack or interact I cant even end my turn because it just pops me right back to the top of the list.

The combat feels really good visceral, the shots are heavy. You can really die from a volley of lasgun fire on lower levels. I play core difficulty and it feels great.

And surprisingly has one thing in common with Starfield. Meaning your playthrough will look like this:

1. Load screen
2. You in the room. After short dialogue you need to leave the room. You click on the door
3. Loading screen
4. You in the next room. Short fight and after 2 minutes you gathered all loot. Click on the door
5. Loading screen
6. You on the map. You click on the planet. Ship starts moving. Some event on the ship happened
5. Loading screen
6. Short dialogue
7. Loading screen
8. You on the map. Ship is moving toward planet
9. Loading screen

So loading screens are literally everywhere.

Battles mostly boring - with officer + Navigator + Psyonic you can do near 5-6 attacks in the round and literally kill all or at least half of the enemy group without worrying about any skills you learned. I'm playing on the ""Hard"" difficulty, one which is next to recommended for 1 play-through.

And most precious - WH40K lore. It is here, but it is mostly in the form of ENDLESS and BORING dialogues that are leading nowhere. It's like reading wikipidia.

There isn't really a way to know if something is too high level for you, like most RPGs. I've had to lower the difficulty to story mode and they were still extremely difficult. To make it worse, this high difficultly spike was the first exploitable system! Be weary of the hulk! I do think the classes are a bit odd. They are very complicated, but I wouldn't say in an immediately fun way. Just when you get used to a current character's abilities, you get some more so you're constantly feeling a bit overwhelmed.

It is well-crafted story wise and there are a lot of cool decisions that you can choose that is very similar in vein to the Pathfinder series. The characters are great, the story is great, the voice acting is AMAZING, but the biggest downfall for this game is its absolutely massive amount of bugs. Weird animations, both in combat and in other scenes, exits to different areas sometimes not popping up, the inability to see if you have an extractium on a planet or not, and enemies will freeze in combat sometimes causing their turn to take forever to resolve. There is also an issue with your allies getting frozen as well when using a ranged attack from cover that takes even longer for the game to eventually catch up but sometimes the attack doesnt even damage the enemy, it just acts like you attacked and you spent the AP to use the ability to no effect even if it was a guaranteed hit. I do not recommend this game in the current state it is in due to the fact that I made it all the way to Act 4 and after a certain point in Quetza Temer, there was no exit from the jungle area after a particular fight. I had encountered the bug before in a different area and reloading the save fixed that one, but alas, this time was fruitless and no matter how many times I reloaded the save, the button to leave the area would not pop up and if there is supposed to be a cutscene, it did not activate like it was supposed to.

It has a lot of minor issues that compile to one big problem: This game doesn't respect your time. Loading screens require you to press a button to continue. Why? It just makes them take longer. Cutscenes consist mostly of excruciatingly slow characters walking on/off-screen. Why? 

I've never experienced a leveling system that made me dread leveling up. If you want to feel smart for min-maxing stats and damage you might enjoy it, but the game is not going to make it any easier for you. If you don't like to min-max, just play on the easiest difficulty and press random things when leveling up — it will literally save hours of your time. Somebody mentioned how a Skill-Tree would've been much better for this game and I have to agree as most choices can be categorized to Archetype (Class), Background (Home World, Psyker, Navigator, etc), General Stats (Attributes, Skills, Proficiencies). Overall the class system is meh. You have four starting Archetypes but six party members, so overlap is guaranteed. Mainly it makes characters feel less unique.

Similarly the inventory system is undercooked. You have different kinds of gear (Weapons, Body Armor, Helmet, Trinkets, Capes (Back), Gloves, Boots), but they are only categorized in Weapons, Body Armor and Other, which makes filtering through the items an unnecessary pain. It's especially bothersome because some icons for trinkets look like helmets or backpacks. I want to emphasize that this doesn't have to be this way, and that it was a conscious design decision.

Exploring the star systems is enjoyable, even if sometimes you find nothing. You can find interesting places and stories, but I can count those on one hand. If there was more to it, I could recommend the game, but it's just too little. Random warp encounters are interesting, but can become repetitive. The colony system is enjoyable and offers interesting choices, but sadly it eventually bugged out and I couldn't open it anymore. 

Co-op doesn't really exist. Evident by the fact that I was writing this review while playing co-op, or rather watching a friend play the game as I'm typing. Especially during star travel you're only required to be present to press a key for the load screens. Outside of that you pretty much only control characters during combat encounters and you can't have your own custom character without jumping through burning hoops. It does make equipping gear and leveling up easier, because you can split up the labor. That being said, the fact that I'm thinking of the game's RPG mechanics as ""labor"" speaks volumes.

The story (so far) is intriguing and I want to know how it unfolds. There's a lot of dialogue and little of it has voice acting. The companions are the most interesting characters, as most other characters are basically gritty douchebags. For me it became a bit too much, especially when minor characters throw ten paragraphs of Warhammer 40K Technobabble text at you. It just makes me wonder if the same thing couldn't have been said in fewer words. It also has an issue that most RPGs seem to have, which is that dialogue options sound vastly different, but end up having the same results. I did start a new playthrough because I was interested in seeing what the other choices would be like, but was mostly disappointed. For example, being a heretic in front of an Inquisitor had zero repercussions. To be fair the difference between Dogmatic and Heretic actions often comes down to whether you execute people in the name of the Emperor or for the fun of it. 

The combat is a huge bummer. From the get go the animations are way too slow, especially when you are facing the same enemies over and over again. Speeding up the movement made the camera glitch, which was still a price I was willing to pay as it probably saved me 10 hours if not more. The choices in combat come down to choosing between focusing an enemy or dealing AoE damage. Most non-attack abilities are just buffing yourself to do more damage or debuffing the enemies to take more damage, which is especially annoying because you will have to buff/debuff two or three times with every character, every turn. It's not a big problem at the beginning, but it gets tedious as the game goes on. Encounter difficulty is all over the place, mostly because enemies will deal enough damage to one-shot you, but only have a 50% chance to hit you. So get ready to reload fights regularly. Friendly AI is usually a handicap, since they don't care about friendly-fire and love to shoot you in the back. To be fair the combat is fun at the beginning, and mowing down enemies is satisfying, sometimes. 

At the beginning I probably would've recommended this game. There have been genuinely good moments, and I don't think this is a bad game, but as you might infer from this review, the problems the game has compound over time.",1702658335,1702658335,False,7,0,0.542491316795349121,0,True,False,False

As it is sadly common for owlcat games, the game launch is in a very bugged state. I have to admit that its not as bad as WotR was at the start, but the bugs that are there are not minor clipping issues, but gamebreaking in nature, like an enemy getting stuck by running into an unaccecible tile, while becoming invulnurable as a result, forcing you to reload the last save, since you cant dissengage from a combat unless you win the fight, core abilites not working at all etc. 

But also i have to admit (and this is of course a pure me thing)...that i just dont enjoy my time in the 40k universe from a rpg standpoint. Because while the 40k setting is badass to look at from the outside, and quite entertaining when playing pure combat focussed games, like an RTS...it falls flat once you have quieter moments. Everyone beeing cold and an as**ole to everyone; all the choices and outcomes beeing cruel and joyless...is well a joyless and for me quite unfun experience. Rather then dragging me into an interesting universe that keeps me engaged in its world and wounder...in rogue trader im just happy, that as shitty as the real world is...thank god it is at least not as shitty as the 40k universe :D 

So after i had to end the game because of an game breaking bug again, i just had to admit for myself that i didnt enjoy my time beeing in this universe and thus even though its very subjective of course, i have to give the game a negative review since i really really didnt enjoy my time roleplaying in it.",1702000026,1702656949,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is nothing short of unfinished. It may seem great at first, but last two chapters have a score of game-breaking bugs so you can't actually progress and finish the damn thing. Despite how good some aspects might be, this sort of product should not be sold. Shameful. Exploitative. Inexcusable. You can't actually finish the damn thing, which is at least for me even worse, since by then you actually get invested into the whole damn ordeal.





[strike]The first Owlcat game that didn't release broken.

Only two bugs so far in 35 hours. It'll melt your GPU on high settings for some reason, but even if you dump the graphic presets it'll look about the same, so that's fine.

Other than that, the game is good. The setting is good. The whole thing is true to the lore. There's no modern nonsense in it that'll disrupt the experience. There's just a good warhammer 40k game. And there are very few of those out there. If something changes as I keep playing, I'll update the review, but up to chapter 2, I'm enjoying it and find it worth the price. Highly recommended.


Well Never Bloody Mind. The most important class (officer) has his main ability that grants extra turns broken so that it locks you in a never-ending loop of officer pre-turns. There's your game-breaking bug. I suppose you technically -can- play without any officers or without their cornerstone talent, but it really feels like you shouldn't. And yes, this happens EVERY combat.

[b]You know what, no, screw it. Despite the gamebreaking bugs. It's a good damn game. Probably the best 40k game made so far. Yes, better than Dawn of War 1. You can get past most of the bugs with mods and despite it being somewhat broken, I'd still recommend it. [/b][/strike]",1702307966,1702645648,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Bugs:

(edit)
Opened up game and loaded save to continue playing and game had no sound. Apparently all my audio settings were set to 0 by the game. 
(??? how and why is this even a bug)

Camera was locked and wasdqe keys would not move camera. 
(fix this by resetting controls to default. Though be noted that you might need to reload a few times as the first 2 times the default button was grayed out and unclickable)

After scenes in your room, a game breaking bug can occur where you are stuck in your chambers with no way out. (fix this by saving and reloading the save)

Entered combat only for all my characters to be unable to move or take any actions I could only click end turn and watch the enemies move around and attack me.
(keep reloading save until it works again. so please save regularly)

Everything like item prerequisites, skill descriptions and EVEN the dialogue texts are suddenly blank and unreadable. You can only see the icon and even hovering over them gives you a blank box.

There are way too many bugs, both big and small, class balancing is off and many of the systems are needlessly obscure. However, they did nail the atmosphere and the story is great and most of the design ideas have huge potential. Wait for the game to be polished up and fixed, then get it.

EDIT: A small number of the bugs mentioned below have been patched with the first patch, so they are actively fixing the game. With a bit of time it should be fine. (Although given how many bugs there are one has to wonder if a bit more time in beta would not have been a good idea)

Holy **** I hate how much I want to love this game. The atmosphere and story are compelling enough for a fan, and they did such a good job capturing the rogue trader feel that I can't stop myself from playing it. However, the endless bugs and needless complexity are massively frustrating. The result is that I get really into the game for a bit until a bug forces my out of my immersion while I try to either fix it, find a workaround or go through the stages of grief and muster up the strength to ignore the bug.

To name a few of the most aggravating ones: 
In combat: my damage grenades (frag and krak) deal no damage (this will come back later), the extra turns ability from officers occasionally malfunctions into an infinite turn loop, which is obviously easy to abuse but kinda takes the fun out of combat and on my navigator one of the dmg buffs (press the advantage) doesn't go away after attacks (which it should, and for some reason does do on my other character) causing her damage to go to the moon, which is also easy to abuse but actually kind of fun. 

out of combat:
One of the companion quests bugged out locking me out of a companion option completely, doubly aggravating because Jae comes with some money and a reputation buff. Another companion quest didn't complete, locking me out of progression for that story line. Also some of the planetary upgrades for my colonies aren't giving me the associated resources, especially annoying because there are very few ways of getting certain resources and my lack of chemicals has so far locked me out of progressing construction on Janus (one of my colonies)

There are also several annoying issues in the system in general. My main complaint is that the hiring of mercenaries (non voiced, non story line, filler troops for your party) and the respeccing of party members reduce your Profit factor (your wealth indicator). 
I can kind of see it with the mercenaries, the cost is outrageous considering that hiring a single person costs a fairly significant percentage of the total wealth of my interstellar trade empire. But if they where free you could get a bunch and spec them into a single ability to serve as buffs for you ship. You can assign characters to roles on the ship as officers for certain functions like gunnery, a silly system in and of it itself, since skill with firing a rifle should not translate to skill in acquiring a firing solution for a macro cannon, but this is still a video game and its a mostly harmless side function. Mostly I like the addition of this system, except its the only reason I have found for giving mercs a price tag, and its not really a good enough reason for that. 
Still, you don't really need mercenaries, you have party members, so whatever. The cost of respeccing is much more of an issue. 
Partially because of the same reason as mercs, I run a massive interstellar trade empire, how can the cost of a retraining course possibly effect my bottom line? 
Partially because of the bugs, remember the grenades do no damage bug? I only got that later in the game, I wasn't using grenades before hand but I picked up the grenadier talent on my tank cause I thought it would be a nice way to buff his dmg output and get some use out of the mass of grenades I'd picked up. Now one of my talent slots is locked into a useless talent that I have to hurt my save to get rid of. 
But the main issue is that character design is pretty complex, and you can't see all of your future abilities because of how class progression is set up. So you might set up a character in the first 16 levels in a way that you regret once you see the abilities they will acquire in the next 20 now that they've unlocked the next archetype. Additionally ability descriptions aren't always very clear, and misunderstandings can leave you with locked talent slots as well. 
By putting respecs behind a cost the designers punish players for choices that may have been correct when they made them, but turned out bad through no fault of the player and the cost does not serve any real function. There is no way that you can unfairly break the game by respeccing, Sure, it allows you to optimize your character builds, but that's part of the fun of games like these, plus I can optimize them just fine if I spend a few hours looking up optimal builds online, putting a cost on respeccing doesn't stop me, it just makes the process more annoying and prevents me from experimenting and learning game mechanics on my own. 

These are not the only bugs I encountered or the only complaints I had, but I've ranted long enough I think. The point is that there are a lot of relatively easy improvements that will probably be made pretty soon. And if you are a smarter customer than me you will wait for those. Once the game runs smoothly I do highly recommend it especially to fans of 40k, but in general as well. Despite the somewhat abusive relationship I have with the game I do keep coming back to it and when it runs smoothly I enjoy it very much, which says a lot about the things that the developers got right.",1702567885,1702634381,False,5,0,0.539737284183502197,0,True,False,False

- Before December 14th : This game was played in release version (no Day One patch or similar were released)

- December 14th: Patch of bug fixes and hotfix to address missing DLC issue bricking saves were released

Notable bugs:
- Quest Soulles bugged as uncompleted resulting in loss of companion (considering who the compaion is I do not really mind but it should not happen)
- Quest Blood Ties marked as uncompleted as well (luckily I did not lose the companion)
- Combat was still going even with no enemies (and I mean really no enemies) during Heinrix´s quest in Chapter 4

My only reason for not recommending this game is the condition in which the game is from technical standpoint.
From bugs (ranging from minor ones to potentionally gamebreaking) to weird FPS drops/locks or inability to select space in a grid or move cursor out of window. Also there are abilities that do not work as they are supposed to. I also recently got gamebreaking bug in companions quest in Act 4 (combat not ending for me but NPCs acting like combat is over).
I must also note that someone had really bright idea to increase difficulty by putting you into middle of arena and then spawning enemies around you (boss of Act 3 was terrible and it was very annoying even on Story difficulty) or by giving enemies buffs/statuses that are either annoying or sometimes busted (50% on completely negating your attack. That one is great. There are others, thankfully less annoying).

World Building: 10/10

Combat: 9/10

Music: 7/10

Sound design: 7/10

Voice  Acting: 10/10

Grand Strategy Elements: 7/10

Story: 10/10

Reasoning below.

World Building: Honestly a fantastic achievement by the writers.  This is the first time, in my experience, the universe of 40k feels real, rather, lived in.  Characters respond as actual human beings rather than mindless automatons whose only thought is ""for the emperor!"" or ""death to corpse god!""  For example, a sister of battle is how you would expect, but also is compassionate for the poor and children, and for people with a shaken faith.  Often times she can be hypocritical.  It makes her feel real, rather than a cutout of the meme.  Character interpret the emperor as a faith, chaos worshipers justify with actual reasons, characters respond with fear in the face of death rather then mindlessly charging ""FOR THE EMPEROR!""  The mix between cliche 40k and a pragmatic take is very refreshing.

Combat:  Combat is very satisfying, with lots of enemy variety and variety for your party.  Feels very fair so far, but i will admit pathfinder games (the ip owlcat worked on before this) usually start like that as well and then add some silly (annoying/over tuned) enemies in the later acts.  But for now, I never have had a point where I avoided combat.  I actively seek it out.

Music:  Very good, with a few standout tracks.  Much of it is serviceable, nothing to really write home about.

Sound design:  Pretty good, but i think many of the weapons sound kind of weak.  Maybe I am crazy, but I found the bolter to have a somewhat weak sound.  Then again, it does fit the actual power level of the weapon in game.  Overall, sound is fine, nothing unpleasant, but nothing crazy good.

Voice  Acting:  My only complaint is there is not more of it.

Grand Strategy Elements:  Basically, Owlcat rpgs usually have a grand strategy level with a mini game, and Rogue trader is no different.  The planet management is fun, usually having unique events.  The ship combat is ok.  I don't like, don't hate it.  I don't mind when it happens, but I dont really seek it out.  It does well for what is meant to be, and definitely a step up from Owlcat's previous title.

Story: I cant judge this; I'm not even close to done.  I like it.



I want to marry the Sister of Battle.

Is it a perfect representation of  the WH 40k Universe and Lore?No, but its damn close, closer than anything else published so far, like 90% close.

Does it have all factions, archetypes of warriors of aforementioned factions , gear, ships etc? No( because if that was the case you would need a dedicated NASA server to iterate that thing to a game), but for a Rogue Trader themed game it has a LOT..

Is it worth the money? Definetly.

     Long story short, its the best game of WH 40K in its genre category (that even surpasses other WH 40k Lore inspired games of other genres in performance and atmosphere if you ask me) and it has things to give even to ppl that are completly irrelevant with the lore of Warhammer in general.
      A solid, well made RPG, with depth, unique flavor, atmosphere, graphics, voice acting, and so many other things to enjoy. 
      True , i am an old fanboy of WH but also an avid gamer and i wouldnt let my own passion and love for WH form a positive critique if it wasnt worth it. 
     As a footnote, bear in mind that this game released a few months after Baldurs Gate 3 came out and shook the world [Easily the best RPG ever, outshining other amazing games (Starfield comes into mind)] and i firmly believe that Rogue Trader has a crapton of things to offer in comparisson, quality and an amazing gaming experience overall, a game definetly worth being into your Library.

[First negative post] I am hoping to come back and change this review soon as I have played very little but after purchasing the base game I already found a game breaking bug that stops all text prompts from appearing.

Luckily I can send in a bug report but I am going to have to try and reinstall the game. It sucks that this game shipped expecting so many bugs that it came with a ""submit bug"" option that sits on your screen at all times.

Another GW title that would have been amazing if they actually took the time to do the due diligence of QA testing.

- way too hard = I get steam rolled and need to spend way too long before either lowering the difficulty or toy-boxing my way out of it

I am an avid fan of the 40k universe and have always been drawn to the mystique of the Rogue Trader class. It is abundantly clear that the Owl Cat's developers share my affinity for Warhammer 40k. The story, characters, and environment all speak to Owl Cat's attention to the nuance of 40k's grimdark universe. Unfortunately, it fails to capture the visceral combat found in 40k novels and captured previously in Dawn of War 2. Nonetheless, This game is as close as a 40k fan will get to interfacing with the dark future of the 41st millenium as a Rogue Trader.

I do not how broadly this game will appeal beyond 40k fans. If this is your first foray into the 40k universe you are selling yourself short if you do not have the Warhammer 40k wiki open and accessible in your steam overlay. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of lore hidden in obscure corners of the game. Owl Cat took creative license in introducing new aspects to the lore, which is a must for a universe as large as 40k. 

The volume of reading available to the player in this game is extensive. Whether it's a character interaction, journal entry, or new ability you will be constantly beset by tool tips or dialogue boxes. I found the ability selection upon leveling up to be intimidating at first. I did not want a sub-optimal character, however, I also have zero interest in doing any of my own research on formula based abilities. This ultimately proved to be a non-issue, and my role-playing heart prevailed. I narrowed my ability selection criteria to those that sounded in line with how I envisioned my party and was able to remain well ahead of the difficulty curve. I eagerly await perfectly calculated builds from meta-gamers, but in the mean time, I will have no trouble progressing further (with great violence, and through waves of heretics).

I have only encountered one nearly game breaking bug. My camera became fixated on an enemy despite the character turn rotation. After some experimentation I was able to rectify this with a lighting bolt through the aforementioned enemy.  

I can easily recommend this game to any 40k fan. If you are new series I would caution you that your upcoming adventure must also include a trip to 40k wiki and at least a handful of Black Library Novels (anything by Dan Abnett is a guarantee).",1702603873,1702603873,True,0,0,0.498903483152389526,0,True,False,False

Pros:
I personally appreciate the combat and dark theme much more. I often find the themes in Pathfinder games to be childish. I feel more attached to the universe, and our limited companions seem more realistic, though additional companions would be great!

Combat feels faster than in P:WOTR. No longer do you need to spam 4-5 abilities every battle or switch between turn-based and real-time to exploit game mechanics. The space battles are interesting, but the ground battles are a lot better.

The concept of money is entirely different from other games; you don't have money but instead have a profit value that allows you to buy things for free, like a true noble of the galaxy. People will treat you like a noble, and it feels great—even the random NPCs. It's a game where you genuinely feel like a hero.

Focusing on turn-based was the right decision instead of having two separate options. Some people may not like turn-based battles, and that is understandable. If they had focused on real-time only, I wouldn't mind as well; however, I do prefer turn-based more until we get more enhanced AIs. Unfortunately, not much innovation has been made to CRPGs when it comes to autonomous AI battle companions since the days of BG1-2.

Coop is a step in the right direction. It is done in a way that respects the story since there can only be one hero. Your partner can only be a mercenary or a companion, but it would be better to have more customization options like voices for mercenaries or additional companions added in the future to make up for this option.

Cons:
First of all, the most significant change many Pathfinder players will notice is the lack of customization. We can only be humans, and classes are very limited. We don't get the epic scale we had in P:WOTR (the plus side: they are a lot less buggy now and less complex). But there needs to be more distinctions or more companions to make up for the diversity, especially for those who choose Benevolent or Heretic paths. I understand the main character must be human, but let us have Ogryn mercenaries, superior Eldar corsairs to obediently serve as good human pets, or even actual Chaos cultists for Heretic players, even summoning minor Warp entities to assist you during battles.

In terms of AI, the AI in this game is basic and not great. Your allied NPCs will lose health to silly things like walking in fire. In terms of the story, while the story itself is more immersive and fun, the choices and options are inferior to what we had in the Pathfinder series. This is why some people may have issues.

Conclusion:
As a Warhammer CRPG game, this is great. However, for those who wish for Pathfinder 2.0, they may be disappointed with a more railroaded story and a different UI and game design. The soundtrack is excellent, as in the previous games, if not more epic, and there are bugs, although a lot fewer than in the previous games.",1702602376,1702602376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story : Great
Graphics: Meh
Combat : --------
Bugs: Game breaking
DM: Terrible


Pros: Story is awesome. 40k is the best and they bring it to life and give you a very lofty title that lets you make crazy changes to the galaxy. Awesome dialogue and random events. 


Cons:

Combat RNG is TERRIBLE. Enemies can shoot through cover that you cannot. 

Bugs: Changed my rating. Beat an incredibly hard boss scenario by the skin of my teeth, bug caused my loading screen to go black forever. Game didn't and does not AUTOSAVE after bosses and before cut scenes. Guess what? Had to alt f4 and my last save was before that boss. Trash, total trash. Tired of being a game tester, and we need to stop giving credit to games that are released with these bugs, especially when something as industry standard as frequent autosaves could compensate for it.

Will continue playing hoping it gets better, but so far it's been little to no fun. 

Pros:
- Writing seems solid if a bit humdrum and trite. Mind that there's a lot of it, even for a cRPG. 
- The Momentum combat mechanic is an awesome experience the first twenty fights. 
- eeer, that's about it I guess.

Cons:
- Environments are bland, repetitive and boring. It's all enclosed spaces and tight corridors, not a great fit for an isometric party-based RPG. Exploration is cumbersome and unrewarding.
- Levelling up and skills in general are boring. +(x + 1/2y)*z % to some skill or a talent, woah so exciting. And you level up basically every other fight.
- No option to auto-level up your companions or pick a set archetype.
- Not enough classes for a party of six. Roles and kits overlap quite often.
- Itemization is boring. 95% items is a vendor spam. 
- Combat encounters are overdrawn, repetitive and - yet again - boring. With the game being turn-based-only they should have focused on good encounter design. Less is more etc. Instead it's just trash fight after trash fight, all in slow-mo, all painfully samey. No memorable encounters so far. It's also surprisngly easy (for an Owlcat game). 
- The novel Momentum mechanic (along with all its combos and synergies) gets super samey super fast. Survive the first two rounds and kill as many weaklings as possible, thus building up momentum. Then obliterate the battlefield in a single turn. 
- Game mechanics in general do not seem to be working as intended. Enemy AI just keeps killing its own units. Line of sight is confusing. Some skills are clearly OP. 
- The plot does not seem interesting, maybe it will pick up later on but so far it's rather run-of-the-mill meh evil cult doing evil things kind of story (~40h into the game).
- Companions are bland, nothing like WOTR. They do not seem nearly as reactive as they were in WOTR too. 
- Voice acting ranges from average (Heinrix, Abelard, Idira) to laughably bad (Cassia, Jae, Pasqual). Another step down from WOTR.
- Animations are embarrassingly bad, a third of your actions do not have any animations of FX at all. Enemies sometimes float in a locked pose, with no animations at all.
- Same goes for in-engine ""cinematics"" - boy does it look like 1999. Hilariously bad. I know it's a cRPG so graphics are not that important, but why create these shoddy cutscenes at all? The book parapgraph thingie with some hand drawn illustration works better for narrating set pieces in these type of games if you're on a budget (WOTR did it as did Pillars of Eternity). 
- Even the OST - something they nailed in both their PF games - is just... there. Nothing spectacular, nothing as memorable or as powerful as 'Mythic Power' from WOTR. 
- Jank & bugs. Some skills are bugged and do not work as written. Some texts disappear. Some in-game settings reset on their own or do not work at all. Some animations are bugged. Loading times and optimization are both abysmal.

Basically, it's a mediocre averageburger. The only good thing about it are the dialogues (not all mind you, some are just plain exposition dumps or some generic drama - and it's pages upon pages on end), but then it's supposed to be a game and not an interactive novel. Right?

All in all the game lands way below Kingmaker, miles below WOTR. A big disappointement, especially with WOTR being imo one of the best cRPG ever created. This just feels like a bootleg Owlcat, I dunno, Team B effort or something.

It's a decently written WH40K novel attached to a painfully average cRPG. Not a bad game mind you, just... average.

And if you liked bg(and you dont play crpgs) i would say avoid it. Bg is i think unicorn in crpgs, they just do something that keeps also people that dont play crpgs entertained, also combat there is very enjoyable.  

Here the combat is very slow, and combat maps are huge so it takes a lot of time to get through them... If it doesnt softlock. The abilities most times dont tell you a full story and you cant for example see on your ultimate what buffs you have taken for it(or it is bugged). Game has super heavy lean on abilities and level ups that you took but it anyways feels bland and boring after a while. since you use 1-2 abilities over again, with 0 diversity.

AI is braindead, once i had a battle with allies and they nearly killed two of my characters and few of their characters (engagement in warehouse, since there the brainded ai shined). AI has no tactics they just do rapid fire or rush you. They dont care if cover or not, flanking etc.

Abilities and level up are very user unfriendly and you always need to list through it to find your abilities. I hated it also in pathfinder that they look the same... Give me a filter offensive, defensive, support, class abilities etc. Its annoying to go through them over and over again, even if you have favorites button.

edit filters are there well not always when it is not bugged, or they just forgot to add them.

Abilities tell you nothing what percentage you will deal, if you have the skill that is prerequisite, and its heavily percentage based so gl counting.Its super hard in combat to tell if passive buffs trigger or not you always need to hover / look at portrait. Its super lazy and needs more information and polish. Some ability buffs dont work so thats also that

You get the random secondary class after 18? is annoying, since i feel like when i have psycher its really weird every single one of them,  you can respec at least. Its good for melee and ranged, but i couldn't see any good class for psycher. i think maybe tactician could be good.

Edit: respec also works from the point you got the character...

Inventory and trading. The inventory has good filters, categories, but holy hell finding a weapon that is better in stats or armor is like pain in the ass, since there is no rarity system.... Again the bonuses are super convoluted if this than that and this than that. Its like doing a min max every single time you want to do something. Rarity would at least help here, tho after a time i recommend always send to cargo button this helps a lot.

I really hate how they did trading, its one off pick item and leave. Its super weird and it shouldnt be in a game since i dont hord in games but this game i have always feeling that i cant use granades because i cant use them since they are limited etc.

edit: after you get colonies you can get unlimited amount of stuff but i still think this system is really poorly designed + cargo is bugged it never sells all stuff that can be sold

Story. Well first 6 hours boring, first 10 hours more exiting but atleast the pacing picks up. Its hard to say if i like the story because everything feels the same. You go somewhere there is a heretic uprising and then there is main heretic. Happend 3 times. Tho i must say that i enjoyed it, because of the setting and that this is a rare crpg in space. Also nearly 0 voiceacting is sometimes a slog. 

all in all im just 20 hrs in but i must say if you dont need to play it right away wait for sale or half a year so they pollish this game. since it needs some love, more tooltips etc to see what is happening(that you sometimes need to calculate it if it is good when leveling up).  

edit: after finishing act 2 the game is just bugridden experience, rushed and not game tested... avaoid until sale... 

Also balance is completly off. i got a battle in arena when i was left with my mele guy that took 0 dmg from boss and boss had 90 percent evasion. Funny part was taht she healed to full when it was her turn every time she got low, so it was softlocked she couldnt kill me and i couldnt kill her. I reloaded and then just boltered her down with arch militant in one turn(since you can do that with 14+ stacks to every boss).

and i can continue with so many bugs that hardlocks the game and you need to reload. Even funner, you can die in a scripted book event and you cant do anything about it it is a skill check O.o. I needed to reload 3 times just to get the positive outcome. since if you fail its insta dead.

edit: after 70 hours on acount and just wanted the story to end since i spent so much hours in it. this game feels like early access, or beta.
There is no way this is full release:

example: lot of items that had one icon have now clear different icon. It is like they ran out of time and rushed the release. there is no way you change so many icons after first week as a bugfix.",1702118148,1702600205,False,21,0,0.573883533477783203,3,True,False,False

The build system is gigantic, it takes a lot of getting used to and pondering because it's quite different from the norm.  Combat is okayish in terms of usage (though I think the maps are sometimes a bit annoying).  But again there seem to be a fair few broken things and things not working.  

Space stuff and combat feels better integrated than the equivalents in the previous games, I think they have learned from their previous efforts.  But I should imagine lots of people will still find it an annoying distraction from the main ""tiny people, lots of options"" style of gameplay.

Common wisdom for Owlcat games is to play them after a year, by which time they're usually quite polished.  I should think they've cut it down to a few months with this one.

This is a great starting off point for both new fans and old fans alike to the series, as this game does a fantastic job of explaining any context that you may not now as you are playing in a non-intrusive way. I have also rarely encountered a game that has as many accessibility options, and you can really tailor the gaming experience to what you want for a given playthrough. I spent a ton of time just in character creation and I'm happy to see the insane level of detail that is given to not only the dialogue options you have available, but the character customization you have access to as well. I would recommend this game to any RPG fan, and would say that it is one of the rare MUST-BUY games for any Warhammer 40k fan. Fantastic music, phenomenal art direction, snappy and fun combat once you get the hang of the interface, delightful sound design, top-tier voice acting, and an intriguing 40k story that captures the Grimdark experience while allowing  the player to have their own adventure. All in all, I would give this game a 9/10. I almost never say a game is perfect, and there are still a few small bugs for the dev's to work through, but it's definitely worth the money, and I'm glad I put in a bit more money to get a better edition of the game. Looking forward to future DLC's but in the meantime I am happy to pace myself and take my time to enjoy the story of the game.

Their only limitation is that they are not fully voice acted, and they aren't even all fully portraited, and that lack of voice and portrait, really detract from the immersion of the story especially given its industry standard these days to have both. I know the cost, and with how much owlcat pulls on these games, it really makes no sense that they didn't fill out these details-- at least adding portraits to major quest characters.

2. The combat system is absolutely a fk'n blast, but you need to really appreciate the 4x ""??%"" chance to hit style of gameplay 

3. choices are all ... choices, but I haven't felt the gravitas of them at all yet. They feel more like diamond paths than trees. I'm not super far into the game though, so maybe I'm mistaken. It just feels like bg3, where no matter what I did I still ended up in the next act without an issue.

So... Would recommend, but might not be for everyone.

Post Script note: REALLY hate fighting enemies 3 screens over where it takes 1-2 turns to just REACH them. I also wish the relationships the MC has with the companions felt deeper. The characters are interesting, but the dialogue tree being the same once you start each new quest, regardless of the previous quest (or at least that's how it is so far), makes it feel like there is no real weight with what you do in regards to companions.

If you liked WOTR or Kingmaker then you might enjoy this.  I say might because its not based on the Pathfinder system, its a weird hybrid of a few 40K RPGs and its not bad, just different.

Be ready for XCOM levels of percentage missing while the AI scrubs nail every shot.

The game has a feeling of being rushed out the door.  Sometimes there is voice acting, most of the time its text reading with no voice, and its very noticeable how it bounces back and forth.  

Bugs are all over the place.  Sometimes combat freezes during the AIs turn and you have to hard quit and restart.  Sometimes LOAD files are corrupted and you can't load your save, very annoying.  T poses all over the place.  Grenades disappearing from your inventory.  Clicking to move results in nothing happening.  I could go on but you get the idea.

This is a very good game marred by virtually no polish.  

My suggestion wait a bit for a few patches then pick it up on sale.

I'll revisit this review later once they iron some things out.

New Patch today:  Still broken and unpolished, worse some of the ""fixes"" have actually broken things that were working.  Not minor things either, like STR not adding to damage for melee.  Some of the states ""fixes"" aren't working either.  They obviously don't have a Q/A team at Owlcat.

Still recommending skip this game for now.  The biggest issue of Saves being corrupted still hasn't been fixed.",1702181352,1702590994,False,9,1,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

Most of this game's positive rating stems from the content drought Warhammer fans suffer through, in terms of video games. I have been hyped for its release since they first announced it, but it really could have used more time in the oven. 

Credit where credit is due, Owlcat did indeed deliver a crpg fans have been clamoring for since forever. So far I'm invested in the story, the sound design is good, the voice acting is great (when present), but in my 20 hours of game time I've encountered my fair share of bugs: flamers shooting backwards, characters moving through walls, enemies shooting me though walls or through full cover etc. And Owlcat's policy of ""pay us full price and help us fix issues"" doesn't really help their reputation either. 

My verdict:
- If you're not a Warhammer fan and just want to get into a classic Owlcat rpg, in the vein of Pathfinder, wait for a sale, or at least a definitive edition, maybe they'll iron out some of the issues. 
- If you are a Warhammer fan: you most likely bought this game on release already.",1702590920,1702590920,False,5,1,0.547565162181854248,0,True,False,False

I have grown so used to Swedish writers in my RPGs so when I saw the white haired, scarred, chaste battle nun I prepared myself to deal with yet another toxic, domineering, chest pounding self insert from the writers but... Owlcats actually made her likable, GASP! If you behave like a good boy or girl of the Imperium she'll be singing your praises and cheering you on. What a happy surprise!

Its not just the Sister of Battle, all the characters are great so far. Our 1st mate is a by the books Navy Officer and the game shows that the writers understand history and military decorum enough to let this character show you he knows what he's talking about. There's a mission involving a revolt and he tries desperately to shield you, the ship captain from having any direct involvement in. If you want to see it up close like I did you quickly realize that he was completely correct and that you the symbol of order and authority shouldn't have put yourself in a position to be openly challenged and ridiculed. 
There's a gorgeous psyker you meet later on that's a stuck up noblewoman and again I was prepared to have to dislike her and have to wither insults the entire game but... she's actually a very likable and at times adorable character! She's just a realistic representation of a Noblewoman and expects you to pay her proper respect - understandable. Such writing that's grounded in history and reality is rare in modern games so I couldn't be happier with what I've seen.

The combat is good, with some visceral effects. Could be better to be honest. I'd like to see animations for chainswords biting into flesh and armor but its still satisfying seeing someone's body start on fire from lasgun fire or having their arm blown off by a bolt gun. 

The actual combat is pretty straight forward XCOM like game with cover and % chances, attacks of opportunity for melee characters and its in a grid pattern. It also has a TON of skills of various level of effectiveness though many are very hard to grasp what they actually do until later.

Now for the cons... the classes and talent system is confusing as hell. I really wish this game had a ""Class builder"" site/software where I could practice where I'd put my points because when you level you're given a choice to pick DOZENS of talents that you really don't understand until you've played for quite awhile.",1702586360,1702586360,True,1,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

10/10 interaction, would threaten to execute a twelve year old gain

For general review though, and light intro spoilers ahead

Gameplay: 9/10
 Bit of jank here and there, but largely incredibly smooth and very intuitive, if youve played a CRPG before, the mechanics will come naturally, attacks feel punchy, environments are reasonably reactive, and mechanics generally feel smooth and fair when functioning as intended

Vibes: 7/10
They have the right idea, and I very much respect the fact this game can run on a sack of potatos, but even with those pluses, this kind of looks like Dragon Age 2, so while the concept is nailed, it flounders slightly in execution, especially when characters critical to the intro lack a portrait and just have a blurred silhouette of code

Acting and Voices: 6/10
 So the acting, when it happens, is pretty good. The actors aren't the greatest in the world but more than make up for it with just how much effort they put in, when the psyker companion melts down in the intro, i stopped for a second to appreciate how hard that actress worked for it, however multiple characters critical to the intro are unvoiced, which is jarring enough i would almost rather there be no voiced dialogue at all

Plot so Far: 7/10
So far the plot is alright, but the intro is very much a Warhammer themed copy of BG3, right down to the asshole in my brain fucking with me, and my interactions with it as a psyker seem ... designed for every class but psyker, my guy really should be both more aware of whats happening and significantly more concerned, perhaps other intros flow a bit better

Stability so Far: 7/10
The game is generally not buggy and during the intro I encountered no mechanical bugs, though there would be the occasional visual bug such as a servitor gliding towards me with no animations, other reviews reference softlocking bugs late game that break progression, among other things, though I am yet to encounter one so it is outside the scope of this review

Companions so Far: 9/10
I love every single one of them so far, they all are fairly well written and generally likeable, perhaps the later companions will change this part of the review but that is also outside the scope right now

Final Review: 7.5/10
If you are an RPG fan, who is a fan of 40k, does not like fantasy, or has already grown tired with BG3, this is worth full price easily, for RPG fans who dont meet those criteria, it is worth it on a small sale, probably 15% or more",1702584975,1702584975,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

After playing it I realized I have wanted something like this for 15 years, in my opinion its the best 40k game of any type since the first two Dawn of Wars. 

This is the first time you really get a sense of what its like to be an imperial citizen. Struggling to survive under the yoke of a tyrannical, uncaring, and inefficient theocratic bureaucracy. Despite this, a short and brutal life in the Emperor's light is preferable to the madness and carnage of Chaos. 
Your position as Rogue Trader is interesting as basically everyone you meet has to bow down to you, by virtue that you are a distant cousin to the old Rogue Trader, highlighting the inequality present in the Imperial system and how the actions of your ancestors thousands of years ago will effect your life and your children's lives. Everyone knows it is unequal however; this system is seen as the chosen system of the Emperor of Man who is a real force, and basically the only thing standing in the way of Humanity's total annihilation at the hands of Chaos and Xenos. 
These deep dives into the inner workings of the Imperium and how humans live is incredibly interesting to fans of the 40k setting. 
I don't read books to get my narratives I play RPGs and this game provides story and setting in spades.

There is some bad. The combat system is a bit clunky. It is based on a tabletop RPG, and while it does work, it gets complicated and fights can drag out too long. Overall it is a fun experience though I just have minor complaints.
This system is primarily focused on buffs, debuffs, and extra turns. Some buffs and debuffs occupy the same space and occasionally it gets confusing on which buff will be the most effective. It also centers around a Heroic action system which requires you to plow through a bunch of chaff to charge up so you can use these Heroic actions to assist against bosses and other strong enemies. This can make combat a slog as quite a few times there is just too much chaff.

Another small bad is the vendor system. You end up with a lot of trash items and most chests are filled with non useful stuff. You are supposed to trade these non useful items and trash weapons and armor to one of a few trade factions, but this system is poorly explained and a simple currency system like there is in basically every other game would work better. 

Also bad is the bugs. Owlcat knew there would be a lot of them. Loading screens even tell you how the report them, and I expect most of the worst ones to be patched. 

Owlcat isn't alone in releasing a buggy game, but it is a sad state of affairs that every game that gets released isn't polished enough until 2-4 weeks after release.

This is a good video game that gives me more than enough of what I was looking for. Not the best CRPG ever made, but its worth every cent of your hard earned money. I just wish combat was a bit more streamlined and a bit easier to understand, I wish it was better graphically, and that the trade system was completely different. Ship combat is cool and you can very much roleplay as the type of character you want to be. 7/10 which is a strong buy in my book.

Excellent lore and attention to detail that is faithful to the Warhammer 40k franchise. Classic CRPG character creation. I had a character in mind since I first heard about the game and was able to create them almost exactly how I imagined. Could use more cosmetic options though. Couldn't find the right hair style. Which is weird considering the portrait I used had almost everything else available.

I am still very early but the combat feels good. It is well paced and you are able to do everything with a controller. Normally I wouldn't play a game like this on controller but since I have the idea of maybe playing on a handheld I figured I would try it out. Navigating the menu does take a little getting used to and the default text size is way too big for monitors. But again would be perfect for the handheld or Television. One of the options before you start the game is to change the text size so you can get that all sorted before diving in.

Part of the reason the UI elements are so big is because of the massive amount of information. Even the tooltips can be scrolled through. With keywords you can highlight and see in a glossary. Honestly even if the gameplay was crap I would keep playing just for the lore alone. It seems perfect for someone just getting into Warhammer 40k for the first time. And a welcome addition to long time fans. One of the rare occasions where we get a high quality 40k game.

At the time of writing this I've spent 50 ish hours on my first run, made it to chapter 3, and lost 30 ish hours due to data corruption from cloud issues with an additional 20 ish hours on my current character. Despite whats I've written, I am in fact enjoying the game, just be sure to increase the amount of autosaves you have and hope for the best.

It's what you would expect from Owlcat Games;

It's super long, f your pretty giant maps, there's some annoying skill checks, there's a moral system that you disagree with at several spots, and before you know it it's 9AM when you last looked at the time a couple of mins ago when it was 6PM but you haven't even beaten chapter 1 yet and should be glad you cleared the tutorial. :P

The ship from the deluxe feels better than the other ship, don't be sacred of a minor pay to win for the space combat because it's horrible. The AI can f'ing run away, which isn't to be confused with retreating, so the battle could last dozens of turns if you cant catch up with them. Luckily it gives up trying to run around turn 35-40 so you can catch up and kill it but that might be because it got stuck on a corner and couldn't fly anymore. 

Continuing with dumb AI, the AI actively kills it's allies which makes the spam of useless mobs worthless even if you weren't cutting through them faster than a hot knife through butter. I know it's for the momentum system but it's always annoying having to deal with fleas when you can slay dragons.

Finally, some of the maps are massive so you are forced to run, slowly, through places instead of being able to go directly to your ship, from a f'ing travel map when moving between districts, and f off. I get the staff spent a lot of time making it look nice, and it does, but the game is already over 150 hours long and I don't need another 40 of that being traveling around because i can't leave some place and go directly to my ship. Please reduce the loading screens we need to sit through Q~Q I'm begging you here. Leaving your palace and going through a massive f'ing plaza just to go to your ship is a good example of needless loading screens. We could do it when leaving the bunker in chapter 1 but no where else do we get that luxury.

Listen, I assure you that we will look into every corner the maps have so you don't need to force us to travel around.

Overall, for games like this and compared to whats come out the last couple years I'd give it 7/10.",1702453901,1702560934,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoy the turn based squad combat. Automatic weapons are a joy after years of fantasy style RPG combat. Ruleset is deep but not too opaque to learn on the fly. Space combat is a ton of fun too but not too overbuilt and confusing on top of the squad combat (which is the main focus of the game).

Dialogue is well written and consistent with the setting. Choices are appropriately balanced between three poles of behavior (Dogmatic [Imperium standard], iconoclastic [humanist-ish], and heretical). Supporting ally characters cover the bases nicely around the player character choices and provide a lot of depth mechanically and atmospherically.

Tactical turn based combat with a loose narrative written around it. Not engrossing or immersive at all. 

But then they got Owlcat to do one for them. And to true Owlcat fashion, the wrote an engaging and immersive story which makes the 40k universe feel massive but tangible all at once which I think is important for how large and complex the 40k universe is. This is the game the Warhammer folks needed to make to get people back interested.

This game definitely does have bugs. Like using some abilities do all the animations and such but don’t make virtually guaranteed hits. Like Cassia’s “breath weapon”. And there’s one early companion quest that is broken which locks it out completely. There are also some fights that feel more like slogs rather than something I’m engaged in. Non-sniper ranged combat gets very underpowered in the mid game I feel and the weapon drops don’t scale well against enemies. This game also really needs a jump or leap mechanic in combat.

I’m sure many of these things will be addressed, but there is a surprising lack of early updates so I’m guesssing they’re planning on doing one big patch in the next few weeks or early next year after the holidays.

Some talents are broken, but it's Owlcat, there are so many different options in their games for building that there's always something broken for a couple weeks. The dystopian element is so spot on, I hope they learn from it here and expand on it in their Pathfinder entries. Getting a smile out of a companion actually feels like an accomplishment, and not in a bad way, just in a ""The world is so F'ed up that it's hard to be happy,"" way. As it should be in 40k.

I love the unique shop system, though I wish there were a few more options filling in the gaps. The illusion of items in a shop that you'll never buy in most games is actually somehow psychologically satisfying, which I didn't realize until now. However, I love the system itself and want more of this in the future. You see what items unlock over time with different vendors, then you sell things to those vendors for rep which unlocks the items. Super useful for planning builds, as you know what you can rely on for a blind run.

The items themselves are great. Just about every item I feel is useful for any team, which is not something you can always say for CRPGs. The variety is pretty nice for weaponry, I had a hard time deciding what my weapons on everyone would be just because I enjoy them all.

I could honestly just go on and on forever, but the game is 100% worth your money if you like CRPGs or Warhammer. I happen to like both, so it's a match made in heaven for one of my favorite devs to make this masterpiece.

Owlcat nailed the Warhammer 40k atmosphere and feel. You can roleplay as a Dogmatic Imperium zealot, a Heretical amoral goon or a naive and hopeful Iconoclast.

6 starting classes with 6 advance classes allow a lot of combinations. I haven't found a combo that hasn't been viable.

Your Main Character will be able to field with a party of 5 additional companions, but the total headcount of recruitable companions is 10 party members, plus 1 secret companion depending on your Morality, so that's 3 extra secret companions, one for each path.

Stellar writing and engrossing game narrative that reacts to your choices.

The game has some bugs, but I have been lucky enough to not have experienced any as of this writing which I clock around 25 hours or so.

- Minor animation and visual bugs 
- Characters can go through their skill animation and spend the required resources like ammo and AP but nothing actually happens. No dodge or deflection popups. Just nothing. 
- Some colony projects have their descriptions swapped with each other. 
- Repeated clanging noise if you move camera too much in your ship's bridge. 
- Having multiple officers can leave you in a infinite chain of turns between them
- Multiple talents don't actually work as written or don't work at all
- in ship combat, the orientation of my ship in the preview hologram sometimes doesn't match its actual orientation when it moves there. 
- Skills greyed out but still usable in combat. 
- Missing conversation triggers that either leave me clueless on how to progress through multiple quests or softlock me out of it . Particularly in Act 4 and onwards.

I suppose I should elaborate. This game was incredibly hyped on my YouTube algorithm. I like WH40k with a mid but expanding interest. Some parts of Rogue Trader feel amazing. Like wow those sumbiches at Owlcat really did it. On the other hand, it feels like something is missing from the soul of this game. 

Like it's on-rails a bit too much with the only deviations being whether you embrace the Imperial doctine, outright heresy, or a rational-thinking andy for a story beat after which everyone sort of ignores where you stand on a galactic moral scale.

Shooting / killing people with Warhammer 40k technology should also maybe feel a bit more satisfying than this. There's .. I think not enough PUNCH to some of these weapons? But I'm also probably just spoiled by Fatshark animating the gore of Darktide.

Underneath it all, there is something very satisfying about playing this game, however, and I want to see all these weird oddities ironed out for when it gets a proper 2.0 update.

Things like being able to preview whatever move you want to make via a hologram, an ingame glossary thats included in dialogue textboxes and skill trees makes understanding game systems way easier and helps experienced and novice 40k enthusiasts follow along the story. 

As a commissar of the Lord Emperor I condemned a planet to exterminatus and executed the lone survivor of an ambushed squad due to my suspicion of heresy being afoot. I truly couldnt ask for a better 40k experience.

One of the fights was mostly because I had no idea what was going on because of the map, all ill say is sewers/pipes. 
The other fight was just annoying because all the boss did was counterattack every attack I made which was a letdown because it was such a cool big boss so I expected more from it. 
But aside from the that, I love the companions, unlike most crpgs where I usually dislike/hate atleast half lol.

PROS:
Engaging story. 
Interesting, well written, well voiced, characters.
They hired writers to write. (not just random devs to type)
Complex, but not overly complicated combat. 
Rich and beautiful scenery to explore. 
Choices that not only matter from a gameplay point of view, but also shapes how you relate to your own character. 
Not woke. 


CONS:
Needs some patches and fixes.
There are some bugs here and there.  (nothing game breaking tho, just a few visual bugs)

this game does A LOT right! I'm normally not a huge fan of tactical turn-based games (and there are a fuckton of bad/bland 40k turn-based games) but the way they constructed combat in this game is fun, can be challenging, and has a lot of depth to it. the writing is good, although it could have used more proofreading as I've come across quite a few spelling/grammatical errors already and I'm barely in act 2.

While Baldurs Gate 3 is the next stage evolution of video games based on ttrpgs, Rogue Trader is a well made swansong to the traditional crpg (ie. bg1/2, icewind dale, tyranny, etc). and while there's nothing inherently wrong or bad about that, it doesnt really do anything incredibly different beyond its setting and inspiration.

one implication of that is that i only played it for an hour, which is true.  another is that Rogue Trader failed to set its hook in that time, from a metaphorical fish that WANTED to get caught.  

i've heard people make excuses for this game without addressing the game at all - all worshipful lore-nostalgia; polishing a relic from which their precious, unchanging fantasy world originated. it's a form of blind reverence that, ironically, the entire setting stands as a warning against.  

in the hour i played i found that the superficial layer of the experience is crudely over-ornamented, unsuccessfully masking a lack of the sort of quality a player might expect in the 2020s. bad voicework. unlifelike character models. they try too hard to make up for it verbally. 
it suffers from overwritten narrative text, which can be tolerable to some as a matter of taste. gave the feeling of a writer whose pay was tied to wordcount instead of clarity.  but it's detrimental when the same charmless, caked-on style of writing is the style for the UI prompts. if any writing needs to be clean, clear and concise, it's there.

As of the end of chapter 1, the game was a lot of fun (with maybe a bit too much combat-focus but that's expected from 40k) with opportunities to tweak your team according to your play-style and good lore tips for the newbies. Perhaps it's somewhat slow on the beginning when you only got 3-4 characters but as CRPGs can already be a little overwhelming to newcomers they make sure you get the basics before giving you new toys to play with.

The first chapter had only a few bugs for me like servitors on the bridge with solid color textures, and only once a game-breaking one where, after an attack of opportunity slowing the camera, kept it slowed down for the next enemy attack and then the camera was stuck there where I couldn't do a thing even when skipping my turn entirely. Luckily after alt-tabbing back and forth it was gone so I didn't need to restart combat. Overall an acceptable experience nonetheless.
Now, just as the second chapter started things got very messy. Some or even all the graphics would eventually glitch out, the game would stutter for a bit or even stop completely, right after the first encounter at Footfall. I replayed the battle three times and every time after combat it would break at some point - right after it while on a dialogue; after looting some goods right in front of me; after exploring the area for a bit and then opening the menu. It's crazy how it took such a drastic turn in terms of game-breaking bugs after the first chapter ended, which is sad since the game was very fun until then.

Cons

Bugs: Especially a most annoying one that happens in combat. Occasionally, characters will freeze mid animation. About 75% of the time they will finally work themselves out of it, but the other 25% usually requires that player to reload their game. Save often.

Graphics: Not horrible at all, but if you're coming from something like BG3 or Divinity, you'll notice it.

Camera: the camera can be a pain at times, especially in the urban worlds. While annoying, I think it was purposefully done to give the impression of how cluttered and packed Imperial worlds can be.
 
Fight difficulty: for the most part, it's pretty straightforward. Every now and again, though, you'll run into something that throws in a new mechanic. This can range from things like a certain enemy able to put out insane damage in two shots to a vox caster spitting out an insanely powerful buff to the enemies. The game won't explain these things for you, so everything is very much a trial-by-error event. Use cover, be aware of your surroundings, and recon by fire as much as possible. 

Lack of customization: this is mostly towards the character appearance/equipment and your voidship. Neither are huge deals, but I'm always fond of games which let you look the way you want, without restricting equipment usage (aka visuals tied to equipped items and not a wardrobe feature). 


Pros

It's 40k.

Lore: right now, this is probably the very best 40k title that lets you experience what actual life in the Imperium is. Granted, you sit at the top of the pyramid, but you'll be the one making the decisions on how your little slice of humanity deals with things. You'll see a large range of issues and individuals from the IP.

Character Builds: probably one of the deepest character trees, I've seen with many avenues to craft a unique style avatar. The amount of abilities, the way the work, and most importantly, how they combo off each other, is something really special. I also love the way they handle buffing classes like the Officer, Master Tactician, and Grand Strategist. One of the few games that can really make you feel like a tactical genius by controlling the field properly.

Tone: this could probably fall under lore or storytelling as well, but the tone is perfect in this game. This is life in 40k. The devs have to be major fans of the IP because that passion comes through in every instance. Which is a rarity these days due to the fact the wider world realized there was money in video gaming.

Space Combat: basically a real simplified version of Battlefleet Gothic. But what I love is that through proper maneuvering and tactics, you can win against things that seem impossible. Controlling distance and angles is vastly important, and once again, when you are flying circles around a battle group that has four times the firepower your ship has and are dropping them through hit-and-run attacks, it feels really good. 

Companions: Nice grouping from across the 40k IP. Additionally, they gave us the ability to create custom characters as well. Most of the in-game companions are really well done, although I feel like the Interrogator from the Inquisition is a little too lenient on the heretical choices the MC may make.  Also, the small amount of voice acting the game does have is well done and fits the tone. 

Wealth and the Economy: The economy and wealth accumulation works a little differently here than most video games. There is no gold, no credits, no coins. Instead, you have 'profit factor'. Which is basically the combined worth of the worlds the RT controls. What that means is that all items require only two things. A high enough profit factor and a good relationship standing with the faction you're purchasing from. I like this mechanic for two reasons. One, it gives the idea that you're ridiculously wealthy, which plays well into the storytelling and RP aspect. Two, you don't have to juggle buying one item or another due to funding. If your profit factor is high enough, you can simply purchase everything at that level and below without 'losing' cash. This means you can experiment with a lot of equipment and not be worried about the loss of revenue. 


Overall, this is a solid game and one I recommend at full price. While there are more than a few bugs, once those get sorted this is a great title with some good replay value.

Been enjoying the game a fair bit, but this one detriment might be enough to sour the whole thing. The rogue trader system is anything but intuitive, just as an easy example; nowhere in game is the difference between ""common"" and otherwise ""uncommon"" talents ever mentioned, yet it's an important bit of knowledge to have while leveling up. And yet the game will penalise you, with an exponentially rising cost no less, simply for not understanding basic fundamentals.
 Not sure what weapons are going to be available/good/come in rare and powerful variants and regretting specialising in the ""wrong"" type. Too bad, gotta pay.
 Not sure which companions even exist/are available/are fun and so end up doubling up or regretting your choices? Tood bad, pay up.
 Miss an exceptionally potent talent/pick a less than exemplary one/miss a fun synergy because the interface is a damn nightmare of scrolling options and so reading and digesting them all requires hours and hours of playtime. Too bad, pay up.
 Pick a talent that is buggy/not implemented properly or otherwise not working? Too bad, pay up.
 Try and specialize a character for something they may not be very good at/another companion could do better? Pay up.
 Enjoy the idea of trying out weird builds just to see what happens? Too bad, go away. You and your kind, you....creatives...are not welcome here.
 There is no compelling reason why respeccs should cost anything at all. It doesn't make you agonize over your choices, live with decisions or get more attatched to your characters. It makes people restart, get annoyed and frustrated or maybe stop playing altogether. This is a massive, dozens upon dozens of hours long, crpg built on an obtuse, lesser-known system. There is little to no chance first-timers aren't going to make mistakes, so maybe it's not a great idea to then add an arbitrary cost to respeccing.",1702492178,1702492178,False,4,1,0.499016433954238892,0,True,False,False

But this game is also player unfriendly, unless you have already played the Rogue Trader system before. The character creation provides you with far too many options which aren't clear what they do, and this leads to characters which don't feel memorable. Even with the recommended choices, the choices are odd because the developers decided to lock out feats you already have instead of removing it as a choice, meaning you can have two or three recommendations locked. Early combat usually boils down to single shot weapon attacks, rapid fire attacks, or melee strikes. The combat outside of the tutorial is slow because you are outnumbered 2 or 3 to one, with you navigating terrain which rarely provides enough cover. The sheer number of combatants means combat encounters continue after its fun, and the lack of a run option as well as large maps means you are spending turns hunting down each enemy.

I very much like the adherence to its source material when it comes to the Character/entities/monsters stats.
Yes, using ""wounds"" instead of ""hp"" might seem weird, but in my opinion this just sets it apart from the general rpg slosh stereotypes.

I would wish skills/abilities/talents to actually tell me what sort of bonus dmg or whatever they grant my pcs instead of ""grants 2x(AGI bonus/3+1*Psyker level) dmg to attacks"" or whatnot, but hey, it still works. *shrug*

I dunno if it just was BG 3 act III or something else, but I actually prefer my CRPS to not be fully voiced.
Yes, if everything voiced, the game feels more immersive...but that immersion has a hidden cost of me, the player, not being able to watch another dreadfull show on netflix on my 2nd monitor or whatnot. It requires a way clearer and more dedicated mindset to enjoy, than the not fully voiced (Even though some characters are, at times) roguetrader.

I really like the Xcom style combat system where everything is set as sqaures to move through.
It does make the maps seem artificial, as a huge amount of terrain is versy blocky or has obvious unvisible barries around their rounded corners, but imho that's fine, as most maps ARE man(xeno-)made anyway, so it defnietly fits when visiting imperial cities or whatnot.

If you are familiar with Owlcat Games and their previous Pathfinder titles, then this style of CRPG should be familiar to you.

Getting used to the Pathfinder combat system and all the nuances it had took some adjusting, and the same is true here.  The skill check rolls are reversed (meaning you pass if you roll low instead of high) and the HP/Damage system of Temporary Wounds (Shields) vs Total Wounds (Health Points) vs Fresh Wounds (Damage) vs Old Wounds (Damage that requires a skill check to heal) was a little convoluted, but you get the hang of it before too long.  The momentum system is a nice change, giving your characters each a once-per-battle ultimate that can lead to some pretty insane turns.  Speaking of turns, the game is entirely turn-based due to the grid and cover-based combat.  You can't toggle it to ""real-time"" combat like with pathfinder, but turn-based combat fits the combat system here just fine.

There's too many bugs and the whole game has a clunky and janky feel to it, so it can't be recommended at the moment, even if you're a big fan of the genre and setting. Also, the colourblind mode doesn't actually do anything apart from dick about with the colour palette making everything change colour and look unrealistic; it doesn't actually help me see the red combat templates etc...

Been a fan of 40K ever since I bought the original Rogue Trader book way back in 1987 so seeing that there was an RPG being made had me instantly interested. I'm also a big fan of the XCOM games, both the originals and the reboots, so all in all, WH40K:RT ticked all the boxes.  Even after reading the reviews and being aware of the bugs I did that thing that we all do...

...ah, it will be different for me. I'll be fine.

Not experienced any game breaking bugs, but I've only had about 8 hours play. Unfortunately, that's enough to convince me the game isn't finished to release standard. There's loads of small bugs like the combat log suddenly changing from English to Russian, missing audio and animiations, and the whole game feels clunky and stitched together rather than smooth or seamless. Not to mention that even though I have many of the 40K tabletop RPG's, the character progression is confusing and convoluted; you are offered skills and abilities etc... when you level up, but you have no clear idea of how your choices are going to impact your playstyle until you've played more of the game. There are respec opportunities, but of course, it's going to cost you.

Despite me not being a fan of 'wall of text' RPG's because in the last decade or so, we're used to having most RPG's having voice actors, the story and dialogue have kept me interested despite the rough state of the game. It's even influenced the way I wanted to play my character which was surprising.

Ignoring the bugs and janky mechanics/gameplay, there's one HUGE NEGATIVE for me personally, and that's the colourblind mode. I can't see red very well and generally, anything important and dangerous tends to be highlighted in red, such as cones of fire and AoE templates in combat. For me, I just can't see them and the colourblind modes don't actually do anything to help.

The COLOURBLIND MODE IS POORLY EXECUTED. All the colourblind mode does is change the RBG levels FOR THE WHOLE GAME and doesn't actually help me see the cones of fire/templates etc... personally, I'd rather have something like that in blue so I can actually see the shapes 'pop' from the background. I also couldn't tell you if other on screen stuff (especially in combat) is yellow or green, blue or purple, and the colourblind options don't help. All they do is change the RGB values so everything is the wrong colour or washed out in appearance. I know many other games use the same 'colourblind modes', but they seem particularly ineffective in this game.

The UI could be better, namely better ways of sorting talents and appearing less cluttered overall.  

The combat is challening in a more interesting way: more numerous but weaker enemies who each can pump out lots of damage against your party.  They have done away with pre-fight buffing that dragged down the previous Pathfinder games, which is great.  There are fewer, more potent buffs certain characters can apply mid-combat.  The game is exclusively turn-based with an action-point system and all manner of synergies to exploit the action-point economy.  

The character creator, a potent filter for new players in previous games, is almost as intense as the Pathfinder games.  While there aren't dozens of classes/subclasses for you to peruse, the game asks you to grapple with a lot of bonuses for mechanics you really won't understand until you actually play the game.  

My recommendation is throwing together an interesting character and playing the first chapter before deciding on whether you want to redo your build.

I was initially worried about bugs but the game has been really fine for me until now. Maybe is the setting, maybe is the variety of builds and the complexity of the system but I'm finding myself going to Rogue Trader more than Baldur's Gate 3. 

The idea to keep the most complex scenes in a well written literary form is a win for me, since 3D puppets talking to each other with generic animations couldn't convey the right dark and horror vibes of some choices and narrative pivotal sequences.

While fitting in term of narrative, the best part of the game - the space exploration isn't available until act 2. We're effective stranded in a system with half of the ship's crew dead, crucial positions vacated by extreme trauma (both physically and mentally, as per W40K warp travel) and the ship in a sorry state that it's a miracle it could still move. So our first goal was to patch the holes and get the ship to a warp-worthy state again, which all happen within act 1.

I feel that the tutorial of the game covers the prologue, act 1 and the first fourth of act 2, but the game really does a great job in introducing gameplay mechanics and in-game nuances to us in a well-paced manner that doesn't overwhelm us.

That's what I feel about it. And now onto the things I really want to talk about:

Act 2 introduces space exploration where we go from system to system, discovering anomalies, wonders and all sorts of horrors in myriad of tastes. There is a fetish out there for every one of us. I feel like I'm crazy saying this - Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader feels more Star Trek than the recent Star Trek games. It is far more in spirit of how things were in the original TV series when it comes to these episodic and self-contained conflicts to resolve on every planet, derelict ship and more.

I found a drifting wreck of a ship with insane denizens on board and signs of something gone horribly wrong which reminded me of Event Horizon right before I had to resolve a refugee crisis on a planet which led to a colony development effort to make the place better for everyone. These are also very early encounters in act 2 as well, which makes me wonder what else Owlcat has in store for us.

The game does a very, very good job on making things feel epic. The scales of things and how our decisions dictate the fates of entire worlds, they are all very fitting for a W40K game.

Oh, on a side note, the game is probably the most optimized Owlcat game to date. I had the game on for hours upon hours each day and they never slowed to a crawl like in WotR or crashed outright like Kingmaker did. It's a miracle!",1702453268,1702453268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-REALLY good turn-based combat. Feels so good to kill enemies and win fights
-Absolutely IMMENSE universe with so much detail and background everywhere which helps to tell a great story
-Truly ENGAGING dialogue and fun dialogue options
-VAST numbers of possible character builds through the classes, skills, abilities, gear, etc.
-FANTASTIC music
-BEAUTIFUL world

Cons:
-None....jk
-Kind of basic animations on characters and NPCs. You can get away with it in this kind of game because its not an up close and personal 3rd-person or first-person RPG, but its still notable.
-Trading with outposts/traders is confusing and not immediately obvious like it could be
-No bear coitus? WTF?!? lol

This is the first traditional rpg i play and i really enjoy it so far.
It really immerses  you into the world of 40k. 
Really good atmosphere, awesome characters and great writing.
Combat is also very fun and fast paced (for a turn based system).

The only negative i have noticed is some noticeable bugs, including one that has caused me to lose some progress, and some during combat but nothing game breaking.
I would also like it if more characters had portraits when talking to you.

The setting, music, and characters are all so vivid and interesting, especially for someone not already that knowledgeable about the 40K universe. I especially love the way that the ""moral"" and ""ethical"" choices aren't really that rosy at all. Owlcat's CRPG strengths lie primarily in this area, and in it, they're better than ever.

HOWEVER

Owlcat's weakness is in designing fun combat systems. They didn't get it right in KM or WoTR, and they didn't here in RT. The aesthetics of combat are great, bolters sound incredibly meaty, veil piercing is wild and unnerving, but holy hell it's agonizing to play. There are *so* many actions you need to take per turn, and with six characters in your squad, it's a lot you need to do each turn. It drags so freaking much. You also get hit with a level up what feels like every 10 minutes, and just like other titles from Owlcat, it's incredibly complex. Don't even get me started on voidship combat: yikes. You know it's a bad sign when you begin to dread combat encounters and go out of your way to avoid them.

All this would be fine (I mean, WoTR had these issues, and WoTR is one of my favorite CRPGs), but there's no realtime combat option, meaning that there's no option that I know of to practically skip combat encounters by setting the difficulty to Story and A-clicking through enemies (which is what ended up doing in WoTR).

Bit of a fan of WH40k and I absolutely love RPGs of this style but finding it difficult to really get into it.
I really want to like it, I really do, but my interest is fading the further I get into it. The story is lackluster and I simply can't get into it.

Highly prestigious post in the Imperium and I'm running around with rusty bolters and pea-shooters and ragged scrap armor. Not to mention I'm being followed around by a guy that is a war-scarred veteran and he's getting rolled by scavs and rebels.

The story telling is meh and bland, with broken bits of voiced dialogue here and there. One minute you get fully voiced lines, the next you get a wall of text. Or you'll have bits of dialogue from ""main"" characters only to have mute sequences shortly thereafter like they added additional lines and just didn't feel like popping back into the recording studio.

The cover system is laughable since enemies will shoot through it more often than not - the sparse bits of cover they did decide to sprinkle about. You'll also end up getting shot in the back by allied AI blind firing into everything that dares to get in their way. Enemies are also able to shoot through hard cover, which baffles me.

P.S from which point it actually became acceptable to have bug report button permanently on screen? Instead of fixing your issues with a better QA, Owlcat, did you actually decide to go a route of releasing a barely tested game and outsoursing QA to your fans? At least do it like Larian did with an Early Access, this is just unprofessional.

INITIAL REVIEW:
Boy, is this a janky experience. 
For the context, I bought and completed full editions of previous Owlcat games, and WoTR is my Top-5 favorite game of all time. I also played basically everything meaningful from CRPG genre, so I know a bit about what I am talking and I am not just hating on the developer either.

So, first impressions.

Pros:
+ best RPG experience in the WH40K universe by far, nothing comes even close;
+ great immersive visuals, the environment and some of the dialog pays tribute to the universe really really well;
+ overall performance is good for me (but the graphics are nowhere near impressive, so it should be a given).

Cons:
- if the visuals and the atmosphere are immersive, some of the dialog and the plot just outright break any immersion;
- especially the romance. it feels so ""shoehorned"", ""afterthought"" and ""lack of effort"" at once, that I can't even. Like, one minute ago half your family/clan dies, the next minute you have butterflies in the stomach for a person, who you have known for like 10 minutes in-game time combined (in case you thought BG3 rushed things, here it's worse);
- verticality: Owlcat, can't you damn learn from Alushinyrra? Great level visually, terrible when playing it. Feels like a complete chore. And in this game it's the same: damn ladder animations take 5 minutes to get your whole team one level up, look terrible visually and just stretch your game time without adding anything of value;
- in combat there are delays and stutters everywhere, if you try to end turn before completing animation or just click through any actions fast enough. Overall, technically this game didn't have any gamebreaking bugs for me, but it feels very unpolished;
- autosaves: they freeze your game and maybe that's why there are literally nearly none meaningful autosave checkpoints (like you could play an hour without a single autosave);
- text bubbles, that contain actual story bits or companion interactions, have no voiceover or any indication that they are going on, if you are not looking at your characters, and are very easy to miss.

Personal cons:
- lacklaster/rushed story: this might be more of a personal preference thing, but it feels like there is a timeskip between every dialog with your companions, where all of the bonding/interesting stuff happens and your relations progress;
- hate grid based combat system.

Wouldn't say it's hopeless, and I haven't completed the game yet.
But feels like a 6.5/10 so far (that's an okay score, but my expectations were way higher story/character wise, that what it is delivering)

UPDATE:
Nevermind, this is even worse than I thought when I first played. EARLY GAME SPOILERS AHEAD in this paragraph, be warned. So I decided to restart my playthrough and follow the warp path. And this is where I found that this game plot is just a line. Oh, you decided to kill all of the people on the Orsellio station and force her to sign a ""slave"" contract? Doesn't change a thing, Cassia's attitude towards you is exactly the same good or bad (like not a single line of dialog changes). Oh, you landed on a planet with a chaos cult and thought, that maybe instead of just fighting through 20 snooze fights, you could maybe skip some of them as a fellow Warp follower? Too bad, NOTHING CHANGES. 

I am done, this is too depressing. I am putting this game on hold till the better times. I said 6.5/10 before, but now I am leaning more towards a 5/10. If you came from BG3 and wanted to try a good CRPG, this is not it. Go try PoE: Deadfire or Pathfinder WoTR, those at least have a story, not a railroad.",1702039105,1702431987,False,23,1,0.562384724617004395,5,True,False,False

I'll start by saying that I'm not deeply familiar with 40K lore and I'm not as passionate about the Warhammer IP as I know many people are, but despite that, I've still found myself quite captured by the game's setting. One thing that it does very well, is portray interesting characters in an interesting world. But my god, the pacing is a nightmare. Very long and extensive narrative expos with walls and walls of text. Getting through most conversations feels like a slog, and the lack of a good pace between dialogues doesn't really allow the player to appreciate how well-written the scenarios actually are.

The quality of the maps and character models look good for a CRPG, and the designs of both really help to sell the Gothic 40K aesthetic. But the animations feel awkward and choppy, and can (albeit rarely) just break entirely, leaving characters to slide around the floor or up ladders - resulting in some pretty poor immersion, particularly during the game's combat. Which is a damn shame as the combat has lots of great potential, as despite the overall animation issues, the game can sometimes just work, and so far I've still managed to experience the occasional deeply satisfying chainsword decapitation or bolter spraydown.

A big feature that I was very excited for was multiplayer, but that also fell short of the mark. I appreciate that this is Owlcat's first time developing a CRPG with multiplayer capability, but many of the design decisions just don't seem to make much sense. I get that the multiplayer host is playing as [i] the [/i] Rogue Trader, so it makes sense that they would lead the group's decision making in critical dialogues. Except that... they also have control of every other dialogue, even insignificant ones with random no-name NPCs initiated by other party members. Other players don't even get to do their own skill checks! It's not just conversations either, when on board the voidship and travelling between locations in space, all players aside from the host are forced into spectate mode and lose control of their characters. Meaning that nobody else in the session can explore the ship, speak with the ship's crew, or select places to visit on the navigation terminal. Despite being a multiplayer game, other players who join you have little to no agency and are pretty much just passengers. From their perspective, gameplay does not feel interactive at all, and outside of combat, it's frankly quite boring.

Since we're talking about unreasonably slow things, let's talk about space battles, because in space every turn will last minutes. Minutes during which you'll watch ships slowly move, then slowly deploy missiles, then maybe slowly attack if they're in range. Then you'll slowly move, and slowly attack, over a 2d space map. Obviously, the balance is terrible, as you're routinely pit against multiple enemy crafts with the same hp as your ship and decent weapons. 
But the balance being broken is not an issue of space battles only. While being much better balance, ground battles too have issues - true to being an owlcat game, there are random, unexpected spikes of difficulty. Thankfully they're as idiotic as one would expect from the setting, and will routinely shoot their own allies. Sadly the unbalance is so gross that somewhere mid act two the game simply stops being fun.  
Another thing that makes it obvious that this is an owlcat game are the numerous bugs, such as animations freezing (and not letting you complete your turn, forcing you to reload), animations repeating ad-nauseam, animations playing wrong, or even more bizzarre, cryptic occurrences, such as random strings in russian filling the chat log when a party member decides to botch a psy test. Among those bugs there will even be literally game-locking bugs - such as in my case, when bridge events stopped happening. Too bad I needed one to continue the main storyline. 
The only saving grace of the game is the non-indifferent amount of content and the fact that there are no other wh40k rpg (and especially no other rogue trader rpg).

Bugs, jank, bizarre voice actor choices and occasional grade-school calibre grammatical errors in dialogue (i.e. ""then"" being used in place of ""than"") are typically groan-inducing, though much improved on their dreadful Pathfinder counterparts.

Also for your amusement:
- T-posing.
- Reloading causing quests to break (due to the game randomly reloading an incorrect state).
- Enemies running into/through walls and causing combat to remain active.
- The UI leaving a black square overlay after closing it (character screen/journal/whatever).
- Voiceless dialogue cutscenes that cannot be skipped through, leaving you to wait an age before it moves to the next bit, or you skip the entire cutscene.
- Few opportunities to simply return to your ship. Traversing a number of maps to get back to it is *tedious*.

All-in-all, it's up to the usual Owlcat Games standard--if you don't look too closely you might be fooled into thinking you're playing something more than the sum of its parts.

These are nitpicks however, as a whole this game is great, it introduces you to the setting and characters masterfully, even if you have no idea what 40k even is. The writing is on average stellar, characters are interesting and while not believable in our world, in the world or warhammer their behaviour makes twisted sense. The mechanics and gameplay are also entertaining, if slightly outdated, more of the style of CRPGs from the early 2000s, but it does them well and gameplay has a vast range of customisability, giving granular control over what parts of the game are difficult and how difficult they are. 

Owlcat should also be praised for their attention to colourblindness options and other aids to make the game more accessible to a wider audience.

The amount of times I have gotten one-tapped from across the map by a sniper that I didn't know was there is frequent enough for me to have to consult my doctor about my blood pressure.

The real issues with the game are the famed Owlcat balance, it really doesn't matter what game of theirs you play, even on normal difficulty you will be struggling immensely at times. Something I had hoped they would have learned to tweak more after PF:WotR.
The second issue is the massive amount of small to big bugs. The one I've seen most often is when enemies slide into a wall and their turn never ends leading to reloads and the potential for this to happen again.

The bug that made me post this review however is the one that made me stop playing,  I have no clue how this happened and I can't be bothered playing through the fight again.
I was on Footfall station and I had just encountered Ember, I beat him, (what a shitty fight by the way, he killed three of my party before I could put him down) I then saved and quit the game.
Today when I reloaded the game, the save had been changed somehow, I was suddenly confronted by the original fight except I was on the opposite side from where I had started when I beat it before and he just massacred my party in 3 turns again and I just couldn't be bothered to continue playing after that.

How the hell does the game saves get changed between play sessions? What the hell kind of nonsense is that?

I will end on a  positive: The AI is genuinely in the player's favour as the amount of times the enemy NPCs kill their own friends by firing full auto into their back trying to hit one of your party members is a VERY common occurrence.

[b]Skills YOU need to bring:[/b]
- reading
- understanding of game mechanics
- attention span longer than a tiktokers goldfish

If you like the Warhammer 40k universe or you ever wanted to get your toes wet with it, this game is in my opinion the best choice so far. It has deep character creation, that is not as slow paced as some other games, since you level up alot more often and therefor really can specialize and tweak your character. (And no fear about bad choices, you can adjust it later).

Not everything is voice acted but the bits that are, are top notch and really enjoyable. I got the chills from the emotion conveyed by the voice actress at one point... 
The characters are diverse and written well, as far as I can tell for now. I have not yet been super far, but the amount of systems the game offers is amazing. The graphics are stylized and crispy clean, yet still very fitting for the wh40k universe with lots of details. Sound and Soundtracks are well done and a joy to listen to. The UI is extremly well made, very stylish and userfriendly at the same time.

This game encapsulates everything what is Warhammer 40k, and it does an amazing job of introducing the lore in a more natural way. The setting is exactly what it should be, I can't stress enough how well done the setting is and the quests. However, I despise the fact that the UI is never fully explained, constant icons I had to figure out on my own. Every aspect of the UI is lacking details, including your own skills, their effects, the perks you added, etc. You rarely know what one of your skills is going to do outside the initial benefit. And combat was another massive chore. The thing I hate the most about this game is its combat. Sometimes you get into a fight and it's 12 enemies, all health tanks with some that can one-shot you. And you'll have another bunch stuck in another room far off, and they all just come after you. This makes fights sluggish, tedious, and randomly difficult to the point of unfun and frustrating.

If you can deal with the combat it's definitely recommended. I'm loving it and just trying to ignore the combat. The bosses are the worst, they're not even bosses, they're timed events where you're not controlling the situation so much as just powering through and hoping you get good rolls so you don't have to restart. That might sound good, but when you can lose a battle that you've already spent 20-30 minutes in it stops being fun. Which, again, brings me to the fact that some battles last far too long to be fun and enemies being able to tank 5 different sniper shots and not even lose half health is absolutely ridiculous.",1702383582,1702384257,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS
+ cRPG set in the 40k universe 
+ About as difficult as you'd expect from this dev if you've played the Pathfinder games
+ Cool companions
+ Moderately interesting story
+ Worldbuilding and map layout
+ RPG aspects feel like they have weight/meaning during exploration

CONS
- Targeting during combat can be goofy
  * Can be hard or impossible to target an exact area, especially with non-square AoEs
- Character creation is a bit narrow
  * Pick 1 of 6 Homeworlds, pick 1 of 7 Origins, pick 1 of 4 archetypes - different combos don't feel too 
     different, with few exceptions

BIGGEST CON
- AI is dumb as a bag of hammers. Great when it's the enemy, possibly costing you a win if they're on your side. Having ""helpful"" AI who nearly REFUSE to single-fire as opposed to burst-fire *in addition to* not giving a damn if your characters are between them and whatever they're firing at is absolutely mindblowing to see. Paused a fight to add this as an AI ""teammate"" just burst-fired and killed two of my people cause collateral damage isn't a thing in the grim-dark future, I guess.

UPDATE
Really enjoying this game but as others have said, you may want to give it some time so bugs can be fixed. Had a few weird ones like slo-mo kill cam lasting forever but a save/load fixed that.
The one I just got is the smaller solar system map from some random system I went to won't go away. Flew to another solar system, bunch of planets I can't interact with. Went to the warp map, warp traveled to a system further away from the cluster I was at - giant sun blocking a huge section, can't see a sizable section of the larger map. Managed to get to another system, landed on a planet, star map was still there - sun blocking a small-ish portion of the map, can see rings & planets around, even my ship was sticking out of a mountain.

Your party will start to double up on archtypes, a limitation from the number of options available, not a fault of game design. Though if you keep in mind that the leveling up of each of these archtypes can take very different forms, you'll have rich useful characters with out a lot of overlap. 

Glitches do rear their ugly head every now and again. Mostly issues with slow motion animations during combat locking up the whole game. The kind of stuff that I assume and expect to be fixed fairly quick with patches.

If you, like me, disliked the amount of loading screens and clunkiness of crusade management in Wrath of the Righteous, I can say it is much better in Rogue Trader. While you can still have some loading and interruptions while warping and discovering planets, a lot of management can be done in the map with menu screens that dont require loading.

As with the previous owlcat games, initial release contains some bugs but in my 33 hours of play so far, I have not encountered any game breaking bugs and not a single crash. It is mostly pathing and dialogues issues.

This is not Baldur's Gate 3. This is not Mechanicus. This is not Pathfinder. The best way I can describe this game would be to take the action point economy of Mechanicus with the character building of Pathfinder. 

The world building is great even for those who do not know about Warhammer 40k, your character can ask questions to explain things and people, places, and things are mostly high lighted to give you a blurb about what they are. 

On normal difficulty where the player gets bonuses the game is fairly easy. on the next step up where the playing field is even the game can be brutal. We are talking ""The Act 1 boss can kill half your team in a single turn"" brutal. ""That one sniper from across the map? yeah he did 43 damage to your tank, when your tank has 40 health."" brutal. ""The magician casted a basic spell? Yeah they just exploded and summoned a demon with 130 health"" brutal. Which is what the tabletop version of Rogue Trader can be, but in video game form it just pushes for save scumming.

The space ship combat is fine but the problem is that there is combat difficulty progression. You can go from the first combat encounter where you wipe out all the enemy no problem and then an adjacent area you are faced with an enemy that can one shot your ship easily if RNG goes their way.

Some things are new and need to be learned (profit factor), but it's very modern in it's design choices: auto-heal after fights without consumables (only 'injuries' need medkit), consumable for when you fail skill checks (picklocks etc) instead of wasting before hand, etc. The story is good so far and it drips with classic 40k theme. The Rogue Trader fantasy is there, and tons of systems support it (ship combat, setting up colonies, wrap travel, commerce and reputation, contracts, etc.)

It's also priced cheaper than big releases and I don't regret giving them my money.  Like many games these days, this will probably be much better in a year with tons of bugs fixed. But it's here, it's playable and we are lucky to get a WH40k crpg of that caliber.",1702368272,1702368682,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

One is the balance, or should I say, the lack of any.

It first started to dawn on me when I got Cassia in my party and started looking at some of her available traits and powers on level up.

As I developed her it became clear that she was MONSTROUSLY stronger than any other member of my party. It wasn't even close.

Poor Abelard would be lucky with his two-handed sword to hit a Servitor, who I had worked to peel the armor off of (otherwise he'd be hitting them for like... 2) for about 20 damage on a 60% chance to hit.

Meanwhile Cassia is regenerating 12 HP a turn, blasting people with her Eyeball from across the map through their armor (lmao... Armor) for 20+ damage (or more if I choose to ""Press the Advantage"") with a guaranteed hit.

Balanced...

And if you think I'm taking the piss, see for yourself, the game is right there.

My game quickly devolved into the ""Cassia Show"" because many of the more difficult encounters proved virtually insurmountable without her, and virtually trivial with her.

Now there are currently some bugs and ""exploits"" that make an already overpowered Character, quite literally broken.

In my most recent fight Cassia was able to spam a 1 AP cost attack with a Guaranteed chance to hit, at range, doing 110-133 damage through armor, multiple times per turn. CLEARLY something is wrong here.

Normally I don't use this kind of cheap exploit, but for this game I'm making an exception... Why? Because this game will kick you in the balls.

Then it will savagely beat you while you are down and laugh all the while.

Many of the encounters I've had are just PUNISHINGLY unfair. I'm talking like 8 enemies who all have 90% armor clogging the melee lanes while several hard hitting ranged characters bombard your party with area of effect attacks. I play through it and think... ""How the hell would I have won that if I didn't have a broken goddess of death in my party?""

I mean all my other characters are taking potshots with 22-50% chances to hit for like some pissy 2-3 damage and here is Cassia with a guaranteed 100% chance 50 point damage eyeball blast.

It just feels unfair to my other characters to be honest.

I feel like I wandered into a Dragon Ball Z episode and Cassia is Goku... She's the only character that matters, the rest of my party might as well not even EXIST except to feed Cassia's occassional need for a ""Bring it Down"" (which gives her an extra turn) or to throw a ""Finest Hour"" on her (another ability which grants her an extra turn) then just laugh as she eyeball blasts EVERYTHING into dust.

I just wish my other Characters had a chance to shine... My poor girl Argenta is out here with her Bolter doing PISS damage compared to Eyeball Girl.

She's lucky if she can do the same amount of damage on a round fully buffed with the enemy's armor pre-stripped and a full VOLLEY from her Bolt gun where every round hits.

That's the level of setup you have to do for her to get her to compete with Eyeball girl.

And my boy Abelard... Don't even get me started with Abelard.

Abelard, I love you, which is why it breaks my heart that you are the most useless human being ever.

I've done EVERYTHING I CAN to make you worth SOMETHING and you just aren't. You just suck.

But then when you have to live up to the example of the Almighty Goddess of Death Cassia and her Warp-Blessed Eyeball of Destruction what chance did you ever have?

Look... For fucks sake...

Make a Bolter, hit like a goddamn Bolter.

Make a Power Sword, hit like a goddamn Power Sword.

My Plasma Pistol... Is a joke compared to Cassia's EYEBALL.

Give my boys and girls WEAPONS instead of Toys and tone down the Eyeball bullshit.

Unfortunately, it's also very buggy, the graphics are pretty bad, and the game system itself is pretty awful.  The tooltips for abilities never tell you what they actually do in numbers, instead giving you an algebraic formula that you'll have to work out on your own, often relying on other variables that you'll need to calculate.  Half of the abilities are completely useless.  

I'm going to still keep playing it and hope it captures me, but so far it's really not very good, I'd call it a 5 out of 10 at best, in its current state.

It has a lot of reading, a lot of tactical depth with ability points, skills, passives the whole nine yard and all that supported by turn based deep tactical combat. I understand that this may not be everyone's cup of tea, however if you're into that, Rogue Trader will not disappoint you.

This is also a Warhammer 40000 game and as such already set in a universe particularly rich in lore, a fact Owlcat does not shy away from. They remain faithful to it, however it is not required knowledge to move the plot. It will speak to a 40k aficionado, of course, however one can play this game effectively without prior knowledge of the lore. But, If you enjoy this universe and read the related books, I can't see how this game would disappoint you, on the contrary I believe that it would allow you to experience this universe in a more personal and detailed way. You would feel at home, so to speak (although, whether this is a good or bad thing, given the specific universe, is another discussion entirely :P).

I have read reports of players having issues with bugs, however as of the time I write this review I found no particular issue.

 As always, Owlcat releases a game with a *ton* of potential but an equally insane amount of bugs.

In researching these bugs I found threads where people list another 10-15 talents or features of various classes/origins that don't work properly.

Combat seems to be divisive for people but I think it's excellent, far more depth than games like Xcom or Wasteland 2/3 (all great games).

It doesn't quite have the insane character diversity of the Pathfinder games, but that's difficult to achieve in the setting and without a system that has had decades of development behind it already.

As a big fan of 40k, I really enjoy this. Characters are fantastic. Story is great. Worldbuilding and atmosphere, fantastic. Bugs...are everywhere.

20 hours in. Still feeling good and looking forward to many more hours spent in-game.

Potential red flag for some would be the amount of text to read through. I've been spending time reading every little parchment found on the ground to each npc's story. Probably why I'm just now leaving the first zone after 20 hours. 

Rogue Trader game mechanics are new to me. Did take a bit getting used too, but very enjoyable now. Already looking forward to a second playthrough and mixing/matching different styles. 

I stand by the game needing some more polish. An in-game bug reporter tool lends belief that these may be ironed out eventually. Some things I've noted:
- Some tooltips/abilities are in Russian.
- Some cut scenes need another pass... Sometimes mobs will fire through the environment, or npcs will face away from whatever they are supposed to be doing. 
- To-hit chance is sometimes off on the overlay. Granted, this one could just be me. 

QoL things I'd like to see: 
- Displaying crit chance/crit dmg within the character sheets
- Easier accessibility to character sheets both in-combat and mid-level. 
- Better explanations of certain skills and synergies. Multiple times I've had to check the combat tracker to understand how a skill or modifier interacts or applies. I understand there are many variables involved in combat, so making everything clear after reading once may be a challenge.
- Better notation of gradual elevation and it's impact on AoE effects... I've seen weird interactions using both offensive abilities and party buffs around stairs.

Major issues like tooltips, menus, dialog, visiting planets, sound, and camera controls not working after relaunching the game and/or loading a save. It's an absolute mess. It uses Unity, so that's half the problem right there.

Very disappointed. I was really looking forward to this game conceptually, but in its current state it's a rushed money grab if I've ever seen one.

On top of that: incredibly annoying, incredibly tedious gameplay. Ridiculously complicated upgrade system that only tabletop players could even begin to appreciate. Prepare to spend half your life reading tooltips and trying to understand complicated equations because you have to upgrade your character every five minutes and you're presented with 1,000 options, none of which are useful. Gameplay is incredibly unbalanced. You have to fight through hordes of enemies (incredibly tedious, again) that can be dealt with easily enough only to suddenly have your entire squad wiped by one guy with a sledge hammer. Don't even get me started on the first boss fight against a Chaos Space Marine.

Combat is a very different deal from their previous pathfinder games being more analogous to xcom instead. Soundtrack is amazing, they nail the warhammer aesthetic, so far very pleased. 
It also has less bugs than expected for an owlcat base release, Ive so far had a couple of audio glitches and graphical glitches. It also has pretty bad tooltips/mechanical explanations, so if youre not familiar with the system (I was not, having never played the RT TTRPG) youre gonna find yourself faced with a lot of weird equations on tooltips when choosing, and very little information on what consequences that might have in future. 
There is respec, but its a bit limited and eventually costs your profit factor, so that is something to keep in mind.
Not very experienced with space combat yet, so not much I can say in that aspect.
Exploration feels fairly rewarding, the trade system is pretty cool, and the speed of levelling is fun, allowing for a lot of choices fairly often.

It nails every aspect of 40k lore and atmosphere I've seen so far, while giving you a lot of freedom to play how you want. The characters are well written and the extreme attitudes of the setting really show in both the dogmatic and heretical choices you can make, while also allowing you to play the goody two shoes iconoclast and having to navigate flak from both sides. I will probably be doing at least three full playthroughs just to experience all three character styles.

The combat system is engaging and rewarding, and I personally like it far more than the RTwP system of previous Owlcat games. There's nearly endless build combinations you can make, and several of the companion characters have unique skillsets and talents that mean you can build them differently to another character even if they share archetypes.

I am putting the game on the shelf, however, because there are quite a few bugged abilities impacting the builds I want to play. I have provided bug reports on these that I have found, and will be picking the game up again once some bug fixing patches and maybe community patches have come out.

It hurts me, because I want to continue the story, and I could just breeze through the combat on a low difficulty level despite the bugged talents making my builds weaker.

But I want to have the full experience, therefore I will wait.

I see a lot of complaints about how it does not follow some rule set for the RT tabletop but since I've never played, I have no opinion on that. 

First, this is a 39.99 game. Not a $50 game. The animations / graphics are a bit on the cheap side and I think needs a lot of work. A decent number of bugs and soft locks (last enemy runs in place and cannot be targeted sort of thing).

This is a very well written game with meaningful choices, well acted and voiced characters, and enjoyable story.

Like most of the releases from this dev/publisher your tolerance for nuisance and game breaking bugs should dictate when you buy the game.  In 6 months or so there will be a GOTY version that includes all DLC, has decent guides for builds (more on this later), and eliminates the bugs which range from nuisance to showstopping. 

[h1]The good[/h1]
Combat is good and sensible.
Story, writing and acting are all enjoyable
Romances are non-cringy (this is looking at you starfield)
Core game systems are solid
Game is stable and has crashed on me once (but there were clear warning signs)
Setting is fiction adherent
Ship combat is crisp and enjoyable
Can make custom squadmates just after the prologue

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
Alternate ships are locked away behind overpriced deluxe versions
Some chaos/freewill/neutral choices are conceitedly forced
Some equipment has less-sensible alignment requirements (a gun that requires you to be evil)
archetype imbalances (some archetypes are enormously effective, others are immaterial)
Overly contrived trick fights (to be fair, some are enjoyable and others are just not)

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
Several of the archetypes are relatively pointless, compared to the combat contribution of others.
Some of the archetypes are overly complex and rely on turn-wasting buildup without any meaningful output.

[h1]Epilogue[/h1]
As it sits right now, so long as you avoid the stinker archetypes you are golden and the game stacks up pretty well all things considered.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Excellent RPG in the vein of fallout tactics/baldur's gate/etc.  Some design stinkers but the game rates an extra star if you go in knowing not to make an agent, bounty hunter  or grand strategist.

Many of the fights that seem too hard, are really about player strategies and tactics.  My first play through I chose a crime lord officer which seemed good for game and RP purposes but turned out to be awkward.  Officers excel at boosting others.  While I recommend having 2 in your party, I do not recommend playing one.

I hate spoilers, and if you hate spoilers too then be prepared to play 20-30 hours of the game to really learn the game mechanics and then start over and be amazed at how well you do now that you know how to play.



I give this game a solid 3/5 stars, and a recommendation that if you don't love great RPGs just wait for the GOTY,  If you're like me and have poor impulse control then it's a 4/5 and just avoid the character archetypes I listed and have a great time.",1702338557,1702338707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Which for me boils down to items and item acquisition. Since relatively early level, you can specialize in any type of weaponry of your choosing. You like chain melee weapons, here is the ability that you can pick and be more efficient with them. You like power weaponry more, by all means, you have specialization for it. The game leveling up sytems does encourage that. Also, RPG wise, you are a rogue trader, a higher class of citizen within empire, that specialize in trade. Meaning, that almost anything there is to be bought on regular or grey/black market, you can get it through your position. And now comes the killer- you can't really get weapon type you want. There is no trader, that sells average equipment of all types. You will hope, that on your mission with some low life you will get their items and weapons after the fight. Seriously, some random cultist citizen or prisoner have better chance of getting and owning weapon they want than you do.

Let me give you an example. The moment game showed its character creation, I wanted to make melee psyker, that will use force swords. Yes, like Heinrix. You know how many force swords are in the game? Two. One of which you will get by taking it from its owner, companion you recruit in game (sorry Heinrix) and other one you will get relatively late in game and that one cannot compete with other melee weapons. Now, compare that to amount of (for example) navigator only gear. Or techpriest only gear, which despite its exotic type have a lot more items in the game. None of those two backgrounds you can pick up for yourself, yet there is a lot of items to choose from.

Lore-wise, I would understand why some of the more exotic weaponry used by either adeptus astertes or xeno races will be hard to find.

It's very good with the setting and feel of 40k along with great music and sound effects. Game play is good with a slight learning curve.

Cons:
Already have found several bugs as I play though it. Some are just funny like if you equip the navigator with a sniper rifle her chin extends and gives her an under bite some inbreeds would be proud of. But some of the game breaking bugs are rough. Like animations getting stuck in a fight and having to start at your last save.

Overall Would give the game a solid 7/10. Bigest issue is the bugs that should have been fixed before release.",1702326340,1702326340,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is really good, that combat is very well done and feels strategical. I enjoy the character leveling up. And the sheer amount of variety with different weapons and abilities you can use. The dialogue is a lot, but it’s really engaging and I have no issues reading a books worth of dialogue.

The game definitely has bugs that need to be ironed out (stuck in attack animation indefinitely). Until reloading. And also I really wish that I could respect my main character fully (archetype, homeworld) etc. 

All in all, it’s a really solid game, just missing some polish and a few QOL improvements.

So far the tutorial section has been extremely frustrating, I've had to reload to make setpieces work, to get critical popups to appear, to get level transitions to work and to get out of softlocked combat (usually whenever I chained movement and an attack/ability).

The UI is aesthetically nice but laid out like crap. Camera is awkward, floaty and a lot of the environment that should disappear when the camera is in a certain spot just doesn't, or only does in very specific angles.

Difficulty feels far too easy, I know it would be turned down from the tabletop RPG but on normal I don't have to use cover because the enemies hit for like 1-2 health, the psyker the game gives you can do an AOE lightning attack that does ~17 damage (everyone I've seen so far has like ~12 health). There's a cleave attack that doesn't have any negatives versus a regular strike which leaves very little reason to not just use cleave all the time. 

Visually so far the graphics are nice but the animations are awkward and stiff. Cutscenes in general are that way too, but considering the type of game and quality of writing so far this isn't really much of a negative to me.

tl;dr it looks like a passable game but it's undercooked in terms of balance and especially bugfixing. A solid beta for a game which would be nice if it wasn't billed as a full game for full games price.

EDIT: Oh and it's pretty galling to see a season pass and all the other greed slapped onto yet another game that was released incomplete.

Owlcat brings their typical love of their settings to this and creates rich, detailed, worlds that immerse you in your character and their party's reality. From the sounds to the visual styles to the use of character portraits every choice is made carefully to create a cohesive atmosphere.

Each character feels unique and interesting, even characters with overlapping elements have enough differences to be unique, and the same goes for player character choices. It lets you chose quite early on the tone you'll be striking, and makes either one feel interesting and entertaining. Are you an iron fisted servant of the emperor, bringing brutal justice on anyone who steps out of line? Maybe more iconoclast in your views, supporting the people of the Imperium rather than rigid dogma? Or, of course, are you a full on heretic, abandoning traditional paths to gain power at any cost? There's no 'wrong' answer, and you can play a blend of options, the choice is all yours.

The characters all have their own perspectives to bring in, as well, even breaking some stereotypes you may have. The rigid inquisitor is also a psyker, fully understanding even with the emperor's 'blessing' he walks a path most consider inherently tainted. The Sister of Battle may snarl at your more 'unorthodox' companions and shout about the emperor's fury but under that there's a pain that fuels her, and a desire to genuinely protect others from suffering similar fates. Even the most obvious types, your gruff and by the book naval officer veteran right hand man, your spooky chaotic psyker, the aliens you can join with, the lone Space Wolf far from his chapter, all of them have their own stories and perspective to make them more than a stock 'emperor good/bad'.

The game also makes you feel like a proper rogue trader. Money is for common people to worry about, you have 'profit factor' which you increase by selling entire cargo bays full of goods to the right buyer. Anything your team has no use for goes in the right bay to be sold off later, and used for barter. Reputation is your main currency, how well the various power factions know you and trust you matters more than anything when doing business with them and gives tangible incentives to cultivate these relationships as you can see what higher tier prizes await you once you get in closer with them.

All in all this game is great, and I hope it marks a start of further exploring the 40k universe in deeper genres than 'just' hack and slash and boomer shooter games (though don't get me wrong I am looking forward to Space Marine 2, ripping and tearing for the emperor is satisfying as hell).",1702321461,1702321461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a lot to like about this game. The story, exploration, the metagame, ship combat, the writing, the artwork...almost everything is really good and solid work. I really feel that the developers hit all the right ""notes"" that make Warhammer 40k what it is.

Having said all that, the biggest issue that, in my opinion, ruins an otherwise stellar experience is the party-based combat. 

A lot of the encounters are, quite frankly, boring. Some introduce fun challenges, but need to be explained a little better. I was really hoping for something a little...more.

The second problem with this game is probably the most relevant to the wider audience here, and that is the combat system. There are a LOT of mechanics, systems, and rules that are poorly explained and confusing. There are a LOT of calculations that are needlessly complicated and, unless you are familiar with the ruleset, make almost no sense even after 20 hours of gameplay. Every time my character levels up I am completely lost about what to choose for what my goal for that particular character is. 

While it's nice that such a system introduces a lot of different ways to interact with a combat encounter, I would argue that either owlcat didn't have the capacity to properly explain things in an easily digestable way, or it is just too complex. To really understand a lot of how the game works, how the calculations play out, and how it affects each target be it enemy or ally, you practically have to pull out a calculator and start crunching numbers. That's fine if that is what you enjoy doing, but for those of us who sit down to just enjoy a good story and challenging encounters after a long day at work (and are most likely mentally exhausted by that point), this isn't good.

So to sum it up:

Representation of WH40k setting: good
Story: good
Artwork: good
Ship Combat: good
Music: good
The ""Meta"" game: good
Squad-based combat: Crunchy, complex, confusing and mediocre.

As a side note, there's still quite a few bugs, a few of which are potentially game-stopping. If you're on the fence, I'd say, at the very least, wait until a few patches come out.",1702312955,1702312955,True,1,0,0.501965939998626709,0,True,False,False

They are so lively, fun, and lovely which is a weird thing to say in 40k universe but it fits perfectly. This is easily my top 5 CRPG games of all time. 

CONS: The combat system is a bit outdated. I play quite a few of turn-based games and I feel very rather fond of them. But turn-based combat in this game feels very slow. The area of engagement is so huge in many areas. It takes some time for the player and enemy to get close. And the enemies will run away from you which is dreadful when it happened in turn-based game.

BUGs?: The bugs in this game aren't really that bad like people say. It happens to me once in my 20 hours playtime where I stuck in a turn. You need to hit the bug report and the game will resume. Other than that, nothing at all.

But the combat AI is heavily holding this game back. Both enemy and friendly AI will routinely take burst-fire pot shots from way down field and happily disintegrate their own allies just a 5% chance to hit an enemy instead of advancing or taking friendly fire into consideration. I can routinely start combat as far away from the enemy and I think every single time at least 1-3 enemies will be killed from 100% hp to 0% by their own allies. I understand sometimes the risk of friendly fire is worth it. But this is simply unacceptable and lazy AI. They will insist on staying as far away as possible as long as there is a 1% chance of hitting one of my units.

What triggered me to write this review: In a dialogue option, I send reinforcements from my own ship to aid local guardsmen fighting rebels. Then I ran forward to engage said rebels. One of the reinforcements, from my own ship, spawned in, burst fired without even moving, and downed my Rogue Trader, who was at full health. Honestly I can't even tell what he was aiming for. This ruins both tactical game play and the immersion of the game. Some lowly guard from my own ship would be executed for lesser treason than this immediately. This was really the culminating problem that is forcing me to stop playing. I will come back to the game after I see some patches improving combat AI.

Negatives: 
- Combat can be a bit of a chore with the line of sight being questionable/scuffed. You'll experience not being able to shoot something you think you should be able to or getting shot at from some weird angles that the AI can see.

Sadly for the steep price of 50 EUR I didn't receive a game that I could recommend even to the most fanatical 40k fans,
I played 20 hours of this before I decided to uninstall it.

The gameplay is tedious. The dialogues are needlessly verbose and I quickly grew bored by the walls of texts by the NPCs. The plot from prologue to the end of chapter 2 is mediocre at best. The combat is XCOM-esque, except it's slow and boring. Character abilities are needlessly complicated (Operative archetype) or boring (Officer archetype). 

The RPG system that is based on FFG's Rogue Trader RPG is terrible (this is not the fault of the adaptation, but the source it was based on). The character advancement offers a lot of options, most of them add nothing to the game in enjoyment but make it a cluttered mess. 

I regret buying it. Would not recommend to anyone.

In all seriousness this game is amazing, I'm a 40k fanatic so I can appreciate the lack of handholding in terms of the lore. That said, I think it might be a little intimidating to people new to 40k, but they do have a whole game system devoted to making sure that definitions for almost everything lore or game mechanic related is available without even having to open new menus or anything. There are some bugs to be sure, but so far none that I've noticed have had any effect other than brief visual issues. I'm only on act 2, I think, and so far I'm blown away by the story. It makes no compromises and does not attempt to water down the grim darkness in anyway, in fact, leans into it in just the right manor that shines a light on the darkness without glorifying it. 10/10 from a 40k nerd, I recommend ignoring the games journalist reviews and looking up some gameplay or YouTube reviews if you want a better picture of how the game really is",1702302446,1702302446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is fun, but the rules took me a minute to get used to since I've never played the tabletop game it's based on. I was getting owned once I got out of the tutorial, but after I learned the rules I had to crank up the difficulty a bit, because it got too easy.

Good speed settings in the options, but the camera can't really keep up on enemy turns. I highly recommend turning off the player non-attack animations, because they are super slow and don't have a sound effect, so they make the game feel very sluggish and unresponsive if left on.

If your following the company they do have an improvement in quality with every game but there are still some bugs out there (havn't seen a game breaking one or total crash yet but needed to restart one combat since it would no longer react (sometimes there are extrem slowdowns in animations) 

at the beginning you level up a bit too fast and later maybe a bit too slow also I´m not sure about the prefab characters but I would recommend to go mainly by roleplay rails - do you want to be a goody good character who will always do whats best for it´s people and probably cause some terrible heresy by that or a snoby noble only out for their own good? 
Or maybe even a bit heretical? 
I think most combinations can become powerful - but it´s mostly about synergy I would say having x char with the same abilities won't work all that well and always just picking the recommended skills might not be always best. 

On the other hand it´s also very hard to go via guideline since there are just so many possibilities to combine skills (already overwhelming at character creation but it only gets worse in that direction) 
Overall it´s probably best to pick out core skills you want to focus on and pick stuff that makes them stronger.

I had high hopes from an Owlcat game with Kingmaker and WotR being iconic successes, and I feel that Owlcat delivered really well too. The storyline is gripping, although very reminiscent of Kingmaker where you are a new Lord of a realm and need to quell the unrest. The engine used is most likely the same as WotR and Kingmaker with the exact same control, movement, and environment systems. So, if you are coming in from those games, then you should be able to make yourself comfortable easily. Oh and prepare to have your mind blasted with new terms and damage types if you are not familiar with this type of Warhammer content. I definitely was, and it took me an hour of reading to understand all the jargon. 

I am playing in the Hard mode right now which is one level short of Unfair, and I can definitely see the scaling. However, it does not feel overwhelming; there is usually a good way out of your encounter and as long as you maintain save files, you gucci.

The visuals and music are breathtaking. Honestly, those are stronger than the storyline yet do not overpower the story, making the game gripping (yes i used this word twice, but i also put in close to 40 hours over the weekend so by the Emperor, my usage is Warranted - heh) [internal joke, you'll get it] 

NOTE: There are still several bugs (as is usual with Owlcat games) at this moment. If you want a bug-free experience, then I would recommend waiting for 6 or so months (which is usually the time when Owlcat rolls out the major fixes)

Imagine their previous games in a WH40k setting and you've pretty much got it: lots of bugs (nothing too fatal), unclear tooltips, insane overcomplexity, lots of grindy fights, and punishing difficulty settings designed for Big Gamers.

But if you like deep CRPGs and epic story arcs full of choices and fun characters, with a nice mix of gameplay (tons - it's long) and reading (also tons - also long), plus an intricate skill system that will make your cooker cook, Owlcat's one of the best devs for that. 

If you want to really dig into it, you're going to be reading lots of long mechanical explanations filled with nested algebra and trying to figure out what they mean. I'm eager to see them introduce differential equations next - I won't be happy til I see a big ass sigma in my tooltip. 

Key terms will be missing and categorization is poor, so you'll find yourself wondering, for example, what's a mental attack? It's even defined in the codex but the definition is almost metaphysical. They should just slap a ""Mental"" tag on the relevant skills, but ideas like this don't make it far at Owlcat HQ. Also, some of these tags are buggy and wrong, so when you notice the Tech-Use skill claims to be scaling off of Perception when it's actually scaling off of Intelligence, you'll be glad you caught it and simultaneously filled with dread at the realization that other skills are mislabeled... Perhaps this is the work of the Great Conspirator...

The writing might be better than Wrath, which I thought was full of shallow fluff. I think they really convey the poetry of the 40k universe well here, with some beautiful takes on the allure of Chaos, mixed in with properly mystic mystery and ambiguity. Instead of coming out and saying ""OH NO IT'S CHAOS GOD THIS SUX,"" they hint and suggest in ways that are winks to people who know a thing or two and opaque to people who don't know anything. They touch on themes and reveal obliquely, little by little. There are even some gameplay metaphors for various 40k concepts like technology being reduced to rote rituals. Maybe this is less impressive if you know 40k lore well, as I don't, but I found the tone refreshing and I'm more interested in the 40k setting as a result.

I think there's less freedom than previous Owlcat games. If you take a given companion, they feel mostly locked into a certain role. Although the freedom of the Pathfinder class system meant power gamers often took the same handful of classes, at least there was creative freedom for people who ignore power gamers. Here there's less of that, because each character is already on a path and it's hard to shake them from that until the 20th level or so. They come with a particular stats package and that's that. Apparently you can respec, but I haven't noticed that option yet so I don't know how thorough it is. If it lets you redesign down to the level of base stats and first archetypes, then that's a bit better, although not nearly as exciting as Pathfinder's possibilities.

Of course, there's still replayability due to characteristic Owlcat branching and path choices. You can also mix and match different party members or make your own from scratch. The archetype (class) system feels quite restrictive overall, but maybe people will manage to get creative with it. You have some freedom to change up the order in which you do locations and things really open up in Act 2, but it's a long road to that point and employed people with families will have a hard time getting there unless you're efficient with your playtime.

Anyway I'm struck with the strong feeling that Owlcat is one of the good guys. I'm glad they exist and that they do these games on a regular basis. It's only been two years since Wrath and if this is the level of quality we can expect every two years, fine.

The game, while fun, is heavily buggy with oversights that make it feel like I'm playing an early access game. I have had numerous visual and audio bugs that are glaringly painful (especially the constant 'Vine booms' on the ship's bridge). The in game cutscenes can look especially jank with effects and movement.

Owlcat also didn't carry over the reverse of the lesson they learned from Kingmaker's Enhanced Edition, with only one gameplay style available, turn-based. Real-time with pause is just gone and the easiest of fights can drag on for nearly half an hour as cultists soak up bolter rounds. This isn't helped when enemies often bug out and don't end their turn, sitting around for a minute until they are auto skipped.

I will give the game credit for being heavily customisable *at first*, but if you wish to respec any characters, you must pay an increasingly demanding amount of Profit Factor which is a heavily limited resource. Furthermore, you can't edit a character's name, portrait, appearance, origin, first archetype, and so on. Not even for your own character. If you want to change into a DPS, buffer, psyker, etc., you're shit out of luck.
This is worse for companions as they are presets and can have their initial level choices gated off. Even mercenaries are subject to this along with the issue of there being no way to dismiss them.

Also, there should be the option for people joining in on multiplayer to make their own characters. As of now, you either play as pre-existing ones or backseat the host to make a mercenary for you to later take control of, or vice-versa. An import and export feature would be appreciated.

Great setting, beautifully realised and detailed. Lots of character options (though not as many as Pathfinder) and plenty of interesting companions. Very cool concept and story so far. 

Fun XCOM-esque combat, some difficult fights but overall a good balance, seems a bit easier than WOTR so far.

Some REALLY game-breaking bugs with quests that cost me several hours of replayed game time. So that kind of sucked. Also the load times are LONG for my machine, considering how relatively simple the graphics are, and frequent. Which is really annoying when you're trying to get to your ship and have to sit through 3 or 4 loading screens. Weird considering how hard they went on some QoL changes like Cargo, which are awesome innovations on the annoying parts of CRPGs... yet chose not to address others.

Two dirt farmers with sticks can beat a Navigator in a single turn. I encourage you to go read some lore and examples of Navigators in battle. I'll wait... See what I mean?

Lore-unfriendly weak characters is not my only complaint. The graphics are not up to 2023 standards. They don't even have to be to BG3 standards, but it is jarring when there is a story moment that is great but the characters just flap their arms.

The reason I had some free time to write this review is because the game glitched right when I was near the end of a battle and I lost more than 30 minutes of game play time. I clicked attack and I think the pistol animation glitched because the UI options went gray, but nothing happened. I have had at least a half a dozen animation hang-up that solved themselves, so animation bugs seems pretty common. It is 2023, and there are soooooooo many developer tools and beta testing procedures developed over the years, that bugs  in 2023, in most games, are rare.

Things that might be do-able to improve the game (beyond fixing obvious bugs) -
-Graphics might be improved with shaders. This will probably be done by modders.
-Game lore-fun battle balance could be improved, once again, probably by modders.
- The camera view while walking constantly is blocked by tall objects, so I spend about 20% of my time moving the camera. I would recommend fading out tall objects near the camera.

edit #1 - next bug - on the enemy'e turn the camera focused on them while they fired, then the camera was stuck focusing on the enemy during my turns. I had to restart. Restarting from blatant bugs in 2023 is just sad...

edit #2 - Same animation bug again, what a piece of... Froze battle and had to restart. This time the attack animation took a side step to swing, but the the character just did the side step and stopped. I have also seen the frag grenade icon appear above NPCs head. Are they going to throw or is it an ability. Nothing happens. I have also ran into three instance (all in the same critical battle) where I would line up an AoE and it fires but nothing happens. I did the navigators eye cone attack and 2 nades. I think it was blocked by terrain but the UI did not show it blocked. Maybe the UI (aka coding of the game) can not handle grenade paths. 

edit #3 - Another thing that grinds my gears is the flood of worthless abilities. They are just added so the game seems to have choices. I think all abilities that can be activated every turn should be re implemented in another way. It makes no sense to just go through the click motions, clicking on the same abilities turn after turn, after turn, after turn, after turn, the same never ending clicking. Aww crap, I forgot to click one of those three abilities this turn. Its ok, they don't matter. It is just filler taking the place of creativity.

edit #4 I had the camera lock bug again, but since 75% of the battle was visable, I tried to continue playing. While the camera was stuck I could tell the game engine, one might say the Machine Spirit, was struggling because the animation and the battle in general was moving in slow motion, like the game had a memory error too. I figured I would play until it crashed with the stuck camera and the slow motion battle (I would say the game was running at 20% speed). The game never crashed, and one of special abilities jerked the camera back to normal and the game sped back up when that happened.

It's their previous titles with a 40k coat of paint. Until the bugs get ironed out (if they ever do), it's a firm non-recommended. It's simply in too shoddy of a state as-is, which I should have anticipated given Owlcat's previous releases.

Good:
+ Story is interesting enough so far, but with a fairly predictable prologue. [spoiler] Getting attacked every single time you land on a new planet is getting a bit old though, in terms of being a way to start/move a narrative [/spoiler]

+ Characters are fairly varied and enjoyable (if not a little two-dimensional), and about what you would expect given the setting.

+ Good attention to the lore, for the most part, and good breadth of areas to visit.

+ Once you get past Act 1, the game feels pretty open with a fair amount of stuff to do.


Bad
- Big bugs. I see Owlcat didn't learn anything from their previous release and it really isn't excusable at this point. This is 90% of my negative feelings towards the game, and why I wouldn't recommend picking it up until a few months/half a year from now. There's game-breaking bugs, nothing critical so far, but some combat bugs that will brick your game and cause you to have to reload, which can set you back a substantial amount of time given that you cannot save during combat.

- Little bugs. Aside from the gamebreaking ones, there's a myriad of small things that make the game feel very unpolished. Units standing/moving around without animations or T-posing, projectiles coming out of a gun at a 90 degree angle, servitors floating up stairs, all kinds of stuff. 

- The AI is horrid and this is doubly so for allied but non-controllable units. Normally, not a big deal, they get themselves killed and no problem. However, I'd need more than two hands to count how many times I've been in an encounter where an allied unit repositions immediately behind one of mine, opens a burst fire towards that same unit at an enemy 100 feet away, thus almost killing/killing my unit. Super annoying.

- The sound design is barely okay. The voice acting is decent enough (some better than others), but everything else feels weak. Might just have been spoiled by Darktide, but you expect a certain sound from las weapons and bolters, and this ain't quite it.

- The art style is a too far to the cartoonish side. It worked alright for pathfinder, less so for wrath of the righteous, but certainly not ideal for 40k. Normally I'd throw this into the subjectives, but given how the content of the game itself and the story are clearly on the darker side, it doesn't mesh well with how things look. This is made a lot worse when gibbing enemies, because the art style just really doesn't mix with the violence. 

- While we're on the topic, they should've been ok with throwing in the occasional low-poly dick and tits. Feels really fucking weird seeing a pile of mutilated corpses in a chaos ritual, but they all have their unsoiled/perfectly white boxer-briefs on.

Subjectives
Θ Combat is turn-based/XCOM-lite and can drag on a bit. I don't really mind the combat speed (barring the bugs acting as a hidden timer to finish up as quickly as possible), but I can see how some people wouldn't like it.

Θ There's a morality system, and the third branch - Iconoclast - is gonna be a matter of taste. Rather than just there being the puritanical/heretical axis, it's dogmatic/heretical/iconoclast (with iconoclast and heretical being considered ""fanatic"" and dogmatic being ""puritanical""). Dogmatic is a no-mercy, no-exceptions kind of adherency to the Imperial Cult and doctrine, and heretical is largely self explanatory (though perhaps comes too close to ""just being a dick"" a lot of times). Iconoclast is still considered a radical path, but is centered around ignoring laws, doctrine, and tradition in attempts to 'do good,' such as pardoning executions over minor mistakes, cavorting with xenos, or hesitancy in using lives as a means to an end. I was a little worried this setup indicated they were going to boil the Imperium and Dogmatic path down to ""it's just space nazis,"" but they've done a good job of showing how the unwavering iron-fisted approach of the Imperium is often warranted by the threat of Chaos. 

Θ Not a lot of room for character development/conversation. Most of the chatting is to move the narrative forward, there's not a whole lot of talking with your party members.",1702268256,1702268942,False,5,0,0.52371138334274292,0,True,False,False

Many of the game systems aren't explained well, the math is poorly presented, and it's difficult to understand most of it. The game rules are arbitrary and inconsistent, and it is often difficult to know exactly what an ability or what stats actually do.

It is amazing to me and feels like it really captures the spirit of Warhammer 40k. Unfortunately, it feels like that's the only thing the game aces. 

To start with, combat is brutal... a little too brutal. I have been playing on Normal for all 27 hours as of the time of writing. Normal... as of the meaning of the word... is presumably the default difficulty, and what most people will gravitate to. Holy shit. Most of them are able to use the same or similar skills as you, and use the same weapons. The issue starts when damage means a something entirely different to two different characters, because even the most basic enemies seem to have 2-3x as much health as my party. Shwacking an enemy for 25 damage out of a 150hp health bar, compared to getting shwacked back for 25 out of my 50hp health bar is ludicrous. Add in that there are almost always 2x as many enemies as you have party members and combat becomes a save scumming slog. This is not a rogue like. Death only means you fuck off back to your last save. Death is not fun. Playing on normal, I expect not to slam my head against the brick wall until I receive a concussion. If I wanted a brutal challenge, I would be playing on a harder difficulty. 

Next is the bugs. I swear, I stumble into bugs almost non stop. Line of sight broken by literally nothing. Characters freezing in their animations and  stopping you from doing anything, which is frustratingly frequent and seemingly only fixed by loading a save. Weird missing texture pink boxes. Quests breaking, getting you stuck so you have to literally load the game before you even started the quest. I have literally lost hours of my time to quests that just don't update and leave you stuck in a room.

Next is dialogue. I get it. Writing responses that take everything into account for all the different things players want to say across your vast open world can be extremely difficult. But still. Just taking the game's three ""moral"" pathways into account, it is painfully dull. Iconoclast is classic nice guy. Dogmatic is the ""strict brutal imperial"". And Heretical is... well... heretical. But some of the responses are completely tone deaf. I forget what the exact wording is, but there is a planet where refugees are invading a holy temple looking for shelter and they come into conflict with each other. Iconoclast's response is ""make them work together in harmony"". Dogmatic is ""well we should lobotomize and servitorize the refugees so they can still be of use after invading holy ground"". And heresy is straight up ""lets murder everyone for fun."" I don't have an issue with having extreme responses like ""let's murder everyone for fun"", but please can we have some like... halfway tame responses? I would love to have a bit of a ""slow fall from grace/slow corruption"" Fulgrim style, without having an otherwise loyal character randomly go ""I want to skin someone alive and feed them to their family"". All the heretical responses and a decent amount of the dogmatic responses feel so out of pocket that I can't rationalize them at all either personally or in character unless you're planning on playing a character that is truly completely unhinged. Further more, though I have not played one myself, I have seen people complain that there are no psyker related dialogue options, which seems like a bit of an oversight when potentially playing a psyker character that's going to interact with multiple psychic companions.

I really... really want to love this game. Unfortunately, in its current state, there is just too much frustration for me to solidly recommend it. If you're willing to deal with all these issues, by all means, there is still plenty of fun to have, and the world building is still amazing.

Instead, I'm stuck with the decision to restart 4 hours of content (including the exploring, side quests, and lost battles), or I can just quit the game wait months and know that my game will have additional issues with it due to the new patches which can make the game unplayable on that old save. Or, I can decide to wait for them to fix the game and start a new character and restart all 25 hours of content which based off my experience of their last 2 games will also have game breaking bugs that'll never get fixed.

Also wish you could completely reset your character and choose different things.

You can then upgrade them to make them safe. It got very annoying after awhile, having to fight the same/similar random encounters. Just let me go to my planets lol. After the 3rd or 4th combat encounter that didn't have anything to do with th story, you were just like ""ok this is getting tiring"". There were some rough moments with the camera where  you couldn't get the visibility you were hoping for. And some of the features I kind of wished they explained more.

Good:
- 40k immersion is spot on. They did a fantastic job with the dialog, characters and storyline. If you like 40k, then this game is for you.
- Combat is fun and it seems balanced so far. 
- Out of combat character debuffs aren't crazy. I really enjoy the system so far.
- Decisions in the game feel meaningful and Grim Dark. Even if it doesn't affect the storyline so much (I only just finished act one after 19 hours so who knows), because they did a fantastic job with the character immersion, you feel for the people around you.
- Plenty of side quests that help with the immersion.
- No game breaking bugs so far as of act 1.
- Excellent music and ambiance.

Neutral:
- Space combat is ok. It's more of a mini game. 
- Not everything is voice acted.

Bad:
- Camera controls are clunky in general.
- Graphics look dated. Don't misunderstand, the game has plenty of atmosphere and environment, I just wish the graphics were less cartoon like.

Conclusion:
- Buy it. If you aren't familiar with 40K, the game does an amazing job with it's dialog to give you a sense of whats going on. I struggle with other CRPG's, but I must say this one is great. It's rare that a 40K game is released that's not just a money grab. Watch some of the reviews online, but it's worth the money and I'm really enjoying it so far.

2. majority of characters even important ones that you have conversations with do not have portraits they have dumb obscure portrait of digital matrix outlining them, at first I was like um no biggy but then had important convo with a frekin MAYOR and no portrait just Neo, left me with a bad taste of the lazies 

3. the first Lord Captain that you meet at beginning has no freakin voice acting at all not even a moan but everyone else through the freakin prologue speaks.. what the frak she's pivotal to the story

Once some of the game breaking bugs (which I've luckily not experienced so far) and these issues get ironed out, the game is perfect.

Otherwise, its everything I wanted out of this game. I feel like some aspects are a little bit busted. Like, weapon skill affecting hit chance, crit chance, parry chance and reducing parry and dodge chance of enemies. When one stat does so much, there's little reason not to invest in it. By comparison, ballistics only increases base hit chance of ballistic weapons. If you want to reduce dodge chance, you need to invest in perception.

The build variety is pretty insane, though I do regret that the conviction system outright gimps your build if you picked the wrong conviction.

Wanted to play a Heretic Pyromancer Psyker? Well you goofed because pyromancer's best path is Dogmatic, because not only do you get bonus fire damage, you get to increase your psi rating by 5 (which doubles the damage of your psi powers)  and get the best melee weapon in the game which scales with how far in you've gone in the dogmatic tree. Thankfully I'd say this is practically the only example of this, since you're clearly giving yourself gear that's meant to the Inquisition Psyker you get in your party.

Otherwise my only crticisism is that once you understand the systems breaking the game in half isn't very hard. This is probably the only owlcat game I've played where it isn't a chore to become overpowered and I actually recommend playing on hard instead of normal once you understand the systems and a littel bit of the loot the game will give you.",1702252741,1702252741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead it's a mobile tier, grid based strategy RPG with a heavy focus on positioning, buff synergies and build specialisation. There's an overwhelming number of abiltiies, so many that the system seems incoherent at best, and if you make a wrong choice of archetype there's no chance to respect. 20 hours in and found your character idea doesn't work? Tough shit, restart. Many of the encounters are so overtuned that it feels more like a puzzle game than a turn based strategy.

Ships, which were detailed enough to be a shared extra party member in the TTRPG, have been dumbed down to drives, weapons and shields, and you don't get anything bigger than your starting destroyer. Ship combat itself is incredibly tedious and regularly pits the player against absurd odds requiring you to save scum until enough shots miss for you to survive.

The story is OK, but it's more there to provide some narrative for the succession of scripted combats that make up the actual game, and if you're familiar with the setting none of the story developments are even going to even raise an eyebrow. There's very little reactivity, next to nothing in the way of non-combat based quests, minimal exploration and few if any memorable non-companion NPCs.

Would I recommend? Maybe, but on when it's sale, after several patches, and only if you're expecting a 40k based X-COM wannabe instead of an adaptation with the fidelity of their Pathfinder games or BG3.",1701980061,1702252046,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

In its current state, this is not worth $50. It is honestly a joke that this was released as a full game instead of Early Access, where it belongs.

I will give them a slight pass with the fact that this is Owlcat's first game to include coop, but the number of bugs, desync, and general unpleasant experiences unrelated to it have made this not worthwhile. People clipping through obvious structures, the game showing duplicate party members in fights, and lack of voice acting in areas where it SHOULD have been added.

Rogue Trader certainly has its flaws, but it does such an excellent job evoking  40k setting and is generally all around solid that I'm quite happy with it. 

Owlcat is typically really good at making you feel like a badass in its RPGs and RT is no exception. You don't start of as some raggedy peasant with nothing but rags and a rusty butter knife. Instead you are *the man* and everyone lets you know it. Wrath of the Righteous also did this as it put you in charge of commanding the crusade, but RT cranks it up into overdrive. From a roleplay perspective I feel really immersed and committed to ruling my fiefdom and commanding my ship . The setting is so well realized that I found all the fluff about galactic politics, trade deals, scheming factions, and everything else the Imperium has to offer engrossing. 

One thing I particularly like is how well handled Chaos is. Chaos offers basically infinite scenarios for writers, and this game basks in all the weirdness and depravity it is capable of. Chaos really feels like a pernicious, omnipresent threat gnawing at the edges of the empire and corrupting it from within. I began to understand the Imperium's genocidal tendencies and harsh measures in the dialogue options, because of the uncertainty and danger chaos presents around every corner and in everything seemingly out of the norm. It got so out of hand at one point that during one scenario (vague spoiler) I even shot one of my companions and deprived my party of a useful member because shit got way too crazy with them. The game's morality system, which has you choose between Iconoclastic (compassionate) Heretical (pro-chaos) or Dogmatic options reflect this strife very well.

The gameplay is fine. I like what they did fleshing out the original ruleset, but I feel more could be done with it. A lot of abilities are just sort of dull. They change some numbers under the surface, but they don't all feel impactful. Which is a shame because you otherwise feel like a badass tearing heretics up on the battlefield. The class system too leaves something to be desired. Each of the ""archetypes"" don't feel adequately distinct. The result is that a lot of my party members felt undifferentiated .

Yes, there are a lot of repetitive combat encounters. You'll slaughter scores of identical or slightly different chump heretics all throughout the galaxy. Personally, I don't mind this, I think of sort of as Dynasty Warriors but CRPG. It wouldn't be 40k if you weren't buzz sawing through hordes of cultist peasants.  Plus, it's always satisfying after a fight to stand knee deep in corpses taking in the very over-the-top, decapitated limbs everywhere carnage. It's just a shame that there isn't more enemy variety considering the many nasty things the 40k universe has to offer. There are distinct encounters, mind you, but there's just loads of filler.

Some mechanics just seem pointless, especially the ""trauma"" system. When a party member dies, they get a massive debuff until they revisit the voidship, rendering them effectively useless. All this meant was that I'd periodically have to stop what I was doing, run back to the start of the map, load into the voidship and then re-enter the map so the traumas would be cleared. They do let you modify how truamas behave in the difficulty settings though. It's just a needlessly punitive, no fun mechanic. 

RT doesn't break any boundaries, except for the one that to me counts most: it is a competent and well-realized CRPG featuring the 40k universe, made by people who are fans of the lore and captured the setting and its mood in its essence. I hope the game is a success and they add a lot more. It's a solid foundation.",1702243141,1702243479,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good:
- Graphics are nice, smooth, colorful yet grim
- excellent writing and presentation of the 40k universe
- good roleplaying elements
- the management + fleet combat mini game are nice
- progression system has interesting ideas but some problems

Bad
- on progression system, pointlessly complex scheme of talents, with complex calculations and lacklustre results, making character planning a frustrating experience
- despite the lore is very good, there is a LOT of text. Prepare to read a few novels.
- Overall pacing of the game can be slow because it's reading bunch of texts, then tons of small battles.

To be really frank, to the casual RPG player, if you had to choose between Rogue Trader or spending a little extra for Baldur's Gate 3, you will have a much better experience with BG3.
Rogue Trader is for 40k fans who have been yearning for an RPG experience, but I hardly see it would attract anyone else.

I want to put this in before I get to the review proper as I feel that Baldurs Gate has brought many new people into the world of CRPGs.

This is a smaller team with a smaller budget meaning:

It is not as graphically stunning as Baldurs Gate. It is also not fully voice acted, only partial voice acting, however the voice acting is great and the writing in general is really good.

The system they have adapted for this game is much more complex than DnD 5e. Combat is a mix between a traditional CRPG and Xcom due to the heavy focus on firearms and therefore is slower and combat encounters take place over longer distances. Note that these two things are not negatives, just that they may be jarring to someone with only BG3 as a reference for CRPGs.

On to my feelings about the game.

Lets start with the negatives.

The only one I really have so far is that there a few bugs, but Owlcat has shown through their last 2 titles that they are very good at addressing them. If you encounter a bug report it with the in game bug report tool, default is ctrl B. I have a lot of faith that they will iron out all of the kinks. The slight jank of Owlcat's games are part of the charm. 

Now the positives.

The system they have adapted is wonderfully complex, it can certainly be overwhelming but I prefer the depth of the system over simpler systems like 5e. The combat plays almost like Xcom using cover bonuses, larger encounter arenas and grid based movement. 

They have really encapsulated the feel of 40k, from the aesthetic to the dialogue choices, you can truly embrace the comical levels of grimdark that the setting provides.

At the time of this review I am near the end of Chapter 1. The story so far has been interesting and the companions unique and well written. Each bring their own ideologies and personality as well as unique playstyles. 

I highly recommend this game to people that are fans of the CRPG genre, Xcom or the 40k setting. Even newcomers to the genre I think will enjoy this game once they get the hang of how the system works. It may be a bit of a learning curve but that is part of the fun. I have never player Rogue Trader on tabletop before, but I am starting to get a feel for how combat works. Though I know for a fact I will mess up my builds and need to respec my party halfway through the game once I really grasp the mechanics. This is not a problem as you can respec very easily.

The one thing I am sad about is I do not think you will get to have a Harlequin, which are my favorite faction in 40k lore. But this game is focused on the Empire of Man, so I cannot really fault the game for this, and I could be wrong as I still have a lot of the game ahead of me.

Having said that, it has to be challenging for the right reasons, and at the moment this game is mostly challenging because the AI is very bad. It's COMMON to see enemies make a move that puts their allies INTO the line of fire and then burst fire killing their friends. This happens in reverse as well, if you have ""friendly"" units your best move is probably just to get to one side to avoid being shot to death in the back by ""allies"" who are burst firing from the extreme max range of their weapon with A LOT of their own and your units in between them and their target. Also line of sight is either so convoluted that it's nearly indecipherable or the AI just ignores it entirely. So it's pretty common to see an enemy gun unit line up at their max range and just start burst firing at you through massive object like shipping crates or industrial equipment, and the shots just magic phase through these things to hit your troops, but if you try to return fire at the same unit it will tell you ""vision is blocked""",1702237190,1702237190,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It plays like Pathfinder, which is what Owlcat is known for, and it really does feel like the grand world-hopping Rogue Trader campaign I thought I was going to get. I'm loving it.

Good:
1. Every frame is oozing with 40k lore (60 40k lore units per second!, sometimes dropping to 45 in crowded battles)
2. The combat is fun and appeals to the endless optimiser like myself
3. The characters are fun
4. The story is fun
5. The music is epic
6. Art is awesome
7. Exterminatus!

Gripes (not deal breakers)
1. The combat can be a little repetitive, it took me 15 hours to get my first plasma weapon
2. With all my sector spanning influence I can't seem to find anywhere to get grenades
3. Loading screens are endless
4. Most of the story is not voiced, so be prepared for copious amounts of reading (it's generally worth it)
5. Dialogue options don't seem to influence much

and thats just the game braking bugs ive found, there was a bug i ran into that just prevented me from looting anything and a few bugs involving cut scene where npcs would just pop into existence in a impotent scene

other than bugs there is a few choices made for the game that just feel lazy, the most noticeable is dialog and rather or not its voiced, its actually just random what dialog is and inst voiced at all, at first i thought it was just for impotent scenes but no, it just sometimes is voiced and sometimes not, i even ran into a situation where the first page of dialog was voiced but once i clicked continue, the fallowing multi paragraph mess of a speech wasn't. for some side characters i can understand but the whole game is like this. its weird and it feels like they just half backed the voices and and screw it

there is also the ""history"" moments the feel super lazy the first one i ran into was with the cultists and the lens the used to blind people, the history segments are actually illustrations on a book, with text that you pick from in the bottom corner, this is how little they care about side content, ""just use a picture from the drafts and slap some options next to it, there side quests all done...no more effort needed, no need for anything else...nope""

overall the game feels lazy and put together real fast, is not a good rpg, not a good action game ether sense the UI make me want to rip my eyes out and feed them to the dark gods, honestly if you have no experience with rpgs like this you will have 0 idea what the hell is going on, for example, you have 4 action points and 4 moment points, this is neatly represented by 2 bars in the center of your screen, green for movement and yellow for action, on the left of your screen you have your combat actions and the right your extra options mainly skill unlocks, things like med kits and grenades are hidden in the ui and easy to forget because everything is in your face, also actions can include combat actions and combat actions can include normal actions, got that? no? exactly my point to top this whole rant about the UI off when selecting an ability or upgrade instead of seeing a value or even a reference like add 0.75% more damage, you insted see statistics like adds 2x(TGH+0.5xSTR) weaopn skill...WHY! WHY DO I HAVE TO DO THE MATH? why cant you just they use percentages...i mean heck they already do, medium armor simply adds a 0.75 dodge reduction so why BS me with stupid stat blocks?

anyway, the game needs major fixes and some major UI changes before i change my review...",1702233753,1702233753,False,4,0,0.488101541996002197,0,True,False,False

Owlcat got to make a Warhammer 40k game. Just like their work with Wrath of the Rightious and other RPG adaptions Rogue Trader knocks it out of the park. Depth, good characters, mechanical depth, good gameplay and of course their signature flare for making choices feel 'Good' even when they have no mechanical affect. This is a strength of their story telling that I feel has gotten better with each game they've made.

If you're a Warhammer 40k fan, a fan of the old d100 Warhammer 40k RPGs (Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Black Crusade, etc), deep RPGs and games that WILL take a while to play. This game is for you.

My 1 big warning for anyone looking to buy the game. This is one of those big time sink games, and it might be hard to play if you only have 30 minutes or so a day to play.

-combat is challenging, and they nailed making it feel weighty and gory with turn based gameplay.
-Whoever wrote the game is a gigantic warhammer nerd, although I just know James Workshop had them at gunpoint when writing the lore.
-graphics are good, and fitting.
-speaking of the settings, wow that shit is cool, they went overboard with designing the set pieces. 
-the best part so far is the writing, like i said, whoever they got for the writing genuinely gives a shit. Hope you like reading as much as I do.
-Oh, and it does the BG3/(good RPG) thing of having insane choices that can completely change how you play the game from the beginning.

Cons: 
-Spelling errors in some of the longer paragraphs, tons of reading if you're not into that. (Reading comprehension is plummeting everywhere, so I see how some of you may struggle)
-The character making, skills, and combat system may seem a bit complicated and daunting, but it's pretty simple if your brain has more than three ridges. Jokes aside, if you're not into RPGs or DND stuff to begin with, you'll prob have a bad time.
-usual week 1 bugs on a pathfinder game (npcs t posing, getting stuck) I have not hit any major bugs yet but you can save whenever so just save often ig. Haven't crashed yet. 
-Unintuitive party controls for moving as a group. Nitpick
-camera doesnt follow character automatically  (WASD camera, left click to move) makes sense after you try it out, pretty old school. Another nitpick.
-left click to move instead of hold left click to move- NITPICK
-Can describe a few features as overwhelming, I don't know if I would really consider this a con, but putting it in here for flavor. 


Overall: So far on the CRPG scale, if Baldur's gate 3 is a 10, this is an 8.5 as it stands. It will probably go down as the definitive warhammer RPG, and I'm really happy about that. 

Oh and final note, this is a 150-200 hour game for sure. It's a bit daunting the shit you can do. I'm talking planetary colonization and establishing a trade empire. They really make you feel like you're that fucking guy. Tutorial took me two hours the first time, 30 mins the second time lmfao.

Are you getting 50 dollars worth of content? Yea sure, I do dollars per hour as my justification (I never hit my mark) but you're getting, by my equation, 200 dollars worth of content.

Also if you have played Xcom, Wartales, Gears Tactics or any other games like that you will be very very very annoyed by the terrible Line of Sight in this game, most of the time you cant even see the obstacles in front of because they are being automatically hidden due to their height [e.g Pillars in the Warehouse not visible in warehouse, visible outside of warehouse]  or the LoS just won't be there even though I can fucking see that Cultist Acolyte right in front of me 

Also Combat is extremely easy and cheesable on the Daring Difficulty, only issues I had so far was in the Chapter 1 Final battle, mostly due to the worst spot for your team to start in in history of worst spots for your team to start in

Get it in a month or two when it's fixed or at least somewhat stable.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Embarking on a solitary journey through the Warhammer 40k universe in Rogue Trader has been an enthralling experience, and I find myself captivated by the immersive single-player gameplay.

Rogue Trader excels in delivering a rich and atmospheric solo adventure, where the narrative unfolds with a sense of isolation in the vastness of the 41st Millennium. The graphics and attention to detail remain commendable, portraying the grim landscapes and massive starships with a visual flair that immerses players into the dark and oppressive ambiance of the Warhammer 40k universe.

The gameplay strikes an excellent balance between strategy and action, and the choices I make throughout the journey feel consequential, influencing the destiny of planets and characters. The customization options for ships and characters continue to provide a personal touch to the strategic elements of the game, ensuring a satisfying sense of progression.

The soundtrack remains a standout feature, enhancing the overall mood and gravity of key moments in the storyline. The haunting melodies and epic orchestrations contribute significantly to the immersive experience.

While no game is without its quirks, the occasional minor bugs did little to detract from the overall experience. The commitment of the developers to addressing community feedback and providing regular updates instills confidence in the game's continued improvement.

In conclusion, Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader is a commendable single-player experience that successfully captures the essence of the grimdark universe. Whether you're a veteran Warhammer enthusiast or a newcomer to the franchise, Rogue Trader offers a compelling journey through the 41st Millennium, standing as a testament to the solitary struggles within the vastness of space.

Minor bugs that I've encountered and remembered so far:
- inconcistent battle logs
- some abilities do not work as described
- some tallents don't work at all 
- buggy lines of sight
- awful animations for some actions + sometimes they get stuck and you have to wait for 5-10 seconds for them to unstuck. One time it actually stuck forever, so I had to end my turn prematurely
- the option of turning off the camera centering on your character on every action doesn't always works
- I put all combat speed to 3x cause its too slow, but sadly that doesn't work on certain enemies, who still walk in 1x speed. None of it also works in space combat and each fight starts with you staring at the enemy ships arriving to the battlefield for good 7-8 seconds
- the achievements are broken. I haven't really noticed it, was too focues on the game, but at a random space combat, about 25 hours in, I suddenly got, like 25 different achievements. Considering that I am among the 0.8% of people who completed chapter one, I suspect that its quite the videspread problem

Major bugs:
- Sometimes the numbers are just... wrong. The sword has 16-21 base damage, I attack, the damage is less then I expected (and what the game showed me on the tooltip when I aimed at the enemy, but you should refer to the point 1 of Minor bugs part), check the logs - the game rolled between 12 and 17 damage instead (all the bonuses and malluses are listed separately bellow the rolled damage, so that is not the issue). Who ate my 5 damage? Why do I have to lose a characater in a battle because the mini-boss did not die?
- I pretty much ignore what % chance to hit the game shows me for burst attackes, it never is true. The game gives you a neat breakdown of where will your shots go in a burst fire mode, like 18% to hit one enemy, 23% the other, 45% for the cover of the first guy, 15% for the explosive barrel, yet all I do is either hit the enemy or miss completely, meaning no cover destruction or barrel explosion
- ship combat just doesn't function properly. I honestly struggle to understand what is a bug and what is a feature at this point. I've been in this madness for so long that I started to apologize to my dry wall for punching it and it replied.
1) Sometimes shields will get penetrated even if they are full. The game mentioned that when your shields get lower, they can be, but at the very first shot randomly?
2) Movement system is broken. It shows you the position of your ship after a maneuver, which is very crucial as you have different weapons sticking out from different sides of your ship. Yet very often the game just ignores that and ""turns"" me extra 45% to the side, completely screwing up my planing, making me unable to use nose cannon, for instance, cause the ship turned too much on itself. This bug actually alows me to turn 225 degrees to the left of right, which after checking multiple videos on Youtube and reading online, is simply should not be possible. The problem is so severe and crippling that it actually made me rage quit 33 hours in and now I'm sitting here, fuming and miserable, writing this review. It is impossible to have a normal space fight because of this
3) Both you and the enemy have sided shields, that is you have 4 directional shields on every side of a ship. Theoretically, the closest to the enemy part of the shield should receive damage and stop the shots, but sometimes decides that this is not going to be the case.
4) After certain actions, you can't move to some cells anymore. Mostly happens with torpedos where if you send them diagonally to the side, sometimes your ship will refuse to turn to that side at all, even if you move far past torpedos
So yeah, space combat is a misery. In land combat if one of my party members bugges out or the game scams me out of some damage I know I had, the other can help. In the space combat its my one ship vs 3-5 enemies, I don't kill that one enemy and its a loss.
- and, of course, the game braking bug for a dessert. I've read some people encountering issues like that, but I though it was just a skill issue on their part, they were doing something wrong. But nope, the game actually can completely break (should've known when I saw the option for ""critical"" bug in a bug report menu). On one of the maps I had to find out the secret code to open a hiding space for tech-bros and the code was in a room full of fanatics. I walk up to the room, the cutsene plays and after that the party has a conversation. A genuies idea arises - dress up as fanatics, walk into the room and sabotage some stuff to kill them without a fight. I make my preferred allegiance choice and then the bug happens and an enire map resets. That respawns every enemy and loot on the map and launches the cutscene of us approaching the room again, with conversation afterwards again. Except it broke something and the computer you need to interact with to open the tech-dudes loft after you get the code is no longer activatable. Of course with the power of hindsight that would be 'only' about 20-minutes replayed, but I spent 1.5 hours trying to figure out what broke the script.
- Oh, and by the way, if you read previous point and thought ""wow, dress up as fanatics and sabotage your way out of fight with, like 40 dudes, how cool"", yeah no, that one broke for me too. I've checked online, people could do it, but however much I tried, I would get immediately spotted and the fight would start. The fight itself wasn't too hard despite the large numbers, but my point still stands.

Lastly, I was continuing writing about poor choices by the devs, not the bugs, per say, but just weird mechanics, but I've reached the character limit midway through. This will have to be blitz round: option 'hide helmets' literary only hides helmets (enjoy waring +5% chance to hit and to crit glasses, you nerd, can't hide them'), the buying power/reputation system is very fragile and can get you softlocked out of some loot for a long time (I had 25 buying power and after respecing all my characters I have 16, please send help) or even forever (there is very finite amount of medikits and grenades for sale. I don't use them much, but if I did, I'd be screwed), you don't have the option to disable choices prompts, like in previous games (thank you game, you don't need to tell me that the option of ""HAHAHAAH, I always wondered how it feels to wear heretic clothes!"" is, indeed, and heretical choice and will give you appropriate heretical poins), several classes are either very underpowered (assasin) or cluncky to use (battle strategist), entire injury/trauma system (which means that after my navigator gets bodied by some nark with a hammer, I have to walk all the way to my ship and then all the way back cause she broke her ribs), fast travel works half the time (and there is none to your ship, which is, like, the most useful thing), the combat is heavily reliant on luck in the beginning (rolling badly on initiative is THE difference between winning with zero issues and loading a save) and so much more...

I really wanna write more, but the character limit is almost here. I've played both Pathfinders before, but years after they released. If this is how Owlcat release feel like - that's just embarasing. You cannot release the game in this state and then fix it later. I am honestly surprised and apalled by the fact that the game is Very positive on Steam, sure doesn't feel like that to me.",1702195785,1702195881,False,39,0,0.664799332618713379,0,True,False,False
