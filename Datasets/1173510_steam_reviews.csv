you need this. 
untill there is a better overlay software to access your desktop (there isnt) ,  you NEED this.

This turns vr into what it was supposed to be. 
A desktop background that can be anything and a smooth, functional, and good looking hologram style overlay for all your desktop needs.

What do i mean? I mean unlike built in overlay programs from oculus and steam, this is smoothly integrated into your experience. Use your entire desktop to play games, surf the web, litterally waht ever you would do  sitting at your computer. from the comfort of a friends house or inside your favorite game on pause,  even in loading zones! LITTERALLY CHILL ON THE BEACH in vrc while ordering pizza from your wrist . go to a visualizer, be watching a movie, whatever. this works overtop of everything with nearly 0 additional pressure on your system.

 Its controls are intuitive and its packed with features that continue to push it beyond what any of the rest can do.

for instance the layout ability: Tap two buttons to have a ""lay down"" mode  or ""standing but somone talking to me"" mode  immeadtly applied to your lay out.

The music control that displays currently playing, the night mode, the tracker/controller battery life / the SOUNDS! 

god. just.
If you are thinking to yourself. ""i dont need this program, i have a built in overlay."" or "" my old desktop+ or toolkit or virtualdesktop setup is just as good""

its NOT AS GOOD. i fucking promise. Ive tried them all,  this is by far the one that ii thiink about the least and have used the most.

Its just there, it just works. and the more u learn about it the more comfortable it gets. try it.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Firstly, the program works as it should. It provides access to your desktop windows and provides a good keyboard. It does it in an pretty intuitive way, though your first startup can be a bit weird as you're trying to figure out which button exactly opens the overlay by default.

[h1]Everything in the future is Chrome[/h1]
However, users should beware: the latest UI overhaul has turned this into [i]yet another[/i] app using an embedded Chromium browser (Vuplex) as well as a node server. Hope you have a lot of RAM and VRAM. This feels entirely unnecessary and absurdly overkill for what is a fairly barebones overlay. I can already hear my 16GB of RAM crying when it has to run all these separate browser instances for Steam/SteamVR, Discord, VRCX and now also XSOverlay. I don't know many people who asked for or needed this update without an option to roll it back, but it is what it is. This part has been enough for me to consider trying out OVR Toolkit instead... assuming it hasn't also fallen to the menace.

When I first tried the UI beta, it was rather laggy, and my settings were broken until I restarted the app about twice. When it released, this settings bug was still present. It's a one-time thing but it feels bad. Lag's gone though. The app still inexplicably crashes sometimes, or freezes/breaks to the point where I have to restart the application, which obviously means a trip back to my keyboard which tends to defeat the purpose.

[h1]Features[/h1]
There are integrated media controls in the wrist menu which allow you to view the currently playing song and do things like Play/Pause or Rewind/Forward, for media programs like foobar2000 and Spotify to pick up on. While it looks sleeker, I also found that having this media player open overrides your theme settings entirely, replacing it with the album art (if found). If there is no album art found, it defaults your UI to a black and white. This recoloring works quite well and looks good, but sometimes I wish there was a toggle for this behavior. As of today, there is none (yet).

The program allows you to save overlay configurations, but for some reason it doesn't seem to load these automatically, requiring you to go into the clunky wrist menu and click ""load"" every time. If there is an option to do this automatically, it definitely isn't explained anywhere.

XSOverlay has done a lot of work in supporting different keyboards and languages. It's the best on the market if you need an overlay with a functional JIS keyboard. If you just need a regular keyboard, this will probably not matter to you at all.

Certain parts of the UI have not been remade yet, which makes the UI feel inconsistent. This will eventually be fixed, but I had to nitpick that one.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
In summary, I would give this a ""Neutral"" recommendation because it's one of the only options on the market. The reason I trended towards ""Not Recommended"" is simply because of the new UI and the new bugs/crashes that it introduced.

SteamVR has done big revamps to their own overlay and keyboard, meaning that the default SteamVR one is no longer inexcusably bad. Ask yourself if you really need this application before you buy it.

[h2]EDIT 1[/h2]
I have been informed that Layout #9 is automatically loaded when you start the application. This is not explained in any way anywhere, other than a cryptic icon on the layout's button.

I also cannot interact with any loaded desktop windows if I do this, which forces me to load the layout manually [i]anyway.[/i]",1703792392,1704844027,False,3,1,0.480900108814239502,0,True,False,True

It used to be a great tool, but not anymore.
Back in the day, the tool was great, especially it's stability.
But now it has become very buggy due to major updates that we don't feel are necessary. It is fine if it is a minor bug, but unfortunately it is all serious bugs that detract from the VR experience. You have to restart several times to try and get it to boot up, and you can't even exit it properly. Youtube plays on its own and the battery level on the controller is unreliable.

This never happened before the update.

It would be nice if some of them could be fixed with updates etc., but even after two months, they have hardly improved.

We hope for an immediate improvement.　We would also like to be able to recommend this tool.

Only qualm I have, and it's very minor, is you cannot rotate the screens unless they are attached to your hand, and if you move them away from your hand they will rotate back to their normal horizontal position. I personally love to have at least one vertical monitor, and it's a little annoying to have to rotate it manually and not touch it if I want to move the screen around.

Secondary, it doesn't track your main GPU for usage / temps on the tracker, it will default to your on-board graphics. A little bit of a pain, considering OVR Toolkit actually tracks the proper GPU, but not enough to make me want to switch.

Picture this: your PC screen, magically floating in your virtual world like a digital David Blaine, ready to entertain you.

Sure, you could use it to pretend you're listening to your VRChat buddy while you secretly binge on cat videos, but be warned: it won't work over encrypted media. So, Netflix's latest Black Mirror season might have to wait while you ponder the unsettling similarities between your metaverse and the show. Coincidence? I think not!

But hey, XSOverlay isn't just for casual cat video espionage. You can use it as your virtual cheat sheet when you're diving headfirst into Vtuber activities. Or, if you're feeling like a digital Christopher Nolan, you can try to create your dream virtual office and work in it. (Pro tip: I've tried it, and it didn't work, but maybe you'll have better luck.)

And don't forget the perks – with XSOverlay, you get some nifty write watch and media control to supercharge your VR experience. It's like having a virtual Swiss Army knife in your digital pocket. So, whether you're gaming, working, or just indulging in some cat video-induced procrastination, XSOverlay is the software sidekick you never knew you needed for all your VR sessions.

In this review, I will compare XSOverlay and OVR Toolkit, two popular VR overlay applications, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

Let's start with XSOverlay. Right off the bat, XSOverlay impresses with its user-friendly interface and easy setup process. Installing and configuring the overlay was straightforward, making it accessible to both seasoned VR users and newcomers. The customization options provided by XSOverlay allow users to personalize their virtual space and tailor the overlay to their preferences. From floating windows and web browsing capabilities to real-time performance monitoring, XSOverlay provides a versatile toolkit to enhance VR immersion.

OVR Toolkit, on the other hand, offers a robust set of features that also contribute to a more immersive VR experience. Its standout feature is the ability to bring desktop windows into the virtual environment. This allows users to interact with their desktop applications while in VR, making multitasking and accessing external content seamless. OVR Toolkit excels in its window management capabilities, allowing for resizable, movable, and customizable windows within the VR space. Furthermore, the software supports multiple monitors, enabling users to extend their desktops into VR.

In terms of compatibility, both XSOverlay and OVR Toolkit support a wide range of VR platforms and games, ensuring versatility for users across different experiences. However, XSOverlay has a slight edge when it comes to game integration and performance. It seamlessly integrates with various games, providing real-time information and widgets specific to each game. XSOverlay's performance optimization ensures a smooth VR experience without significant impact on frame rates, making it an excellent choice for gamers.

Regarding social integration, XSOverlay offers social media and streaming platform integration, allowing users to stay connected with their audience and manage their online presence within the VR environment. This is an area where XSOverlay surpasses OVR Toolkit, as the latter focuses primarily on desktop application integration rather than social features.

One notable aspect to consider is the community support for each overlay. OVR Toolkit boasts an active and engaged community, with regular updates and new features based on user feedback. On the other hand, XSOverlay's community, while vibrant, may not be as extensive or as frequently updated. However, both applications have responsive developers who actively address user concerns and release updates to improve their products.

In summary, XSOverlay and OVR Toolkit are both solid VR overlay solutions, each with its own unique strengths. XSOverlay shines in its game integration, performance optimization, and social integration features, making it an excellent choice for gamers and content creators who value real-time information and social media interaction. On the other hand, OVR Toolkit excels in its desktop application integration, allowing for seamless multitasking and content consumption within the VR environment. Depending on your specific needs and preferences, either XSOverlay or OVR Toolkit can significantly enhance your VR experience.",1687896021,1687896021,True,56,0,0.855977475643157959,1,True,False,True

Recently, my overlay has been randomly dropping to the framerate of a powerpoint presentation. There doesn't seem to be anything specific that causes this. I need to restart XS whenever this happens to fix it.

I've used a few VR overlay applications and so far (despite it's flaws) this one is the best overall package.

Some of those minor flaws are:
 - Screen grab tends to crash, which requires you to restart XS Overlay (not fun when you're in VR!)
 - Doesn't come with any way to elevate the overlay to admin automatically so you can interact with other elevated apps. (Might be for security reasons)
 - Touch input is borderline unusable, but that's a windows issue I believe.
 - Out of the overlays I've tried this one works the best while laying down but it's still not perfect.

Some pros that I really like about XS Overlay, and why I use it over the others:
 - Runs well
 - Controls and UX is really good, the primary reason I use XS Overlay.
 - Overall pretty polished
 - Has OSC parameters you can tap into! This is huge, I have integrated XS Overlay's OSC output into my VRChat avatar!",1676849599,1676849599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have tried a few VR overlay software including OVRdrop and OVRToolkit and XSOverlay is by far my favorite.
Its simple, easy, unobtrusive and quick to navigate, its not bogged down by flashy features (OVRT) or outdated (OVRd), you also have access to many setting that allow you to customize and fine tune the software so it fits your personal taste.

The keyboard is a MASSIVE improvement over the SteamVR Overlay Keyboard and you can type with 2 controllers at once as well as doing stuff like CTRL + (inset letter here) along with the other functions + you have all the keyboard buttons such as a WINDOWS KEY (AT FRICKING LAST!) and function keys and more that are all lacking on the SteamVR Overlay! There are way many more features this software has that is so useful but the keyboard is worth the £7 alone. The Wrist overlay is super useful and having music control, performance stats for your PC and game as well as all the other stuff I love to look at as a person who loves statistics and figures is great. There are also plenty of customisation settings to make it how you want so I recommend you have a good look through all the settings and make it how you want while you learn how to use it all before actually going in for an actual session of gameplay with it. I learned how to use it and set it up over 2 hours in my VRChat Home World and it works exactly how I would want it to now.
There's plenty of videos online showcasing the features of this software and how to use things as well as set things up that you can look at if you want to know more but I 100% recommend this especially if you spend more than half of your day in VRChat like me (currently around 13.5 hours per day on average but I also sleep in VRChat to be fair lol).

ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE
XSOverlay is a Desktop Overlay application for OpenVR. This means that you can access your desktop, or specific applications, and interact with them however you'd like to.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
MINIMUM:
OS: Windows 10
Processor: Intel i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 equivalent
Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent
DirectX: Version 11
Storage: 500 MB available space
Sound Card: Not Required
VR Support: SteamVR

XSOverlay has been the most stable and reliable for me. The other overlays have had weird quirks with window capture, mouse positions being incorrect, graphical glitches, and just not being able to interact with windows like Discord.

That said, the other overlays may have updated to fix these issues since I tried them, and beyond that they're all just about as usable as the others.",1671330840,1671330840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is a great application that was exactly what I wanted. You can put your monitors or specific windows where you want them in the 3D space around you. You can save layouts so that in the future you can get those windows/monitors exactly where you liked them, although the vertical positioning was always wrong for me when I loaded a layout (randomly several feet above or below where I had placed them) which is an easy fix. Put media controls (Spotify, VLC, etc.) or your chat/Discord on the back of your hand like a watch so they appear with a twist of your wrist then disappear when you don't need them. Any other minor issues I could assume were due to being early access.

The absolute deal-breaker reason I cannot recommend this in the current state is that the application occasionally decides it doesn't want to left-click for a few [i]minutes[/i] at a time. The shortest length of time that this happened was at least 30 seconds, but it typically lasts 1-2 full minutes, and while it's happening you [i]cannot[/i] left-click using your VR device. Everything works fine for a while, maybe 10 minutes or so... I would be interacting with windows on the (virtual) monitor and my left-clicks would suddenly begin to constantly register as right-clicks. When this happened I would try adjusting my grip, pressing buttons to make sure none were sticking or being pressed accidentally, and using other button combos to see if anything else would work. Without luck. Needless to say, during this time it is essentially unusable. I was able to confirm that my mouse would work so it wasn't an issue with the PC itself.

Overall, I actually think this is a pretty great overlay system. But I will be explaining why I don't recommend it.

Pros:
- The interface is very clean, snappy, and user friendly. This is what I value [b][i]most[/i][/b] in any application.
- Having the wrist clock and shortcuts is cool, and I like the computer usage stats so I don't need to open Task Manager.
- The keyboard generally feels nice to use in terms of it's design and what not.
- The presets for monitors is fantastic.
- While not perfect how I would use it, the way you can manipulate monitors and the keyboard especially for laying down is good.
- Being able to capture specific windows instead of just monitors is very useful.

Cons:
- [i][b]The desktop and window capture performance is horrendous.[/b][/i]
- The keyboard sounds + input feel slighty delayed, so it's difficult to type fast like I can on the Oculus Dash.

I am not sure why, but I only get a stuttery 10 or less FPS when trying to view the desktop, mainly with the mouse inputs. 

My only logical guess is that it's because by default, Oculus Dash runs on my CV1, and they both are probably trying to capture even when my Oculus has no monitors up. I checked my system usage and I tried both capture methods, but neither fixed the problem.

Given that this is such a serious problem, it is pretty obviously something on my end, and I doubt others have problems. However, I also am coming from the Oculus Dash where the keyboard and monitors were very responsive with at least a 60+ FPS capture.

I hope I can fix this problem and change my review, but frankly I don't have any motivation chasing down a probably very specific problem that will be difficult to solve. Oculus Dash has been pretty much fine so far and I haven't found a need to have more advanced features like XS offers.

I'd still rate the software something like an 8.5/10 if it wasn't for the desktop and window capture performance.",1658410883,1658410913,False,0,0,0.493589729070663452,0,True,False,True

There are only a few issues I've had with the app so far. A & B are the only ones that actually effect me at all, and even they have some pretty decent work-arounds.

A) The window select menu on window overlays doesn't recognize any additional Chrome windows after two or more have been opened. This issues won't be resolved until all Chrome windows are closed. This is definitely the worst issue I've noticed so far since it makes it more difficult to work on multiple online projects at once. 

B) Anything that has be to double-clicked can be kinda of annoying since the cursor usually has to be on the same pixel for both clicks. You can Left-Click -> Enter in most cases, but being able to double click would be more convenient.

C) Sometimes after closing out the of SteamVR menu, the game I'm playing won't register controller input, but this can be fixed by disabling then re-enabling Layout Mode or by opening/closing the SteamVR window. 

D) Occasionally, the button in settings to access controller bindings stops working, and can only be fixed by restarting the app.

HOWEVER, with multi monitor setups in VR -- which I use for monitor access in Beat Saber and No Man's Sky -- dragging between monitors is finicky and only sometimes works. This is VERY situational and I don't have to do it often, but it is very annoying when it comes up. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that monitors don't attach to the room, they attach to you in reference to the room. This means that they cant load on start up, so you'll have to load your overlay manually each time, again not a big problem, just a minor inconvenience.

The first time I tried to use this, which would be the only time I would use something like this is on Stream. I was excited that I had found a program where I can see both chat and donations on different windows while having them neatly on my hand. Though literally 2 minutes after I start the stream and begin to present the new ""tech"", it crashes. Forcing me to stop what im doing in VR and attempt to both find the startup on tesktop, but also realize that I would have to quit the game since the games window function was fullscreen only. So I quit, got the program up and running again, went back on the game, and figured that I should just keep the windows hidden to not have it crash again (which goes against why I wanted it in the first place), after some time it just crashes again multiple times and I go back to OVRDrop which worked fine.

To explain for the software, I read some comments and reviews, and it turns out that the crashing can be tied to how many windows I have open. I had 3 open, Chat, StreamLabs which may be the problem due to the preview window of stream also playing on that specific window, and VoiceMod for silly voice or sound moments. I could try and lower the amount of windows to just Chat and Specifically the Page that shows the alerts, the one problem I have though is giving this software too much trial and error time to where I can't refund it. In other words, I want to have it work, but I also don't want to be s.o.l for my money.

Does anyone perhaps have some knowledge they can pass down for this? Or perhaps just a conversation in general about this? Having multiple windows is nice, but if the software can't really do its main task too well aside from playing music and telling time then whats the point of it? I could run OVRDrop with this at the same time to run multiple windows, but I think that will just lead me to the same crash or CPU usage problem I have now. But Ill give it a try.

You can see and do so much with it. You're able to see the time, date with day, how much battery percent you have left on your controllers (and trackers if you have them).

Most useful things I've done with it so far:
* MUCH better desktop display than the one built into Steam's UI, easily scaled and peered at so I can tweak options for things, start and stop programs without taking off the headset.
* Watching a live stream in a little floating window while hacking through the wilds in Skyrim.
* Sharing phone screen to desktop and adding that window in here (anchored to wrist with auto-hide) gives me a swipe-able keyboard and all my notifications, so I can FINALLY easily see and reply to messages in VR.

My biggest hopes:
* a plugin system for this, so others could add, for instance, alternative keyboards / input methods. Sometimes I still gotta type something on the desktop and classic QWERTY keyboards in VR are not a great match. Another great plugin API would be a way to push heads-up notifications into this.
* some way to give this precedence for the grip button when in layout mode, over NaLo.
* complete input blocking to the underlying app. Sometimes trigger things in the running app while interacting with windows. I tried the experimental input blocking thing and it didn't seem to help any.

But yeah, I think those last two are really issues with the SteamVR API that this is dealing with the best it can.

Quickly create panels that show entire desktops, or individual windows from your desktop.. pull up a keyboard with a quick press of a virtual button on your wrist, everything is faster and more intuitive than the default VR overlays.

XSOverlay has quickly become my favorite way to bring desktop content into my VR space.

Whether that's a Twitch chat window, youtube video, or all three of my desktop monitors, XSOverlay is the smoothest and least buggy desktop overlay I've experienced, and this is coming from someone with 3 years of VR experience with overlays like OVR Drop and OVR Toolkit.  As someone with 3 desktop monitors, I've long begrudged the fact that other overlay problems make it very difficult to drag and drop things between separate monitors.  I've often needed to drag a window half way to another monitor, then click on that monitor to activate it, then drag the window the rest of the way.  With XSOverlay, I can open up all three monitors side by side and freely drag and drop windows/files between them with little/no hitching.  It really is a godsend for trying to actually be productive in VR without needing to take off the headset and fiddle with something at my desktop.",1585353475,1585353531,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

On OVR Toolkit, I used to attach a desktop window to my hand as it was the most practical way I've found to use it.

On XSOverlay, I don't feel like I need to do that anymore. I just leave the desktop freely floating around, move it around and resize it as needed because it feels so natural to use it this way. Overall it feels much nicer for me to use XSOverlay as the interactions are more intuitive and comfortable.

Let me explain the problems with the others, which is why I decided to try XSOverlay:
OVRDrop -- almost impossible to move windows around, you have to use sliders. Doesn't natively support multiple windows, but in development mode you can start the program multiple times to act like it. But if you do this, windows conflict and go in front of eachother, so it's bad. This is by far the worst overlay.
DailyVR -- very good. Loved this overlay. However, it didn't support any way to curve windows, which was really bothering for me since I code in VR and would have to move the window around a lot for comfortability. Pointing your mouse at a different window would make it a priority, and all other windows would turn into the window you're point at if that makes sense; this was very annoying too.
XSOverlay -- the best. Easily able to use multiple windows without them conflicting, windows curve similar to the Oculus Dash, easily resizable, pinnable, can reset window positions. This is the exact software I was looking for when I wanted an overlay different from Dash. Biggest problem from using Dash alone is that you can't use it outside of the Oculus menu which dims the background, so this is amazing.",1584669138,1584669138,True,4,1,0.558139562606811523,0,True,False,True

Not worth a cent.  It does nothing at all but give you an achievement, and pop up one message.

Also, if you buy it anyway and go looking for instructions on how to use it, don't.  There aren't any.  At all.
