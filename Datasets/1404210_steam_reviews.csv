After endless hours on PS4 and another 91 hours on PC, I just gave up in the end.

The biggest issue - like any Rockstar game - are the Cheaters/Modders.
You can spend ages gathering supplies say for Trader, build up a good supply, start a mission, only to then have your supply yoinked in the blink of an eye and sold by someone else. As annoying as it would be, I'd of been fine if it were stolen and sold by actual players playing the game, but what are you supposed to do against someone who can legitimately just teleport your supply away?
Then comes the classic ones from GTA - such as planting infinite explosives/Fire Bottles at your feet, teleporting you to the top of the skybox to plummet to your death, disarm you of everything you own (Weapons, equipment, supplies, etc.), and of course (As mentioned above) disrupting missions.

Then when it comes to getting games without a Modder, the next problem is that RDO is much better with Friends - there's a better chance at playing the game and getting missions done when you have a Posse formed. On your own (Like any Rockstar game again), you just get completely wrecked, and I've found RDO Posse's to be far more relentless than GTAO Players. GTAO I might have someone kill me a few times for about 5-10 minutes before they move on... RDO: 1-2 hours. Like, holy hell; it gets to a point where I just AFK and wait to see how long before they move on: 2.5 hours is the record so far.
It's all part of the game, I get it - but if you're a low level, a new player, or returning player; then good luck trying to survive solo against a Posse who have everything unlocked from Gold Bar purchases and can just spam explosive & incendiary ammunition.
The game is much better with Friends. GTAO at least there is some fun with playing solo - RDO; not a chance.

However; in my opinion, this game could of been very easily redeemed had Rockstar not given up on it so quickly. 
So many unique ideas could of been added (Heists as an example), but instead it was just grindy missions & roles that offer little to no fun. The only fun this offers is if playing with friends and just goofing around, otherwise it isn't worth it.
Very disappointing Rockstar pushed this aside to focus on GTA - so much promise, yet so little care.",1708913545,1708913545,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game’s expansive and meticulously detailed world, combined with its immersive gameplay, provides a unique and engaging experience that is hard to match.

The game’s strength lies in its stunning open-world environment. The beautifully crafted landscapes, the dynamic weather system, and the diverse wildlife all contribute to a sense of realism that few games can rival. The attention to detail in every aspect of the game, from the character design to the intricate storyline, is truly commendable.

However, it’s disheartening to see such a beautiful world feel somewhat abandoned. The lack of substantial updates and new content has left the game feeling stagnant. The potential for more immersive storylines, engaging missions, and innovative features seems to have been overlooked.

Despite this, the game still offers a lot to its players. The freedom to explore the vast open world, engage in various activities, and interact with other players provides endless hours of entertainment. The game’s complex character customization and progression system also adds depth to the gameplay, allowing players to truly make their characters their own.

In conclusion, while Red Dead Online may feel like a beautiful world that’s been left behind, it still holds a lot of charm. It’s a game that offers a unique and immersive experience, and despite its shortcomings, it’s definitely worth exploring. Here’s hoping the developers will breathe new life into this beautiful world in the future. 🤠",1708748123,1708748123,True,2,0,0.548872172832489014,0,True,False,False

Despite it saying red dead online, I ended up playing red dead 2 on the launcher. My initial thoughts back in 2020 of this game were horrible, as I was a sweaty no life fortnite loser who couldn't appreciate games. I revisited rdr2 recently, and I completely replayed the game. I even got the high honor ending (the better one). The game was nothing short of an extreme masterpiece. The vast world that rdr2 was able to captivate, along with the world that rockstar created for us is breathtaking. The fact that this game that released in 2018 looks better than most recent games is proof that rockstar is a magical gaming company. This video game is a masterpiece, and a 10/10 overall. The story is amazing, the visuals are amazing, there's plenty of missions and dialogue to go through so you never get bored, and even the epilogue was one of the best parts of the game. Playing as Arthur was a magical journey, and he is currently my 2nd favorite protagonist oat. Rdr2 is a game every gamer should try, even if you don't like story games. If you don't have the time, watch a playthrough with 0 commentary. No matter what, you should play this game or at least consume the media thrown at you.",1707789486,1707789486,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Stunning world: Rockstar's meticulous attention to detail shines through, creating a visually breathtaking and atmospheric world to explore.
Deep character customization: Craft your unique outlaw with extensive character creation options, including clothing, physical features, and even morals.
Variety of activities: From classic cowboy pursuits like hunting and fishing to story missions, robberies, and showdowns, there's always something to do.
Evolving world: Rockstar regularly adds new content, missions, roles, and gameplay features, keeping the experience fresh.
Poignant world-building: While primarily focused on action, the game touches on themes of morality, societal change, and the fading frontier, adding depth to the experience.
Cons:

Grindy progression: Earning money and experience can feel slow, especially early on, hindering access to desired items and roles.
Microtransactions: While not pay-to-win, microtransactions for gold bars can accelerate progress, potentially creating an uneven playing field.
Griefer issues: Open-world PvP can sometimes lead to frustrating encounters with disruptive players, although defensive measures are available.
Technical hiccups: Occasional bugs and connection issues can disrupt the gameplay experience.
Content gaps: While updates are regular, there can be periods with less frequent content drops, leading to a feeling of stagnation.
Overall:

Red Dead Online offers a unique and captivating online experience in a meticulously crafted world. However, the significant grind, potential for disruptive players, and occasional technical issues can be drawbacks. If you're patient, enjoy exploring a vast and detailed world, and can manage expectations, Red Dead Online can be a rewarding and immersive experience.

but besides this and the gunplay I sadly can't recommend this game to anyone because even though Rockstar is taking steps of actually updating the game again yet they still fail of putting any form (or lacking there) of anti cheat or completely changing the servers from peer to peer.

I'm not going to get into details because it's been said over a 1000 times by this point but to make it short it's running rampant with cheaters and script kiddies and hackers to make the gameplay experience miserable to any new player who bought the game without taking a look in the reviews section for this game or just any normal player in general.

Even though there are ways around it like for windows users you can use something called RDO lobby manager which pretty much creates a private server while still appearing online or if your a Linux user or prefer to play this game on a steam deck like me unless your a wizard of how to run a .exe program with command prompts it won't work but it is however possible to still play by yourself or with friends without needing rdo lobby manager.

Thankfully for me I knew what I was getting myself into when I picked up this game from a discount and found out a way how to play just by myself, I might however might give public a try one day but I doubt I will until take 2 interactive and Rockstar can actually fix thier game!

Both of these companies should be embarrassed that despite all they did for gta 5 online that players yet still consider this game of getting the """"labor of love"""" award over that wether it's intentional to get them notice (which it has) or not.",1707640006,1707693606,False,4,1,0.515923559665679932,0,True,False,False

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2915561463

[b] What is Red Dead Redemption? [/b]

Rdr2 is a open world (story or online) game. In the story mode you play as a interesting man called Arthur Morgan and you go around trying to help your gang while meeting new friends on the way and adventuring through the gorgeous open world. There is plenty of things you can do whether it is through the story mode or the online mode. Online is a little different then the story however, and you can meet other players in the game and talk to them through the open mic feature. There are many different types of enemies in the game (in online that can be other players). There is bounty hunting, horse taming, stealing, animal hunting and much more within this rich story line. This game is also based in 1899 if I remember correctly, so, no telephones have even been invented yet. 

[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]

-""What a beautiful open world, wheres my horse I want my horse.""
-""Can I kill this lady? WHOOPS, OH GOD, RUNN""
-""OH GOD OH NO WHY ME WHYY""

[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]

This game seems pretty beginner player ready, though online is not as friendly and a lot of murder does happen. The only thing is I never really understood the controls to well, they can be a bit confusing at first and you may need to check your keyboard or controller binds. Yes this game is controller compatible so that is always a nice addition to this game as well. There is a map that helps you navigate your way though if you want, you can just wing it and figure it out on the way.

[b] Game Play: [/b]

Once you get the hang of the controls you can kind of understand whats happening and how to work the game. There is loads of character customization and you can continue to edit your character throughout the game. In story mode though you cannot edit the character himself, you can only pick and choose what clothes you decide to wear on the character. This game has the option to have either a first person or third person view of your character, I favour the third person view a lot more then the first person because the first person view gives me motion sickness. They have many different features you can unlock throughout the game's story and you do the objectives of whichever NPC in order to get paid and progress further in the game. This goes for both online and the story mode. The story has more content then online does, however online has more player with player and PVP options that make it more interesting. Everyone plays this game differently, and its up to you how you want to make your adventure and what ending you will get. 

[b] Graphics: [/b]

This games graphics are absolutely gorgeous, though as of recently I have been noticing that a lot of them have been broken. My map, horse textures and skin textures have all been breaking. Which is probably because Rockstar has been working on other games as of recently. But I did notice a patch update so I hope that helps fix some of the problems. This game has some of the most realistic graphics and world textures I have ever seen, and it makes me appreciate them a lot even though sometimes they break. For some people I would recommend turning down the graphics as they can be super heavy on your gaming device. Sometimes my computer breaths like a air turbine even though I try to keep my graphics on medium. Thankfully my computer still doesn't lag and doesn't get too hot. There have been games that have pushed my PC further then this. 

[b] Community: [/b]

The community is a mic of, crazy people, role players, bounty hunters and toxic players. After a certain level however I have noticed that they aren't as intense. Some of the toxic players (which are not as common as they are in say, CSGO) do make very inappropriate and some times too far jokes. However the large majority of the community are pretty hilarious and I have met some absolutely AMAZING people on here. Some in which are going to read this review and tell me how cringe I am. The other people you have to look out for on this game are the modders, some are awesome. I am friends with some of them! As for others... They are extremely toxic and irritable. Though usually if you switch servers when you see flaming horse feet, you are pretty okay to avoid them all together. But again, the large majority of them are amazing people and are willing to help you out if you need and offer you some good laughs. 

[b] How long can you play? [/b]

The game's playability depends on how much you like it. I am only 5 hours into the story mode and I am still at the beginning of it, so if you are here for the story it is 1000% worth it and you can play it for hours on end. As for online, if you are only there for the content and not for the players then you will be able to have quite a while to play and sometimes it can be a bit slow paced. But if you are there to play with other people, you will end up like me and have quite a bit of time in the game because you want to hang out with your friends and be absolutely psychotic.

[b] My Opinion: [/b]

Overall I recommend this game if you enjoy story games (for the single player story mode option) or if you really enjoy hanging out with your friends and being forces of nature. I would also say if you enjoy just strolling around a beautiful world on horse back, this could be an enjoyable game for you.

Also I keep trying to fast travel, it charges me, the game crashes, and I keep getting back to where I started. The camp is always changing places even though you pay to have it in a certain point. The basic things in this game don't work. Very sad :/

EDIT: 
I have been playing more by using a personal server, not ideal but it definitely works better... still very buggy, and for some reason, the only way I seem to be able to keep my camp in a determined location is by creating a posse and sharing it with them.

I must add that this is definitely not optimized for PC and it{s painful to play it without a controller. I keep closing and opening other things by accident while playing.",1705779748,1706760893,False,2,0,0.500561654567718506,0,True,False,False

For most people, you cannot play for more than 10-15mins before being kicked or crashed by one of the many cheaters/modders that plague this game. Sometimes you'll play for a little longer, sometimes you'll get crashed within the first 30 seconds.
Don't get me wrong, the game has been very fun and relaxing in the past. But that's not what it's like now. Whenever you load up the game, there will be at least 2 or 3 cheaters/modders in every lobby. They will crash you, they will spawn stuff on/around you, they will make the game unstable. It's like trying to play Garry's Mod, but it's set over 100 years ago.
Red Dead Redemption2/Online will go down in history as the most expensive abandoning of a game, you can bet your sweet dollar that Rockstar has gone and is not coming back. 
I have enough hours in this game to tell you that it used to be good, but as a warning to any new players, don't buy it. Not until Rockstar fixes this horrendous problem of cheaters and unstable servers, if that ever happens.",1706527703,1706527703,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have a very high level character on Xbox with basically everything unlocked, but I was looking for a good PC game to play with my friend. We couldn't figure out anything to play that was any good that we hadn't done already. But then I noticed this was 10 bucks on Steam. I just shrugged and asked ""Red Dead Online?"", and when he texted me back he already downloaded it. Wasn't really too excited, but hey, I had already had thousands of hours of fun on it on Xbox, so why not? I bought it too after he told me he got it. As you might be able to tell, I haven't worked in awhile LOL... 112 Hours at the time of this review, and it hasn't even been two weeks LMAO.... I'm freaking addicted. I played over 30 hours in one session. Haha... This shiz is just so much fun. I'm level 45 on PC now and I only just recently purchased the game. It's the best co-op experience, the most fun gunplay, crazy good immersion, addicting repeatable missions, and a super slow burn as far as leveling up and gaining things - which I LOVE in a game as long as it is fun to play. There is just so much to do... Fishing, hunting, bounties, story missions, PVP, Running a Moonshine business.... The list goes on and on... Sometimes I like to role-play as a serial killer, and stealthily murder people in towns at night. You can get into slap fights in your moonshine bar. You can rope somebody and hogtie them and then they are at your mercy. Stab em to death, burn em alive, throw em in the water and feed em to the gators... Haha.... Just ridiculously well made! The MINOR TINY bugs compared to other games are so rare they are basically non-existent. The graphics are MINDBLOWING. The gunplay is weighty and realistic. If you don't like this game, then you most likely have had some issues with griefers and modders. I can't really divulge any information for you, but if you really want to avoid them - Google is your friend. ;) Can I just say that 10 bucks is a freaking steal for such a great game? :D",1706001416,1706002106,True,1,0,0.511464953422546387,0,True,False,False

It's honestly a great game to have fun with friends or solo. It's like GTA 5, has many things you can do to pass the time. From trading, specialties, tasks, missions, racing, horseback riding in the wilderness, hunting wild animals (including legendary), Meeting other players, crazy npc and random moments. It's really a good lay out and I've enjoyed it. The only THING I WOULD RECOMMEND is get the file that allows you to play solo or with friends. The actual servers have hackers and some are mean as hell. They will want to make you rage quit the game. Get the file, add it to your data folders and play peacefully. Unless you like chaos then have at it. I've enjoyed the game with the ultimate edition and also play the storyline of Arthur Morgan. The humor in this game is great too. I'm also an author of fanfictions so it's helping create an adventure in a novel (Which will be posted on Wattpad one day). 

Great game, good graphics, Beautiful landscape. A good look at the world before the modern society.

I can't in good conscience recommend the online mode to anyone while it's in its current state. Back in 2020, perhaps even early 2023, I did, but not now!

Modders have made RDO almost impossible to enjoy.

It used to be just having to change servers once modders would drop several bears or cougars on me, I could get away from them for a time and still enjoy the game. Now, they'll track you down and blow you/your horse up, they'll make your game crash, and even if you were to avoid towns and just focus on roles for the leisure of it they've enabled some kind of coding that gives you an infinitely looping loading screen!

There's almost no one else in these servers except griefers and cheaters, it's not a fun experience anymore.

I'm at the point now where I'm thinking about uninstalling RDO and sticking exclusively to the main game until something is done to stop this. 

Rockstar has pretty much abandoned this feature and it shows, and it's VERY ugly.

I won't ever buy another Rockstar game unless it's proven for a fact that they've learned from this disaster and decided to get their act together and promise to place and maintain firm protections in future titles.

Please, do yourself a favor and avoid playing online for the time being, it'll save you a massive headache and disappointment. There isn't even much of a chance to grind now.

I really wish I could give a neutral recommendation for this review, since it's not the quality of the game I'm really basing this on, it's the user base and the in-game price inflation. But, oh well.


I already enjoyed playing RDR2 on console and was thrilled to be able to play with some of my PC friends.

It's a beautiful, tranquil, and immersive experience. I really play it just to ride a cool horse, go fishing, and cook over a campfire. 

Until I came to realize that Rockstar has little to no protective measures in place to sieve out the irritating players from the casual ones. 

I do enjoy playing online, don't get me wrong, but there are a number of issues that interfere with the quality of gameplay and I strongly suggest that you buy this game on discount ($20? No, and you'll understand why in just a moment) AND be sure to either have higher level friends help you get through the first fourteen rank levels to unlock basic gear such as the fishing rod, or, get lucky and find nice players at random to join up with.

This is NOT a game you will want to play on your own on PC, cheaters have more free reign here than ever before on console, so things will be a bit messy for starters.


Some things you can expect when booting up the game includes:

*Hackers have found ways to make online a slog by either spawning deadly animals on top of players or creating spontaneous explosions that disrupt gameplay. In either case, players often need to exit to menu and log back in to change servers and enjoy the game without hiccups. Rockstar has no protections in place to prevent cheating of this sort, just as a warning.

*Griefers apparently have nothing better to do once they reach max level and unlock all features of the game; they have no problems hunting players down and ruining a good time regardless if you're simply wandering in free roam or taking part in a friendly competition. Even worse, if you were to try and report them Rockstar will do nothing - no temp. bans, not switching the servers for you, nothing.
But, hey, most of them don't even speak so you usually won't have to worry about age-old slurs being lobbed your way. Yay? I guess when your character dies you can opt to Parley and give yourself ten minutes of invincibility, boring the trolls just long enough for them to turn around and find someone else to bully. So, there is that as a saving grace, sort of.

*Micro-transactions are a big part of online mode; either you pay real-world cash for in-game gold bars to buy stuff more easily (5 gold bars versus $500 for a shirt. I am serious here.) or you can grind. And grind. And grind, oh, did I mention that you gotta pay 15 gold bars for almost all the major career options in the game before you can get started on ranking up and collecting rewards? (Bounty Hunter, Collector, Moonshiner..cool sounding jobs, right? Well, you better get that gold first so you can buy the licenses/kit bags!) I hate micro-transactions as a principle since that is a very slick slope into financial anxiety. 

While this game is beautiful and usually enjoyable, when I can get those moments of peace, it leaves one wondering if it's even worth playing if it's so easy to get blown up, shot at, get turned into a rag doll, lose your hard-earned profits while traveling with your Trader cart as it gets blown to pieces...

You can grow to like RDR online, but do NOT take it seriously, and play in short bursts if possible.
And don't give Rockstar any more of your money than they deserve. Don't buy the gold bars. Ever.",1638266131,1705713090,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[u] The main game is amazing, but RDR2 Online is a cesspool of hackers and bugs. [/u]

- RP is extremely limited due to the state of the game
- Griefing is encouraged via Daily Challenges & new players don't stand a chance
- Constant Crashes & Insanely Long Load Times
- In-game Economy is Garbage $150 for a hat +$1000 for a pouch
- Trade & Moonshine Runs fail during Loading wasting invested Time and Mats
- Reporting Hackers does Nothing, [b] the game is no longer monitored! [/b]

[b] - Unchecked Hackers with God-Mode [/b]
 - Hackers can add the Rockstar Admin logo to their names
 - Hackers spawn infinite money, gold & gear bypassing level restrictions
 - Hackers set their level, hostility, and status to whatever they want
 - Hackers teleport anywhere they want on the map
 - Hackers can teleport everyone on a server to one spot, to be slaughtered
 - Hackers send self-guided explosive barrels that land on your head
 - Hackers spawn 50 hostile animal around you, just for LoLs
 - Hackers summon UFOs with death rays in a western game
 - Hackers turn random NPCs & Animals into flame throwers
 - Hackers kill Quest Givers & NPC needed for Quests for hours at a time
 - Hackers ignore Parley and Camp No-PvP Flags 
 - Some hackers have found a way to pirate Steam account through the game. [i] (When you accept gold, killing a spawn, or harvesting a spawned corpse) [/i] You are literally risking your account and payment information by playing RDR2 Online.

The abandon nature of this game, the countless security holes, and game destroying bugs are both an embarrassment & reflection on the management within Rockstar Games.

Howdy, fellow virtual cowpokes! Get ready for a rollercoaster ride through the pixelated plains of Red Dead Redemption 2 Online – a game where the wild west is filled with laughter, tears, and more cheaters than a crooked poker game in a dusty saloon.

Let me paint you a bleak picture of the frontier: you're saddling up with your posse, ready to ride into the sunset for an epic cattle rustlin' adventure. But hold your horses! There's always that one varmint who thinks he's the quickdraw sheriff of the server, armed with hacks that'd make a snake oil salesman blush. I reckon the good folks at Rockstar Games might want to reconsider calling it a ""Red Dead Redemption"" and instead name it ""Red Dead Respawn.""

Now, if you enjoy a good ol' fashioned round of disconnection roulette, then Red Dead Online is the place for you! Every ten minutes, like clockwork, the game closes faster than a saloon door in a sandstorm. It's like trying to build a house of cards in a tornado – frustrating, futile, and downright infuriating.

Imagine this: you're about to complete a mission, pockets full of loot, and the thrill of victory within reach. But suddenly, the screen goes black, and you find yourself staring at your desktop like a bewildered tumbleweed. It's a true test of patience, my friends, and let me tell ya, it's more difficult than trying to lasso a greased pig at the county fair.

In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is a virtual wasteland where the only constant is the relentless onslaught of cheaters and the game's uncanny ability to crash faster than a lead balloon. So, saddle up if you dare, but be prepared for a frustrating journey through a wild west that's less ""rootin' tootin'"" and more ""Ctrl+Alt+Delete."" Yeehaw, and may your disconnects be swift and merciful.

I'm sure there are a lot of good reasons to play this game (you can easily read up anywhere) but here are a few things to keep in mind though:
The economy in online is not the greatest, I suppose that's a way for people to grind missions and play a lot more. E.g. horses will understandably be expensive, but things like accessories, clothes and low-level guns are too expensive given how much you earn in missions.

There's a weird system where you gain more XP, Money and (sometimes) Gold if you take longer to complete missions. A lot of the time (even when playing solo) these missions only take 5 minutes max to complete, including travelling time, yet a timer of 15-20 mins is given.
You just end up running the time to the last minute, spending 10-15 mins foraging, hunting or collecting etc. Just to earn you the extra RDO$10 and 0.2 Gold Bars, 

There are a number of activities to do in Free Roam and more game modes available with friends, however they can become very repetitive and even boring if you've done them multiple times already.

Unfortunately, as of now, Rockstar are no longer adding any DLCs or updates to the game.

I would love to give this game a positive review and a thumbs up but I can not in good conscience do so, so here are the events that led to this negative review, enjoy. 

I boot up the game,
I spawn in,
I call my horse,
I stow my weapons,
I look at the days challenges,
I see that there is one for skinning four coyotes,
There are three coyotes in front of me, lucky me,
I kill two with the third coyote escaping,
I ride over by the pelts,
I skin one of them and stow the pelt on my horse,
Me and my horse are blown up,
During my respawn time I look at the players in the session,
There is a level 333 player with every letter of their name a different color,
I click on their RS name and I block them as I do with all cheaters,
Their RS name does not match their in game name (common cheater thing they do),
I spawn in and blow up again,
This time it lets me press charges against rainbow name doesn't match 333 person,
I ask them for a feud,
I spawn in my game crashes and I must restart my PC.

I've played RDR2O for over 671 hours and my opinion of the game is based solely on the Online as I've never played the Story Mode, I love this game in fact the only game that is better in my book is a whole series of games and even then it is very close, I'm level 198 with again over 671 hours the fact that I've suffered through this game simply because I love it shows just how good of a game it is and how good it could be if RS would simply do anything at all to stop the cheaters, now for the third time I've played over 671 hours of this game and in all that time the longest I've ever gone without running into a cheater was maybe, maybe one hour most times its within twenty to thirty minutes at best and at worst go back and read the first part of this review again.

There is also a difficulty Curve for players using a Keyboard and players using a Controller as Controller users can lock onto enemies, animals and other players this means that players on Keyboard are at a great disadvantage as they need to be far better skilled with aiming then their Controller counterparts, I'll note that players on Controllers still show a great deal of personal skill but that Keyboard users are not given any assistance or at the very least very, very little assistance if any, in the end this means that I as a Keyboard user must be faster and more accurate then a Controller user if I am ever going to win a PVP encounter. 

RS has also been banning people that haven't done anything while somehow still missing the people flying around as 20 foot hawks so that's fun, RS doesn't care about anything but Money.

I want to give this game a positive review but I simply can not the game is broken not because of bad code or a game ending bug but because RS does not give a single solitary thought about the players that play and love their game, RS sits back and watches as cheaters destroy their game, and that's before you look at the fact that the cheaters are even stealing In Game Gold which could be considered real world money destroying the games economy for other real players, then there's the time that they waste from the real players I'd wager that about 100 of those over 671 hours was spent running from session to session so i can actually play the game, in all you've got a broken game so do not buy this game unless you are willing to suffer through the cheaters and trust me you will suffer at their hands time and time again until RS does something about it, RS please do something do anything please do anything and help us real players, and when you do I'll be overjoyed to change this review to what the game should be getting.

So in closing you must be asking yourself ""Is it worth it?""
ArchAngelLnK: ""Oh yeah, it's worth it... If you're strong enough.'

Red Dead Online, the multiplayer component of Red Dead Redemption 2 developed by Rockstar Games, offers a vast and immersive multiplayer experience set in the sweeping landscapes of the American Wild West.

Strengths:

Expansive Open World: Just like its single-player counterpart, Red Dead Online presents players with a breathtaking open-world to explore. From the bustling towns to the serene wilderness, the attention to detail creates an atmospheric and living frontier.

Dynamic Activities: The game features a variety of dynamic activities, from intense shootouts to more leisurely pastimes like poker or fishing. This diversity allows players to shape their own experiences and engage in activities that suit their playstyle.

Robust Character Customization: Red Dead Online offers a robust character creation system, allowing players to tailor their avatars to their liking. The ability to acquire new outfits, gear, and customize your horse enhances the personalization aspect.

Weaknesses:

Economic Balancing: Some players have raised concerns about the in-game economy, suggesting that certain items and upgrades may require a significant time investment. Finding the right balance between progression and accessibility could enhance the overall experience.

Occasional Technical Issues: Like many online games, Red Dead Online is not immune to occasional technical hiccups, such as server disruptions or bugs. While Rockstar continues to address these issues, they can temporarily impact gameplay.

Engaging Multiplayer Features:

Posse Dynamics: The posse system encourages cooperative play, allowing friends or other players to form groups and tackle challenges together, adding a layer of camaraderie to the Wild West experience.

Role-Playing Elements: The introduction of roles, such as Bounty Hunter or Trader, adds depth to the multiplayer experience. Players can specialize in different roles, each offering unique missions and rewards, contributing to the overall depth of the game.

Conclusion:

Red Dead Online successfully extends the captivating world of Red Dead Redemption 2 into the multiplayer realm. With its vast open world, dynamic activities, and engaging multiplayer features, it provides an immersive Wild West experience that continues to evolve.

Clearly they don't prioritize their PC releases, but this game and GTA online on PC are downright unsafe to play. Your account is legitimately at risk of being taken over by a hacker, and yeah this is possible in other games, but the problem is so bad in RDO that you cannot find a single lobby without a modder. A lot of players resort to playing in glitched private sessions, but that kind of defeats the whole purpose. 

Otherwise, it's an unfinished and unsupported multiplayer mode that should only be bought if you're really into the old western theme. If you're not, it can be incredibly boring and seem like there's no real point to any of it, other than a pointless role grind to unlock clothing and weapon skins. My character is over 100 levels and there's nothing more for me to do that is enjoyable. I've completed all of the roles, grinded collector for thousands of dollars, got most of the trapper clothing items and have done every heist. (my playtime on steam doesn't reflect that, most of my time was spent on the Rockstar games launcher client.) It was a little better when they had an active battlepass-type system, which allowed you to even earn back the currency you used to buy into it. They don't do that anymore. In fact, this game is lucky to receive any updates at all anymore.

Runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck, with some minor graphical errors noticed. Overall, looks great and performance is decent.

First of all, the graphics are stunning. The details of the open world are mind-blowing, from the landscapes to the smallest details like the way the horses move. It truly feels like you are in the Wild West. The attention to detail is impeccable, just like in any other Rockstar game.

The gameplay is smooth and immersive. The missions and activities available in Red Dead Online are diverse and keep you entertained. From hunting and fishing to robbing trains and completing story missions, there is always something to do. And the best part is, you can do all of this with your friends. The online aspect adds a whole new level of fun to the game.

The character customization is also impressive. You can create a unique character with different hairstyles, clothing, and accessories. There are also different abilities to choose from, which adds a strategic element to the game.

One of the best things about Red Dead Online is the open-world PVP. It is intense and exciting, especially when you team up with your friends to take down other players. The online community is also friendly and welcoming, which adds to the overall experience.

However, the game is not without its flaws. The economy can be a little unbalanced, making it difficult to earn money and purchase items. But I believe Rockstar will address this issue in future updates.

In conclusion, Red Dead Online is a solid game that offers a vast, immersive open world, fun gameplay, and an active online community. It is the perfect game to play while waiting for GTA VI, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys open-world games. I cannot wait to see what Rockstar has in store for us in the future.",1704818946,1704818946,True,8,1,0.515643537044525146,5,True,False,False

friends with high end pcs can't even launch the game 90% of the time because having a cpu that's too good apparently makes the DRM fail to validate so the game thinks you're not signed in even though you saw social club pop up and everything, only fix is to supposedly raise cpu usage but now that doesn't even work for me on my bare minimum 8 year old rig. so eventually, you're pretty much garunteed to get to a point where to have to try launching the game 200 times and just hope it works because there is ABSOLUTELY no fix for it despite the problem being well known for YEARS, not even users could find an actual fix

I gave this the good old college try. love the single player, at least I did on ps4 but I have never regretted a purchase more than when I decided to buy the online on pc to play with my pc friends. this game is a fucking scam, I swear it's just rockstar trolling people. I didn't expect much, I heard the online was barebones, I just wanted some basic cowboy rabble rousing with my pc bros, but we can't even play the actual game, I got this for 10$ and I regret it more than if I had spent that on some indie game that ended up being abandoned.

can't even refund because time spent trying to launch the game added up to 2 hours before I even got to actually play it.

once it actually launches, and you get into a private server with your friends, assuming they can all launch it too, it isn't terrible. fun to just go around doing missions and hunting. but not worth the trouble at all.",1704608329,1704608329,False,12,0,0.601195752620697021,0,True,False,False

After playing about 40-50 hours of red dead online, i manage too make some gold, tier good weapons, high character stat and extra, i am gonna rereview this game and i am gonna give it a 7/10 for now its fun after playing and getting loots in game and it would be better if you don't get crash after 10 min or getting smoked by a UFO in middle of western world (talking about people who use mod menus). It would be fun for you if you like some solo game but i rather play games with friends.
after all i will like to continue playing it and i will recommend you guys give this game a try.",1704402707,1704565651,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Firstly, Rockstar is very aware of the incredulous issues with this game and have done absolutely [i] nothing [/i] about it since its inception. As a matter of fact, in early [i] 2022, [/i] they had given up entirely on supporting Online, being generous enough to leave it running to continue sales, but there's no love for the community in this regard. For example, there are hackers who bypass the PvE option -- which itself is VERY poorly implemented and turns off automatically -- hackers who have you explode the second you log-in and with every spawn, forcing you to quit the game; and the list goes on and on. Any bug that is present will remain. 

There's no doubt that Rockstar is one of the best developers, with one fantastic hit after another, and do put an enormous amount of love into their games -- probably due to crunch -- and [i] Red Dead Redemption 2 [/i] being one of the best games in years, but the general disregard for PC players with every title and their online components shouldn't be excused.

The ""Labour of Love"" that Steam has just awarded them is an insult to the actual nominees and should immediately be [i] revoked. [/i] The fact that it qualified in the first place is utterly baffling and should have been blacklisted from voting. The votes themselves were [i] satire [/i] and has made a laughing stock of the voters.

Red Dead Online has been absolutely dead in the water for over two years. There are no updates, there are no fixes, it is complete radio silence and abandonware.

It is a tossup and a gamble whether any event will just be crashed by some wannabe comedian playing dropbears on everybody involved, and they have all powers, including being able to ban you nearly at will. 

The idea that anything involving RDR2 or RDO at this point in the good year 2024 is a labor of any amount of ongoing love is a face, ridiculous, and I wish a temporary but excessively annoying and itchy rash upon the sensitive regions of the people who believe otherwise.

However fast forward to the PC release and the last ""real"" update the game got and I cant say in good conscience to buy this game. Rockstar has completely abandoned this game a couple of years ago and especially today the game is overrun by a load of glitches, cheaters literally everywhere, and a myriad of server problems. We had some really good updates over the years but now there is no reason to play and even if your like me and just want to experience what is already there you can't. I do not over exaggerate when I say that Red Dead Online is completely UNPLAYABLE, missions don't start no matter how many times you reset or change sessions, ALL PVP MODES are impossible to play with rampant cheaters everywhere, the game crashes all the damn time, micro transactions are way too pay to win and can be used to bypass almost all forms of progression, and if that wasn't bad enough there is no solo sessions that I could find to circumvent some of these issues. Don't buy this game, and to Rockstar I am unbelievably disappointed and fairly angry that you let something this near and dear to my heart be turned into this garbage. If you really cared about your players you would do the bare minimum and fix the problems that this game has (cheaters, bots, glitches, bugs, server problems, stability, etc) and let players experience what is already here until the sun sets on this game.

The in-game mechanics aren't much better. The honor system is stupid; you can undo every town you shoot up by petting your horse, and everything nice either costs gold or is at least $100 (not to mention the rank system).

Not only that they will also try to bait you into looting spawned boxes in front of your character to get modded money so you yourself could get banned.

There is no way to escape the hackers/modders.  Some have even made it into a phased mission to ruin the game for you even further.  Some hackers/modders have a system set up that when you report them you are kicked from the game when sending in the report.

At this point, beginning to wonder if Rockstar Games will ever do something to beef up their security.

RDO PC has been overrun by ""hackers"" and script players, making it often unplayable. 

In the short time I've played RDO I've seen every manner of ""hacked"" madness you can imagine (players spawned as UFOs, sharks with shotgun mouths just blasting innocent players, swarms of legendary creatures in town, entire constructed buildings/stage sets, ""purge"" npcs who attack on sight, forcing you to fight for your life thus earning a bounty for murder, etc etc)

had my moonshine shack hacked so that I blew up the moment I stepped out of the bar

had my name hacked so that there were two copies of me in a lobby, while the other ""me"" killed & blew up every player in sight (I'm expecting a ban for that anytime, I'm sure they will ban me and not whoever did it) 

on top of all of this, if a lobby is ""hacked"" the stables won't work, the moonshine shack won't work, missions wont load properly, etc so you're often forced to reload to find a good lobby, and the game crashes constantly, too. 

and now Rockstar is banning innocent accounts while these blockheads run rampant and continue to make the game a nightmare for the rest of us. I paid for the game and have bought gold for the game and would continue to do so if I thought it was worth the investment, but this is a sh*tshow and Rockstar is a joke for how they're (not) handling it.

edit: the crashes are not due to system requirements

windows 10
ryzen 5 cpu
36gb ddr3 ram
rtx 4060 8gb ddr4

second edit: as my playtime is likely to suggest, none of this is enough to stop me playing the game 😅 so take that as you will, of course!

I recently purchased this game with high hopes for an immersive gaming experience, but unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. The game constantly crashes, making it nearly unplayable, and what's more disheartening is the apparent lack of effort from Rockstar Games to address this critical issue.

From the moment I launched the game, I encountered frequent crashes that disrupted the flow of gameplay. These crashes occur at random intervals, and it seems that Rockstar Games has turned a blind eye to the countless complaints flooding their forums and support channels. This lack of responsiveness from the game developer is not only frustrating but also raises serious concerns about their commitment to delivering a polished product.

I have attempted various troubleshooting steps, including updating drivers and verifying game files, but none have provided a lasting solution. It's disconcerting to see a company of Rockstar's caliber releasing a game with such glaring technical issues and then failing to provide timely fixes.

The absence of communication and updates regarding the persistent crashing problems leaves customers in the dark and creates",1703505201,1703505201,False,6,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Set against the backdrop of the dying Wild West, this game is a cinematic marvel. The graphics are a testament to the craft of the developers, painting landscapes that are as breathtaking as they are hauntingly beautiful. From the sprawling plains to the rugged mountains, every inch of this meticulously crafted world feels authentic and alive.

But it’s not just about the visuals; it's the depth of the narrative that truly captivates. You step into the worn boots of Arthur Morgan, a complex protagonist navigating a changing world. The characters around you feel real, each with their own stories and motivations that interweave to create a rich tapestry of emotions and experiences.

The level of immersion is unparalleled. Whether you're hunting legendary animals, engaging in intense gunfights, or simply bonding with your trusty steed, every moment feels purposeful and contributes to the larger, immersive experience.

Moreover, the attention to detail extends beyond the main storyline. The dynamic ecosystem, the changing weather, and the interactions with the world around you create an environment that responds to your actions, making every decision impactful and shaping your own unique journey through this unforgiving yet captivating world.

In essence, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of gaming. It's not just a game; it's an epic odyssey that invites you to lose yourself in its vastness, to explore its intricacies, and to experience a world that will linger in your thoughts long after you've put down the controller.",1703296572,1703296572,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I know your brain might be as slow as a three-legged mule, but let me spell it out for you: Red Dead Online is the best thing since sliced bread, and if you can't see that, you're dumber than a bag of hammers. Now, unlike your feeble intellect, Red Dead Online has more depth than a puddle after a drizzle. It's got everything – from stunning landscapes that probably make your simple mind implode to missions that require more strategic thinking than a game of checkers with a toddler.

But let's not forget the real kicker, boah. The online community is thriving, unlike your social life. You can team up with other players, form posses, and maybe, just maybe, experience a sense of camaraderie you've never felt before. But hey, if that's too much for your tiny brain to handle, stick to playing with your imaginary friends.

Red Dead Online is a masterpiece, and if you can't appreciate it, you're probably the type who thinks a tumbleweed is a sophisticated form of entertainment.

There's a way to get away from public servers completely as long as you want, nexus RDO lobby manager allows you to play in your own private server, also allowing access to anyone that knows the server name and password which you can set by yourself and cheaters can't get the information of it. They simply get blocked and this program isn't a cheat or doesn't change anything about the game to get you banned, you will be completely safe both from cheaters and from rockstar, it also allows you to do your businesses without getting griefed by a cheater.

The story and the game itself is playable without the player combat, considering you don't crash into desktop without an error because of an update they brought without testing it.

The reason why i don't recommend this game is because it's both unbalanced and it's full of cheaters, a high level player will have every damage reduction cards unlocked and you will deal less damage to them while they're dealing much more damage to you, they will have much more health and with cards they have 3 times or more the amount of effective health you will have while starting, cards are passive abilities which you pay to unlock using in game currency and you have to upgrade them by earning exp while equipped which increases the stats they give, a game like this should be balanced by weapon stats and such rather than rewarding time played. This game doesn't care about how good your skills are or the weapons you are using, it cares about how much time have you played it and rewards you depending on how much time you waste.

To simply put, player combat in this game sucks, oh have i mentioned the auto aim dead eye skill also is in online game, which means you don't even need skill to kill the other player, incendiary bullets makes the enemy not be able to aim and become a walking target, this game's player combat is a joke, huge joke, more than half of the community wouldn't be able to kill the skillful players ever again if they didn't have such unbalanced items but the game is abandoned by rockstar and despite being a game with player combat in mind they didn't really think about the unfair advantages.

Compared to GTA this game has both more cheaters and griefers and is unbalanced, also you have no way of fighting back because this game doesn't care if you're skilled or not with aiming, i rarely use the dead eye and mostly it's in AI combat when i feel too tired. In my opinion player combat is necessary to enjoy the game and gives the game a unique feel, that's of course when you meet the other player on equal grounds or rather close enough to equal, i'm not a player which goes around and seeks to combat someone randomly as it's the equivalent of being an asshat and likely griefing. I will fight you if you're a red dot on the map, i will fight you if you're interrupting my business, i will fight you if you have a bounty on your head that's high enough for me to care to waste a bullet which is very rare as most of the players don't have a bounty higher than 4$ even which is not even high enough for me to care about it, i'll care about it if it's maybe about 10$ or more and that's rare as no one likes having a bounty due to many griefers who will keep them tied or kill them over and over again, aside from these i will never be fighting you, not all players can be the same but there should be a balance that the other player has a chance of fighting back instead of getting griefed because of the unfair unbalanced disadvantages of playing the game less than the other player who's griefing them.",1703103979,1703105295,False,9,0,0.5680580735206604,0,True,False,False

compare to the canon RDR II, RDO got everything from its main game, the graphics, the NPC, the world, and environment. it's just sad that RDO lack of updates unlike its cousin GTAO that R* cared and loved, as if RDR II (RDO) is a damn child born just for the sake of the story telling and the linearity missions.

overall, I personally enjoyed it, I don't think I could recommend this RDO, just get RDR II and you will get both storyline and online. which is awesome.",1702828231,1702828231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really want to like this game, and honestly i do like it, but i don't like what rockstar has done with it in recent years. We haven't gotten a major update in 2 years now, and rockstar uses the ""excuse"" that they are transfering all their resources over to developing GTA 6.

But guess what? GTA online gets updates and new storyline missions/heists virtually every month, despite it being a game that's over ten years old.  Meanwhile Red dead online doesn't even have basic matchmaking for telegram missions, you have to manually create a posse and invite people on the server in the hopes of them joining you. (you get a limited amount of invites too that refresh after a couple of minutes) There's no text chat unlike in GTA online, so most people don't even know what you're inviting them to your posse for.

As if that all wasn't bad enough, the game is outright infested with Chinese players who all have mod menus and will grief everyone they find. I would say around 75% of the playerbase is chinese currently and without fail they almost all will use mod menus just to blow you up and use godmode in competitive game modes. Rockstar doesn't even acknowledge that these players exist and just like with GTA online, rockstar has completely given up on punishing hackers/mod menu users.

At the bottom of it all is a good game that has been utterly failed by Rockstar as a company and it's been torn to scraps by Chinese ""players"" who aren't good enough at the game in the first place so they rely on mod menus to compensate for their lack of skill and intelligence. The game crashes quite frequently due to modders and inherent rockstar server instability. You'll also get a lot of permanent loading screens that require you to restart your game.

 The irony is that this game had the potential (and arguably still does have that potential) to be an even better cash cow for rockstar than GTA online could ever hope to be, and be significantly more enjoyable to play than GTA online at the same time.

Keep a few things in mind though:
- Rockstar games will not update the game anymore (""discontinued"")
- Hackers / Modders (Game still is playable though, I've only met like 5 hackers of my 60 hours of game time)
- Some glitches = Stable glitch ( you'll often stuck in the stables, easy fix = restart your game, Before going into the stable flee your horse sometimes that helps ) 
- You might get stuck on the 50% story mark (not sure how to fix that yet, some say it depends on your honor level)
- You will meet hackers in modes such as ""Public enemy"" (you wont be able to kill them) 
----------------------
But There's always negative aspects to good games
The graphics are amazing, the game runes smoothly, The story mode is amazing in my opinion (The LeClerk missions are so good) 
The map is huge. 
Compare it to another rockstar game such as GTA V there's always missions available to do  
The roles are fun, you can own more than 1-2 roles (you can  own all of them at the same time)
The Moonshiner role has its own story too
Its a bit hard to grind for money at the beginning but it gets easier as you progress in game.
----------------------
Its really fun to play with friends! Yes the modders are annoying but sometimes you'll get lucky and a modder will feel generous by dropping you a chest with money / gold & other things. Or you'll meet a hacker who will scream ""I will Obama you"" as they blow you up whilst flying past you in a drone...

------------------------------------
I'm a person that bought the game to play mainly with other players. The game world is beautiful (if you're computer is powerful enough), full of animals, landscapes and adventures to explore.

Most of my playtime goes towards exploring the game and earning gold bars to purchase the bounty hunter license. My reasoning for doing this is to be able to customize my character with weapons and costumes before trying out the pvp, and then settling for the pvp in the long run. I wish I tried the pvp thoroughly first instead of trusting that it would be as entertaining as I envisioned.

When joining the different pvp series such as the shootout series there are a couple of things to note.
First of all the loading time and matchmaking is tedious, it can take 10 minutes to start a match. On times of the day with less active player it can take longer.
Instead of showing the player a browser window with the various games available, how many players there are in that game and letting you pick one, you will blindly be loading for about 5 minutes to maybe find the match you are looking for.

When writing ""maybe find the match you are looking for"" I mean that there are different types of games even within each series. For example in the shootout series one is a free-for-all, another is a team deathmatch, and some games are entirely different and force a predetermined loadout on you, instead of letting you use your own loadout you strived to achieve with your in-game grinding, or bought with real life money.

If you're fortunate and enter the match you're interested in, you'll quickly notice that the majority of players use the auto aiming system to their advantage. When playing pve against other npc's I can see how dead eye and auto aiming can be entertaining for some, however in pvp it completely eliminates the aspect of having to aim.
If you miss a shot with a rifle while standing 100m away from your target free aiming, a person with the lock-on aim can instantly turn around, lock on to your torso and tilt the aim slightly up to most of the time one-shot head shot you (most of the time because of ability cards), all this while sprinting. 
Players with enough in-game dollars or gold can also buy the most powerful tonics that make them live many more shots than other players that lack these tonics.

You could then say, but what about the hardcore game mode? In this game mode the ability cards, tonics and the lock-on aim are all disabled. 
You'd be right, however there is still the element of having to dress up and use completely different setups from the one you select before the game starts. In one team you may be assigned a top hat, while in the other you are assigned another hat. And as mentioned before some games even give you an entirely different weapon loadout than the one chosen by you prematurely. It's as if Rockstar is giving the player a freedom to customize their character in free roam, however this freedom is trampled on in online matchmaking.
On top of this there are less players playing the hardcore games, so it's even rarer to find a match in this series compared to the shootout series.

Loading in the different maps takes a while as well. Even if it's because all the assets and other game elements need to be loaded in, is it worth it? Is it so important that all these small crates, coffee mugs or detailed chairs are loaded in, when a match lasts for about 10 minutes and my focus is on staying alive or finding other players? When searching online I can see that the loading times are an issue in games such as GTA V as well.
Battlefield 4 loads up quicker and is in some aspects even more aesthetically pleasing to look at with destruction etc compared to Read Dead Online.

This is the first Rockstar game I purchase, I doubt I'll buy any other Rockstar title. There are simply too many other competitors that have solved the lack of performance compatability that Rockstar keeps repeating across triple A titles.

Other than that the game offers variety, from fishing to hunting and trading for players that are interested in this. The dialogues and cinematics in the game are well made with great voice acting, but there should be an option to skip them as they can be lengthy.


Written after playing for 423 hours
-------------------------------------
I've played an additional 393 hours of this game now, because I enjoy some of the core mechanics such as the combat (Except the ability ""Paint it Black"") and the looks of the game. 
However, I still stand firm on my first impression of the game, and would like to add that the support and respect the staff of Rockstar has for their players is minimal. The game is riddled with hackers and Rockstar either lacks a full fledged way to detect them, or let them roam the game.

When writing ""lacks a full fledged way"" I'm referring to a technique Rockstar uses to detect hackers, which involves the earning of massive amounts of gold in a short period. However, many players have been banned or suspended this way claiming that they have never hacked.

Rockstar also updates their newswire every month on their webpage. However, this month (December 2023) such an update has yet to be posted. I hope the company continue to support Read Dead Online even though they release new games such as Grand Theft Auto VI.",1681082205,1702485638,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Their focus seems to have shifted to the bottom line, echoing the cash-hungry trend of many other big corporations.

I, recently was playing the online, and I usually play by myself and I don't really play with any friends or anything like that. I was minding my business, and I think I encountered a hacker or a modder of some kind. Kept killing me blah blah blah the usual nonsense they try. Only reason I can confirm they were exploiting is when I tried to kill them, they wouldn't die and take no damage at all.

Anyhow, eventually I managed to get away from them and go back to what I was doing. An hour later, I get booted from game claiming I've been suspended. So I check my email, and I get an email claiming I'm suspended for a month and my character will be reset etc. Mind you, I don't mod, cheat, nor hack in this game. After doing some research, I see several other people were caught in a suspension or ban wave this month around the same time as me. So, I don't think it's a coincidence at all.

What I don't appreciate is Rockstar unfairly doing this. Then, claiming I can't dispute and suspensions/bans are final even though I haven't exploited this game at all.

- this should've been bundled with RDR2 instead of it being an entirely separate purchase.

- the money system. having weapons and clothes be upwards of 500 in-game dollars but only paying out 20 dollars per mission or 27 cents from dead bodies just makes the game harder to play as a new player.
- Modders running rampant. The amount of times I've had my game crashed or being imprisoned because I shot at someone in god mod is insane. Riding around from town to town and having 1000 legendary bears spawned on me makes the game impossible to enjoy.
-  The modder issue wouldnt be so horrible if you could make solo lobbies. but oh wait, you cant! you're forced to either play in a session while being harassed by 3 modders, or install sketchy software to make private servers, or do 40 random steps that just lead to you turning off your internet for 10 seconds.",1702195847,1702195847,False,3,0,0.523448586463928223,0,True,False,False

Hear me out
Cowboy.
Now, I think maybe you weren't listening- cowboy and you can form a posse with friends.

Goofs aside
The game feels right. You play alone unless  you have a posse but running into other players is rare enough it feels significant. Yes this is a Rockstar Game so yes there are hackers BUT otherwise the game hits the nail on the head. You wander different biomes of the American SouthWest. You can hunt buffalo or hunt down bounties. You can camp in woods near rivers or in large sandy deserts with cacti and rattlesnakes. 
The game plays slow, the guns run slow, the fast travel is limited enough the map feels big.
Like I said, they got the feel correct. Play like the game intends and enjoy the vibe.
Overall 9/10

Everyone wondering why your crashing?
The issue is that you are with a Hacker in a lobby.
There is a guide how to get rid of the crashes i will link it down below.

The game is great and runs like a dream but as soon as a hacker is in your lobby you will crash.
And even animals stop spawning or npcs that completely disappear.

All because of hackers...

This is a necessary fix, get the latest runtime zip:
https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#sdk/downloadConfirm/latest/windows/vulkan-runtime.exe

Second get this just to make sure:
https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/

last but not least go to your Local Appdata and delete your DXCache that is in your NVIDIA folder.

The very last step is to get the legal screen script:
https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/28

Go to your steamapps\common\Red Dead Redemption 2\x64\data
And put the file in the data folder.
This file will start your game in a solo session.

If you wanna play with your friends make sure to use the same password in the startup meta file.
All you gotta do is put a password at the bottom of the file and your done there are guides online how to do that.

And suprise suprise no more crashes, all the npcs are still on the map and no more smart people that fly across the map.

I played more than 4 hrs in a session without crashing.
If you still crash you might need jesus and a good exorcism.

But with that, I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a cool and cozy game set in the wild west. You can play through high or low honor and that will adjust how the world responds to you. I love the care for horses and the hunting aspect, and some of the little achievements are funny. 

What I don't like is that it lacks a few things the main game has. You can't tame wild horses even if you have an open stall...that was a huge part I loved in the main game that isn't even allowed despite the tutorial saying you can. I wish that posse members could donate toward camp improvements easier than needing to give up opening a treasure chest or giving perfect hunts to support...just a QOL thing. 

In the case of gold, initially I was peeved you couldn't get any job titles or some things without gold, it seemed like you really needed to spend money on the game. However, through gameplay we've found that you can get some amount of gold for the randomly generated assist quests in the world (such as giving a traveler a ride into town, etc), and you can get good gold through some free roam quests, purple world events (some events you need more than 2 people, but not many), and you can get gold through treasure maps. 

Overall we really enjoy the game. Wish we could use some rdr2 mods to give it some extra fun, but alas it's good enough where it stands now. You can also upload photos you take with your camera in game to the social club for R* and then download them from there if you want.",1701446695,1701446695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
It runs fairly well, solid port.

Cons:
Its so boring lol. Just like the story mode.
U need gold to unlock the more fun content.
Its going to take a lot of grinding to get the gold you need.
The best content it has to offer, isnt very good or worth replaying.

2. Enjoyed hunting, treasure hunts, and managing a camp/business.

The online version not only includes these but expands on them in detail. With 5 major choices, each with rich stories and missions, it surpasses GTA Online

There is not a 'nice' hacker or modder.

They won't ban the hacker for actually duping it in. 'Nice' Hackers are making the game harder and harder to play with glitches, excessive lagging, and of course griefing.  

I bought this back when the game relatively had no hackers; maybe one every other day but now it's like I'm having to switch servers 4-6x each session to avoid someone ruining my progress.

Arbitrary change in minimum requirements, most likely paid of by NVIDIA to make people buy a new GPU. Could be played with no issues on a 660Ti, now it REQUIRES a 1060 minimum, while AMD still can use older GPU. *rooster*star (synonym) at it's finest.

:Review from playing 3 hours: I'm not into western myself. But the game is good, and quite a lot of fun if you like western.
Quite a few bugs and glitches, the horse has....special needs.
Graphics are nice, and the environments are quite beautiful.
Gunplay is ok, but some guns you need to cock the hammer and such to shoot, which is something I liked.

If you like western, I think you'll like it. If you, like me, have no interest in western, then you wont be impressed but still might enjoy it.

You will be teleported away from what ever you were doing at random times, killed repeatedly by people you can't even see, and be subjected to immersion breaking things like UFO's, unnaturally large creatures, and weirdly sized or colored players. However, if you learn how to do a private lobby using a text file, the game is glorious! I play this way with a friend, and while I miss the interaction with other decent people (they exist!), I  never have to worry about random disconnects or being griefed while I enjoy the stunning landscapes and just going about my business in the game world. My favorite parts of the game are the horses, clothing options, and realism of the game world. The PC UI takes some getting used to, and I could do without a lot of the forced grouping and combat, but otherwise this has become my favorite game. The horses are the best game horses I've ever seen and interacted with, and it's a pleasure to just ride slowly down the roads and trails and enjoy the wildlife and scenery. 

Tips: It's worth it to buy enough gold to get the Collector Role as soon as you can. This Role will easily give you the ingame cash you need to maintain your camp, pay for stables, and keep your horse well fed while you get going. Do the dailies and treasure maps (you get one every 5 levels) to make the gold to purchase your next Role. Loot all the NPC's you kill - they don't have much cash, but sometimes you will get a treasure map, things you can sell to a Fence, gun oil, and other useful items.",1700317804,1700317804,True,35,2,0.772403120994567871,0,True,False,False

It's fun the first, oh, three hours? Conveniently I basically NEVER saw another player until past the 2 hour refund window- Did I say conveniently? I mean suspiciously. The instant that refund window was past, in the first and ONLY town I have access to, I get demolished by other players on sight, slamming me with horses to cause fatal damage, the moment I respawn another literally choking my character out in the middle of the street on sight, or my personal favorite: glitching my game to spawn an undressed male character model to follow me all throughout town that only went away when the player I suspect got bored. I guess there's no good way to report *literal* sexual harassment in this game, because only option I got was some BS way in which I could only put up a bounty for other players. For some reason I doubt the efficacy of that.

Which sucks. I want an old west style MMO to work, but the company that makes it OBVIOUSLY doesn't care- it's so bad I don't even want to get the offline games in order to not support this.

I loved playing this one my ps4, it was less annoying, occasionally a griefer but for the most part, I could play in peace. However, on pc its pathetic that 2 hours of gameplay was mostly being griefed, running from other players, and being surrounded by annoying script kiddies that break the game in so many ways it is frustating. Rockstar treats this game like a stepchild and isn't doing anything to fix any of these issues. The only fix for this is to intentionally lag the game via task manager for 10 seconds to get a private lobby that eventually gets ppl add to it or to get a mod that goes the notepad trick for you which gets something akin to a passcoded lobby. 

Outside of this issue, I love the game and the joy it brings me alone or with friends. Its honestly fun and its very beautiful graphically as well as the immersiveness to make your own stories in the game.

My revised review: yeah the game is fun overall. modders still run rampant, fuck up your gameplay, rockstar is doing nothing to fix it, there hasnt been any content added since 2021, the missions are just repeats so it get repetitive very quickly, still a buggy mess from crashes to things just not appearing or doing what theyre supposed to.

That means no more new content, just old stuff recycled every few months. Really annoying bugs like the stable bug (that traps you in the stable and forces you to exit game via Rockstar social club) are still present even 2 years after the final update. It's biggest issue however is that cheaters using third party software have free reign now, so you can't even get any playtime without some idiot using auto-aim, infinite health, modded weapons etc. harassing players from afar using random explosions, teleports, or spawning all kinds of random enemies in free roam. Trying to report them will often auto-kick you, so it's pretty much a waste of time.
As RDO already comes bundled with RDR2, just buy that when it's on sale, as it's by far the best western game out there. RDO could have been great too, but it clearly didn't earn enough cash for Rockstar compared to GTAO, so they walked away from it and let it go to ruin.

But the fact that I have not been able to find a single server in WEEKS that is not full of people modding is getting frustrating. Areas where you are supposed to be safe are unsafe. I get headshotted at least once every session while buying things from the general store or the butcher. Modders chase you across the map with ease - if you fast travel they will just teleport to follow you. Pressing charges does nothing, reporting does nothing, the only thing you can do is keep server hopping until you (hopefully) find one without modders. The amount of times I have had to quit a great session out of frustration because someone randomly started attacking me and using cheats to throw me into the air, make my horse explode, make my items disappear, etc. is becoming too much.

PROS:
- The Graphics are GORGEOUS! 
- The gun play is pretty good
- The character creation has alot of room to get very detailed, unless you want an ogre.
- The roles are pretty fun 
- It can also be fun to just ride around on horses solo or with a group

CONS:
-LOTS OF MODDERS, which is somewhat a pro because the grind can be boring sometimes but majority of the time they are just a bunch of bored weirdos
- The men on this game will fall in love with you if you are a female.... just saying
- The women on here are pretty chill but some are lowkey groomers so be careful of that too!

Be me for a sec and imagine this scenario. Im taking my hides to sell them to a buyer. Out of nowhere a guy teleports next to my wagon, kills me, destroys the wagon. after i respawn he teleports over and over again to kill me. ""fine, new lobby"" *loads up new lobby, plays for 30 seconds, gets killed, realizes he followed me, because all you need in RDR2 online servers is someones in game tag to force themselves into you're lobby*. 

the ""online"" problem for this game is worse than the reviews make it out. Every lobby has at least one cheater, and they OWN THE GAME. For one let start out by pointing out its near impossible to get these guys banned, so long as they take even the most minor precautions. as i said, modders have total control of the game, and have many ways to keep you from reporting. my least favorite is when they crash your game before you can ever finish the report. They can also change names, resulting in others being reported who weren't cheating. plenty of those stories floating around. This game doesn't have dedid servers either, its peer to peer and for those in the crowd that means all the players are basically connecting to each other.... which means without a vpn, all they need is simply to be in you're lobby to get ips, and you're screwed if they so choose. some examples of the endless grief you'll see in this game is: endless tp killing, your horse will never live long enough to see you, you cant retaliate bc they cant be killed or harmed in any way, they can cage you in place, freeze your character, crash you're game, and i haven't even brought up ddos. Just don't bother with this game, unless you just really like being bullied GTA5 RP SissyMod style.

Now id like to address directly to the people who think this is just a salty bs review, and the mod greifing isn't as bad as i making it out to be. Go on YouTube and twitch, and look how healthy the content community is for Online. It ins't healthy, and anyone who does make content has addressed this issue, with much more frustration than I.

Ill wrap this up by pointing out to anyone whose hopeful Rockstar will fix this issue, this has been a problem since release, and they've watched it get worse while doing nothing. no hope for this heaping pile of online grief fest.

Edit: i almost forgot. most importantly, if you do buy the game, under no circumstances, for any reason, not even on opposite day, open a chest you don't know for a fact is supposed to be there. if you find a chest, you  better look on YouTube and Google until you can verify that's a real chest. Modders spawn in chests that give you gold.... and a permanent ban. Yeah that's right, Rockstar doesn't ban the cheater who spawned the chest, they ban the level 3 account who didn't know any better for opening it, because Rockstar doesn't care about cheaters greifing, they only care when someones getting premium currency for free instead of paying them.",1698088569,1698106045,False,386,12,0.956780493259429932,10,True,False,False

A couple downs sides to it: Rockstar has abandoned the game(no new content) but it has a ton of variety and different things to do plus incredibly immersive.  The level of detail is amazing.  Another not so great aspect is that the game seems more designed for consoles and controllers then PCs and keyboards.  Their tips for doing stuff are not intuitive or easy to understand but once you get the hang of it it is loads of fun.  Also, the community is super toxic on the main online version lots of little punk hackers but there is a way to enter your own lobby(lots of instructions online).  So set it up for you and however many friends you want to play with to go through a separate lobby then you won't have to deal with hackers and punks.

Cowboy simulator. Smooth animations, a detailed open world, stunning graphics, quality voice acting, and an incredible amount of polish. When I say this, I speak for both story (Red Dead Redemption 2) and online (Red Dead Online/this product). Both ""modes"" are actually extremely similar in what you can or cannot do. The main difference is that in online, you get to create and control your own protagonist who experience a different story. Who they become is up to you to decide. The entire map is available for exploration and most, if not all guns/horses/food/etc. available in story are also available in online.

What are the players like?
What players? After a few weeks of playing, I can count the number of people I have seen in free roam on my two hands. This can be both good and bad--if you like meeting new people in the game, you're better of using a third party site or platform to find friends. If you like to be immersed or are just weary of griefers, this is a godsend.
But for the people that I do see, what are they like?
GTA Online but most aren't blood-hungry psychopaths or literal Gods. A vast majority of the people you see will probably just ignore you. Tryhards/griefers and modders/cheaters are present, yes, but they are incredibly rare in my experience.

As for the ingame economy?
Cash is the standard currency--it's easy to get and earned from most things in the game. Gold is the ""premium"" currency of Red Dead Online; it can be used to bypass level restrictions, purchase roles, or be used in place of cash. It's a bit harder to come by compared to regular ol' cash, and is rewarded in smaller amounts. You will need a lot of it. Expect to farm/grind for currency often. Just keep in mind that there's no need to hurry. And don't get burned out. It's also important to note that the way rewards work in this game is a bit weird. In many instances, you get paid MORE cash/gold for taking LONGER to complete a mission or objective. So take your time and enjoy. Don't rush--you'll only sandbag your rewards anyways.

What should I be doing when I start?
When you first start out (after the tutorial missions), you will mostly be going to Horley and doing online's story missions for early cash and a bit of gold. Once you discover more lucrative sources to make bank, you can sort of ""farm the way you want"" with specialist roles. These ""roles"" or ""jobs"" let you earn cash by doing specific activities that are exclusive to said role. Like gunplay and lots of action? Save for a bounty hunter pass. Want to start a hunting business? Become a trader. Like alcohol? Sell moonshine! Are you intrigued by animals? Consider becoming a naturalist. Fond of exploration and/or treasure hunting? Collector. Note that getting into roles requires a steep gold investment and that only the bounty hunter role can earn gold from their activities.

Miscellaneous tips
- I recommend you buy the collector bag to become a collector as soon as possible. With the collector role, you can stock up on treasures found in the open world, then sell them in sets for a large sum of money. Each treasure you collect also gives you experience points to increase your rank. This is especially important because you get a treasure map every 5 ranks that provides you with a lot of gold and cash in addition to your other sources of income. I recommend looking for antique alcohol bottles and the Swords and Pentacles tarot card sets as these collectible sets are easily obtainable without any additional investment aside from the collector bag,
- Speaking of collector, hit shift+tab ingame to toggle the Steam overlay. Select ""Web Browser"" to open a new web browser tab within Steam overlay and search for ""jeanropke map"". This will lead you to a site with a virtual Red Dead Online map that updates in real time. With it, you can see the location of every collector item and mark them on your own map ingame. The map also has other important markets for fast travel points, Madam Nazar (collector vendor), legendary animal spawn locations, and some other useful things.
- Aim to upgrade your Carbine repeater to the Lancaster repeater. The Lancaster isn't too cheap but it has a high rate of fire as well as balanced range and accuracy, making it an all-around reliable weapon. Oh, and don't forget to clean your weapons every so often so that their stats are good. To do this, make sure you have gun oil in your inventory (purchased or looted), hover over a weapon and press the scroll wheel/middle click.
- Press L to pull up the player menu. You can do a lot from here but going to ""Online options"" at the very bottom allows you to change your playstyle between offensive (on by default) and defensive. Defensive mode is good for players who aren't looking to pvp, as it gives you damage resistance from players, disables auto aim lock on, immunity from executions and the lasso, and other buffs that promote pacifism.
- Don't forget to do your daily objectives (accessible from the player menu, L key). These are actually an incredible source of easy gold. Most challenges are pretty easy and there's always at least a few that don't require pvp or interaction with other players. You only need to complete one daily objective per day to start getting gold reward multipliers for them. The multiplier increases every 7 days, up to 28.
- The game seems to start with very low volume in Window's volume mixer. This is probably because the game's starting cutscene (the shotgun) is actually very loud on max volume. Be sure to check/change the game's volume in Windows mixer every time you boot it up or switch sessions.",1696401738,1696401738,True,13,0,0.661156237125396729,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

Red Dead Online is a game that has long lived in the shadow of its illustrious single-player counterpart. It's a sprawling, open-world Wild West playground that could have been a diamond in the rough, but it feels more like an abandoned frontier town left to decay.

Gameplay (★★★☆☆): When you saddle up and ride into the vast expanses of Red Dead Online, you can't help but be captivated by its potential. The core gameplay mechanics, inherited from Red Dead Redemption 2, are still there. The gunfights are gritty, the world is beautifully detailed, and the promise of forging your own cowboy legacy is enticing. It's this promise that keeps players coming back despite the game's issues.

Abandoned by Rockstar (★★☆☆☆): The most frustrating aspect of Red Dead Online is the feeling that Rockstar has left it to fend for itself in the lawless wilderness. Updates are sporadic, and it's clear that the studio's focus has shifted to other endeavors. This abandonment is felt through the lack of meaningful content updates and the absence of quality-of-life improvements that players have been clamoring for.

Neglected and Cheater's Paradise (★☆☆☆☆): It's not just the neglect; Red Dead Online is also plagued by rampant cheating. Hackers run amok, ruining the experience for everyone else. Rockstar's response to this issue has been lackluster at best, leaving legitimate players feeling powerless and frustrated.

In conclusion, Red Dead Online is a game with untapped potential, still riding the coattails of its single-player predecessor. It's a Wild West playground that desperately needs some love and attention from its creators. While the core gameplay can provide moments of enjoyment, the neglect from Rockstar and the unchecked cheaters tarnish what could have been a true gem of an online experience. Saddle up with caution, for this frontier is wild and unforgiving in more ways than one.",1695955774,1695955774,False,3,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

The game consistently crashes (or runs poorly)... Shoot, if you're interested into becoming a BAD*** moonshiner and pay IDK, 25+ gold bars, just to get it up and running. Be mindful that you need to spend $50 (or more) in game to start brewing, and once you get the boys together to run a mission. Be prepared to roll the dice with the server, your game might crash (lose all your moonshine and wait again) OR you score some dopamine once the game LOADS the mission. See?

Sure it's the best western game out there, but that's really not saying much when the only competition for the title is Fistful of Frags and Oregon Trail.

I will change this to an upvote however if they add something like an Australia or Rhodesia map run on separate servers which may be traveled to and player owned ranches with cattle herding. This game has so much potential and they have thrown it all away to prioritize GTA, which was a very poor decision. If they added another region, more activities, maybe the valley of the kings in egypt -imagine a shootout in a tomb while trying to find a lost artifact- or gold prospecting a valley in Alaska, swarming with bandits, grizzlies and moose. Even trapping beaver in Northern Minnesota or Ontario! Instead they have abandoned the game, which is sad, so I downvote.",1638508447,1695261170,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tried both mouse button options.  Right button does nothing, even if held for many seconds.  Left button shoots the clerk.  What gives?

I do enjoy this game when i do not get stalked by modders, the repeat of the same missions and moonshine gets dull overtime.. i wish thy still would care for this game but yet like my GTAOnline review i will tell you the same. DO NOT buy this game. Not becouse of the modders but becouse R* gives 0 focks about your private information when it comes to to modders and hackers. If thy did care about you and me thy would not ban the people trying to play a game thy would make solid anti-cheat and inplement change but thy care more about milking a game.

And even then, you can't really spend that money on anything useful, all horses are the same, it doesn't matter if its a 1000$ horse or a 100$, it rides the same, the speed is the same. All guns feel the same, with barley any difference at all, it doesn't matter if you use a cattleman revolver or a navy revolver, most of the time you wont feel a difference. Card balancing is a joke, some are just straight up busted while others are just useless. There is absolutely no content what so ever, which makes the game feel old and boring after 3 hours of playtime. But the main problem, are the cheaters. Every 3rd person you see has a cheat menu, which makes the only thing going for this game, the player to player interaction, just straight up disgusting.

Your every lobby has some amount of effect from a damned cheater and they are a damn plague and exist only to ruin every other persons game play.

It's almost hard to say whether the online is worse then GTA 5's current online state, and the circus going on there with the official servers (modding, issue) and how bad the problem appears to be there, but atleast Red Dead has a solid foundation and gameplay, unlike the careless additions they've made for GTA 5 with the futuristic stuff, flying vehicles etc as a short example. 

When playing, my experience in australia has been that somewhere close to half of every encounter is that of somebody using a cheat menu or that person having a friend with no other better thing to do then to come along and assist them with cheats cause their boy getting crapped on. 

I don't very well understand the mind of a cheater, them people are weak as piss. Yet somehow they manage to convince themselves they're better then a non cheater its bizarre. 

Rockstar isn't even bothered to poke a stick at this game when it comes to security, especially when the micro transactions for gold currency is essentially pointless when a cheat menu can spawn chests in game that reward users with the currency illegitimately. You know the publishers don't care at all when they aren't bothered to protect their bread and butter micro transactions. 

Card/perk system in my opinion needs some work, and the lack of the features which red dead 1's online had in comparison, mostly in regards to some of the animals you could mount and own.

There has been a lack of new content which the community has anxiously been waiting on for what seems like forever.

The issue with drowning, and ships sinking in the ocean without a clear border which states what is accessable and what is not.

Some glitches still existing with a large one being that your character becomes stuck when accessing the stable.

Still no Undead Nightmare..

A worrying concern is that of Rockstars recent purchase with the folks behind the custom launcher that allowed unofficial servers for both Gta 5's ""Five M"" and Red dead 2's ""Red M"".

A slightly increased player limit within the open world free roam would be more appropriate, given the scale of the map and todays tech now.

Review is set to positive, as the cheating issue lies mostly with the community, although the anti cheat has to be taken seriously, it is well overdue.",1607385146,1693231297,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Should I be upset that such a beautiful game has nonsense online mode, or should I be upset that 138 hours of effort is wasted? I really don't know. Guys, do not buy Red Dead Online and don't recommend anyone else to buy. 
You will start to hate Red Dead Redemption's Story mode just because of the Red Dead Online and have a nervous breakdown. [b]Don't buy the Red Dead Redemption Story Mode from Read Dead Online just because it's cheap. When something happens to your account,[/b] like those cheaters/hackers pull your IP address from Rockstar Servers or like stealing your Social Club account and all your games. Even though I separate my accounts e-mail address, my credentials were compromised and those hackers stole it. When that happens, you cannot find the relevant person to contact. [b]Rockstar Support really don't care about you.[/b] I lost 370 TL on this road just because I wanted to bought 50 TL cheaper. Do not enter such a path. Online Mode is something like the empty tin can. You are running around aimlessly without any purpose. It's like a Turkey's simulation. Cheaters ohh those damned cheaters. If you meet one of them and once, they become a pain in the ass, they won't let you go. They are ruining your fun and everything in the game.
You are leaving with nothing but trouble with the game you entered to distract your mind. Red Dead Online is a nothing but regret.

You pay 20$ to get access to things after buying the game just so a hacker can take your hour worth of work and throw it down the drain. I could not find a single game that did not have a hacker ruining it for everyone else. It is sad where this game is now. Last time I played this had no issues like this.

Pretty much, this is how you shoot a gun and ride a horse.  After that it's good luck!  Nothing on how to fast travel, nothing about game mechanics or anything of the sort.  

Lets go with missions, at first I tried to sneak but the coin of visibility is pretty much 1 mile for those guys and would immediately spot me.  So I would sneak to the making a long circle, yeah got him!  Course there is another guy looking from 2 miles away that spots you and now you have to fight off 15 guys at a time.  I know what you're thinking, ""that sounds exciting!"" but no.  They all take cover which is fine but also they all know exactly where you are!  Jump into a ravine and sneak around to a barn?  Nope, as soon as you get there they already have you lined up and are firing.  So soon enough you find yourself dead.

All right fine, you're dead and it's time for a different approach right?  Wrong again!  Even though they killed you they are still on alert as to you being with their super amazing eye sight, they will start to shoot at you from a distance even through trees!  You can't see them do to the leaves but sure as day they see you just fine and when 10 of them are firing at you, they are bound to score a few hits.  So you're dead again.

Okay you think, screw missions, maybe I'll just wander around and take in the sights.  I have my flag up as protected so I don't have to worry about other players at least because it says right there when I raised it, ""Raise flag for protection from other players"".  Great I'm safe considering I'm a low level and would get beaten soundly instantly.  

But hold onto your hats folks because while wandering in the middle of town I get a player running up to me and fires a shot gun in my face...instant death.  Fine, I respawn, he is right there and does it again.  At this point I was done but because I kept spawning on top of him I couldn't even quit the stupid game because he would shoot me before I could!

In short, there's much better games out there worth playing.  But if you do want to play this, go ahead!  Some people just want to suffer.",1692323509,1692323509,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

This is what we all wish MMOs actually were, and in my opinion what they should be (not massive, but a fluid ""lobby"" system like what RDO is). Few games have nailed this sort of thing so well. RDR1's multiplayer was amazing as well, and this is nothing but an upgrade upon that

That being said, I highly recommend you don;t purchase this, and instead get the full RDR2. RDO, or BCO (Bing Chilling Online) is completely filled with hackers on PC, and it ruins the experience. It's been an ongoing issue for years and they have never done anything significant to deal with it, so at this point it's a lost cause now that BCO is officially abandoned by Rockstar. If you are able to go more than an hour without a Bing Chilling user spawning cages around you or spamming explosives at your location, you are lucky - that's not an exaggeration at all. BCO has lots of jobs you can do which have a high risk factor (which is part of the fun) - but you are literally 10x more likely to get griefed irrecoverably by hackers in the middle of a mission than you are to get attacked by an honest player

I originally purchased this because I had already done RDR2 on the PS4 and thought I would only want to play online. Now I see my mistake. As far as I know there's no discount for Bing Chilling Online owners to purchase the singleplayer version",1692096077,1692096077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the very moment you step foot into its meticulously crafted world, you are transported to a realm of unmatched beauty and complexity, where every cobblestone and blade of grass tells a tale.

The game's narrative prowess is a tour de force, a symphony of emotions that grips your heart and refuses to let go. Arthur Morgan's journey is one of profound self-discovery, a redemption arc that rivals the greatest tales of literature and cinema. The characters that populate this vast canvas are not mere digital constructs; they are living, breathing souls with dreams, flaws, and histories that will leave an indelible mark on your psyche.

The open world itself is a triumph of design and detail. From the bustling streets of Saint Denis to the serene vistas of the Grizzlies, every locale feels alive, each corner teeming with secrets waiting to be unearthed. The sheer scope of activities and interactions is staggering – whether you're engaging in intense shootouts, embarking on epic hunts, or simply sitting by a campfire strumming your guitar, the world reacts to your every move with a sense of authenticity rarely achieved in gaming.

Graphically, Red Dead Redemption 2 sets an unsurpassed standard. The play of light and shadow, the intricate textures, and the meticulous attention to environmental nuances elevate this game to an artistic marvel. It's not just about graphical fidelity; it's about the synergy between visual craftsmanship and narrative cohesion, making every frame a work of art that propels the story forward.

But it's not just the grandeur that makes this game unforgettable; it's the small moments, the quiet interactions, and the subtleties that weave together to form a rich tapestry of experiences. The conversations around the campfire, the camaraderie shared with your horse, and the sense of wonder as you stumble upon hidden gems in the wilderness – these are the elements that breathe life into the world and make it feel like a living entity.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is more than a game; it's an emotional odyssey that resonates long after the credits roll. It's a reflection on the complexities of human nature, a meditation on morality and consequence, and a love letter to a bygone era. It's a rare gem that seamlessly blends technology and art to create an experience that defies classification.

In the end, Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a game you play; it's a world you inhabit, a story you become a part of, and an adventure that etches itself into your soul. It's a triumph of imagination, a testament to the power of interactive media, and a reminder that gaming can be a form of high art. If there's one game you owe it to yourself to experience, it's this magnum opus – a true pinnacle of the medium that will stand the test of time.

From the stunning visuals and breathtaking landscapes to the authentic Western atmosphere, this game will immerse you in a world unlike any other.

One of the best aspects of Red Dead Online is the freedom it provides. You can choose to embark on story missions, hunt wild game, explore the vast open world, go bounty hunting, or simply hang out with friends in your camp. The possibilities are endless and it’s all up to you.

The multiplayer component adds an exciting layer to the gameplay. Whether you’re playing cooperatively with friends or competing against other players, there’s always something to do.

The customization options in this game are impressive, allowing players to create their own unique character and build a reputation within the game. And with the ability to purchase weapons, clothing, there’s a real sense of progression as you become more powerful and influential within the game world.

Of course, the game isn’t perfect. The matchmaking can sometimes be a little slow, the many hackers, and the recurring bugs can be frustrating. However, these issues are relatively minor compared to the overall experience Red Dead Online provides.

Red Dead Online, while it definitely falls short in comparison to its story counterpart, is a great, cheap way to play RDR2 with your friends. Sadly, even though I've been playing this for a while I'm unsure if I can recommend it.

You can explore, taking on missions and heists with friends, battling lawmen, gangs and dangerous animals to forge your own path on the American Frontier. You can ride solo or form a posse (party) with your friends and take in all that the world of RDR2 has to offer, from farms and busy towns to large mountains and snowy landscapes. You can also become a bounty hunter, fish, hunt, run your own Moonshine distillery, and more.

Now lets get to the bad bit, the microtransactions. Most of the fun parts of RDO, like being a bounty hunter, are often put behind paywalls with RDO's premium currency called gold bars. And there are challenges that only give you 0.10 of a bar, so you can see how annoying grinding for gold is to get that business or whatever you want. And I have heard it has gotten worse since the launch of this standalone version, with Rockstar nerfing the daily missions to give less gold.

Red Dead Online is a great way to experience almost all that RDR2 has to offer, but the microtransactions and the grind, while not as bad as GTAO, still feels bad and the amount of paywalls you can hit, especially when starting a business, makes the game feel boring and slow. I would suggest you get the story mode, that is where the good game is. In conclusion, RDO is a great introduction to RDR2 but sadly it feels like only the foundation is there, and there is just no actual meat to the game - at least - none that doesn't require hours of grinding or malicious microtransactions. Due to these things, as it stands I just can't recommend this until Rockstar fix the problems that have been plaguing this version of the game for a while.

EDIT: Yeaaaah, theres literally no reason to buy this, Rockstar abandoned it. Don't waste your money.",1607245741,1691743888,False,4,0,0.468696117401123047,0,True,False,False

From epic gunfights to heartwarming moments at the camp, every step of Arthur Morgan's journey left me feeling like a true frontier legend. The vast landscapes and immersive world made me forget I was just a rootin'-tootin' gamer, and for a while, I was a gunslingin' outlaw.""Stunning Realism: ""I couldn't believe my eyes playin' Red Dead Redemption 2 – the graphics were so sharp, I could see the tumbleweeds rollin' in the wind! Every detail, from the creak of the leather saddle to the glint of sunlight off a tin can, had me feelin' like I was livin' in the Wild West myself.""Emotional Rollercoaster: ""Red Dead Redemption 2 had me laughin', cryin', and holdin' my breath like a rodeo rider. The relationships between the characters were so deep that by the end, I felt like they were kinfolk. The story's twists and turns had me gripped tighter than a rattlesnake's coil.""Open-World Marvel: ""Talk about freedom! Red Dead Redemption 2's open world had me explorin' like a pioneer. Whether I was chasin' down bounties or takin' a leisurely ride through the countryside, there was always somethin' excitin' to do. It's like they packed a whole frontier into my console.""Horse Whisperer's Dream: ""I never thought I'd get so attached to a bunch of pixels, but Red Dead Redemption 2's horses stole my heart. The bond I formed with my trusty steed was somethin' else – groomin', feedin', and ridin' together made me feel like a true cowboy with a loyal companion.""Spaghetti Western Bliss: ""Red Dead Redemption 2 delivered that classic spaghetti western feel I've been cravin'. The showdowns, the duels, and the showdowns turned this game into a cinematic masterpiece. It's like Clint Eastwood handed me the reins and said, 'You're the new sheriff in town, partner.'",1611479815,1691443279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is potentially the best game that exists, at least it's definitely the best wild-west game.
The realism must be unmatched, the way the animals react, the human ai, the hunting - even from shooting someone in one of their major artilleries and watching them bleed out.
One of the most realistic features is the police - in story mode, if you had a mask up or no one saw you commit a crime, then you get wanted - you can convince the police it wasn't you!
The story, while sad, is one of the best i've ever seen, maybe seconding to the last of us. 
It's brilliant, and it is worth every penny. The online and story modes will definitely give you an experience that you'll play over atleast twice.
I might be a fanboy, but I've played through the game 3 times and am currently on my fourth.

I'll divide the review into 2 parts, I'll keep the old RDO review as it is because I didn't change my mind.

RDR2:
The game has an awesome and emotional story, the realism is just wow, a big map to explore and tons of activities to do like exploring, carriage stealing, bounty hunting etc... I feel lucky being alive at the time of RDR2 release.


RDO: (from September 2022)
No doubt that Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games of all time, I appreciate and respect all the time, effort and dedication Rockstar gave this game, it pushed me into the western genre of movies such as the iconic The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966), as well as many more. When Red Dead Online became a stand-alone title in December 2020 I grabbed it for 5 bucks, excited to try the online side of my favorite game of all time with my friends, it all went good at first but once you complete everything it becomes boring as hell, especially if you have no one to play with. I expected it to be as rich in content as GTA Online, but for some reason Rockstar abandoned the game, no update as of September 2022 (the last update was in July 2021), many bugs that are unfixed, some argue that all Rockstar studios are busy with GTA VI, others argue that the game no longer brings profit to Take-Two Interactive (The parent company of Rockstar Games) and thus had to suddenly cut support.
I like RDO a lot, but I'm a bit sorry and disappointed to not recommend it, the truth must be told. It has an enormous potential though.

Red Dead Online, the highly anticipated multiplayer component of the critically acclaimed Red Dead Redemption 2, has become a nightmare due to the overwhelming presence of modders and hackers, further exacerbating the game's existing issues and leaving players with a frustrating and unplayable experience.

One of the most pervasive problems plaguing Red Dead Online is the rampant presence of modders. These malicious individuals exploit vulnerabilities in the game's code to gain unfair advantages, disrupt gameplay, and ruin the experience for legitimate players. From teleporting across the map to spawning infinite resources or invulnerable characters, modders create an imbalanced and chaotic environment that undermines any semblance of fair play.

The sheer number of modders in Red Dead Online is astonishing. Almost every session is infested with these individuals, making it nearly impossible to enjoy the game as intended. Their disruptive behavior ranges from spawning absurd objects and creatures, such as flying horses or oversized characters, to manipulating the economy and causing widespread inflation. These actions completely destroy the immersion and ruin any sense of accomplishment or progress that players strive for.

The impact of modders extends beyond mere disruptions and glitches. They also pose a significant security risk to players. By injecting malicious software and malware into the game, modders can compromise the personal information and privacy of unsuspecting players. This flagrant disregard for player safety is a glaring failure on the part of Rockstar Games to provide a secure and protected online environment.

Regrettably, Rockstar Games' response to the modding epidemic has been inadequate. Despite numerous reports and complaints from the player base, the company has shown a lack of urgency in addressing the issue. Infrequent updates and a sluggish approach to banning and penalizing modders have allowed the problem to persist, frustrating players who long for a fair and enjoyable online experience.

The presence of modders not only disrupts the gameplay but also exacerbates the already existing technical issues in Red Dead Online. Modding can often lead to crashes, freezes, and connectivity problems, further hindering players' ability to enjoy the game. It's disheartening to witness the deterioration of a potentially engaging online experience due to the unchecked activities of a small but highly disruptive group.

In conclusion, Red Dead Online's failure to address the overwhelming presence of modders and hackers has turned what should have been a captivating multiplayer experience into a nightmare. The pervasive disruption, unfair advantages, and security risks posed by these individuals diminish the enjoyment and undermine the integrity of the game. Rockstar Games must take immediate action to combat modders, implement effective anti-cheat measures, and restore a sense of fairness and security to Red Dead Online. Otherwise, the game will continue to serve as a breeding ground for chaos and frustration, driving away players seeking an authentic and enjoyable online Wild West adventure.

You can have good, fun moments when you're not being griefed by cheat nerds. Reporting does nothing and seems to notify the cheat nerds, they seem aware of when you report them.

:::UPDATE:::
Many of the issues with cheating and security can be resolved by playing private servers. There are guides and discords set up for small communities to play together. This resolves like 66% of my issues with the game. Do I play? Yes. Do I enjoy the game? Yes. Do I recommend you purchase? Considering I see this game as fundamentally broken, no.

If you could not tell in the above rant I am being Completely Sarcastic. This game is full of more hackers than i have seen in any game i have ever played. This is really sad to me because I remember a time when it wasn't like this. When people would come try to fight you for your loot and you would have to fight them off. now you cant move more than 100 yards it feels like without some hacker coming out of nowhere bypassing every safety in the game to kill you relentlessly over and over to the point where the game just becomes boring. I don't understand how that is fun for anyone but whatever. This could be an amazing game but until they do something about all the hackers I would say its unplayable.

The challenges/quests are decent and give good rewards for what they are most of the time, some quests/challenges are a bit tedious to do.
The game has a wide variety of different horses that all have different stats and different designs, this is a good thing about this game, as it encourages players to obtain the horse they like.
You can also unlock special roles, such as the bounty Hunter role and the Moonshiner role each role gives different rewards that relate to its theme, e.g. Bounty Hunter Gives bounty hunter themed outfits and can give things like lassos.

I give it the grade of ""Does NOT play well with others"". Every 3 minutes of ""play time"" gives you more grief and misery than you might feel after 3 days of a fiance's funeral proceedings.

To quote a certain French artist Charles Châtenay ""This game and its grief givers are Whole Assery at its finest!"" I'm paraphrasing of course.

[b]Pros:[/b]

[b]Stunning Visuals and Immersive World:[/b] The game's visuals and meticulously crafted open world create an immersive Wild West experience.

[b]Diverse Activities and Missions:[/b] Red Dead Online offers a wide range of activities and missions, ensuring there's always something to do.

[b]Roleplaying Opportunities:[/b] Specialized roles like Bounty Hunter, Trader, and Collector allow players to customize their experience and engage in unique activities.

[b]Co-op Possibilities:[/b] Playing with friends or joining a posse enhances the multiplayer experience through teamwork and camaraderie.

[b]Cons:[/b]

[b]Grind and Slow Progression:[/b] The game can feel excessively grindy, requiring repetitive tasks and significant time investment for meaningful progress.

[b]Limited Content Updates:[/b] New content and updates have been relatively slow, leaving some players craving more variety and freshness in the game.",1613321299,1687792277,True,10,0,0.582235991954803467,0,True,False,False

Finish a mission but can't do anything but Alt+F4 the game as no menu can be accessed until the server decides to wake up, play a cinematic after completing the mission, then let you go. Until then you are held hostage to the nothing.

Below is my earlier rating since the complaints still stand, but it's overall still a game I want to play.

Game crashes with ffffff error for no reason. Randomly will get stuck in cilnematic view where I can't access or see anything of my inventory unless I force Alt+F4 the game the re-launch it. Sometimes when I go to climb onto the horse, the horse will disappear and I have to call for it to come back from wherever it glitched to and wait for it to run to me from the edge of my radar.  Just enough bugs to make the enjoyable part of the game just barely enjoyable, if not ruined.

Edit:  This error likes to happen immediately after completing missions before the free roam world can load, making their completion invalid and forcing me to restart the whole mission again, hoping it completes and doesn't FFFFFFF itself into the memory hole.

Edit:  I completely forgot to mention the lack of oversight that prevents players from modding/manipulating/hacking/exploiting whatever they are utilizing and harassing other players online. Nothing like being in the middle of a bounty mission with your posse and about to bind the person you're about to pick up and turn in for a bounty when suddenly in the middle of a dry cactus field, my character  spontaneously combusted and exploded, killing not only me, but also the target for the bounty and the other posse member helping with the capture.",1669148652,1687789816,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But there are CONS. You can't transfer over user data from other consoles, you can't make multiple characters so you're limited to only the one (which sucks cuz I started on XBOX and I miss my OG boi. I took the opportunity to use my PC character slot to make his cannon little sister). The HACKERS are just getting out of hand. I can't log in and play at all at this point without being hacked, instantly becoming an outlaw with max bounty on my head, being caged in with a bear, or dying to explosions.

Fix your game, Rockstar.


EDIT:
Day 2: Had to move to a private lobby because script kiddies kept blowing me up, blowing my horse up, sticking torches out of my character model, summoning legendary cougars to attack me, etc. 

In other words, I am now playing Red Dead ONLINE as a single player. Alone. Which defeats the purpose of playing online.

I'm enjoying aspects the game, I like being a trader - it's fun -  but it would be more fun without the bugs and hack babies.

Red Dead Online transports players to the expansive open-world of the American frontier, offering a vast and immersive multiplayer experience. Set in the same time period as Red Dead Redemption 2, the game allows players to create their own unique character and embark on various activities within the shared online world.

One of the standout features of Red Dead Online is its rich and detailed open world. The game beautifully recreates the landscapes and environments of the Wild West, from sprawling deserts to dense forests and vibrant towns. The world feels alive, with dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and a variety of wildlife to encounter.

Red Dead Online offers a wide range of activities and missions for players to engage in. You can team up with friends or other players to tackle story-based missions, go on hunting expeditions, participate in competitive multiplayer modes, or even form a posse and engage in player-versus-player showdowns. The game also introduces various roles, such as bounty hunter, trader, and collector, which provide unique gameplay opportunities and progression paths.

The game's progression system allows you to earn experience, unlock new abilities, and acquire better equipment as you advance. Red Dead Online also features a robust economy, where you can earn money through various activities and spend it on weapons, clothing, and camp upgrades.

Red Dead Online encourages player interaction and cooperation through its dynamic world. You can form or join posses, take part in events and challenges, or simply explore the world alongside other players. The game's online community brings a social element to the experience, creating opportunities for both friendly cooperation and intense rivalries.

While Red Dead Online offers a compelling multiplayer experience, some players have raised concerns about the game's economy and the balance of in-game currency. Additionally, occasional technical issues and the occasional need for grinding to progress have been reported. However, Rockstar Games has been actively updating and improving the game over time, addressing many of these concerns.

In conclusion, Red Dead Online delivers an immersive multiplayer experience set in the vast and detailed world of the Wild West. With its diverse activities, engaging missions, and dynamic online community, it offers a compelling and enjoyable multiplayer experience for fans of the Red Dead Redemption series and those looking for a unique online adventure.",1686515739,1686515739,True,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

All I do is hunt and sell whatever I've killed, maybe occasionally a rescue mission if I stumble on one. I use a lobby manager that makes sure I load into one with no players. I have absolutely no desire to play this for any social experience or to get into the story or anything remotely like that, this is just therapy for me. I miss the western landscape after having moved away from it and I miss it dearly. This is the closest I can get to recapturing that, and it serves its purpose well.

This is probably not the review to read if you want a genuine opinion on this thing as an MMO because I have no desire to play it as one. *BUT*, if you just want a neat little hunting game on horseback, this is for you, I think. Even if Rockstar never updates it again, I really hope that I'll be able to keep playing it for many years to come.",1686499915,1686499915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Online mode has so many bugs and hackers that it's unplayable. There was a glitch that causes the player to get stuck in the stables to the point that the only way out was to exit the entire game. This bad of a glitch took over two months to fix. 

Now there's glitches with horse AI, which is detrimental to the game, where the horse will randomly run into a tree, not auto-jump, or get spooked and buck you off repeatedly even if the horse seems calm. If you cannot use your horse in this game, it is barely playable as your character is very slow in comparison. At this point, the horse is unusable, and who knows when this glitch will get fixed, if ever.  

Not only that, but the game kicks the player out with a frozen screen and error message, or the tab just closes entirely with no warning. It doesn't matter what is being done in the game, there seems to be no pattern to it, but maybe there is. If there is, it's extremely specific, but occurs often. 

And lastly, the amount of hackers in this game are terrible. There's most likely one in every server. It's considered a miracle if there ISN'T one in a server. These people often blow up players and continue to do so every time one respawns. This is another situation in which the player must leave the game or switch servers. Switching servers may not seem like a huge deal, but the time it takes to load the game up is significant. Hackers will also spawn exotic animals that cannot be sold, farm money by spawning wagon missions and teleporting the wagon to the end point, spawning items in players hands so the player cannot use their gun or get on their horse, or an exploiter may make themselves immune to any damage while they go on a rampage on NPC's and players. Also, it is very common to come across a random animal that is shooting fire out of it's side, head, rear-end, feet, etc. Fire also spawns on stationary objects such as buildings, wagons, rocks, and plants. If you expect to get this game and NOT see hacker in your first play session, you would be the luckiest person on earth not to see one. 

The game itself is in my top five favorite games. I LOVE this game, yet it is simply unplayable. The game is so good that I wish I never knew it existed because of the terrible state it's in. I know what I'm missing out on due to the game getting zero love from it's developers. So unless you want to get attached to this game and slowly get increasingly more depressed about it's unplayability, DO NOT BUY THIS.",1676218047,1686436398,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

On my first day we've seen:

Random crashes with Unknown error FFFFFFFF.
Hackers on PC! Invincibility, aimbots, teleportation, explosions etc.
NPCs shooting fire from their heads.
Horses running around with burning hooves.
My own horse dying from said burning hooves.
Invisible horses.
Invisible friends.
Massive desync.
Friends not being correctly brought into missions (even when in the same posse).
Missions not correctly starting and simply resulting in all map icons to disappearring.
Unnecessary and long loading screens.
Missions where you have to pickup money bags yet only some of them are actually retrievable.
Randomly exploding whilst AFK. Then stuck in a never end 'killed yourself by explosion' loop till you ALT F4.
Random crashing resulting in game stored on your horse being lost.
Etc etc.

The controls, camera, and UI are also very cumbersome and clearly designed with consoles in mind. Oh, then there's the money/gold grind.

I honestly expected FARRRRRR better from R*!

This game has a lot of strange bugs and mechanics that may make it difficult to enjoy at times, there are also plenty of mod-ers and hackers that try and ruin your fun. My suggestion here is to learn the bugs, they are easily avoidable, learn the mechanics like bullet lead its unlike any other shooter, and in the case of hackers and modders, hop to a different session do not engage that's what they want.

For me I really like this game. I have a scary 'Jack the Ripper' looking character and I am not an easy fight. The old west style fits this character and allows me to create interesting narratives as I play the monotonous game that this is. What I am getting at is there is not much here, but that allows for you to fill in the gaps and create your own story. 

So yeah, I have to say its fun especially with some buddies but this game has a lot of grinding at the START of your Red Dead Online career and some bugs and some poor sport players. All avoidable but you have to look for the ways in which to avoid these crummy things.

And of course, I am a cowboy baby!!!!

Blood Money' is essentially a creatively void, low-effort 'Stranger Mission' expansion. Without exaggeration, the boredom sets in less than two minutes into the new content and it's never relieved at any point.

Capitale, the fourth currency to be introduced in RDO, must be slowly and tediously earned by grinding a series of vapid, uninspired 'Stranger Missions.' Capitale is then exchanged for the opportunity to buy a 'Blood Money Opportunity,' however, the earning rate here has been throttled in order to encourage players to buy gold to advance. These 'Blood Money Opportunities' are not heists; these are not multi-stage robberies. They are essentially glorified 'Story Missions' with similarly structured garbage payouts.

Reward vs. time-spent here is an abomination. Economically this content is worthless.

New outfits, including Arthur Morgan's beloved Haraway outfit, were introduced at a premium of 52 gold bars, not including the 25 gold bars that must be spent in order to unlock the first of four new Quick Draw Pass iterations.'Weapon Ammo Pouch Pamphlets' introduced in the previous Outlaw Pass were made available for an absurd $2000 in-game. This pamphlet only applies to normal ammo however, and doesn't expand special ammo capacity.

Curiously, the developers failed to add any new horses, guns, clothing, or cosmetics outside of what little was offered in the Quick Draw Pass. Content creators have amassed hundreds of thousands in cash and gold over the past year and it will be at least another nine months before there is anything to spend it on.

Finally, 'Blood Money' re-introduced a slew of different game-breaking bugs and hard crashes which render RDO nearly unplayable.

The speed of Rockstar's decline over the past year has been staggering, having gone from being the darlings of the games industry to caving with rat-like enthusiasm to the mirco-transaction currency loop. This community had been hanging on by a thread before this latest spectacular failure. RDO is a shambles and should be allowed to die.

Review:

While certainly a pretty game, Red Dead Online unfortunately lets itself down by being desperately starved for content while Rockstar are satisfied miserably whoring gold off what little the game has to offer. The most puzzling thing about RDO is that where there was nearly limitless potential upon the games release, we now find an indifferent, middling, cowboy shooter that has worn out the players goodwill.

RDO suffers from a stingy economy and tedious gameplay. Mission rewards are based off of time spent rather than efficiency or kills, inevitably leading to players/ streamers being mired in downtime simply in order to be properly compensated for their efforts.

Animations are protracted and overlong, even when involving straightforward actions like skinning an animal, (this required a cut-scene?) Rockstar bully the player into paying for 'quality of life' changes such as fast-travel and weapon storage.

New updates require premium currency (gold) to buy-in, while offering limited re-playability and paltry content offerings. Recent changes have included the introduction of character roles (bounty hunter, etc.) and telegram missions. When properly structured these missions can be delightful and rewarding to play, however, many tasks hardly vary from the escort or fetch quest mission types from GTA Online.

Perhaps most regrettably, rather than give the game a clean death as the result of a diminishing player population, RDO has become mainly populated by role playing posses, whose factions exist outside of normal game servers. These people can hardly be blamed through; with the silence coming from Rockstar North the role players may be the only thing keeping this game solvent.

Much like GTA Online before its reinvention with the addition of the 'Doomsday,' 'Diamond Casino,' and 'Cayo Perico Heists,' RDO will not be rescued without the introduction of the 'big update.' Until such a time that this update arrives, RDO cannot be endorsed, and might well be considered the great 'missed opportunity' of the modern industry era.

Pros: Beautiful graphics.

Cons: Riddled with hackers. Crashes often. All of the above.",1625092566,1685557161,False,7,0,0.566003978252410889,0,True,False,False

But I believe if we REALLY want Rockstar Games to bring back support for this game, we need to get it into the media for games like IGN, Gamology, GameByte etc...[/h1] 

To do that, a review bomb of this game explaining our unpleasant experiences with the company itself and the game post-launch and then dropped support will be enough to get Rockstars attention.

[h1]Why do I think this will work?[/h1]

I think this will work, to prevent someone with a lot of time and a lot of money from getting further aggravated by the game company. There has been a rumor floating around on Facebook between groups that someone is preparing a lawsuit against Rockstar Games for unethical business and not delivering a product that they promised and over-billing of the customer. In the alleged Rumor, they have said that GTA is also applicable in this alleged lawsuit production, not just Red Dead.

But as to why I think my theory to get their attention will work is because it worked with Activision/Infinity Ward with Call of Duty, Microsoft/343 with Halo and it worked with Fatshark with Warhammer 40k Darktide among a few other games like Ground Branch and Ready or Not.

As the player and consumer, we hold the power of the purse. Laying down and accepting defeat is exactly what Rockstar wants so they can continue to get away with exploiting their playerbase and fans for money for a product they don't intend to continue to support without being forced into action. 

I've been a monetary investor in Rockstar for 10 years now, I have pulled my own support from their investment side as the first step for myself. I want to go farther so I am reaching out to the community in hopes to gain support.",1642880192,1685291119,False,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Now, let me tell ya, this here game is somethin' special. It's like ridin' a wild stallion through the open prairie, filled with all sorts of adventures and misadventures.

The first thing that struck me 'bout Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is the sheer beauty of them landscapes. From the majestic mountains to the dusty plains, the attention to detail is just jaw-droppin'. It's like steppin' right into a real-life wild west.

Now, the gameplay itself is as smooth as a buttered biscuit. Whether you're wranglin' cattle, takin' on outlaws, or huntin' down varmints, the controls feel natural and responsive. And the variety of activities you can partake in is downright impressive. You can join up with yer buddies and form a posse, or you can go it alone and make a name for yourself in them lawless lands.

One thing that sets Red Dead Redemption 2 Online apart is the way it makes ya feel like a part of the world. You can choose to be an honorable gunslinger helpin' folks in need, or you can become a notorious outlaw robbin' banks and causin' mayhem. The choices you make have real consequences, and it adds a layer of depth to the whole experience.

Now, I gotta admit, there are a few hiccups here and there. Sometimes the servers can be a tad unreliable, and you might run into the occasional bug. But Rockstar Games has been mighty diligent in fixin' them issues, and they keep addin' new content to keep things fresh.

All in all, Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is a hoot and a holler of a game. It captures the spirit of the wild west like no other, and it offers a heapin' helpin' of fun for cowboys and cowgirls alike.

Saddle up, cowpokes, because Red Dead Online is an adventure like no other! Get ready to traverse the untamed frontiers of the Wild West, where modders and hackers roam freely, turning the game into a twisted yet strangely captivating playground.

Let's start with the modders, those creative individuals who seem to have found their calling in breaking the game's delicate balance. From transforming horses into UFOs to turning saloons into impromptu discotheques, their imaginative shenanigans never cease to amaze (and frustrate) unsuspecting players. Just when you think you're about to enjoy a peaceful ride through the countryside, along comes a modder, turning your trusty steed into a rainbow-colored monstrosity. 

But wait, there's more! Alongside the modders, you'll find a motley crew of hackers who possess an uncanny ability to bend the rules of the virtual world. While their actions may occasionally disrupt the gameplay experience, there's something oddly exhilarating about dodging invisible bullets and witnessing cows gracefully take flight to the heavens. It's a chaotic ballet that keeps you on your toes and reminds you that in the Wild West, anything is possible.

So, if you enjoy the thrill of uncertainty, the constant fear of encountering modder-induced madness, and the challenge of surviving in a lawless wasteland, then Red Dead Online might just be the game for you. Red Dead Online is waiting to whisk you away on a wild ride where the only limit is your imagination (and perhaps the occasional server crash)",1666513232,1684860152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Every single session has bugs which are an inconvenience and often times game-breaking. The moonshine shack for example, the doors just don't work sometimes. Your character will push against it as if its locked despite you literally owning the building. How to fix it? Go in to a new session and hope it stops. Sometimes entering from the other side of the shack helps but that could take several tries (and that assumes the game doesn't wait 30 seconds before letting you enter). Another common issue is server crashing. Ill be playing with my friends in the middle of a 5-star legendary bounty and boom, server is done for. That difficult mission we were in the middle of was a waste of time now. And its not just after bounties. Any mission has a chance, albeit small, to crash your game. For a game that looks and feels so beautiful and well put together its a shame that after several years Rockstar has no intention to fix what is so blatantly wrong. But above all else, we have cheaters. They destroy lobbies. Altering the map, causing all npcs and players to constantly die, griefing players, and more. Its not fun to be hunted down after starting an important (yes I know its a game) mission by a cheater who has no other purpose than to ruin the game for everyone else.

In conclusion, Rockstar is a greedy company that doesn't care about their game so long as it rakes in money, and their game has several prominent issues that need to be addressed/fixed.",1684383806,1684383806,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

THE OPEN WORLD IS NEXT LEVEL. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, THERE IS TRULY NO ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS NO OPEN WORLD THAT HAS THIS GREAT OF DETAIL, STORY+SIDE MISSIONS+OPEN WORLD INTERTWINED SO WELL, NPC SOPHISTICATION, GRAPHICS, AND JUST EVERYTHING.

OTHER GAMES HAVE MUCH LARGER WORLDS, BUT DO THEY HAVE AS GREAT NPC AI? EVOLVING WORLD?

OTHER GAMES HAVE PERHAPS GREAT NPC AI, BUT AS BEAUTIFUL WORLD + STORY AT THE SAME TIME?

THIS IS TRULY A MARVEL FOR NOT JUST GAMING, BUT FOR ALL OF ENTERTAINMENT AND TECHNOLOGY IN MY OPINION. ROCKSTAR CONTINUES TO ASTOUND US WITH HOW MUCH WORK THEY PUT INTO THE GAMES. 

SO ALL OF YOU STOP CRITICIZING ROCKSTAR FOR HOW LONG THEY ARE TAKING. WOULD YOU RUSH MICHAELANGELO PAINTING THE SISTINE CHAPPEL?????????????????????? WOULD YOU RUSH DA VINCI WHEN HE WAS PAINTING THE MONA LISA? WOULD YOU RUSH MICHAEL JACKSON WHEN HE WAS WRITING THRILLER? HE DIED BY THE WAY DID ANYONE HEAR ABOUT THAT, YEAH MICHAEL JACKSON, THE FAMOUS POP SINGER PASSED AWAY. 

AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT SINGLE PLAYER WISE, ONE OF THE GREATEST OPEN WORLDS EVER. IT'S LIKE 3 GAMES IN ONE. STORY, SIDE MISSIONS, AND FREE ROAM. YOU CAN GO HUNT, RANDOM EVENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT FLOW FLAWLESSLY IN TERMS OF TRANSITIONS. YOU CAN EVEN LITERALLY CREATE YOUR OWN MISSION WITH THE AMOUNT OF FREE ROAM CONTENT THAT'S NOT STORY MISSIONS OR SIDE MISSIONS - ONE THING I WOULD DO IS GO OUT FIND NPC CABIN, CAMP OUT TIL NIGHT, THEN GO IN AND BURGLAR THE HOUSE. NPCS LITERALLY ARE SLEEPING AND YOU CAN KILL IN SLEEP, THEY CAN WAKE UP, GOD VARIOUS INTERACTIONS NOT JUST SOME RANDOM BUILDING FOR SHOW LIKE MUCH OF GTA 5. RDR2 REALLY FIXED THE INTERIORS, AND NOT JUST HAVING AN INTERIOR, BUT THE AMOUNT OF WHAT YOU CAN DO AND THE REACTIONS WITHIN THE INTERIORS - CATFISH JACKSONS AND ABERDEEEN PIG FARM ARE EXAMPLES.

OKAY. SO ALL I HAVE TO SAY SINGLE PLAYER WISE THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT ONE OF THE GREATEST SINGLE PLAYER OPEN WORLD GAMES EVER,  LIKE YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO PLAY THIS ALL OF YOU. BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY.

Sure, creating your character might make you feel like a goose with a broken wing, but once you saddle up and head out into the wild west, it's like being on an adventure with your best horse. The missions are as unpredictable as a lightning strike and rival outlaws are as cunning as a fox in a henhouse. And good golly, the dynamic weather system is like nothing you've ever seen before!

And don't even get me started on the online posse system - it's like having your own band of merry misfits to roam around with.

You gotta make your own fun here, the game is pretty limited, atleast at the time of writing this review.

No bank robberies, no train robberies etc..

UPDATE!: Rockstar has done fuck all for the game since the summer of 2021. It's 2022 and the game hasn't changed at all.

Rockstar moved on from the game, so players do what they want since theyre not being monitored like before. not worth the $10 til they put private lobbies so we can do our business and enjoy the game in peace. 

The grind is also rediculous. Payout for missions sucks, fun factor is not there for me. Daily missions arent worth it. Prices for in game items and weapons doesnt make sense.

Typical modders/hackers: god mode, teleport to player, continuous explosion to crash your game, inf bullets and throwables, spawn npcs/creatures to kill u. Cant even do the moonshine/trader business without getting griefed by hackers/modders. You run across int'l players alot. they cuss you out and bully you with all their hacks and mods. Thanks rockstar! 

Should have bought story mode instead. so i can enjoy the game overall with no worries.

un playable without a posse and it costs a shit tone of in game money to make one and when you do, you will run into hackers every 10mins. 
The developers have a toddlers sense of balance because when you go do ANY THING alone you will just die and lose ammo. THATS IT you cannot do shit solo, on top of that if you encounter a player with a certain dead eye perk just exit the game. There is no point in playing even with a 2v1 you will both die.

Red Dead Online is an awsome well made game set in 1899 and has many different features.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
✅ Multiplayer
✅ A variety of difficulties
✅ Simple Controls
✅ Fun gameplay
✅ Graphically Stunning

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
⛔️ Cheaters

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay involves a lot of different elements. PvP, PvE and Roles are the main 3.

[h1]PvP:[/h1]
The PvP in red dead online is ok its just that hackers are quite common due to the anticheat in the game being terrible. Theres many different gamemodes you can play with friends or just random RDO lovers!

[h1]PvE:[/h1]
Theres plenty of missions where you are fighting npcs and blowing up stuff. But there is also many npcs around the map in general that you can fight or kill.

[h1]Roles:[/h1]
Bounty hunter, Naturalist, Moonshiner, Trader and collector are the 5 roles in the game. Moonshiner Costs 25 Gold (Plus The 15 Gold To Start Trader). Bounty Hunter Costs 15 Gold Bars (Plus Another 15 for Prestigious License). Trader costs 15 Gold as stated before and Naturalist costs 25 Gold.


In RDO its very common to encounter a cheater and sometimes can be quite frustrating but we will just have to wait for a new anticheat to stop these cheaters.


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Overall Red Dead Online is a good fun game and has an engaging story and is fun to play with friends. But only because of cheaters/hackers your experience may not be as good, but if your ok with a couple cheaters every so often then I think this game would be perfect for you!",1679769657,1682886914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yeehaw! Red Dead Online is the rootin' tootin'est wild west adventure this side of the Mississippi! The ginormous world out there is chock-full of risks and chances, and the gameplay is so immersive you'll forget you have a life outside of it. With so many activities and missions to choose from, you'll never be bored! Whether you're looking to join forces with fellow players to take down some pesky outlaws or venture out into the wild to hunt for elusive critters, there's always something exciting to discover. So saddle up, partner, and get ready for some rootin' tootin' fun! Wowza, these graphics are so stunning they make my eyes pop out like a cartoon character! And the attention to detail is so incredible, I feel like I'm in a microscopic world where every pixel has its own personality. Wow, even the pixels in this game have more life than my houseplants. The online community is like a big, warm hug from a friendly octopus. There are so many tentacles to help you out and join in on the silly shenanigans. Yeehaw! Red Dead Online is the rootinest, tootinest good time you'll ever have in the wild west. I reckon you'll love it if you're a fan of shootin', ridin', and livin' like a cowboy. Although there is quite a lot of cheaters which can get annoying

""The open world of Red Dead Online is a gateway to many experiences... some consider to be extraordinary.""

""Well, as the game's popularity grew, the developers saw an opportunity to capitalize on its success. They started prioritizing monetization over enhancing the core experience. As a result, they introduced numerous microtransactions and paid content that provided little value to the players.""

""Did that... ruin the game?""
""Over time, it did. As the developers became more focused on their greed for money, they neglected the essential aspects of the game and its community. Players began to lose interest, feeling that the game was becoming more of a cash grab than an immersive Wild West experience. The once thriving community started to dwindle, leaving behind a shell of what was once a remarkable game.""

[b]This is a neutral-positive review, I have just given it a thumbs down for issues explained below to urge Rockstar to actually do something about said issues. I have seen a lot of reviews that are truly negative, but thumbs ups. I don't think this is the right approach to get a massive company's attention.[/b] Beautiful graphics and rich content. This game is more engaging than any MMO I play. I really do recommend you buy it, only after reading the below disclaimer.

[b]For those looking to buy[/b]
Go in understanding Rockstar Games is notorious for having issues with hackers, and Red Dead II Online is no different. My best tip is playing in Defensive Mode (player menu \ online options \ playing style) which grants a huge PvP damage reduction (i.e. head shots only result in body shot damage instead of something like 500% damage), immunity from PvP melee, immunity from player dynamite, and immunity from PvP lasso. You cannot keep Defensive Mode if you attack first. Hackers can still burn you (may have been patched with dynamite), spawn enemy animals, and spawn developer(?) treasure chests that will get you banned if you loot them (never touch a chest with metal bands in free roam if you're paranoid like me). Rockstar cares about money, you will not be able to appeal an unfair ban like this. Despite what Rockstar advises, reporting cheaters/hackers is not the greatest idea: these malicious players use the account names of others and you'll likely not be able to stay still long enough to do so anyways. Instead, go to the main menu \ Online \ Free Roam, then rejoin free roam. If griefers are following you server to server, confirm you know everyone on your friends list via the player menu.
[b]Addon:[/b] Apparently hackers can also force you/your horse to wear [url=http://prntscr.com/21y1sxl]special items[/url]. The server swap trick still works in this case, swap servers immediately. This may or may not be my character after returning from AFK.

[b]Feedback[/b]
Rockstar, please:
(i) improve Defensive Mode to make defensive players immune to player dynamite and fires in free roam;
(ii) improve Defensive Mode or make a Passive Mode that wholly prevents griefing with other players, going as far as to prevent collision with them; and
(iii) have your folks spectating random lobbies in-game to catch cheaters/hackers. If you genuinely can't tell when a cheater/hacker is posing as another player, something is seriously wrong here.

[b]The game is also not the most friendly to genuinely new Red Dead players, and tutorials can take up to 30 hours of play time to appear in the game. However, plenty of fan tutorials exist on YouTube that are extremely helpful.[/b]

I hope you purchase this game regardless of the above issues, and if you own the game consider making a similar review. A bad review score is not great for Rockstar's income, and that may just be a catalyst for improvement.",1638305548,1682389523,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Why even put in the money and effort to make such an amazing game if you're just going to abandon it. Bugs and glitches litter online play, not to mention that the game sees no more updates on content in the middle of story missions. Jobs get old fast. Stables sometimes don't work properly causing you to restart the whole client waiting long periods of times on a loading screens and Rockstart essentially abandoned the game to which ill get to in a moment. 

I'd be able to excuse ALL of these due to how fun the game is and I'd be able to recommend it if it weren't for the sleezy, crappy, and absolute degenerate of human beings that mod and hack the game TO SPECIFICALLY grief people. I've ran into nice modders who were jsut messing with some settings. Typically just watching everyone from the distance and even playing vigilantes to stop the bad modders from ruining everyone's fun but the bad CLEARLY outwiegh the good as you'll find sh*t happening as follows that keeps you from enjoying the game: 

-Exploding randomly
-Any pelts you collect explode randomly
-Spawning of infinite predators that mawl you
-Spawning things on top of you
-crashing your game (I'll get to this. This one is a kicker.) 
-Impersonating you and getting you reported. (They can do that. They can change their user name and frame you for modding)
- Obtaining your IP for your computer. (They dont have the mental capacity to actually do anything with it but some do. Your security is basically at risk.) 
-They can track you and follow you from server to server just to ruin your day. (This happened to me once. Mans had no life and took pleasure in my grief despite me not having had said a single word for about a day. 

And remember when I said they can crash your computer? Well you're gonna love this. They can do it voluntarily and can program it so that when you REPORT them for cheating and griefing, your computer crashes and they get notified of who reported them. The nice modders I ran into explained this to me and I was in utter shock. Rockstar let this go on for quite a while and did nothing to fix it. Reporting them only paints a target on your back. The system is broken and there's no justice. Can't even get a refund on both online and regular version of the game. This is a breach in terms and conditions and as consumers, we should be entitled to a refund if we can't even use the product as intended. 

Rockstar is so embarrassed by this that they basically abandoned the game saying there will be no more updates for it. Crap security for anti cheats and hacks and crappy practices. Save yourself the headache and money. Don't buy this game. I honestly would even go as far as don't support Rockstar anymore. This is how they treat their games that are not GTA. It's sad. All that money they make and they can't create a good security system. THe game uses PEER TO PEER CONNECTION!! WHAT THE F*CK? NO COMPANY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD USE THAT BECAUSE IT PUTS PEOPLE AT RISK OF HAVING THEIR PERSONAL INFO LIKE THEIR IP STOLEN! Who does this? 

Again, GTA and RDR are amazing games but, until rockstar can do something about the modders (specifically the ones who only grief players) I can't within good conscious recommend any of their products. I just wanted to enjoy the game with my wife RDR Online gets a 1/10 for the lack of policing and the fact that the game is unplayable do to modding griefers that have nothing better to do with their lives than to spread suffering for their own enjoyment.

Yeah there are fun modders that do wacky stuff, give people supplies or help, nice people just making the game more goofy.

But most of the time, instakill, godmode in pvp, effects, attaching stuff to people, hogtie over and over. Just being the scum of the earth

To play this you'd have to have your own mods so you can defend yourself against griefer modders, especially from the game crashers.

Red dead 2 by itself is a nice game, lots of enjoyment, but people ruined the online and rockstar doesn't seem to care, something as simple as adding EAC to the online would help a ton

If you're willing to risk getting crashed, instakilled or have to leave a game because someone teleport hogties you constantly, yeah play the game, otherwise just play the singleplayer and enjoy the game for what it is

I don't even know where to begin expressing the depth of my love for you. From the moment I met you, I knew that you were the one for me. You light up my world with your smile and your infectious laugh. I cannot imagine a single day without you in my life.

Your beauty, both inside and out, captivates me every single day. Your kind heart, your unwavering support, and your unconditional love make me feel like the luckiest person in the world. Every time I look into your eyes, I am reminded of the incredible love that we share and I feel a sense of peace and happiness that I never knew existed.

I am grateful for every moment that we have shared together. From our first date to the adventures we have had, every moment with you is a treasure that I will cherish forever. You have taught me so much about love, patience, and kindness, and I felt like a better person for having you in my life.

As I write this letter,  I am  grateful  for the amazing woman that you are. I promise to always be there for you, to support you, and to love you. You are my soulmate, my best friend, and my true love. 

I will always remember the times we spent playing Red Dead Online together and created all those wonderful memories from the drinking at the moonshine bar and dancing and laughing and slapping each other around till we ended up falling on the floor.  Flying off our horses and doing wild stuff with matching outfits and looking badass as hell. I'll never be able to experience this game the same without you 💔 .  I love you....

Forever and always,
Crossxfires  (Jason)

Red Dead Redemption 2, developed and published by Rockstar Games, is a sprawling open-world action-adventure game set in the late 1800s, during the declining years of the Wild West era. Released in 2018 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and later for PC, Red Dead Redemption 2 quickly garnered critical acclaim for its breathtaking graphics, engaging gameplay, and captivating story. As a prequel to the original Red Dead Redemption game, Red Dead Redemption 2 provides players with an immersive experience as they step into the boots of Arthur Morgan, a member of the infamous Van der Linde gang. With its meticulous attention to detail, deep character development, and vast open world to explore, Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece.

One of the first things that stands out in Red Dead Redemption 2 is its stunning visual design. The game features a meticulously crafted open world that is vast, diverse, and teeming with life. From the lush forests of New Hanover to the arid deserts of New Austin, each region of the game world feels distinct and has its own unique beauty. The attention to detail is astonishing, with dynamic weather patterns, realistic animal behavior, and stunning vistas that make the world come alive. Whether it's watching a sunset over the plains or seeing the snow crunch under Arthur's boots as he trudges through a blizzard in the mountains, the visual fidelity of Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of breathtaking.

The gameplay in Red Dead Redemption 2 is equally impressive. As Arthur Morgan, players will engage in a wide range of activities, including hunting, fishing, horseback riding, robbing trains, and engaging in epic gunfights. The controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing players to easily navigate the game world and engage in various activities. The combat system is well-designed, with a mix of shooting and cover mechanics that make gunfights intense and satisfying. Players can also interact with the world around them, from talking to NPCs and engaging in meaningful conversations to making decisions that impact the story and gameplay.

One of the standout features of Red Dead Redemption 2 is its deep and complex characters. Arthur Morgan is a flawed protagonist who is torn between his loyalty to the Van der Linde gang and his own moral compass. As players progress through the game, they will witness Arthur's character arc, as he grapples with his past, makes difficult choices, and comes to terms with his own morality. The supporting cast of characters is equally compelling, with each member of the Van der Linde gang having their own unique personalities, motivations, and relationships with Arthur. The writing is top-notch, with well-written dialogue and memorable interactions that draw players into the story and create a deep emotional connection with the characters.

The story in Red Dead Redemption 2 is epic and engrossing. The game's narrative spans across several years and is filled with twists, turns, and moments of both triumph and tragedy. As Arthur Morgan, players will experience a richly crafted story that delves into the complexities of loyalty, family, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The game explores themes of morality, civilization versus the wild, and the changing landscape of the West as it transitions from an untamed frontier to a modern society. The writing is superb, with well-defined characters, meaningful dialogue, and a sense of authenticity that draws players into the world of the game.

In addition to its engaging story and characters, Red Dead Redemption 2 offers a vast open world to explore. The game world is filled with a staggering amount of detail, from the bustling towns and cities to the serene countryside and remote wilderness areas. Players can embark on various activities such as hunting

There is griefing yes but you can just go in defensive or switch sessions so don't listen to those people who hate on the game because the got killed by a griefer and are terrible at pvp.

While great at first, Red Dead Online’s ongoing support has been declining. There used to be weekly updates that brought new content to the game, and when was the last time we had any content updates? Last June, and it was a minor update, feeling like a filler update leaving us hoping for something much bigger. When was the last major update that added a new role which offered a completely new way to play? Nearly two years ago, July 2020. Where's our ever-evolving world we were promised?

One of the game’s major issues additionally worth pointing out because it ultimately hurts the game’s experience is cheaters and hackers. They comprise of about half the players you will see. If you are looking for PvP, this is not the game for you, at least on PC. The gunplay is amazing, but cheaters ruined it and it is now, and has been for the longest time, heavily discouraged in wanting to engage in any form of PvP. You may shoot somebody, only to wonder why they don’t lose health, you keep shooting them over and over again, and they never die, even from one-shot kill headshots. Then the next thing you know, many of them further ruin your gameplay experience by deciding they want to “fight back” with their cheats and spawn a cage on you, or even spawning explosions on your feet constantly, killing you over and over until you switch sessions, or even straight up crashing your game. Ironically, these are the reasons it is more fun to play this online multiplayer game by yourself. True solo content is offered, but you have to look for it.

While it may be a fun new game for newer players, this is one of Rockstar Games’ examples that have hurt hopes for their games’ longevities for us more veteran players. Yes, the Red Dead Online title has much to offer, where I would guarantee a few month’s worth of playtime, but there is generally not much reason to come back afterwards.

My ultimate verdict: beautiful game with lots of potential and a bit of replayability, and maybe I’ll admit, some grind, but we know Rockstar Games won’t put out content anytime soon. They also will refuse to address any cheating problems. They will do nothing about your reports, even with video evidence. Great game, poor support. 5/10

2023 now and no hope the game is getting saved. Thanks Rockstar.",1654349097,1680929181,False,266,14,0.863817811012268066,2,True,False,False

Update it gets WORSE, they cant keep the hackers out of most of the free roam events so those arent much fun. Defensive mode and reporting seems to do absolutely nothing, when a hacker decides to ride your ass they can just keep killing you until you quit the game. As they seem to also have an ability to teleport directly to you. Or they can harass you buy repeatedly killing your horse, keep you from finishing missions, or seemingly even just forcing your game to close. Though that last one could just be coincidence hard to tell as their servers dont ever seem to be doing to well.

Also I don't know if it was hackers our a glitch as I never saw another player nearby, but Once I was killed by a large cat, only to have the cat seemingly spawn at my location each time I respawned. This repeated several times until there was even bears and crap. Maybe somehow I just ended up in an area incredibly dense with the things, either way it was absolutely horrid, took an hour and countless deaths for me to finally get away.

Surrounded by other player waiting for the train free roam event, the exact second after it starts my character drops dead, it claims  I left the play area. Nobody else seemed to be affected.

From one side the character creation, world, mechanics and roles are pretty good.
From the other side, the game is dead and doesn't have anyone playing it (as far as i've seen in connected players menu), why?
Because the game doesn't get any updates and people get sick of the same content that isn't changing, rockstar abandoned such a good game, and i don't know why they have broke up the whole project while keeping on updating and giving flying cars for tryhards in GTA V online.
Let's be real, some people want the grind and to play missions without having the same experience, even tho I am more connected to the free roam itself, I want other people to enjoy too.
Even with that, if you have friends to play with this game is 100% RECOMMENDED.

SUMMARY (less details): The Mechanics and roles are good, the game has no players and gets no updates.
If you are the type of players who just like to free roam or to play with friends it is 100% RECOMMENDED.

NOTE: Sometimes you will find a cheater or 2 (or more) due to rockstar not giving sh*t on anticheat.

- It has a lot of modders (hackers/cheater) that grief you with cheats
- It is mostly abandoned by rockstar

If you can look beyond those issues then this game is truly amazing. I've never played a game that paid so much attention to detail with a world that felt so alive. It truly responds accurately to almost everything you do.

Abandoned by rockstar is the only thing that truly stops this game from being of the greatest multiplayer games of all time. If they added more content like in GTA online then this game would explode. I suspect they don't do it because the western genre is more niche than GTAO.

Until i got to the online part.

THE INSTANT I logged back in, there was a douche trying to start a fight. I was playing with my BF (his first time trying it for years) spawned at his camp and some moron spawn killed him before he even had a chance to fight back. Then we both got harrassed by the same MF even though we had defensive and low threat on our character.  Honestly, it was not fun and frustrating as fuck as we just wanted to enjoy the game and learn it without the f*cktards griefing us while we are low level and learning the game. What a waste of money. Really ruined this game for me. Not sure i'll even bother again. A bit of PVP is fine. But to be constantly respawned only to be gunned down straight after by the incel who obviously has nothing better to do than target new players.

Pretty fun once you get settled in with rational controls and get past the fact that your party members won't get rewarded. Let's see how round 2 goes!This online experience is a watered down experience compared to the single player game. The keymappings for PC are poorly done and in in the intro it keeps trying to tell you to use left mouse button to mount your horse... too bad you need to hit E. That one experience explains 90% of the interactions for this game. Normal things are janky, your horse dies if you step on the wrong shadow, find and meeting up with friends is a nightmare. Just like the janky horses who die at the slightest breeze this ""online"" version of RD2 should be put out of its misery.Still not that fun after roughly another dozen hours. I like the music, the visuals are stunning, but the content is fairly light weight and boring after a while. Some of the more high level bounties with stories are actually pretty fun.Adding some more updates after ~90 hours of gameplay. Most fun professions from best to worst: 1. Moonshiner ~ kudos to this team. The story mission are fantastic and the level of difficulty makes it quality2. Bounty Hunter ~ legendary missions are pretty fun, but the game breaking bug where posse members don't get rewards can fuck right off... fix. this. shit. seriously3. Trader - doing the ""long"" deliveries and having Players interact have been some of my favorite moments of this game =D Exactly the type of thing I want from online old west. 4.  Naturalist - until you hit rank 5 you have to chase non large critters around with a varmet gun shooting them over and over again with ineffective drugged shots. Boring. After rank 5 legendary hunts are pretty fun but repetative. 5. Collector - GuhhhhhhhStill don't recommend it due to the game breaking posse issue where not all members get rewards (exp/gold/RDO$). The deves should play coop for a while and track the rewards for non posse leaders the issue would stand out immediately. The worst part is people payed really $$$ for some of the content assuming they didn't farm in-game gold to buy the professions.",1610828318,1679761559,True,0,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

If you are playing with friends I recommend setting up your own private server, this will miss some of the interactions with other players and some of the PvP fun, but its so much better than putting up with the hackers.  Over 200 hours now on a private server with no FFFFFF8 crashes.  Before this on a public server every couple of hours it happened.

The landscapes are amazing, the weather effects are impressive, and the sounds are great - they have really nailed the sound of different horses, at different speeds, on different surfaces.   Animal A.I is good, getting chased by wolves, ride past some deer to distract them.   There is even humor to be found in the game - with possums playing possum.   Trader role is great for making money, the moonshiner storyline was good, and the different missions add good flavour to the role.  Naturalist is so slow to level, especially if you want to trade occassionally for $.",1679525266,1679525266,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Beat it, loved it, kept playing it.
Online was released, and I played that with a friend up until rank 15, due to console players being extremely toxic. We couldn't find peace and enjoy the game.
Recently, I got online on steam, so I could enjoy it with the same friend, who explained that toxic players on pc are lacking.
They were right for the most part.
    Don't get me wrong, this game is incredible.
This game is beautiful.
But this game has problems.

Online is littered with hackers, who spawn cougars and other dangerous animals on top of you. They put explosives on your head, teleport you around, and overall just destroy the game experience.
Changing servers won't even work anymore with how common they are in the game, and with 181 hours on record, it's sad, because I haven't played as long as most people and I've seen more than enough to decide my review on the game.
You can report for disruptive behavior, which includes griefing, but nothing will be done.

Rockstar doesn't care about RD Online.
Rockstar doesn't care about their community.
Rockstar doesn't care to use the money they get from said community, to improve the game and anti-cheat system that they could add.

Online gets so few updates that are worthwhile, and it's tiresome seeing a game with so much potential and people playing it staying in the gutters.
    Until the hacking is fixed, and only until then, this game will keep this downgrade of a review from me.

Rockstar doesn't care.

|| EDIT ||

477 hours now, in hopes that the game would be fixed and updated.
Rockstar abandoned red dead online fully.
There's a horrid stable glitch, and while they announced that they weren't going to update the game anymore, the least they could do is fix the fucking glitches for what players they have that are staying loyal to this game.
Reinstalled it of hopes of nostalgia just to be left extremely disappointed and annoyed.
Want to play this game?
Don't.
Do the story mode instead, because they don't care enough to do anything with online, and the base game is better.",1623040040,1678953465,False,150,5,0.860375404357910156,0,True,False,False

Alot of glitches and bugs are easily fixable but have not been the past 4 years its been released, and the amount of hacking and greifing, and harassment going on in game is also an easy manage but has not been fixed in the past 4 years.

The plotline is simple and basic, which would be fine if there were more than 9 episode to it. Its so easy to blow through all the missions, especially when a posse member is a higher level then you. Theirs no real goal to gaining exp or upgrading or levelling up after the nine episode plotline as side missions never change and are the same basic bullshit over and over again with minimum reward, it starts to get so tedious.

Why am I sticking around? Why am I still playing this game and grinding ? If I cant use my weaponry or horses ive been working hard to level up for and unlock in anything new, then whats the damn point of playing this game? You could do all 9 episodes in less than two hours of buying this game. Its not worth 30$ and in fact with all the glitches and bugs id say its barely worth 15$.

The thing is though: This game is gorgeous. The graphics and animations are fantastic. The missions are fun the first few times around, and I like that they give quite a few customisation options to you, your equipment and your horse. I like that their is certain classes so to speak you can join aswell. Its unique addition to the wild west theme. BUT every other point mentioned still stands. it ruins a majority of the game to the point you dont want to play anymore.

These are easy fixes by the way. VERY easy, so im confused why in 4 years ROCKSTAR has never made a damn effort. They should add more plotline / storyline quests, and update some every few months or so, to keep the player interested in playing. There should be unique side missions maybe even unique to the classes added every once in a while too, to keep the grinding for exp fresh and not a chore, and make the game worth buying and playing.

The controls for laptop are bullshit. PC is difficult when you have a lasso, but forget it with a laptop. You cant even pull out your goddamn rope properly. Its difficult to turn and aim and then shoot with a fucking mouse, they should atleast add options for the camera or sensitive on the mouse to fix it.

PVP is so ridiculous. I was a beginer, just loaded into the game after buying it and got headshotted 7 times before I could even take two goddamn steps. They waited at my respawning point. Why isnt there a passive mode, especially for first time players? This is such an insanely easy fix and so annoying to go through, and it doesnt happen once, it has happened many times.

to go on with that, the amount of hackers in this game rival on ridiculous. Ive seen people hack weapons, explosives, and death modes where they cant die and constatnly blow up players or there horses nonstop, it even follows them over changing servers. How are you expecting anyone to buy this game and play it if they cant even take a few steps and try a damn mission without someone ruining it for them?

Then theres the stable glitch. You go in with your horse and get stuck and cannot move. You cannot access your menu or anything. You have no choice but to task manager and end the game that way. Are you kidding me? Why wasnt this tested and run through during beta? Its been four years and you still havent fixed it?
Ive had this glitch happen SIX TIMES IN A ROW. after that i called it a night and shut my damn pc off.

weaponry is so few and basic, why so little options when this game is based on the west? Shooting is part of the whole point to rdr2, yet most weaponry are the same stats and theirs only about eight choices to choose from and their all locked to ridiculous levels, why would i want to spend my time grinding boring delivery missions till i can eventually unlock a weapon at 40 that has no discernible features to any other and has the tiniest differences in stats?

lastly, the horses. The horse options are good but I think more should be added in color and variation. Again the lock grinding is a pain when the missions are so boring, please for the love of God consider fixing rdr2 online.

this game has such potential to be a fantastic MMO but God does it fall short at the moment

I would recommend jumping up levels, Gearing up via nefarious means and enjoying CaC simulator since this game was abandoned after they couldnt make it more PVP heavy since ya know, that is the content. Player animosity towards players EXCEPT, This game didnt turn out that way for the most part which is wild once you look at GTA online and its insane hacking problem.

We the players merely wanted a CO OP Cowboy experience we could laugh, Cry, love and enjoy across the board. 

INstead Rockstar took a huge S H I T on our chests and charged us for it. 

0/10 - For greed, lackluster content, actually it got 4 professions and less than 10 story missions.

5.89/10 - Content being modified different online to artifically extend mission time to A: Make the map feel bigger, B: make missions take long and C: same R formula, longer it takes more you get paid.

HOWever if you can look past all of this, The hunting is relaxing, The Fishing and canoes are also lovely.

I just cant recommend a game like this that got abandoned despite players begging for more content. If you do buy it, go find a Gold dropper and dont waste a cent more as Rockstar really does not deserve it for the ONLINE.

Now the MAIN GAME of RDR2 is a delightful Gem and worth full price even today. The online however was a senseless cash grab riddled with hackers who got so bored, most left.",1678732123,1678732406,False,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

It's a horrible, horrible experience playing online and trying to enjoy the game as intended. I can't seem to join a single Posse without cheaters, you can NEVER, EVER reliably enjoy a fair Player Versus Player conflict. Every single game mode is packed with cheaters. 
Winning doesn't matter. Losing doesn't matter. Money and Gold don't matter. Daily you will see cheaters spawning infinite gold chests.
I haven't yet mentioned the fact that Rockstar provably does not care about this game because it doesn't generate billions of dollars like their godforsaken GTA5 ""Shark Cards"" whatever the hell that is.

This really was may favorite game and my favorite online game and I just could never in good faith suggest this game to someone. Maybe single-player.
The only Good side, is there is a growing Red Dead Roleplay community.  You can go to redm.net and get the Mod which requires a discord account.

NOTE: YOUR horse is probably the most annoying thing in this game. IT has only 2 modes:

A: In your proximity making sure your aim draws on him, and not the 20 other NPC who trying to kill you and you need to Sush him away to finally able to defend yourself.

B: 3 Miles away from you making sure that if you are chasing someone and trying to call him, he never catches up, because apparently you can also sprint faster than your horse. Even if it finally get near to you it will stop like a good 40 meter behind you, so you actually need to stop the chase and sprint back to him because why would he run up to you?

I had grown up in a small, conservative town where people of color were few and far between, and my upbringing had taught me to be suspicious and wary of anyone who looked different from me.

But as I approached the person, I realized that my assumptions and prejudices were unfounded. This person was just like me in many ways - they had a job, a family, and dreams for the future. As we passed each other on the street, I felt a twinge of guilt for my initial reaction. I realized that my narrow-mindedness had been holding me back from seeing the world in a more compassionate and open way.

Seeing that person made me realize that I needed to confront my own biases and start actively working towards being more inclusive and accepting of people from all walks of life. It's not always easy to change the way we think, but it's important to try, and to take steps towards being a better person and a more empathetic member of society.

Have ignored my request to reset my account or try other fixes which could provide workarounds that could at least let me play while they find a dev or tester who isn't death-marching on GTA6. https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-confirms-end-of-major-red-dead-online-support

The issue I'm having seems to be related to the stables bug which has been outstanding for months, but has received no real attention. Certainly no fix - just a workaround, which - because I'm stuck in a tutorial sequence - doesn't work.

Not a great experience for someone who has seen what looks like interesting open world game play, but hasn't been able to scratch the surface of this bug. If I launch the game, I cannot exit the quest sequence I'm stuck in. Options to leave are greyed out. I can only close the game via Task Manager. I can't even get back to the entry point to the quest sequence I get stuck in.

This seems like some pretty fundamentally broken game logic. You should always be able to get back to a game's main menu. You should always be able to back out of a quest sequence. This is garbage, and the level of support is no better. Three week's worth of ""We can't replicate this"" (presumably because they haven't bothered to clone my character onto a test server) and ""Your ticket is on hold.""

Not good enough.

No text chat.  Really sucks if you're deaf or hard of hearing.  This game isn't deaf friendly by any stretch of the imagination.  And it also makes the game feel self isolating which is NOT a good thing for an multi player game.  It really limits the player community TBH, sure text chat might expand griefing and general assholery, but it also makes the game more multi player friendly.   RIght now..at times it feels like you're playing a single player game with far less content if you want to stay in defensive mode.  

Occasional crashes. 

Griefers and cheaters.  

The graphics are awesome and gameplay...the latter up to a extent.

So much potential.  And poorly executed on Rockstar's part.

If Rockstar really wanted to bring hacking and cheating to a screeching halt..just park some RDO characters with anti hack/cheat tools operated by Rockstar employees in the game...undercover of course. Then that'd lead to quite a few cheaters/hackers getting permabanned.  They'd never know if Character So-so is actually a Rockstar employee waiting in ambush for them...

Right.

Upgrade your weapons? Tried that. No dice. Your starting level isn't high enough to upgrade.

Bring a friend? I did.

Out of the four missions, there is this one requiring multiple firefights on horseback using the .22LR they give you against thugs using pump-action shotguns. They do NOT need to aim, YOU are required to do so.

And....it was no less than fifteen against the two of us.

But wait, there's more! The glitches in this game are like tangerines that have been left out in the sun too long and have gone all squishy and gross on the inside. And the storyline? Well, it's about as confusing as trying to eat a pear without peeling it first. But hey, who needs a coherent plot when you can just shoot stuff and ride horses all day?

For context: I have been a horse girl for nearly 20 years and I am currently horseless and thus desperate for a good horse game. Those are practically non-existent, so in my time of need I turned to RDO.

The game is gorgeous. The horses are beautiful & the horse mechanics are wonderful. There is something so incredibly satisfying just riding across the vast landscape on the back of your horse. It really is soothing. I spent most of my time simply riding from town to town, murdering and looting the NPC travelers along the way as a form of therapy. It really worked.

The actual game-play itself is dull, repetitive, and marred with the fact that other people exist and will constantly try to ruin your day. I encountered far too many hackers that made it their mission to make game-play impossible for no reason at all. From time to time I would meet a cool group of people who would follow me around and assist me in my adventures, but they were rare. I certainly never felt comfortable enough to ever use the speech chat feature.

So, while the game helped get me through a very rough time in my life and also filled the internal need I have to ride a horse, I cannot recommend it until solo-play or dedicated private servers are a feature. And for those who recommend simply playing RDR2 the solo game... I don't want to play as a man. I want to play as a self-insert. RDO gives me that ability through character creation and that is my favorite feature of the game.

2. Amount of grind is classic R*. You have nothing unlocked in the beginning, your weapons deal little to no damage. You earn 10-20$ for super grindy missions where enemies spawn every 5-10 seconds so yeah, forget about completing ANY mission in a similar manner to SP RDR2.
3. Amount of content is not even close to what GTA Online offers ( I'm not saying GTA Online is good, no. GTAO is a game that got sucked all the goddamn blood and energy it had for 10 years after release. It's completely dead. What's funnier is that R* managed to kill it's newest 2020 RDROnline in such a short time ( I just hope all the efforts go to GTA6, otherwise they just screwed up big time.
4. No private lobbies, griefers, and OF COURSE, cheaters. I don't think I should really explain this.
