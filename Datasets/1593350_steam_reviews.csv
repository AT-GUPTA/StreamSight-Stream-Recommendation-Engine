If you liked Clicker Heroes, Adventure Capitalist, Firestone, etc... then give this a try but know it is NOT a clone of those games.

Regardless of opinion about the UI, Story or methods of how things are gathered, crafted, moved, etc... I went ahead and purchased the game as a signal of SUPPORT for the developer to enhance this little gem.

The DEMO encapsulates Chapter 1 (which took me about 8 hours to complete)... I'm writing this review as I am currently in Chapter 2 of the 11 total available so far.  

I HIGHLY recommend just trying the DEMO as you have NOTHING to lose.  This is a UNIQUE blend of micro-management optimizing that funnels into automation and then backpedals as you learn new skills when you progress to the next chapter.

It's a unique, minimalistic take on a fun indie genre, but instead of taking the best elements of incremental games in a new direction, it takes the worst. The typical incremental game formula mixes spans of time when you don't have to interact with the game to gain slow, steady progress with the option to intervene at any time to speed things up and accelerate yourself through the true progression of the game. Drop in, drop out, the game is waiting for you whenever you want to step in. Increlution instead alternates between 10-15 minutes per run of complete non-interactivity and the remainder of a run being a careful hunt for optimization to get the most experience you can out of your current life before health decay catches up to you. The latter would be interesting on its own, but the quarter hour of staring at progress bars between each attempt feels like a punishment for daring to want to have fun.

The tantalizing hint of an idling reward amounts to a way to skip through the initial wait.... once. When you reach the end of your autocomplete unlocks, the game pauses and burns the rest of the accumulated idle time, returning to normal speed. This creates a loop that encourages reopening the game every half an hour just to poke at it for a few minutes then close it after dying. You don't play the game, the game plays you ‚Äî on its schedule.

Increlution totally reverses the freedom of how to engage that most idle games encourage, and I have to say the end result is the most unsatisfying compulsive behavior in my life since I quit drinking. $3 is cheaper than half a bottle of straight Campari, but the thought of how much time and anxiety I've put into this game is equally nauseating.",1646843875,1703516898,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

So of course, if you think incremental games are stupid, you obviously won't like it. It's all about the grind.
However, for the fans of the genre, this is a jewel you won't want to miss.

I have completed the game (Took 9 days and some hours from my life) and I find this is one of the truly fun incremental games out there.

Increlution is written with great imagination and the story is captivating. I kept being reminded of the Epic of Gilgamesh, or Homer's Odyssey. You want to see what's behind that door that you just can't reach just yet. So it keeps you enthralled. I would call it pleasantly frustrating. (And the author is obviously versed in mathematics and has done some truly infuriating things). Sometimes I wouldn't touch it for a whole week. but my progress was there, waiting for me to return. 

I kept being reminded of the Epic of Gilgamesh, or Homer's Odyssey. The game takes place in an unnamed ancient world that truly feels mythical.

Everything  starts off simple with a railroaded path so you can learn the basics of the game as it increases in complexity. You'll see minor path branches, major splits in content, and eventually reach a point where you're deciding which chapter to tackle in which order. Eventually, you'll turn all of that into non-choices with unlocks in later chapters, allowing you to focus on more recent chapters. In a word, it slowly ramps up in complexity until you're reconsidering choices across 5 chapters for the sake of efficiency based on which one allows you to survive longer, complete a difficult task, or what have you.

Original review:
At the time of this review, I'm at the end of Chapter 2 with about 600 HP and 200 Instinct levels in just about every skill.

I came back to the game and gave it a second try.

You will need to pick and choose what you do at first. Why? Time is always against you. Period. The good part? You gain both temporary and permanent levels that help you do things faster in the next run. Do I wish it was a little faster? Always but the game isn't bad. Eventually, you'll reach a point where you're completing an action multiple times per second. My personal recommendation is to always focus on houses and food as your first priorities.

Eventually, you'll complete each action enough times to also unlock automation. As expected, automation allows you to set priorities for actions to control when they're done. This will lead you to simply let the game run for a bit(20-40 minutes) before you have to do a few manual actions to finish the run.

What is it that kills you and ends your run? Well, you have a stat called decay that drains your HP as you do actions. Don't worry! The game pauses itself when your character isn't doing anything! However, decay builds up by 25% per minute. You can build things that reduce your decay by 50% but you will still die. Also, the more runs you do and the longer you survive, the bigger the HP bonus you get at the end of your run.

So, how do you combat the effect of decay? Gathering food to eat to restore your HP. Your inventory has a number in the top right corner that lists the maximum decay your food stash can handle. You will start to slowly run out of HP once decay passes that number. 

On the topic of healing, the game does NOT waste healing potential. If your lowest healing food restores 20 HP, then the game waits until decay has drained 20 HP before automatically eating 1 of your lowest food.

The game is beautiful in initial simplicity. You perform actions until you die. Your next run shows you completing those same actions a little bit faster until you die. Then, the run after that shows you making a bit more headway on progress. You hit a wall, die 3-5 times, and then you're able to pass the wall. The simplicity of the gameplay loop is both rewarding in with the emphasis on short term goals and in how you get faster at actions with each run.

How do your actions get faster and faster? Through two kinds of skill levels gained from performing actions; generation and instinct levels. Instinct levels persist through every run while generation levels are reset upon death. Each instinct level increases it's skill bonus by 1.01^level, providing a 1% increase to your instinct level's skill multiplier. Generation levels increase it's skill bonus by 1.05^level, providing a 5% increase to your generation level's skill multiplier. Finally, your instinct and generation multipliers for a skill are multiplied together to get the skill multiplier. The higher your skill multiplier, the quicker you're able to do actions related to that skill.

Finally, by Chapter 2, you encounter your first optional task called ""Campfire Party"" and completing it will double the HP you gain on death. According to the forums, there are also optional constructions and such with other effects that increase experience, multiply a skill multiplier, branching paths with temporary rewards, and other effects that change the core gameplay.",1637913538,1699257105,True,0,0,0.482758641242980957,0,True,False,True

At first glance, this is a fantastic game.  You go as far as you can, doing things, until you starve to death.  Each time, you get a little further. Even better, once you do something enough times, you can automate the task.  Some things are difficult, and require you to run through several lives to get to the point where you can complete it, but each time, you get a little better, a little faster.

And then comes chapter 10 and 11.  See, there are several things you can't do right away, even if you tried.  Fighting the jaguar, fighting the gorilla, the hydra...each one gives you significant bonuses, but actually trying them, and the penalty for the attempt is too severe.  You just lose health too fast, and even fighting everything up to chapter 11, you still get exp too slow.  And, that's ok...they are optional.  Just go around, right?  Except that chapter 10 and 11 are nothing BUT high penalty tasks.  Not only is there a huge penalty for trying them, but a huge penalty for failing...and to succeed, your skill has to be a great deal higher than what you already have.  It took three days to get past one of them in chapter 10, and as for chapter 11?  Not a chance.  It's a gimmicky boss fight.

It's also supposed to be replayable, with bonuses given per play through.  This was to reward players before the game was in final for going through, and keep them interested.  With chapter 10 taking so long, and chapter 11 just being an exercise in self abuse, I'm not seeing as how I would ever want to replay, even with the bonuses.",1698262206,1698262206,False,14,2,0.587474286556243896,0,True,False,True

This game initially felt like a ""Waiting Simulator"" to me and I intended to refund it, but am very thankful I gave it a chance. The gamechanger for me was understanding the core mechanics. The main flaw to this game IMO is that the mechanics that make this game unique/incredibly-interesting aren't obvious (at least they weren't to me) until I saw a thread for the formulas to the game in the very active, interesting, and helpful Discord server for the game. 

I believe there is some charm in not making this information obvious as it gives players more ability to experience/learn on their own, but I'm not sure if this is worth turning-off some players who may not be interested in the game if not for knowing about this great feature/mechanic.

Sorry for the wordy/non-concise review, but I really felt a NEED to amend my review as this has become one of my favorite incremental/idle games of all time.

The concept behind this game is very similar to another idle game called Idle Loops by Stopsign
The game is still updated but not by stopsign
I call them similar because, well
Both games have this list of tasks concept
Both games have a constantly draining meter before loops reset
Both games have the levels and an instinct meter that stays with you through the loops

That's where the similarities end however and with the exception of one thing i prefer idle loops and heres why
The idling and micromanaging of idle loops is so much more enjoyable
The list of tasks you've built is kept between cycles and you decide how you want to go about your time remaining
Here with Incredulation you've only got on average 5-7 tasks on screen at any time and if you aren't actively watching every second of the new unautomated tasks your wasting your own time as the game does nothing 
where as idle loops gives you speedup points at a loss for having the game paused. it also allows you to flip back and forth between any location you've been to before so you can build your list up and manage it how you wish. 
The other problem is what happens at the end. you die
idle loops? game immediately begins again following the list of tasks you've set for it even if you didn't reach those tasks before dying
Incredulation, you've got to wait 20, 30, 40 minutes to even get back to new content and if you aren't paying attention YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME AGAIN.
The micromanaging, this game seems to think its a realistic goal to strive for, but 30 minutes of micromanaging, in what hyper-fixation would some one want to do that, that sucks.
idle loops you can shift your list at any point in time to make it more efficient, more grindy,
want to level your skill and focus on that, change the list to reflect that, incredulation? there's no grinding, its hurry up and wait with 10 minutes of a couple button presses until your dead or there's nothing else to do but wait to explore the next area.
The most I've built a list has been clicking back in forth between two food options so i can try to reach the automation point. or between some wood option and whatever I'm spending the wood on. There's no fun micromanaging, only waiting to do something else,
That's all this game is, waiting simulator.",1689286595,1689286595,False,3,0,0.485618501901626587,0,True,False,True

Gameplay happens in 30-40 minute bursts. The first 5-25 minutes of which, depending on your progress specifics, can be skipped with buffer time from idling. 

From there, you fine-tune progression curves ala IdleLoops or Stuck in Time. 
Where Stuck in Time focused more on graphics and exploration 

Increlution is condensed down to the core of what makes an incremental:
- Number Go Up (Good!)
- Bar start left and bar go right (Progress!)
- Cycle start over (Again!)
- Maybe get new thing to discover (Happy!)

With a progression curve that is slow but rewarding and ramping complexity of systems and buttons to fiddle, this can be played by applying thought and care, or you just go again and brute force your way through. Both approaches work and can be fun. 

I'm very excited to see the further evolution of this, but the value is already there, and it's already a polished and worthwhile experience.

Basically how it works is you play the game and level up skills as you go. For example, gathering berries gets you farming experience. When you die, you lose your 'generation' experience, but keep your 'instinct' experience. Generation experience levels up faster and gives you more speed than instinct, but instinct perseveres throughout runs. So after a run you might have farming at 1.2x from instinct (you perform the action 1.2x faster than normal). As you play your next run, both generation and instinct will level up, increasing this, and you will be slightly faster than the last run via instinct. Using this, you can accomplish more and more every run.

Basically how the actual game works is your health slowly depletes and you must try to stay alive as much long as possible (which will also increase your hp, I'm at 111 after 4 runs, 100 is base). Berries restore 5 health, for example, and you will auto eat them whenever you are missing 5 health or 4 seconds has passed. As time goes on, your loss of health increases. You can build carts (increase inventory), huts (halves corruption), and explore areas.

You can also queue tasks, and the game pauses when those tasks are done. For example, you could start picking berries and queue cutting wood after. Once those two are done (you've gotten the max of 10 each) the game will pause and wait for you to select another task. You will also unlock automation eventually, which you can adjust (high, med, low).

Like I said at the top, it's not massively interesting, but it's a good time if you're half-listening to something or want an easy, relaxing game.

My only half-complaint is that the game has no music. I understand that it would be hard to have a continuous music that wouldn't be annoying, but Orb of Creation did it just fine. Either way, can't beat it for $4.

It includes some features of idle games like the fact that you don't constantly need to actively play and the typical game mechanics of ""numbers go bigger"", including New Game+ mechanics... However it isn't quite an idle game at it's heart.

You can't simply make progress from letting the game run in idle for hours and hours at end. The game-play loop is more of a cycle between 15~25 minutes of idle followed by 5~15 minutes of active game play and decision making. (The game does have an optional sound notification when it needs your attention after an ""idle"" period.)

Another big characteristic of the game is the text adventure and story telling along the way. The story is fairly engaging and humorous and there's a lot of opportunities of choosing different paths through the chapters. The choices you make usually don't have a large impact on the story, but they are important in terms of strategy for your progression.

Ultimately the game is about progressing through the story by leveling up a set of skills (by spending time performing actions that use that skill) and sometimes switching paths in order to give you some different perks which better suit your needs at the time.

Overall, I think it's a fun and unique game and if you think any of the aspects I described might appeal to you, you should probably check out the demo version and see for yourself.",1681032218,1681032218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The mechanics are relatively straightforward, but I find a good balance of idle and active; you can generally automate most of a run (typically ~20-35) minutes and just play the last bit that's still new and interesting.  Or you can micromanage throughout the run and get a fair amount of benefit; I like having that option as well.  When I'm busy, I can let it run in the background; when I'm bored, I can give it more attention.

It does also slowly roll out new mechanics to keep things fresh, though the first few hours are definitely a little repetitive.  I'm not generally a big fan of stories in this sort of game, but the story here is just interesting enough to help keep my attention.

Overall, well worth the (current $3) price; unless there are major updates after this point, I'm not sure I'd go much over $10 for it, since it's just too simple to justify the price (though with a month or two of reasonably-active playtime, the hours of entertainment would fully justify a higher price).",1680699921,1680714670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Just one thing bothers me. I have automation on wooden and stone hut set to off, because I do all that just before boarding the raft to have better health decay rate before I board the raft. I have boarding the raft set to low with ""Low explorations halt"" turned on. I was expecting the game to pause when everything automated being completed (except for the ""board the raft"", which should stay at 1s remaining), but in the end, the game decided to board the raft instead leaving the huts not built. So my only remaining option was to build the wooden hut while on the raft and I ended up with no ability to build the stone hut, because I didn't have an access to wood anymore. How exactly can I set the automations so I won't have this problem anymore, please?
EDIT: Okay, it seems that I found kind of a workaround to do what I want. It's not exactly what I want, but it's better than what it was before. I had to set the wooden and stone hut to low and it almost works like I wanted. Would appriciate a bit better customisation of automation though, so I could fill all the food (and materials) JUST before the stone hut is finished (while all the materials for it are already used) so I could finish boarding the raft while having everything full.

I obviously enjoyed the game, or I wouldn't have played it for so long. Careful though, that it does not suck up all of your time (same as with many incremental games)! It requires more active player involvement than it may appear!
The reason I give it a negative review just the same, is that later game mechanics have turned me off the game enough to stop playing, even after having invested so much time.
2 major, related problems: Hourglasses are easier to get the worse your stats are. And some later ressources give you a fixed amount of damage each time you aquire one. Which again means they are easier to get so long as your stats are lower (if aquiring food takes longer, your health has more time to replenish).
Being able to do less because your stats get better is a cardinal sin for any game, but especially so for an incremental game.

A tip for anybody playing: Once you discover your 3. hourglass, focus on getting the hourglasses as high as you can to the exclusion to everything else. Once you realize you actually need that, your skills will be to high to get the highest hourglass levels.

My proposal to the developer: Please, please implement a ""do nothing"" activity. I know that would make the game easier. But the parts it makes easier are exactly those, where the current difficulty is soul-crushingly not fun.",1675839168,1675839168,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, when comes to the gameplay, it feels like Increlution in its current state is currently the worst of both worlds of active/idle gameplay. It tries to do both and fails.

For an active incremental game, there's too few meaningful decisions player can make, too much grind and no really meaningful rewards in short time period. The mostly superficial branches/choices (that I've seen so far up to episode 4) that can be made result in a lack of player agency, which leads to boredom. For an active incremental game, it It certainly feels it tries to make up its lack of content with hundreds of hours of grind.

So it's a good idle incremental game then? No, not really. For an idle incremental game meant to be left running in the background, Increlution demands player's attention way too often, halting progress altogether whenever it does, which feels terrible. For this mode of gameplay, the automations are too slow to unlock and the rewards player gets for coming back after a while, are again, not meaningful and don't feel good.

To sum up, Increlution is a very promising idea that in its current state fails to deliver on its promises. It requires a lot of player's attention, offering little in return. After the initial charm of very cleanly made minimalistic UI and innovative game loop wears off, we're left with little to keep us interested. Your time and money is better spent on other incrementals at the moment, regardless if you're a fan of the active or idle variety.

Hour 8+

This game has potential that doesn't seem to be realized.

The game is too linear and only points you in one direction.

I was hoping the game would open up and let you choose to focus on one skill ""infinitely"" or at least have other choices but it abruptly stops and limits you from doing any of that.

It's like going up a stair, falling off the next step, going back up again, falling off the next step.

As of the posting of this review, I am currently on my second playthrough, after completing the Early Access content once through.

The game is a basic incremental game, from its UI, to its story and sound (or lack thereof), and from its game mechanics, to its progression and reward systems.

The basic gameplay loop has you completing tasks of various types, earning XP. One type of XP is temporary, lasting for only that life, and the other is permanent, lasting through lives. This XP leads to levels, which lead to speed multipliers. As the game progresses, you lose more and more of your health through ever-increasing health decay. Eventually, you will die and have to restart. However, all the permanent speed multipliers propel you through more and more of the game. As you complete these tasks, you will begin to automate them. For the first playthrough, most ""Job"" tasks take 400 completions, and most of the other tasks (""Construction"" and ""Exploration"") take 10. The automation isn't barebones, but it isn't super complex either, with different priority options to allow a very simple degree of run customization.

Once you've automated a bit, the gameplay is generally ""idle the first 5 to 15 minutes of a run"" then, once your automation is over, micromanage the game. Then repeat.

If the concept is appealing to you, the first few chapters of the game are marvelous. The health decay matters, there are branching story paths starting about 1/3rd of the way through, and you can really feel the speed increase with every single life.

The problem arises in the later chapters. Because of the design of the game, where you finish earlier content faster and faster, but the base health decay at any given point in time will always be the same (barring linear multipliers), the game starts to throw more and more ""direct"" damage at you, whether it be from failing a task due to an insufficiently high multiplier, completing a task and taking a large chunk of damage at once, or, the most egregious example, damaging you simply for finishing a ""Job"" (farmable) task. In addition to this, the later chapters are filled with more and more linear health decay multipliers (for balance reasons, to make health decay sort of matter).

I was having a ton of fun until a ""wall"" in chapter 7. The game's ""mantra"" is ""throw enough lives at a task and it will eventually fall."" This ""wall"" is brutal. Due to the limited options afforded to you by the time you hit this wall, you will die at the wall. Again. And again. And yet again. Until you eventually pass it. It was frustrating but it wasn't the worst part. The lowest part of the game, for me, is the volcano in chapter 9. The game turns into a ""puzzle"" at that point, where the ONLY solution (as throwing enough lives at it no longer works, you will instantly die endlessly if you do not have the CORRECT solution) is stacking uncooked food from previous chapters and bringing it with you. Needless to say, I stopped having fun around this point and needed to ask a friend (whom I gifted the game to) for help.

If anything, I would like to see certain walls addressed (not necessarily removed) as the game needs SOME challenge. It's just that for me, as a player, these walls came very suddenly and, due to the rest of the game's structure, took me by surprise.

As previously stated, the rest of the game is a wonderful mix of various systems and mechanics. If you're into this sort of ""time loop"" incremental game, it's very well worth its price. I'm looking forward to future content.

So why down thumb? The UI is smooth and the game has a lot of spirit but the overall arching of the game fails. It is a straight line to the end nothing you do influences anything in the game there are paths that branch but all return to the same line and at certain points doing things in order will effect your efficiency for that round but that is it. There is also no bigger collapse wave than the singular run and that mechanic alone would add several 100 hours to the game if at some point you could reset everything to gain like a certain increase in something that you actually control. So for now it is a thumbs down until I feel more player input actively effects progress because half the fun of incrementals is trying to figure out the ever moving formula of efficiency which this game just doesnt reward. This game is on the right track to greatness though and will look forward to further updates.

A single generation tends to be around half an hour, and you must interact by the end of each generation; only the earlier parts, which you've already completed several times, are automated. As you progress and complete a new action in several runs, it too becomes automated, so you can focus on just the newer content on each generation. A nice mechanic.

You can make minor decisions that prioritize experience on one skill versus another, but for the most part this is an idle on rails.

I found it compelling enough to let sit in the background and do it's thing. There is a lot of optional choices or branches that are really in no way obtainable on a first play through, without a serious detriment to time spent, and one or two pathways where you get your multiplier weighted enough to give it a go, and folding in an early path that used to be impossible into your overall path.

Not sure how I feel about the game itself, I was more interested in the story and observing the gradual change of time per action that resulted in forward action, where one insurmountable task was suddenly easy, and it was the next task that was seemingly insurmountable, repeat, repeat.

I think the game suffers from not allowing the player to decide when to play idle vs active. In order to progress you have to check back and intervene every 20-35 minutes when your ""loop"" completes. There's no way to play actively for more than a few minutes at a time.

You might be able to make it a bit of an idle game, but it does not appear to be intended to be an idle game. DO NOT buy this game if you want an idle game. Just about every negative review is about this - and I agree with them: as an idle game, it sucks. I hope it was a developer oversight - but it needs to be removed from the idle game category.

What it is, is an incremental game. You'll play once, you'll get some things done, and then you'll die. But you will have built up some permanent stats: a couple HP, and a couple percentage points on speed on certain actions. The next time you play, you'll get slightly more done, and your permanent stats will be slightly higher. Every time you play, it will be the same: you'll (usually) get farther along in the game, and you'll (always) get experience towards your action speed. Over time, a story will unfold as you are capable of more and more.

And as an incremental game, this is pretty good. There are interesting choices to make at every stage of the game that I've seen so far - it's unusual in that it takes away choices at certain points, which makes planning around those important. The story is cool too - not many incremental games put much effort into having any story; while here it provides the context for the game in a way that explains what is going on and why you have the choices you have at the moment.",1654140982,1654140982,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It's an idle game that you keep in the background and check every now and then to give a few orders.
Each run is usually between 15 and 30 minutes and since you can automate each part after doing them for a few runs (usually between 5 and 10 runs worth) you only have to play the laqst bits (unless you want to play it yourself of course).

One of the fun things is that unlike most games where things just keep increasing in length, your runs stay relatively constant in length.
The levels all give multiplicative increase, meaning that a single level of increase will mean the same actual increase (1% for the permanent levels and 5% for the ones that reset with the run).

Similarly the ""energy"" that determines your run is a health decay that increases multiplicatively over time (+25% per minute).
Of course you have some ways to mitigate that decay but ultimately the game is balanced in  such a way that the runs don't just extend forever (at least until you reach the end of the content).

The story is not exceptional but it is only covers one run and is good enough to give some context to your actions, which is a plus compared to many idle games where you do things just because it gives you bonuses to progress.",1648567762,1648567762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Gameplay: 
Do you like numbers and sitting back watching them increase? If you said yes, this game is for you. Brilliant idle mechanics that differ from competition. Dying and starting over again rather than having an optional prestige keeps things fresh. For example, there are activities introduced to you early on in the game which are designed only to be returned to when you have more experience under your belt (which requires dying). 

Getting really far ahead of the health reduction rate is a feeling of great power, having your stew with the potential for it to keep you sustained for 20 minutes is great (even though you run into a monster and die before you get 5 minutes in).

Overall, mechanically this game is different from the rest in ways that I've been enjoying.

For example, Increlution. I've played this game for 349.7 hrs at the time of this review. Probably more than half of that is the game sitting open and not progressing while I'm doing something else, In that way, it's not really an idle game. If nothing is happening while I'm gone because my automations ran out, I don't feel that sense of progression when I get back. In fact, most of the progressions has to happen while I'm there. Because in a loop game, you're only really progressing with the last 4 or 5 things that have already been automated and everything that hasn't been automated yet. Everything before that gives you so little experience that your levels barely progress. 

So I've been grinding this game for the past few days. Like really sitting down and working my way through the acts. And I get a little satisfaction when I finally get through a task I've been stuck on for one reason or another. But that's after sitting through 5 or 6 40-minute cycles. I'm now at the point where I just closed the game. I have no idea how close I am to the end, but I think I'm done now. To be fair to the game, it's well-written and  pretty engaging (at least at first). But it's not really enough of an idle game for me to really think of it as an idle game.

Anyway, I actually feel like pass/fail reviews are unfair and this game is an example of why. If I could give this a rating, it'd be maybe 6 out of 10? Still a failing score for me, but had a lot of potential and may be someone else's idea of a great game. I'm just tired of only being able to walk away from it for a half hour at a time.

There aren't any interesting decisions to make, you are at best grinding out the ability to automate a task so you can stop playing the game and well, even for an idle game, that seems to be the opposite of what's enjoyable.  Basically it's a ladder to climb, and there's nothing interesting on your way to the top.  For me that's what it comes down to: there are no interesting decisions to make.  It's not like I can devote a run to upgrading my axe so that I can chop wood faster, and even if I could it wouldn't matter because the next time I need the wood chopping skill, it's offset by the amount that is needed to progress to the next rung on the ladder.

And that's pretty much it.  There's no real optimization to speak of since you have to hit each rung on the ladder to proceed, and you can only proceed to the next rung once you've ground up enough experience to reach it.  What would really help is if you could unlock the ability to perform multiple tasks, so you could like chop wood at 50% efficiency _while_ you fight the wolf.  That would give you goals to work towards, have automation serve as another progress path, and allowing you to feel like you are getting to make a few progress related decisions.

That being said, it's not a perfect game. I can certainly see a lot of people not liking it and that would be reasonable. The primary gameplay experience is running through the same tasks over and over again, your character getting ever so slightly faster at them each time until things that used to take you fifteen minutes now take fractions of a second. This is basically unavoidable in the game though. It's not a game that you CAN fail. If you clicked on random buttons on the screen at random intervals you would eventually beat this game.

The primary gameplay loop or player engagement with the game is from deciding what priorities each task should take and which tasks you should do at all. You are automatically progressed through the game's story and are constantly being pressed with new tasks (and the opportunity to do old ones goes away). 

Some of them are mandatory to progress the story. Some of them you'll definitely have to do to survive long enough to progress in the story when you first reach an area, but later on you can safely do without them with no real problems, and some tasks you absolutely won't be able to do at all at the skill levels you have when you originally reach an area.

Understanding how building skills work and the health system and understanding each task is all pretty intuitive and you'll probably pick it up as you go. It's nice to make small tweaks here and there to your last run and see it improve your next one. You can't really fail at this game, but being good at it means butting your head up against the wall of your most recent obstacle less before you overcome it. It's the difference between finishing the game's content in 40 hours or 100 hours.

Still, the only thing you'll find after getting through your last task is another new one that you don't have the skills to beat yet, and it can feel monotonous or repetitive with time. Combine that with the game's automation system that forces you to watch the first half of every run as an idle game, but actively play the second half and I can fully understand how people could get tired it.

Either way. The demo is free. Try it out.",1644725496,1644725496,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Took me about a week of play to reach the current ending and the core gameplay loop didn't change much, but changed enough to keep it interesting.

For the most part, you'll be spending about 15-20 minutes afk, and then another 5-10 minutes manually pushing your progression. There are meaningful choices and decisions to make, paths to prioritise and ultimately a fair amount of grinding to unlock automation. After unlocking automation, there's more just around the corner as you get better and faster every generation. This is why i say the core gameplay doesn't change all that much.

To give a general idea, i reached the end of Chapter 5 after 191 generations. Which doesn't sound like a lot but that's roughly 100 hours of semi-idle gameplay. While my hours are closer to 200, there were plenty of times where i would have the game open but be too busy to interact, or i was asleep.",1644056591,1644056779,True,0,0,0.459259271621704102,0,True,False,True

Increlution starts out as an active game, giving you various tasks to split your time between as you progress through the storyline. As you get further, and the tasks you've already completed get faster and faster, automation unlocks will let you breeze through it up to your current progress point. The game is currently in early access, with 3-4 days of runtime to complete. 

When the action queue runs out of items to complete, the game will automatically pause. Because of this, there is no punishment for leaving the game minimized and doing other things- resources that could be spent won't stockpile and go to waste, upgrades won't be missed. 

The developer, Gniller, provides active feedback and support in the game's Discord server, as well as consistent progress updates on additional content as the game looks at moving from early access into its full release.

You repeat everything WAY to often imo. As someone who played a ton of idle game I could think of a lot of ways to make the gameplay much more interesting. 

To give you a general idea of what the gameplay consists of:
- Click on a task to automatically do that task
- Level up a certain skill while doing that task
- Select a new task and repeat

The only thing that happens when you reincarnate is that these tasks start automatically instead of having to click on them. Also, you gain 2 types of levels when you level up a skill. One that resets after every reincarnation and one that stays permanently. Levels in these increase the speed you complete tasks with. The permanent levels give less speed than the levels you gain each run. SO overall you basically just get the permanent levels which isn't a lot compared to the standart idle games.

Later on you learn to fish a different sort of fish. What could've been a cool mechanic would've been to simply let the player fish that fish from the start now which would lead to a much quicker early game. The game is based around one generation learning/remembering stuff from the other generation so this would be a logical mechanic.

Anyways, the game is still somewhat fun but has a lot more potential. And it's early access so who knows, maybe there are some cool mechanics coming. Right now it's just a slow side scroller pretty much",1643841739,1643841739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Essentially your character is going on a journey and every second of action, they have health decay.  This ramps up over time until your character dies for the ""loop"".

You can stave off this death by crafting food items which are made but a button press based on a skill.  Farming for example might let you pick up apples in the current area you're in.  The more farming skill you have, the faster you pick up apples.

Two things contribute to your maximum progress each loop.  You max hp increases depending on how long you survived each loop.  The second is ""instinct"" levels of your skills.  As you level skills, there's a level that multiplies the speed.  Instinct is another bar that also levels underneath it, that is a permanent skill multiplier to the base level.  The base level resets each loop.

Finally, if you do a skill so many times, you eventually get the ability to automate it.

The main gameplay loop consist of making decisions for what actions to take. After X times of repeating a task you get options to automate it with priority levels. That means over time you start automating more and more of the game, and only the later parts of the game are where you need to actively make decisions.

The early to mid game is pretty fun, as long as you don't mind not really having much offline progression at all. A typical run consist of roughly 15 to 40 minutes; generally longer the further you progress.

The issue is that the further you progress so during mid to late game, you can still maybe let the game run for ~20min before it needs your input again. I think it'd improve the game noticeably if tasks required less repetition before unlocking automation options; it just feels like a chore when you're approaching 40 minute runs and you have to babysit it for a number of decisions at the end even though nothing is new which drags on. Less repetitions would make it feel a lot less like it's artificially dragging out playing time.

Still, it's pretty cheap, and my first foray into the time-loop incremental genre and i have to say i quite enjoyed it and i can easily recommend it for incremental game fans despite some issues. If you're not into incremental games yet, i'd recommend free games first like NGU idle (which is king of the genre to me; and free) just to get a feel for if the genre is for you at all.",1641427796,1641427870,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,True

You set up a queue of activities, await for them to complete (assuming you do not die) and rince repeat.  Semi-idle since it does require user input, a lot in fact at the very beginning, but eventually you'll go ten, twenty, thirty minutes before you need to act because of the unique automations factor built into the game.

As you repeat certain actions manually, you eventually unlock the capability to automate that action.  This is what gets the game to move into an idle aspect, as your character will automatically do these tasks in order or prioritization rules until they have no more tasks to do and requires player input, or you've died and you need to reincarnate.

Reincarnation is the purpose of this game, like most idle games, in a form of ""prestige"" except this is forced upon you rather than optional at your choosing.  When you reincarnate, you bring with you some of the experiences from prior playthroughs, making those tasks go faster.  This is important because the manner in which you die is your health points constantly draining, and this drain increases with each passing moment.  Thankfully, Increlution is casual in this regard because if your character has no active tasks, the game automatically pauses - this means you're not forced into watching the game every waking moment, and can go about other things.

I've completed all the current in-game content and it's taken me ~45 playing hours (Steam reports 82 hours played but again, when Increlution has nothing running, the ""game"" is paused expecting input.  The 45 hours is how long the game actually ""played,"" versus Steam is reporting how long the game was open/running).  That's a lot of content so far for a game that's less than a fiver!

This game will only appeal to idle game fans though; there are barely any choices in game, so don't expect a future playthrough to be any different than your first - or your experience to be any different than someone else - but the core game here has a very interesting loop and will appeal to many, especially with its fresh and unique take on the idle genre.

With a minimalist interface, no music, a barebones (and ultimately meaningless) story, this game would have to stand on its gameplay, and doesn‚Äôt.  The core gameplay loop is so flawed I can‚Äôt imagine it ever being developed into something good.  The game is literally designed to play itself for the vast majority of ‚Äúgameplay time‚Äù in a way that at first was intriguing, but ultimately is boring and wasteful.  This may at first hook the part of your brain that loves watching numbers get higher and seeing bars increase (as it did me), but will stop surprising or interesting you very quickly, and ultimately leave you dissatisfied.

The gameplay loop is as follows:  You are constantly losing health at a rate that doubles every 3 minutes.  You must gather resources to survive as long as possible until your inevitable death, hopefully managing to explore and reveal a little bit more of the world until you‚Äôre forced to start over.  Each task is simply pressing a button, then watching the bar go up as it finishes.  As you do tasks, you gain experience in them, making them take incrementally shorter amounts of time.  Some of this experience rolls over to the next playthrough, ensuring that no matter what happens, you will eventually be able to succeed through brute force alone.

However, brute force isn‚Äôt just an option, it‚Äôs a necessity.  Each new exploration task you discover is designed to arbitrarily take enough time to be impossible to finish when you first find it.  Then you die, and are forced to replay everything you‚Äôve already done.  At first this is fine:  You get to make some choices about how to prioritize your time, and see if you can make the next run a little more optimal.  Quickly you realize that no amount of optimization (or really any skill) will keep you from having to play the same thing over and over, and worse, each new area you discover then is the same as the old.  ‚ÄúGather berries‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúGather Apples‚Äù with the exact same mechanics and purpose, and ‚Äúexplore cave‚Äù becomes ‚Äúexplore shore‚Äù.  Very quickly you realize you aren‚Äôt making interesting decisions, you‚Äôre just babysitting buttons.  You aren‚Äôt developing or being rewarded for any skills.

This is where the automation system comes in, which I at first though was going to be what saved the game:  Perform a task enough times and you can set the game to automate it on your next playthrough.  It‚Äôs an interesting idea, works well with the minimalist design, and is at first intriguing.  You get to tweak automations like you‚Äôre programming a robot.  ‚ÄúDamn, I set Build the Hut too high and ran out of food.  I‚Äôll increase the priority of Gather Berries.‚Äù  Except quickly you realize this fails in several ways.  You can‚Äôt automate it well enough to be better than micromanaging (I would like to gather just enough food as to not starve until I finish the Hut, but automating means I won‚Äôt stop until I‚Äôve gathered the maximum).  You have to manually do things at least a dozen times before you can automate them, even if they‚Äôre identical to their predecessors (I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to need you to gather at least 200 more Apples before you can do the exact same thing you did with Berries).  And just like before, no matter how well you do this, it ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter:  The newest task (and the new one after that, and the one after that) will still take an arbitrarily large amount of time, so you‚Äôll always have to play through again and again, and no amount of tweaking automations will change that.

Worst of all, you will eventually automate the first few minutes of gameplay, but you still have to wait for the bars to go up on every playthrough.

At this point every new playthrough starts with you waiting and watching the bars go up until you get to the area you haven‚Äôt been able to automate yet.  At first this takes a minute and a half (the game keeps track of how long your playthroughs are), so you tab over and start browsing reddit.  Soon it‚Äôs 5 minutes of waiting ‚Äì with you tabbing over to a different game ‚Äì then a couple minutes of ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù.  My last ‚Äúplaythrough‚Äù involved me pressing one button to start the next run, then playing a different game for 21 minutes and 43 seconds.  Even when I got back, I still wasn‚Äôt being asked to make any decisions ‚Äì there was only one button to press, I couldn‚Äôt decide not to press it, and I still had to wait to do it twice more.

So the numbers that represent your skill are ultimately meaningless, since the next thing will always take even longer.  The ‚Äúgameplay loop‚Äù involves playing a different game while this one plays itself for 20 minutes at a time.  The ‚Äústory‚Äù is no more complicated than, ‚Äúyou got past the last challenge, now here‚Äôs the next one‚Äù.  It has no music at all, and no graphics to speak of.  There would have to be a major gameplay overhaul in the future to allow the automation system to be more rewarding, but even that would most likely run into the current gameplay issues, so I think you're better off ignoring this one.",1638053453,1638053453,False,5,0,0.540145993232727051,0,True,False,True

A huge point of frustration for me is the game won't let you end a run easily. For example you cannot start a fight if your health is too low (and you have other things you could do), even if that is what you want to do to end a run. In fact, the game goes even further than this and can interrupt a fight to do some action, then refuse to continue with the fight because your health is too low!

Another major point of frustration is you can't concentrate on a single skill. The game mechanics simply won't allow that - largely by limiting your opportunity through small inventory and limited time on that particular skill, before forcing you to level another skill.

PROS:
-Gameplay loop is simple and satisfying.
-Balance feels very intentional. You can still make progress even when you aren't playing optimally.
-The game really captures the feeling of getting just a little bit further - you're presented with various challenges which require you to dedicate time to pass, and once you run out of time the run is over. The incremental part comes in as you get more skill levels over time, allowing you to spend less time on old challenges, and you also get more time each run to spend. Being able to see what next challenge is just around the corner can keep you going.
-No microtransactions!

CONS:
-The game toes the line between idle and incremental without fully committing to either, somewhat to its detriment. After several hours you'll reach a point where the game can (and in fact must) be left alone for 20-25 minutes, but you'll have to spend a few minutes managing it to reset that clock. By the end of the current content it can potentially idle for 30-35 minutes, but no longer. The nature of the game makes solving this problem difficult, though I'd appreciate an ""offline time"" or ""paused time"" mechanic just so I don't feel like I'm losing out when I have to ignore the game for a few hours.

You play as a character that overcomes obstacles, and completes actions that extend their life, allowing more time to extend their life, and so the feedback loop is established.

This sub genre can fall victim to scaling issues. I found Idle Loops took hours to complete a single loop. However, this game has been balanced very well, with every run taking about 30 minutes, giving a nice balance between getting faster at the actions you've already completed with starting new activities.

However, I wasn't a fan of how every loop required some human interaction. There was no way to just leave the game running, you'd eventually hit the tasks that you couldn't automate, and reincarnating requires a manual click, so you have to manage things every loop.

As the game goes on, the paths forward become more numerous, adding experimentation and variety to the game, which is a really nice feature. I only wish there was more of this mechanic, though I'm only on chapter 4.

i'd say the demo of the game is pretty fun and it's free so you can just go try it, but bewarned that that what the demo holds is pretty much all there is.

the gameplay of this game consists of quing up a couple of tasks, doing something else for 5 minutes and then quing up some more. that's it. your guy will do the tasks you que up until he runs out of health and dies, at which point you start over but have very slightly higher stats.

that's right, this is one of those rapid prestige type of idlers. which some people may like but i generally dislike. but that's just opinion. the problem with the system as it's implemented is that you have to keep replaying trough the same contend over and over. you have to complete it aproxemetely 10 times before you get the option to automate it. so if you unlock a new batch of content you have to do the same dance of queing something up, alt tabbing for 5 minutes and the repeating because you can't que up actions you can't do right now (so if you have something like ""build boat -> set sail -> sail to island -> walk to village -> talk to mayor"" you have to do each of those with a 2-5 minute wait 10 times total before you can automate it)

there is nothing to optimize other than what order you do things in to maximise what you do in each life. all you can do is que up actions which progress the story (which is completely liniar) gather resources or gather food.

That was not fun.

I find it annoying that Hunting and Cooking tasks are not automated together. This feels like fake progress, or pretend achievements. The game does not actually get any easier until you automate both, but one is always unlocked a good hour before the other. For example, Hunting vultures and then Cooking vultures. I have hunting vultures automated, but Cooking them is only at 372/500. It will require several more run throughs to automate it. In the meantime, this means I have to manually do all the Cooking, which is no easier than doing all the Cooking and Hunting. So it's as if I hadn't yet earned anything by unlocking Hunting. Do you see? Unlocking automation is the game's primary way of indicating progress to the player, but it's not real progress until you get both things automated.

Another complaint I have with automation is the sheer quantity of times your progress is one single task with no alternatives. For example, going from Chapter A to Chapter B, you Get on Boat then Paddle then Paddle 2 then Paddle 3... What's the point? It results in mismatched automation so that going from one place to the other is not fully automated yet. When I have gotten up to Paddle 2 and then time runs out, that just means Paddle 2 is automated 1 time before Paddle 3.  There's literally nothing else to do, no other skill checks available, except to Paddle forth. In my eyes, I am trying to go from A to B, and the mismatched automation just means that nothing is really automated until the whole thing is. It doesn't feel right.

I do wish the Running/Pause button were at the top of the Action queue, so that it did not change positions with the Action queue's size. I'd rather it was in a fixed, unchanging position.

The Time vs Last run is a great addition, as are the breakdown of time spent doing each Skill check (3 minutes doing Digging, 5 minutes doing Farming, etc.) although I wish we could see that during the run, not just at the end of it. There's plenty of room in the names for each skill to put up a small timer.

All these complaints aside, I think the game's UI is pretty good. The fonts and colors are eminently readable, and I like that a lot. It's way better than most other incremental / idle / clicker games.

That said, those 90-100 hours were some of the smoothest I've ever experienced in an idle game. This is where the game really shines--there are few of the hard bottlenecks or annoying babysitting due to huge exponential growth other games in the genre tend to have. 

Similar to Idle Loops and Your Chronicle, etc., you can queue processes for your player who will perform them--bars fill up and unlock new processes and flavor text in the form of unobtrusive story content. The handful of forks in the game are interesting and keep the gameplay (that is, the metagame) fresh, as different forks will be more useful at different stages of your character's skillset progression. 

As criticism goes, the plot feels VERY shallow and played out at the moment, at least until close to early access content. Some improvements to the flavor text in the form of foreshadowing and, perhaps, small changes to the world as you perform different actions (like the dragon / slayer subplot), would be welcome. Text based games, not being able to rely on graphics, need to be a little more precise about the nature of their world than Increlution, and in this way, both Your Chronicle and Idle Loops do a better job--although it should be said Increlution still does better than Groundhog Life and most of the other games in this subgenre. 

Still, these are minor gripes. I am a very busy person and being able to come back to a game like this every 20 minutes or so has been a joy this last couple weeks. As far as early access content goes, I would give this a 3.5 / 4 out of 5. For the price (a stunningly low $3), this game is an absolute steal.

Once you get past the first few parts of the game, it becomes almost entirely hands off. But after about 10 minutes you still need to prod it occasionally. Which makes it an odd combination of having nothing to do and yet not really being an idle game at all.

The UI is a little bit wonky. When there are too many activities a vertical scrollbar appears. This is fine, but it applies to the whole window. So if you scroll down to see your exploration progress you can't see your health etc any more. There is also a lot of unused white and black space on the screen. I'm sure things could be shifted about so better use was made of this.

Progress is painfully slow, given that all you are doing is leaving it running for the majority of time. This looks like it's simply to stretch the game out more (which I'm sure it is) but if the extra time you spend minutely increasing your Instinct stats is completely dull and uninteresting, why would you want to?

I am 35.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

""It's not the kind of idle game that you play in the background, it's idle game you sit and watch"" 

This game is built like most idle games. bars fill, numbers get bigger and things happen as you wait!
What sets this game apart is there is a time management element where you need to pick between keeping your character alive and gathering stuff to get upgrades, adding a fair amount of skill and strategy! 

However, the time management is what KILLS the game. You NEED to sit there and pick the right things do to, if you tab out and do other things your run ends and you sit at the reincarnation screen. And that's the issue. . . you sit and watch bars fill. no visuals, jokes, no music. just constantly waiting 30 sac to two min for bars to fill so you can click again
the automation doesn't help much. it just changes it from ""you can't tab out"" to ""you have maybe three min before you die""

A simple list of checkboxes that are greyed out due to certain conditions not met yet would be nice. Like how am I going to know there are pirates later on if I didn't have to go through the forum and find out from users that are having trouble with said pirates?

Like I said, it needs a facelift design wise because the boring design doesn't fill you with excitement during those periods where things are just grindy and uneventful.

And in their short and fleeting life they picked some berries, caught and cooked some fish with wood they chopped. Built a hut, explored a cave... and fought a spider. I hope for the sequel they get rid of the UI and your faced with a screen full of code, cause that's the only way you can one up this game at this point. 

Seeing my food meter fill up as my life meter was slowly being depleted inspired me... I liked seeing my life drain before my eyes. And knowing that in my old age, the only course for self preservation was to desperately shove my mouth as full of berries as I could. Cooking fish requires you to catch it in the the first place, than you need to chop down an entire tree to make fire to cook it... I don't have the time, patience, skill, planning, forethought, will, desire or interest to do so. I'm hunched over the berry bush seeing my life flash before my eyes, and as the clock ticks closer to zero. Panic swells into my soul.

My children's last memory of me will be of me bent over in the dirt, frantically searching the ground for berries to sustain my last few moments of sentience. My mouth is full of dirt, I'm sucking it clean of any nutrients it might hold... I spit out sand in distress. I look up while on my hands and knees to see my children grieving for me, some are looking away and quietly sobbing... I turn my head down for another handful of dirt. And right at that moment I can feel my heart stop, I can hear one of my children gasp out loud through their mouth. I'm not sure who it was, but it's probably my favorite child, the one that will actually miss me when I'm gone, the one that will actually remember me.

I don't love the other children as much as them, all of them are older and have suffered due to my inexperience and neglect. It wasn't until my last that I knew what I was doing as a parent to actually have a positive effect. Everyone hates me except for the one. I die with a mouth full of dirt, a mind torn from reality, and a soul overburdened with sin. I hope my children do better than me, I hope they know how to survive beyond sucking dirt from the ground. I ran out of time, as we all do, I might have even made a fool of myself. But I got to live those few precious moments I wouldn't have otherwise have gotten.

I don't know what will happen to my children, it is up to them now to be however successful or not in my absence... much like I'm in the absence of anyone who's died before me. Perhaps because of the meta progression nature of this game that they'll have a better chance of survival. Ozymandias at least has a story about him, and everyone has heard of it. I'll be nothing but a suppressed memory in someone else's life. And me and my dirt filled mouth will have to be okay with that.",1634939569,1634939632,True,1,6,0.519650638103485107,0,True,False,True

If you like idle/incremental games, this game is completely worth the money. A projected 700 hours of content will give more than 200 hours of continuous and progressive content *per dollar*. Aside from being free, it does not get much better than this. The graphics are very clean and the story is captivating (I did not think I would care about the story but it's proving to be very interesting). The post-death screen and exploration tracker provide clear evidence that you continue to progress each iteration. This provides an addicting gameplay loop that is constantly pushed into more-or-less current progression as instinct levels continue to rise, so you never feel like you're at a standstill. If you're still on the fence, you can try the free demo, which should give you good enough of an idea how the gameplay works. Heavy recommend.

In this way, the game fills the same kind of niche as afk training in Runescape in that it's not interesting or compelling enough to take up all your attention all the time, but it requires some attention in regular intervals.

For people who play a lot of idle games, this plays like Idle Loops or Cavernous, but made a lot simpler, with a friendly UI.

For gamers who don't play a lot of idle games, this is the casual-ish kind of idle game where as long as you're doing something, you really can't do anything wrong. And there's always something to do. There are optimal builds as well as suboptimal builds, but you can still make plenty of progress playing suboptimally. The decisions that you make each run only really matter in the short-term; in the long term, the game is balanced such that you can just grind through suboptimal decisions.

If you have a lot of different idle games running in the background, this one deserves to be put into your rotation.

It gets dull, repeating the same functioning strategy over and over again with next to no change. There's automation, but it plays so sub-optimally that it's useless except to grind stats, because it has a priority system. Thing is, my manual priorities would vary greatly throughout a run. So either I'm sitting around, manually ordering priorities, which takes away the point, or I just let it run suboptimally. It'll do things such as stocking up on goods I'll literally never use before I die or letting the guy die because I either have to prioritize food too high (wasting a lot of time, costing a lot of resources due to the increasing pressure of the health decay increase) or too low (killing the guy early). I would much prefer having a template system to a priority system, as I want things to be run in a very specific order. It would also be nice with an auto restart, to help grind out stats.

It has a simple interface and fairly simple game systems, but there's a solid sense of progression both short-term and long-term, and the gameplay loop is engaging.

There are no microtransactions or any of the other nonsense that plagues the genre, and the dev values player feedback and discussion and genuinely just wants to make a fun game. It won't be everyone's cup of tea (you might not like incremental games at all, or maybe it's too idle/not idle enough for you), but you can find that out for free, as there's a lovely demo that's just the first several hours of gameplay as-is.",1634142702,1634142702,True,6,0,0.589581131935119629,0,True,False,True

Most of my prior games just plain got boring.

Increlution is nothing like those games, but adds in a well thought out incremental aspect for leveling. While you do get automation for tasks that you completed a certain number of times, the game pauses automatically when it is time to make your choices - and your choices matter. You will die often, and that is how you skill up for your next reincarnation. Every action you performed in your previous ""life"" improves your future lives skills. Because of the automation aspect you don't have to grind a large portion of the beginning of your new life, and can focus on progressing farther.

I've really enjoyed this game so far and can't wait to play out the entire story line - it's simple, but intriguing enough for me to want to see what lies beyond the next obstacle. It's brought back that ""Just one more run"" feeling that I missed back in my early ""MUD"" years. No, it's not the same, but just as addictive. Plan on losing many, many hours of your life if you play this.

For idle game lovers, if you want a fully automated set and forget game, don't bother. Check out this developer's other game (Incremental Adventures - an awesome AFK Grinder). This game needs active participation. It's a refreshing change for me, and I'm sure others will love it too.
