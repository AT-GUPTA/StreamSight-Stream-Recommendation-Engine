The game features over 100 cars, 60 tracks, and a variety of customization options for both the appearance and performance of the vehicles. The game also supports online multiplayer, where players can compete with each other or join drift crews and participate in tournaments.

The game’s strongest point is its physics engine, which simulates the dynamics of drifting with accuracy and responsiveness. The cars feel different from each other, depending on their weight, power, and drivetrain. The tracks are diverse and challenging, ranging from urban streets to mountain roads. The game also offers a lot of feedback to the player, such as tire smoke, sound effects, and score indicators, which enhance the immersion and thrill of drifting.

However, the game also has some drawbacks that may affect its appeal to some players. The game’s user interface is cluttered and confusing, making it hard to navigate the menus and options. The game’s progression system is also tedious and grindy, requiring a lot of time and money to unlock new cars and parts.

Overall, CarX Drift Racing Online is a game that will appeal to fans of drifting and racing, who are looking for an arcade-like and challenging simulation of the sport. The game offers a lot of content and customization, as well as a vibrant online community. However, the game also has some technical and design flaws, which may deter some players from enjoying it fully. The game is not perfect, but it is certainly one of the best drifting games available on the market.",1708902368,1708902368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, when I was a younger man, I used to take to take part in 1/10th scale RC Drift contests the length and breadth of the land, and quite often these were run in tandem with the British Drift Championship in its early days. I quickly learned to tell my AE86 from my Supra, my S13 Silvia from my S15 Silvia, my Skyline from my 350Z, my… you get the picture. Long story short, no matter what kind of ridiculous body kit the drift cars sported, I could tell what they were. And it’s the same here: the Hachi Roku is a Toyota AE86 (Hachi Roku is the Japanese nickname for this car, meaning almost literally 86), the Panther is a Mazda MX5 and so on. This is however a real pet hate of mine, as I can clearly see that the car I’m driving is a Camaro, yet it’s called a Hornet, and even that’s a bit too close to Bumblebee from Transformers. It just seems a little dishonest to try and sidestep licencing in this manner. 

Anyway, we start off, as is traditional in these games, with a weedy bunch of underpowered, asthmatic cars that would struggle to pull the skin off a rice pudding. I initially opted for the Hachi Roku (imagine me rolling my eyes here) as it is a hero car in Initial D, and obviously I had to paint it in the traditional Panda style. Taking a stock car out on track is a bit underwhelming, as you’d imagine, as they don’t have much power, struggle to kick the back end out and lack the ability to hold extended drifts. Still, each run round the car park saw my score get better, as I learned how best to extract drift that was hidden inside the sleeping monster. With sufficient runs, I had some money saved up, and so was able to power up the car, and from here the fun and the drift just went ballistic.

In the Garage menu, you can mod your selected car in four ways. Turbo does what it says on the tin, and shoehorns a turbo under the bonnet, giving much more power but no more control. The Drift mod allows you to add parts to make the car better at drifting, alongside freeing up some of the spare horses lurking in the depths of the engine bay. Racing mods do similar, but set the car up for the Time Attack mode that is included, and finally Ultimate mods allow you to fully exploit the performance of the car, giving you total control over its setup. Of course, Drift and Racing mods are cheaper than Ultimate, and can be bought at a lower level, so I settled for a Drift modified Hachi Roku, with the most ridiculous body kit money could buy – painted pink and lime green because I could. After this, the sky was the limit, and the gold cups began to stack up on my mantelpiece.",1708540778,1708540778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it was just an in-game lobby hack where they just gained control over my game...

For example, the cars could have endless body kits, vinyls, and different setups.  Then not only do you just drift, but you can also do regular races, depending on your car's setup.  There just a couple issues though.  First, There's only around 20 maps so once you unlock the final map, there's nothing else to unlock except more cars.  Second, some tasks, this game's challenges, are pay to win.  For example, the 2024 Mustang, or Cobra, requires the red rock map so you cant unlock the car unless you buy the dlc for that map.  Third, Multiplayer servers are way too laggy.  Its kinda hard to play with others and tandem because the game is just too laggy and its hard to control where you're going.

I spent countless times uninstalling and reinstalling changing security and admin privileges with same results. 

All to come down to try old 1.9 version and it opened without flaw. This infuriated me that this whole time it was the game and not me. Never have i experienced something that destroys a game like this even modding. I am disappointed in the developers for letting this go this long. I have been gaming my whole life and never have seen this so if your game doesnt open you know who to be mad at now.

The problem is it is fun when it works. And there lies the problem with this game. Its not the bugs that make it a bad game neither is the fact that the minimal specs have risen over time. The biggest problem is the servers. The constant connectivity issues the ping spikes the lag overall the fact that chat has a lesser chance to be working than getting a 5 star one pull in a gacha game. Sometimes you cant even find connection to the server themselves. Look the game is fun and has some great communities behind it. If it wasn't for the constant server problem it would be a yes but i cannot disregard that problem.

The worst about all of this is that the servers didn't use to be has bad as they are now so what changed and why isn't it being acknowledged and-or fixed?
At the end of the day if you got this game on a discount and only play it from time to time in offline mode or in a private lobby with friends you probably wont have this issues. But for the bigger community of players that have invested hours and days in this game to be let down like this is just a big middle finger from Carx.

As an avid gamer, I recently delved into the world of CarX, eagerly anticipating an immersive experience. However, my excitement swiftly turned to frustration upon encountering their abysmal servers.

""Bad"" and ""cheap"" are understatements when describing the quality of CarX's servers. The incessant lag I experienced was nothing short of infuriating, severely detracting from gameplay enjoyment. It's disheartening to invest time and enthusiasm into a game, only to be hindered by technical shortcomings.

Equally concerning is CarX's inadequate handling of these issues. Instead of proactively addressing the massive lag plaguing their servers, they seemingly turn a blind eye, leaving players like myself feeling undervalued and dissatisfied.

In conclusion, my experience with CarX's servers left much to be desired. With performance issues overshadowing gameplay, it's difficult to recommend this platform to fellow enthusiasts. Unless significant improvements are made, CarX risks losing its player base to competitors who prioritize a seamless gaming experience.",1650462385,1707851934,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The servers are full of actual children, having power trips. most servers are either full of people that just ram you out or are empty.
The modded content servers are fun...but again are either empty or power tripping teenagers.
I don't like the overall tone of this game lately after hours playing it at this point.
The dev's are just...idk man, there aren't any games like this these days so you are stuck with either this or AAA games.

Buy only on a significant sale and play single player modded or official servers to somewhat get a positive experience.

dec 2022 update: This game is still great for online tandems. It's playable on keyboard, game pad and wheel. On keyboard and game pad there is really nice steering assist and nowadays the force feedback has actually gotten pretty good as well and feels really nice drifting with a T300 on the pro steering setting.

Nice for Assetto Corsa players who want a more chill / arcadey game for their wheel with really in-depth car customisation.

Update one year later 5 feb 2024 and this game is still amazing. There have been some superb updates and now we have map mods on the workshop that all work for online. We now have many touge lines, track days on Nürburgring, dedicated tandem tracks, you name it. The price to fun ratio of this game is insane. Even with all dlc included it's a good price even when most dlc are purely cosmetic. Tuning, customising and painting are a lot of fun but you can also share and download tunes and liveries nowadays. The single player campaign is not too interesting but the online play is just endless fun and keeps me coming back again and again.",1570363295,1707149310,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

        [td]Do you enjoy a good casual drifting game? Here you go! Honestly this game has a ton of content even for a base game. The customization is really good and you can make some really cool designs for your cars as well. The tuning is really well thought out and gives you a lot of freedom on how your car will drive, but can be challenging if you don’t know much about tuning, luckily youtube can help you with this, as well as steam guides. You have a good amount of tracks, but if you can get the DLCs for this game, please do. They are not that expensive, and can add more content in the customization department.[/td]

        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]In multiplayer, you will find lobbies and they are mostly just open sessions with people drifting around and having a good time. Honestly the community is really chill and I had no issues with them at all. The game still has a healthy amount of players too (at the time of this review).[/td]
    [/tr]

        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]If you are a big drift nut, you will spend a lot of time on this game. The physics is so well done and the community is pretty nice and helpful. I’m not a huge drift guy (plus no friends on this game), but if you have friends that play this, you will spend so much time here. Plus the amount of vehicles you can tune and customize is absolutely insane.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]I love the car sounds in this game. They sound so aggressive and just a joy to drift. You can also hear how close the other driver is to your car pretty well without even needing to see. The sound design is pretty well done. You can’t change like the exhaust and have different sounds for the car, but when you upgrade them they will sound incredible. The turbo’s are just the icing on the cake.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]No bugs that I am aware of. I haven’t had any crashes or odd glitches. The game was actually pretty smooth in terms of bugs. I did have car builds delete when I uninstalled the game so I'm not sure if it's a cloud save bug or not. Just something to keep in mind.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance was perfect. No stutters and no frame drops. I’m really impressed by the game's performance. You should have zero problems especially if you have similar or even better computer specs.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]I'm not a big drift guy but I had such a blast with this game. It’s a chill experience even if you're not into drifting. Find some friends and male some cool builds! It’s a blast and worth the money.[/td]

The community is made up of mostly moody young adults and children and is very hard to find cool people. The new task lists are not good- and take too much time, events are soulless and draining/repetitive. Playing this game makes me want to play any other racing game- with the cheap and tacky visual mods, bad sounds, sad excuse for physics, and overall lack of polish just make the game an empty husk.

Only good I can mention is, the livery editor is really good, they do 'regular updates' from time to time, and have added new features like VR. Thats it.

Otherwise, this game is a complete waste of time for any car enthusiast with dignity.",1706638599,1706638599,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-it has a very wide variety of tuning how you want to drift. adhesion makes the largest difference. 
-its fun tuning for hours getting cars to drift how i want them to
-i love the drift mechanics, reminds me of drifting in the need for speed remaster
-decent selection of cars and they have STILL been adding more after all these years.
-kino mod supported

cons
-servers are spotty. modded cars usually break the server
-griefing can be bad, kino+ fixes that for custom collisions though.
-(personally don't care) competitive modes are limited. I just enjoy drifting and can't afford to do it irl

**Pros:**

1. **Realistic Drifting Physics:** CarX Drift Racing Online is praised for its realistic drifting physics, providing players with an authentic drifting experience. The game captures the nuances of car control during slides, making it appealing to drifting enthusiasts.

2. **Extensive Car Customization:** The game offers a wide range of cars that can be customized in terms of appearance and performance. Players can modify and upgrade their vehicles to suit their drifting style, adding a layer of personalization.

3. **Varied Tracks:** CarX Drift Racing Online features a variety of tracks with different layouts and environments. Each track presents its own challenges, keeping the gameplay interesting and varied.

4. **Multiplayer Competitions:** The online multiplayer mode allows players to compete against each other in drifting competitions. This adds a competitive element to the game, fostering a sense of community among drifting enthusiasts.

5. **Graphics and Sound:** The game boasts impressive graphics and sound design. The detailed car models and realistic environments contribute to an immersive drifting experience.

**Cons:**

1. **Learning Curve:** The realistic physics and controls may pose a learning curve for newcomers to the drifting genre. Mastering the art of drifting and achieving high scores requires practice and skill.

2. **Limited Content for Single Players:** While the multiplayer aspect is strong, the game may feel somewhat limited for players who prefer solo experiences. The focus is primarily on drifting competitions, and there might be a lack of diverse single-player content.

3. **Microtransactions:** Some players have raised concerns about the presence of microtransactions for in-game currency and customization items. While not uncommon in the gaming industry, it's worth noting for players sensitive to such monetization models.

**Conclusion:**

CarX Drift Racing Online offers a realistic and enjoyable drifting experience, particularly for players who appreciate the skill and precision required in drifting competitions. With extensive car customization options, varied tracks, and a vibrant multiplayer community, it caters to drifting enthusiasts looking for an authentic and competitive drifting game. While the learning curve may be steep for beginners, those seeking a challenging and immersive drifting experience will find CarX Drift Racing Online to be a compelling choice in the genre.",1705131405,1705131405,True,3,1,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,False

Once you settle on a map things will start to get repetitive and you will get bored eventually. There are some bugs here and there and the graphics could be better but the variety of mods there are makes up for it a little bit.

Be careful who you make friends with because some people in the community are one sided meaning you do something wrong for one time they will never be friends with you again (even if its a small thing). I unfortunately had to learn the hard way.

IMPORTANT

IF YOU DECIDE TO WASTE SOME MONEY AND DO SIM RACER -> GET ASSETO CORSA AND GET THE PROPER GEAR!!!! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!

IF YOU DECIDE YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE A SIMRACER AND SAVE MONEY DO NOT BUY ASSETO CORSA!!!!! ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ALL THE EXPENSIVE SIM RACING GEAR!!!!!! I MADE THE MISTAKE OF GETTING AC [ASSETO CORSA] AND I DID NOT WANT TO BE A SIM RACER NOR DO I HAVE ALL THE GEAR FOR IT [STEERING WHEEL AND PEDAL N STUFF]!!!!! DO NOT FALL INTO THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID!!!

First PLAY CARX and get used to the mechanics and then decide after to buy AC. 

PLEASE NOTE:

AC & CARX ARE NOT THE SAME, DRIFTING ON CARX WILL NOT BE THE SAME ON AC!!! I AM WARNING YOU!!!!!!

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1663856214,1705075057,True,2,0,0.537016332149505615,0,True,False,False

The new update yesterday gave lobby hosts the admin controls they so desperately needed, i can finally run proper community lobbys.

But there is a new massive problem, high ping (500 - 2000 ms) that makes the game unplayable. 
What i suspect is happening is that 1-2 months back CarX developers might have changed to cheaper servers to save money, everyone noticed the servers got worse than before, Goosiest made a Youtube video about it, now since yesterday with a lot of old players coming back to play with the new update, the cheap servers can't keep up at all with the player load and thus everyone is constantly having random +1000 pings every 5 minutes or so. This doesn't affect gameplay when there are less than 4/16 players in the lobby, but when the lobby is full 16/16 its really really bad.

Once they get the high ping issue figured out, it's finally a ready package and i can finally give it a thumbs up and a recommendation. Until then, the thumb stays down.",1669196262,1702776369,False,19,1,0.742388784885406494,0,True,False,False

Listen Im not telling you anything you dont know, You've seen the tiktok videos, the fb reels, whatever of this game, and you wanted to try it. Congrats, you've made a good choice.


Just buy premium, I know you're thinking about it. Do it.

This game is great, Satisfying, and the new modded maps make me smile.

I have a little over 100 hours in this game and its only going to grow.

Devs are active, and put some cool stuff in, they listen to the players for the most part, and respect the opinion of everyone.

Is it the most realistic? Absolutley not. Is it the prettiest? Once again the answer is no.

However the devs open arms to the modding community has created a game of creators that constantly improve the experience, with things like Kino, the mod maps, the mod cars, everything is just......God its good.

I want you to imagine this game as the Gmod of drifting, the wacky, crazy car options you can make, the countless tracks, being able to bump doors with your best buddy down a mountain pass in a donked hot pink corvette with enough camber lean to make MJ jealous is the charm.

This game is not merely an arcade escapade; it is a canvas for the automotive connoisseur, particularly for devotees of JDM legends and the venerable BMWs.

My heart leapt at the sight of the E30, a close copy of my own chariot. This digital counterpart dances through corners with a grace that transcends pixels, composing a ballet of burnt rubber and euphoric roars that echoes the thrill of real-life drifting.

The game's physics blend the exhilaration of arcade style with a nuanced understanding of drift mechanics - a delightful paradox that challenges yet entertains. Multiplayer is a crucible where camaraderie and rivalry fuse, a test of skill peppered with jests and laughter.

Visually, the game is a masterpiece of dusk and dawn, a world where each drift leaves a brushstroke of tire marks on the canvas of asphalt.

In summation, 'CarX Drift' is where my E30 and I transcend reality, pirouetting into a fantasy of perpetual over-steer. This game is not just a play of speed and skill; it's a poetic ode to the art of drifting.

So I gave this game some more time and didn't really made any progress with a steering wheel so I bought asseto corsa and it was very similar. However after few hours I was slowly getting better and after few days I was able to link the full track with steering wheel and zero assist. With this new knowledge I came back to CarX to try wheel and no assist and after few tries I actually started drifting, just like it works in Asseto.

It's waaaaaay more easier to play this game with controller, but with a wheel you get pretty very immersive experience and once you figure it out, it's very rewarding. 

Can't wait to put even more hours how much I can improve.

Regarding the VR issues, it now works perfect. They keep updating the game so they probably fixed it.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Bought this game to play in VR and steering wheel. 

The game is ok but for me it's not overwhelming experience as all the reviews say. Very arcade ish.

On gamepad I can get gold trophys everywhere but with the steering wheel it's extremly dificult to keep the car doing what you want. Maybe I just need to put more hours in or maybe tweak the car settings so it works better with steering wheel idk. 

Regarding the VR experience. Game is very hard to make it work in VR. half of the times the screen is shaking and the other half times the game doesn't even start in VR at all.

Feels very repetitive. Cars without licences so they are copy pastas of real cars but with fake names. 

For me 6 maybe 6.5/10 experience.
Will try to play it more with the wheel to see if I improve and update the review.",1691337455,1701121616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It stands out in the racing game genre with its focus on realistic drift mechanics and extensive vehicle customization options.

Graphics and Sound: The game features visually appealing graphics, with detailed car models and diverse environments that range from urban streets to rural settings. The sound design is notable, with engine sounds and tire screeches adding to the realism of the drifting experience.

Gameplay Mechanics: The core gameplay revolves around mastering the art of drifting. The physics engine is designed to provide a realistic drifting experience, which can be both challenging and rewarding. The game requires skill and practice to perfect drifting techniques, making it appealing to players who enjoy mastering complex driving mechanics.

Customization and Vehicle Variety: One of the game's strongest aspects is the extensive customization options for vehicles. Players can modify almost every aspect of their cars, from engine and suspension to appearance, allowing for a high degree of personalization. The variety of cars available caters to different preferences, adding to the game's replay value.

Multiplayer and Community Features: The multiplayer aspect is a key component, allowing players to compete against others in drifting challenges and tournaments. The game fosters a strong community, with players sharing tips, customizations, and competing in events, which enhances the overall experience.

Difficulty and Accessibility: The game has a steep learning curve, particularly for players new to drifting. While this adds depth for those seeking a challenge, it can be a barrier for casual players or those looking for a more straightforward racing experience.

Content and Updates: The developers actively support the game with updates, adding new cars, tracks, and features. This ongoing development keeps the game fresh and engaging for the player base.

Conclusion: This drift racing game excels in delivering a deep, customizable, and realistic drifting experience. Its high-quality graphics, sound design, and robust physics engine make it a standout title for drifting enthusiasts. However, its complexity and focus on drifting might not appeal to all racing game fans. For those seeking an in-depth and authentic drifting simulator with a vibrant online community, it offers a rewarding and engaging experience.",1701058477,1701058477,True,13,0,0.634202778339385986,0,True,False,False

The customization features are impeccably designed, offering a nuanced control over suspension, wheel, and tire specifications. The options for body-kits evoke a sense of nostalgia reminiscent of classic racing game series such as Need for Speed, Tokyo Xtreme Racer, and Midnight Club. While the decal editor may require some patience due to its touchy nature, it allows for precise detailing decal by decal.

The driving experience itself is highly commendable. The physics governing the car's movements, rolls, and slides appear to be meticulously crafted, offering a semblance of accuracy. Notably, each car exhibits distinct performance attributes, accompanied by unique engine sounds, contributing to an immersive driving encounter.

The game boasts an outstanding selection of cars, albeit under names crafted to potentially circumvent copyright issues. The accuracy of the car representations, with names like Glorious XZ (reminiscent of the Nissan Z32) and Hachi-Roku (evoking the Toyota AE86), adds an authentic touch to the experience.

For enthusiasts of automobiles who relish the combination of customization and racing, this game excels, offering a highly satisfying and well-executed drifting gaming experience.",1598672555,1701042705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:
- Very strong car list with pretty much everything you could ask for.
- Mod support and Workshop.
- Active community.
- Good wheel & controller support (can be played with Keyboard).
- Physics are good, not to easy but not super hard to get into it.
- Custom car configurations and possibility to swap engines.
- Livery creator.
- Crossplay with PlayStation, Xbox and Switch players.
- Car setups, designs and maps sharing.

The bad:
- Still the occasional lag in maps or when players join.
- Sometimes the game still crashes.
- 16 players max for a lobby. I know if they increase this number to 32 the game would not run properly but it would be nice.
- Personal point, Civic EK Hatchback and S2000 still missing from the car list.

Conclusion:
If you want a game to put on some music and just chill this is it. At the same time, it can be super competitive if you find the right people to tandem or make custom competitions. You only need to like cars and/or drift to enjoy this.",1700861236,1700861236,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1]The good:[/h1]
-	Very strong car list with pretty much everything you could ask for
-	Mod support and Workshop
-	Active community
-	Good wheel & controller support (can be played with Keyboard)
-	Physics are good, not to easy but not super hard to get into it
-	Custom car configurations and possibility to swap engines
-	Livery creator
-	Crossplay with PlayStation, X-Box and Switch players
-	Car setups, designs and maps sharing

 [h1]The bad:[/h1]
-	Still the occasional lag in maps or when players join
-	Sometimes the game still crashes
-	16 players max for a lobby. I know if they increase this number to 32 the game would not run properly but it would be nice
-	Personal point, Civic EK Hatchback and S2000 still missing from the car list

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you want a game to put on some music and just chill this is it. At the same time, it can be super competitive if you find the right people to tandem or make custom competitions. You only need to like cars and/or drift to enjoy this.",1700693097,1700693097,True,3,0,0.541844844818115234,0,True,False,False

Works great on controller, TONS of vehicle customisation with loads of free livery editor, body kits and wheels to choose from. Recently got workshop update which allowed us to easily share Tunes/Liveries/Custom maps with other players and they all work online, people can see your custom downloaded liveries and you can all play on modded custom maps together with friends or random players tandeming together. Plenty of custom maps already, from drifting on an aircraft carrier to Japanese touge tracks and real life drift tracks. 

If you're thinking of buying this solely for wheel gameplay I wouldn't recommend it, as wheel driving in this is not that great.

Hra nabízí úžasnou grafiku, realistickou fyziku a širokou škálu vozů, které vám umožní prozkoumat umění driftování ve své plné kráse.

Jedním z hlavních taháků CarX Drift Racing Online je jeho realistický model řízení a fyziky. Každý vůz se chová podle svých skutečných protějšků, což poskytuje hráčům autentický zážitek ze závodu. Driftování je přesně tak náročné, jak by mělo být, a hráči se mohou cítit, jak auto klouže elegantně po zatáčkách.

Grafika hry je dechberoucí. Detailní modely vozů, okolní prostředí a efekty jsou vynikající. Každý závod přináší vizuální požitek a dojemně zachycuje rychlost a intenzitu závodů. Různé tratě nabízejí rozmanité scenérie a výzvy, což udržuje hru svěží a zajímavou.

Velký výběr vozů zahrnuje klasické driftovací legendy a moderní sportovní vozy, které hráčům umožňují vybrat si vozidlo podle svých preferencí. Možnost úprav vozidel dodává hře další rozměr, protože hráči mohou ladit svá auta podle svého stylu a preferencí.

Online multiplayer je skvěle provedený, ať už jde o soutěže s ostatními hráči nebo společné driftování. To dodává hře sociální rozměr a umožňuje sdílet závodní vášně s ostatními fanoušky.

Celkově lze říci, že CarX Drift Racing Online je vynikající volbou pro všechny milovníky driftování a závodění. Realistická fyzika, skvělá grafika a široká škála vozidel zajistí hodiny zábavy a adrenalinu.

You don't really need a lot of car knowledge, and with there being a workshop style browser for tunes for your cars, you don't even need any at all, just snatch some tune that looks good and try it out.

CarX Drift Racing Online brings the thrill of tire-scorching, adrenaline-pumping drift racing to the online gaming world. As a seasoned racing game enthusiast, I found this title to be a refreshing take on the genre, but it's not without its quirks.

Gameplay: ★★★★☆

CarX Drift Racing Online lives up to its name by focusing primarily on the art of drifting. The drifting mechanics are solid, and it's evident that the developers put a lot of effort into getting the feel just right. Drifting through tight corners, maintaining control, and racking up style points is immensely satisfying. The game's physics engine adds realism to the experience, making it a joy for those who appreciate precise car control.

However, the game's scope is limited compared to other racing titles. It's primarily about drifting, and if you're looking for a diverse racing experience with a wide variety of cars and tracks, CarX Drift Racing Online might not fully satisfy your appetite.

Graphics and Presentation: ★★★★☆

The game's graphics are impressive, especially considering its indie game status. The cars are beautifully detailed, and the tracks are visually appealing, with a variety of environments to race in. The dynamic lighting and weather effects add a layer of immersion to the experience. That said, the game isn't a graphical powerhouse, but it more than holds its own in the world of indie racing games.

Sound and Music: ★★★☆☆

The sound effects in CarX Drift Racing Online are serviceable, with engine roars and tire squeals that enhance the feeling of speed and control. However, the game's soundtrack is somewhat forgettable and lacks diversity. Fortunately, the option to play your own music in the background helps alleviate this issue.

Multiplayer: ★★★★☆

The online multiplayer component is where CarX Drift Racing Online truly shines. Racing against other players in real time, competing for the highest drift scores, and engaging in tandem drift battles are all thrilling experiences. The online community is active, and the ability to create and join drift lobbies keeps the multiplayer aspect fresh and engaging.

Customization: ★★★☆☆

CarX Drift Racing Online allows for a degree of car customization, with options for tuning and visual modifications. While it doesn't offer the depth of some other racing titles, it provides enough to personalize your drift machine to some extent.

Replay Value: ★★★★☆

The replay value of CarX Drift Racing Online is high, especially if you're a fan of drifting. The desire to master different cars and tracks, improve your drifting skills, and climb the leaderboards will keep you coming back for more. The online multiplayer aspect adds significant replayability, and the sense of competition is addictive.

In summary, CarX Drift Racing Online delivers an enjoyable and authentic drifting experience that caters to a niche audience of drift racing enthusiasts. While it lacks the breadth of content found in larger racing franchises, it excels in its focus on delivering a solid drifting experience. If you have a penchant for powerslides and sideways action, CarX Drift Racing Online is a game worth exploring.",1698622290,1698622290,True,4,0,0.507905185222625732,0,True,False,False

The game is solid for drifting, yes, but don't ask the game for anything else. I'm main racing and that part of the game sucks, bad mechanics, bad car settings. players Toxic everywhere. not a balance between cars or do you use the most powerful or the second most powerful. Maps become extremely repetitive. The fact that to play this game decently you have to install external mods like kino or zml is sad, especially because they use these mods to modify the parameters of other players in the game, making the game unplayable on some servers. apart from the bad optimization of the game, being that with a Ryzen 9 3950x/RX 7900 XTX.

Hands down one of the best looking and aesthetically pleasing drifting games out there. The graphics look really pretty on Ultra settings (obv not as good as AAA Games). The drifting is nice, the car collection and customization is amazing. The vinyls are amazing. The updates keep bringing new things. However, after a good 3-4 hours of the game you don't feel like you have much to do. Yes, drifting and touges with friends online is a blast, however, I've spent way more time on the mobile version of game with different modes such as Multiplayer. 
The developer keeps bringing new updates to the game, so here's hoping Multiplayer mode and ranks would be included in the upcoming updates. The game as of now is a sold 8.5/10. Would just love to have more competitive options such as a proper drifting or time attack mode against friends and people online.

Unlike many of its peers, you're straight into the action with a solid player base. One of the highlights? Customizing your ride; not only can you deck it out, but the gameplay keeps you earning and upgrading. The variety in community-run servers is legit, from Car Meets to Street Drifting. And while it caters beautifully to beginners, there's depth for the car junkies with advanced controls and tuning. Now, I'm a sim-racing purist at heart, and while CarX leans more arcade-y, it's got a sprinkle of 'sim-cade' for those of us wanting a dash of realism.

The virtual world of tire-screeching drifts was your refuge, and you threw yourself into it with abandon.

As you raced through the neon-lit streets, perfecting each drift, a sense of exhilaration washed over you. It was as if the worries of the real world were left behind, and for those moments, you were free.

But then, a notification popped up on your screen. It was a message from an old friend, someone you hadn't spoken to in years. Their name brought back a flood of memories, both good and bad. You hesitated, contemplating whether to respond or continue racing.

With a heavy heart, you decided to reply. As the conversation unfolded, it became apparent that your friend was going through a tough time. They needed someone to talk to, to share their burdens with. Despite your longing for escape, you couldn't turn your back on them.

You left the game and spent the night talking to your friend, offering support and understanding. The virtual drifts would have to wait, but in that moment, you realized that sometimes, being there for someone in need was more important than any virtual victory.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Maps are fun. Some people prefer tight corners, some prefer speed and slide and we have maps for all tastes.
Big car collection with super easy way to make money for new cars/upgrades.
Then, for the rest that the game doesn't bring in the vanilla, there are tons of MODs

--------------------------
OVERALL: 10/10
This game has the most accurate car culture references to dates even triple AAA Racing game failed. Never get tired with this game always come back [Assetto Corsa good as well if got steering wheel ].

Reason?
Pros:
- Drift Physic is superb and fun [addicting]
- Various of tasteful JDM Car that hardly release in any current game.
- Tons of customization and decal [ Got an RX7 Kit (R-MAGIC) when NFS don't have one... ]
- Make sure install Kino Mods [ Custom map/plate/Enhance graphic ] and your game is up to next level.
- Game file size when installed is wayy too good.

Cons:
- Add more map [Urban Area/etc]

When it comes to using an unassisted steering wheel, I was so surprised to find out how much the tuning mattered in CarX. after coming in with the assumption it would be completely arcade and surface level fun. The tuning is a huge part of the game and I really enjoy the trial and error, dialing it in just right and then being rewarded with a super fun experience when you nail it. 

I'm 43 hours in, with over 300 drift events completed and haven't even played anything but single player solo drift and it's the most fun I've ever had with any racing game - I took on an enormous sim rig upgrade just for this and it was 100% worth it.",1691113085,1691113085,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have quite a lot of tuning options, the game is fun for a long time, especially if you play again and again and don't play for hours at a time. The multiplayer also plays well and without major problems. However, the driving physics of some vehicles are completely weird. Furthermore, the game apparently does not have the permission of the vehicle manufacturers to name the vehicles with real names. For example, a Ford Mustang is called ""Cobra GT530"" or a Viper: ""Rattlesnake"". WTF. Well, that may be irrelevant to some, but it goes further. To get the platinum trophy in this game you MUST buy all the DLC, otherwise no chance. So if you're just looking for a racing game to just play around a bit, you'll get a good, solid game here.

I love this game but somethings it doesn't bring happiness to me that are able to exist but don't like your car having a certain amount of fuel and griefers

this game is fun but after playing it for 8-10 months it does get pretty repetitive there is never any new good updates that bring new maps and exciting cars. I personally just want a bit more cars and a few new maps like a Tokyo highway map, and I think some super cars or muscle cars would fit into this game perfectly.

Overly you can do everything you can't do in real life, like drifting, driving backward

CarX Drift Racing Online offers an enjoyable drifting experience despite its imperfect physics. What sets this game apart is its extensive car customization options, which more than make up for any shortcomings. In other racing games like Forza, players often spend more time customizing their cars than actually racing, and CarX Drift Racing Online delivers exactly that.

The level of customization in this game is impressive. You have the freedom to create genuine modifications that you would see on real street cars. From painting individual panels to customizing the engine bay, the attention to detail is commendable. It's even possible to remove bumpers and add nudge bars, which adds a unique touch to your vehicle.

Exploring the customization options in CarX Drift Racing Online feels like stepping into an Autobot repair bay, where you can transform your car into a masterpiece. The ability to personalize your ride to such a detailed extent is a standout feature. It allows players to showcase their creativity and create cars that truly represent their style and preferences.

While the physics may not be flawless, the fun factor of the drifting gameplay helps overlook this aspect. Drifting through corners and maintaining control over your car is a thrilling experience that keeps you engaged. The sense of satisfaction when executing a perfect drift or linking multiple drifts together is unmatched, making you feel like a Decepticon leaving a trail of chaos in your wake.

Despite its focus on customization and drifting, CarX Drift Racing Online could benefit from further refinement in its physics department. Nevertheless, if you're a fan of car customization and enjoy the adrenaline rush of drifting, this game offers an enjoyable and immersive experience.

Overall, CarX Drift Racing Online serves as a playground for car enthusiasts who want to express their creativity through customization. With a wide range of genuine modifications, the game provides endless possibilities to create your dream ride. While the physics may not be flawless, the fun and excitement derived from the drifting gameplay make it a worthwhile experience. Strap in, customize your car, and hit the tracks for some exhilarating drift action.

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking

the only problem in this game is the lack of a steering speed/sensitivity option for controller. it's very hard to drift with controller in this game without assists because the steering wheel moves way too fast. even if you figure out how to drift without assists, the drift will most likely not be smooth and the tire will basically TP from one angle to another every second.

all in all, great game.",1688103884,1688103884,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False
