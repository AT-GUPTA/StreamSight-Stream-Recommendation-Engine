(But for reference I have played this game much more in depth on console on its release) I cannot for life of me understand why this game is as hated as it is.

Its a great game with fantastic storytelling. And objectively *nearly* identical mechanics to BL2, which to say is the crown jewel of the series. The villains were still interesting, Col.Z and the ??????. Showing the backstory of one of the most deranged and insane characters in all of video game history was a incredible experience. You can see a man with already a few screws loose, go completely insane over the course of the game. You see the progression, your there hand in hand watching him slowly slip down this slope of power. 

While the oxygen mechanic was kind of meh. I never was in a point where I actually had to worry about it. It practically replenishes on its own if you shoot enemies. And there's a spot to get oxygen practically every 5 feet. So really if you had that much of a problem with it, the only response I have is: Skill issue I guess? 

And moving onto the VH's you can play as. They are just awesome. Like the gladiator? Hell yes. F**IN WILHELM? YES SIR.

CLAP TRAP? Eh why not its funny.

And don't even get me started on the Doppelganger. Single best character I have ever had the pleasure of playing as. The voice actor for HJ, is the same guy as the Doppelganger, (as it should be.) And I like the Doppelganger more. Thats saying something to how incredibly the DG was written. 

That being said. Also expanding on Moxxi was a neat touch.

9.5/10 not enough Jack.

Not only not as good, but while they were all a bit buggy, it seemed to get worse with each game. With this one, it's so bad I bugged out on the final boss and got stuck outside the fight while my friend had to finish it, and then they had to exit the level because I was stuck and unable to move. And, of course, when I went to play on my own afterward, I found that since I bugged out on the fight, it didn't complete it for me. So of course I tried to do it myself, but the fight is so absurdly ridiculous that it's next to impossible. I went into it with full ammo and the boss takes so many hits, refilling its shield and health after you kill it so many times, that I'd just run out of ammo before I could kill it. And then I'd die, and it would restart the fight while, of course, leaving me with next to no ammo, because of course when I couldn't kill it with full ammo, it makes sense I'd be able to with no ammo for some guns and partial ammo for others. Gearbox clearly got lazy after the first game, hardly doing anything to improve the games or fix the issues, and in fact making some things worse, while just riding off of the name.

[h3] Actual Review (No Spoilers) [/h3]
This game makes me sad. It had all the potential to outdo BL2: A quality story, more refined gameplay, better balance, better movement, and better designed vault hunters. The pieces were placed and then....2K Australia shut down. And thus TPS stopped development before a full set of campaign DLCs and whatever additional things they had planned could be developed and released.

[h3] Story [/h3]
Let's cover story first. Right off the bat, Borderlands has never been about story and the primary focus of the games are the gameplay/grind. The further into the franchise you get the stories do become more centered (which in some cases actually detract from the enjoyment of the game imo) but nevertheless, most stories the mainline games have are good to average. Thankfully, TPS falls on the good side of the spectrum as this game is Handsome Jack's origin story and rise to power. A lot of other stuff is explained here as well such as Claptrap's story, and it's overall a nice lore dump of a game for the series.

[h3] Gameplay: Combat, Grind, Content [/h3]
But the meat of the game is the gameplay. There's been a lot of changes, and most make for a unique spin on the Borderlands formula. This game is on Pandora's moon, so there's things like low gravity, an oxygen system, and air boosting/slamming. Cryo is also the new element that replaces slag and it's pretty good. Most bosses are also more unique and more creatively designed across the board compared to BL2 (and certainly compared to BL1). Endgame balance (which doesn't really matter until UVHM) is MUCH better than BL2's endgame balance. Partly because there's more viable weapons, but also better overall enemy and combat mechanics so that everything just isn't a tank like with BL2 UVHM and OP levels. The designs of the vault hunters are also improved. I can't say they are objectively better made than BL2's characters, but for the most part, skill trees are more complex and are much more synergistic, as well as rarely having any bad or weirdly scaled skills. For these reasons I have a theory that these characters were designed from the start with UVHM in mind, also because the insane builds you can run make even max level UVHM kind of easy. I will always wonder if 2K/Gearbox had planned to add OP levels or some equivalent to this game, I'm pretty sure these characters would have a way easier time there than BL2's characters.

Now in terms of the game itself: the engine, mission structure, and underlying framework. This game isn't as tight and polished as BL2. There's a variety of bugs and quirks and it's easier to glitch out or softlock stuff. But for the vast majority of the game, the only bugs you'll find don't interfere with your progression at all and are more just funny moments to laugh at. Characters walking through stuff, enemies randomly sinking into the ground or ragdolling across the map, NPCs breaking their neck to look at you, stuff like that. Borderlands being a more ""wacky"" game with how the humor and stories are constructed, these bugs almost feel like they fit right into the game.

The only major gripe that I and most people have with this game is the severely lacking endgame. There are no true raid bosses even in the DLC. You have a single campaign DLC and a Moxxi's Underdome-style arena DLC. the arena DLC is fine since it adds new gear and isn't completely obnoxious like Moxxi's Underdome. But thankfully the campaign DLC is one of the best campaign DLCs in the entire franchise with pretty much no downsides. It introduces a ton of new content, gear, and a new rarity type. The ONLY other big issue I have with this game is it feels like Gearbox/2K took a step back in terms of streamlining the game. A few examples would be like how there aren't many dedicated drop sources (which I understand because they want you to use the grinder, but it's not as fun) and there are also a handful of maps that have NO fast travel in them, so you can't travel to and from them easily. No idea why this is a thing.

[h3] Play With Mods!! [/h3]
Lastly I should mention that like BL2, there are tons of mods that you can run that improve the game tremendously as well as add new content like gear and enemies. If you're a first time player, I would HEAVILY suggest playing with the Unofficial Community Patch or the Exodus Overhaul mod as they are literally just TPS but better. (They also don't interfere with achievements and you'll be able to unlock everything normally)

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
This game is definitely worth playing still and is an important part of the Borderlands series and story. It's got a great sandbox of new features and mechanics that offer a cool twist to the Borderlands formula. 8/10",1670107374,1706670890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played just about 100 hours of B:TPS and, I am truly sorry here, but it's the worst game out of the lot. I will explain my reasoning below, so, let's get to it.

 [h1][b] The issues/cons/Why it's the worst Borderlands game [/b][/h1] 
⚫So, my first main issue is one of the main reasons why it is the WORST borderlands game to date. NPC's get stuck on EVERYTHING. The very start of the game, when you are told to follow Jack and he goes to walk onto the elevator, he gets stuck running into the dead body of the loader you had to melee. This forced me to restart my game 3 times before it fixed itself. This happened on countless missions. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3148204468 
⚫Enemies get stuck in walls, floors, roofs, objects e.t.c. This also forced me to restart my game over and over again or it forced a ""FAILED"" quest on me.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3150001492 
⚫Killing a boss or doing a quest that has an item or a bunch of items that drop is painfully bad. All of the dropped items get sent to space (LITERALLY) and you are unable to pick up quest items or the loot from the boss you just killed because of this.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3148205375 
⚫The maps were so boring to run around on. It felt like purposeless wandering with nothing to kill. A few audio logs to collect and like 2-3 cult symbols to collect and that's it. 
⚫The waypoint system in B:TPS is so inadequate it will have you scratching your head, going in circles trying to find out where your going... it will not ""DIRECT"" you or show you a path to your waypoint.
⚫Every single door you open you need to slog back through the area you just came from to flip a switch, pull a lever or activate a jump pad to open the door then drag your butt all the way back to the door. 
⚫Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel lacks TRUE engame content. Borderlands 2 had INSANE memorable content, bosses, guns, OP levels and so much more. B:TPS has NONE of this. No gun is memorable. No boss is memorable. No OP levels. No AMAZING DLC. Nothing. Just True Vault Hunter and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. If you want, you can farm the guns from boss's but why... why do it on this game  when you can play the BEST borderlands game.... Borderlands 2. 

[h1][b] Pros/The only things that made Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel good [/b][/h1] 
⚫Jack. The story of how jack goes from HERO to Maniac is one of the biggest reasons to play this game from start to finish. Meaning you will spend about 20-or-so-hours trekking across Pandora’s moon, Elpis. Jack is more sympathetic in this game and it does not make him into the clichéd misunderstood villain. He is excellently written.
⚫The new ""VAULT HUNTERS"". The new VHs are really well designed. First you have Wilhelm, accompanied by his flying drone duo, Wolf and Saint. These two really stand out. One does automated bombing runs while the other hangs back to heal him. Then you have Nisha who is a gunslinging killing machine with AIMBOT. Then you have Athena that throws shield's like Captain America. Then you have Claptrap who is by far the craziest, granting him different abilities depending on the situation at hand. 
⚫The DLC. I'm not going to say much about this but all I am going to say is this - You go inside of Claptrap. Yes. For. Real.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
Spending 10-15 hours jumping through hoops before you get to the good stuff makes this Borderlands game a boring snore fest. The lack of endgame content and the bugs/issues I encountered really had me pushing through the game so I could finish it and never touch it again. If you want a ""GOOD"" Borderlands experience, just replay Borderlands 2 over and over again. It has amazing DLC's. Amazing combat. Amazing weapons and so much more. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel feels like a rushed standalone adventure in the Borderlands universe.

[h1][b] 4/10. It's a good game if you're interested in seeing Jack become the Villain apart from that, Borderlands 2 outshines this by a mile [/b][/h1]",1706559628,1706559903,False,12,2,0.516018509864807129,0,True,False,False

Taking the FPS genre in a new direction. The second one took what the first game was, and did a complete 180. The story was fantastic. the game play  was amazing, and the characters are some of the best if not the best to ever grace all of video games. Gearbox and 2K took this formula, and somehow failed to match the original. Not only is there way less content (half of every map is empty, and I managed to finish the story twice and am more than half way through my third play-through of my first character in a little less than 120 hours, compared to my 200+ hours of Borderlands 2 and I just started my 3rd story play-through) but its been really frustrating. i went back and fourth on my 2nd story modes twice on both games, and discovered that The Pre-Sequel is in fact way worse in terms of game play. guns are not nearly as powerful yet enemies get stacked to a point where you can empty mag after mag into them and they have the ability to one hit you and you get knocked down repeatedly. The combat in Borderlands 2 is very well balanced overall and I had a lot of fun playing even when I raged. The Pre-Sequel was just downright frustrating. The Claptastic Voyage DLC takes this and made everything so much worse. if you haven't payed for that DLC, don't. The final boss will make you wish you never bought this game. In addition all of the loot is really weak and honestly not worth it. The only thing that saved this game for was story. It wasn't perfect, not even close, but I kept playing it for that reason and because I'm trying to 100% it and be done. Side note but the optimization is really bad. lots of frame issues and the default settings are garbage.

-There's a new environment that is 6/10 interesting (wouldn't call it amazing)
-There's a new equipment type that is 6/10 fun (wouldn't call it amazing)
-There's the weapon grinding together system which is 7/10 kind of amazing (but see the drawbacks below)

Bads:
-Things like Roland and Lylyth's relationship were bad to even have to hear in the second Borderlands right?!?!?! Well, get ready cause it seems like everyone and their dog (hide your stuffed animals and legs) are super ready to be in a relationship with anything that moves... and it's just as akward as Roland and Lylyth, but much much much more prolific and randomly tossed in. Literally, 0/10. If you are going to do something relating to romantic or physical relationships, make it funny, or make it make sense. No wonder there won't be anymore borderland games.
-Falling into instant death is not fun, but is now a staple (though it may add some mild irritating thrill). 2/10
-Why do I never have any money ever? Maybe we had a little too much and not enough to buy in the other Borderlands, but in this one there are a couple more interesting things for sale... and you can't ever afford any of them. The grind and purchase mechanics aren't two options, they aren't competeing options, they are directly opposed options. And keeping money is even harder cause you fall to your death every 6.5 minutes. 2/10

So averaging out my scores I'd confirm my feeling that this game gets a total of 3.83/10. By the way get used to averages, cause when you grind items together they will average the level of each item together. You think damage per second is fun to calculate? Me too.

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is an incredible accomplishment that not only lives up to the high standards set by its predecessors but also introduces new and interesting components. This installment elevates the iconic Borderlands experience, both literally and figuratively.

The moon-based environment is brilliant, introducing low-gravity gameplay that completely changes the way we approach combat. Vault Hunters can now soar into the skies, performing jaw-dropping aerial stunts and annihilating opponents. The sheer excitement of navigating this low-gravity world adds a thrilling layer to the Borderlands formula, which is already addicting.

The story, which takes place between the first and second games, adds to the lore of the Borderlands universe. The new ensemble of characters, which includes Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha, and the iconic Claptrap, adds a new perspective while retaining the series' distinctive wit. The plot takes surprising twists and turns, keeping players interested and committed in the fate of Pandora and its moon.

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel's cel-shaded graphic design continues to amaze. Character design, environment design, and weapon variety are all exquisitely detailed. Each locale is a brilliant, colorful work of art that immerses players in Pandora's chaotic yet delightful world.

The Borderlands series' trademark randomized loot system is in full effect here. Because of the enormous diversity of weapons and gear, each playthrough feels distinct, stimulating research and experimentation. The game accommodates to your playstyle with an unmatched level of customisation, whether you want a rocket launcher that shoots lasers or a shotgun that sets foes on flames.

To sum up, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel surpasses all expectations and is a fantastic intergalactic masterpiece. It solidifies its status as a must-play for both die-hard series fans and newcomers with its inventive gameplay, gripping story, and gorgeous visuals. You won't want to miss this adventure, so get ready, Vault Hunters!",1704569745,1704569745,True,4,0,0.557162642478942871,0,True,False,False

In a world that often feels overwhelming and unforgiving, there exists a game that transcends its digital confines to become a lifeline, a source of solace that saved me when I needed it most. This is not just a game; it's an emotional masterpiece that wove its narrative threads into the fabric of my existence, rescuing me from the depths of despair.

As I embarked on this virtual journey, little did I know that it would serve as the anchor to my sanity during one of the darkest periods of my life. The beautifully crafted tale unfolded before me, a symphony of emotions that resonated with the echoes of my own struggles. The characters, mere pixels on the screen, became companions in my solitude, offering solace and understanding when the real world seemed devoid of both.

The game's narrative prowess lies not in its complexity but in its ability to mirror the intricacies of the human experience. It became a mirror reflecting my own journey, the highs and lows, the triumphs and defeats. As I navigated through the virtual landscapes, I found echoes of my own resilience mirrored in the protagonist's struggles, a comforting reminder that I, too, could overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in my life.

There were moments of profound beauty, delicate and poignant, that left an indelible mark on my soul. The soundtrack, a haunting melody of hope and melancholy, served as a companion during my loneliest nights, weaving a tapestry of emotions that guided me through the tumultuous seas of my own existence.

This game, with its enigmatic charm, became more than a mere escape; it became a lifeline. During nights when the weight of the world threatened to crush me, I could retreat into its digital embrace, finding solace in its narrative that transcended the pixels on the screen.

It's challenging to put into words the profound impact this nameless game had on my life. Suffice it to say that when the shadows seemed insurmountable, it provided a glimmer of light, a reason to hold on, and a reminder that beauty can emerge from even the darkest corners.

To the creators of this masterpiece, thank you for crafting an experience that goes beyond entertainment, transcending into the realm of salvation.

Lower your expectations for both quality (BL2 ripoff) and quantity (DLC size, if that) and enjoy.

New characters, new weapon type (laser), new effects (cryo, lowgrav & vacuum). Some of the new characters are both over the top and flat as a pancakes, and become old after a while. The laser has a lot of variety and a huge ammo pool, but not all player characters can benefit equally well. Some 'new' weapons are very like BL2 originals, this sometimes feels a little copycatlike but also can be great. With the new cryo effect you can now freeze your enemies and punch them in the face at your leasure! There is a nice variety in environments. Due to the lowgrav effect some of the maps are hard (impossible?) to navigate, but google is your friend yet again. 
Added to this a sizable set of quests and an illuminating storyline on Jack to make for a decidedly above average gameplay. Added joy: Many familiar old characters return and the BL story is expanded nicely.

The game offers a perspective into the iconic ""Handsome Jack"" character, adding a layer of novelty for seasoned players.

However, amidst these commendable aspects, certain drawbacks merit consideration. The inclusion of millennial writing elements, while reflective of contemporary trends, does not resonate universally and often alienates a segment of the gaming audience. Additionally, the characterizations within the narrative fails to leave a lasting impression, rendering many of the personas somewhat forgettable.

A further point of contention arises from the perceived lack of substantial rewards accompanying the completion of side quests.

[quote=author]Step into the anti-gravitational chaos of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, a space-faring adventure set on the moon of Pandora. Developed by 2K Australia in conjunction with Gearbox Software, this installment in the Borderlands series offers a unique perspective, exploring the rise of the iconic villain, Handsome Jack. Get ready for a cosmic heist, low-gravity combat, and a whole new side of Pandora![/quote]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel takes the action to the moon, providing a fresh perspective on the events that led to the rise of the series' infamous antagonist, Handsome Jack. With its low-gravity environments, new playable characters, and a narrative that bridges the gap between the first and second games, The Pre-Sequel adds a cosmic twist to the beloved looter-shooter formula.

[hr][/hr]

[spoiler] [h2]Low-Gravity Gameplay[/h2]
The moon's low-gravity environment is a game-changer, introducing a new dimension to combat and traversal. Jump higher, slam down on enemies, and navigate the moon's surface with a sense of weightlessness. The low-gravity mechanics add a layer of strategy and unpredictability to the familiar Borderlands gunfights.[/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Play as Handsome Jack's Henchmen[/h2]
In a unique twist, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel allows players to step into the boots of characters who would later become key members of Handsome Jack's villainous crew. Playable characters include Athena the Gladiator, Wilhelm the Enforcer, Nisha the Lawbringer, and Claptrap the Fragtrap. Experience the rise of these characters as they navigate the treacherous lunar landscape.

[hr][/hr]

[spoiler] [h2]Cryo Element and Oxygen Management[/h2]
The introduction of the Cryo element adds a chilling effect to the arsenal, freezing enemies in their tracks. Additionally, the moon's atmosphere lacks oxygen, requiring players to manage their oxygen supply. Oxygen can be replenished with oxygen generators or by shattering frozen enemies. These elements add an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.[/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Dynamic Storytelling[/h2]
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel delves into the backstory of Handsome Jack, providing insights into his motivations and descent into villainy. The narrative unfolds through the perspective of Athena, who recounts the events to the mysterious character known as the Watcher. The storytelling approach adds depth to the Borderlands lore and offers a fresh narrative structure.

[hr][/hr]

[spoiler] [h2]Moon's Edge Environments[/h2]
Explore the lunar landscapes of Pandora's moon, complete with futuristic settlements, cavernous craters, and low-gravity environments. The moon's edge setting introduces a distinct visual style, combining the familiar Borderlands aesthetics with a sci-fi twist. The environments are not only visually engaging but also contribute to the overall gameplay experience.[/spoiler]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Loot and Weapons Galore[/h2]
As expected from the Borderlands series, The Pre-Sequel continues the tradition of a vast array of weapons and loot. From laser guns to new grenade mods and shields, the moon's arsenal is brimming with high-tech gear. Experiment with different weapon combinations and gear up for the challenges that await in the cosmic frontier.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Cooperative Multiplayer Madness[/h2]
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel retains the cooperative multiplayer mayhem that defines the series. Team up with friends or other players online to form a squad of lunar Vault Hunters. Cooperative play introduces synergies between characters, creating chaotic battles that are even more unpredictable in the low-gravity environment.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Expansive DLC Adventures[/h2]
Extend your lunar adventure with downloadable content (DLC) expansions that introduce new campaigns, characters, and challenges. The DLC content adds even more depth to the story and provides fresh opportunities for loot and mayhem. The moon's edge continues to be a canvas for ever-expanding adventures in the Borderlands universe.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel propels players into a cosmic caper, blending the series' signature humor, looter-shooter mechanics, and a unique low-gravity twist. With its memorable characters, dynamic storytelling, and the lunar landscape as a backdrop, The Pre-Sequel adds a stellar chapter to the Borderlands saga.

As much as I have long enjoyed several Borderlands titles over the years It is absolutely enraging to have Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, a product I paid for - WITHOUT ads - force an ad down my throat every time I load the game. 

Not only is there a banner ad in the middle of the screen on the main menu, there is also a text menu bar ad on the left hand side of the screen. This addition has reconfigured the menu in such a way as 2k hopes the player will accidentally click on the link to the game being advertised instead of allowing you to easily quit the game. 

2k's Steam moderators have censored criticism of 2k's in-game ads in the forums on numerous occasions.

I will keep this review a thumbs down and without any direct mention to the qualities of the game itself (graphics, music, game-play, fun etc) as long as 2K insists on prioritizing their ads at the expense of the product I bought and my experience with it.

""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"", a thrilling installment in the beloved Borderlands franchise, takes players on a cosmic roller-coaster ride through the untold story that bridges the gap between the first and second main titles. Developed by 2K Australia in collaboration with Gearbox Software, this game delivers a unique experience that expands upon the iconic loot-shooter formula while introducing new mechanics and a fresh perspective.

Set on Pandora's moon, Elpis, The Pre-Sequel showcases the rise of the charismatic yet morally ambiguous villain, Handsome Jack. Players find themselves aligning with a motley crew of characters, including fan-favorite NPCs like Claptrap and Athena. The narrative unfolds as a flashback, narrated by Athena, adding depth and context to events previously hinted at in the series. This new perspective injects fresh energy into the well-established universe.

The standout feature of The Pre-Sequel is its low-gravity environment, which drastically alters game-play dynamics. Jumping several times higher and gliding across lunar landscapes feels liberating and adds verticality to the gunfights. Oxygen management adds an intriguing layer, forcing players to keep an eye on their remaining air supply. While this can occasionally feel like an unnecessary distraction, it generally spices up exploration and combat, demanding more strategic decision-making in battles and navigation.

The character skill trees return, accompanied by the brand-new ""Oz"" kits that provide both oxygen management improvements and unique character buffs. This system allows for more personalized play-styles, and experimenting with different combinations is half the fun. The four playable characters each bring their own set of skills and abilities, ensuring diverse experiences in subsequent playthroughs.

Graphically, The Pre-Sequel retains the franchise's distinctive cel-shaded art style, delivering colorful, comic-book-inspired visuals. Elpis' low-gravity setting grants the environments a refreshing twist, showcasing a blend of lunar desolation and twisted futuristic architecture. However, some textures and character models do show their age, especially when compared to contemporary titles.

Gun variety, a staple of the series, receives a cosmic expansion with the introduction of ""Cryo"" weapons, which freeze enemies in ice. Watching foes shatter into pieces brings a gratifying sense of satisfaction. The arsenal's sheer diversity remains a cornerstone, though a few more innovations could have elevated the experience further.

Multiplayer is where The Pre-Sequel shines brightest. Co-op game-play amplifies the chaotic fun, making it an ideal game for playing with friends. However, solo players might find certain encounters more challenging due to the game's balance being somewhat skewed towards cooperative play.

In terms of storytelling, The Pre-Sequel serves as a supplementary narrative to the main series. While it offers valuable insight into Handsome Jack's transformation into a villain, the plot lacks the same level of emotional resonance as seen in Borderlands 2. The humor and quirkiness synonymous with the series persist, but some jokes miss the mark or feel overused.

In conclusion, ""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"" successfully takes a calculated leap into the unknown by introducing new mechanics and a fresh perspective on the beloved universe. With its low-gravity game-play, varied characters, and unique story angle, it's a must-play for Borderlands fans and an engaging entry point for newcomers. While it falls slightly short of the narrative brilliance of its predecessor, it's still a cosmic joyride well worth embarking upon.

1. Story and pacing. 

After beating the game and starting UVHM it's clear as day that the writing ran out of juice by the end of production cycle of this game. While at the very beginning you can see clear paths and motivations for characters, that all goes away by the final chapter. Additionally, some characters are completely gone and pop up to say ""Hi"" before you go to the Vault (Pickle and Janey, for instance).

2. Gameplay and gameplay loop. 

Just like in Borderlands 2, guns are an additional enemy you have to fight in this game. Not only do you struggle with challenging enemies on UVHM, but also struggle with your shitty gun. 

Another issue I have with this game is the grinder. While cool on paper, it feels much like a chore. Also, the game doesn't feature recipe book in-game and it is undercooked. Let's say I want to create a specific type of gun: a Maliwan SMG with shock damage. It would be nice to know that I can grind only Maliwan SMGs with Shock damage to upgrade them to blue/purple/orange. But I'm not too sure such a thing is even in the game, to me it was all random and I can't be bothered testing it out. 

3. Difficulty spike towards the end. 

The game was a breeze up until the last chapter, which ramps up the difficulty quite steeply and feels rushed. 
Just not a pleasant memory about this game is all. 

4. Challenges

Challenges were introduce to replace gun specialization from BL1 and they still suck. By having Baddass rank 2249 I have a salad of added stats to my character, but all those stats individually do not exceed 5%! 

What is a 4,8% added to grenade damage my grenade mod gives me 450 damage per grenade. That would make it around 26 damage! Isn't that all fun and exciting? 

You get the gist of it: it sucks and should have never been added to the game.

5. Classes and characters

Those that I've played are cool. Athena is a famous character from BL1 DLC and Wilhelm comes from BL2 and they are really nice to play. I didn't have any issues with it and it is worth praise. 

Story characters though sucked: Lilith was a bitch, as well as Moxxy, Janey was absent from 60% of the game, Pickle was alright, but still the same issue as Janey. Jack's descent into madness was fun to observe. It's a mixed bag. 

All in all, I would not recommend this game, just go get a copy of Borderlands 1 instead, a much better experience.",1702085910,1702085910,False,1,0,0.434051424264907837,1,True,False,False

I used to play this on PlayStation before caving and buying it on PC to play with friends.

The game runs smoothly, the graphics are pretty and the mechanics are good.
One thing I have noticed is some latency issues if you join another persons' game, no matter how good your (or their) connection is. I don't know if this is a connection issue or something to do with the servers, but at any rate it's not bad enough to spoil the game entirely... maybe screw up a sniper now and then.

Some of the NPC's might act a little buggy here and there, their pathing may be off but this is -usually- caused by a player or NPC walking into their path and delaying or forcing them to walk around you. Don't be surprised if Jack is on an elevator clipping half-way into the door, that's just his thing... let him do his thing. He's okay.

1. Cast of characters. Specially Athena, Handsome Jack's Double and Claptrap. Playing as any of these three is really fun.
2. An Ice day to kill. Freezing enemies and blasting them into flakes of blood and bones?! HECK YEAH! And Lady Aurelia Hammerlock has that in spades!
3. Lasers. They eat up its own ammo reserves like crazy but let's talk be real: you always wanted to melt someone's face off with a constant beam.
4. Handsome Jack's descent into madness. We all know the nice guy we meet in this game is going to be a massive jerk in 2... But why?! Figure out and have fun doing so...

- Filled out the lore with a pretty good narrative.
- Gunplay is always satisfying as well as the fight pace.
- The gravity-based gameplay was actually a cool thing and made sense considering the environment.

Cons:
- Side Quest padding. Backtrack-a-palooza quests are just bad game design and turned the experience into a slog when it didn’t have to be.
- Loot drops suck. I was getting purple loot at higher levels that was worse than green loot nearly ten levels lower.
- Th grinder sucked for me. Even when I added moon rocks with high quality purple guns, I’d get ass for a gun. The only Orange piece of gear I looted was a shield and two levels later, I  found a green one that was better.

I recommend if you actually play for the story and have already completed BL and BL2. If not, maybe you’ll like it.

Making this recommendation off the fact that you can get this and the DLC for a few dollars or less during a sale. Pre-Sequel doesn't have as much content as Borderlands 3 or even close to the vast depth of content as Borderlands 2, but if you're looking for more Borderlands content it's worth at least a run-through on normal mode. If you're looking for a new end-game grind here you're not going to find it. The end-game is essentially non-existent, and you'd be better off grinding OP levels in Borderlands 2, or Mayhem 11 in Borderlands 3.

The story here is the 2nd strongest in the franchise (which isn't saying too much to be fair) and the dialogue isn't nearly as painful as Borderlands 3. The Vault Hunter choices are interesting with the favorite being the Doppelganger (Jack is the default name). Lazer weapons are unique to Pre-Sequel so if you want to try them out this is the only place to. Pre-Sequel also introduced Cryo, slams and removed Slag after Borderlands 2 (thank god). Legendaries that are farmable don't have too bad of farms in my experience, HOWEVER there are legendaries that are locked behind the grinder, so if you want something specific you may have to grind Moonstones first (which drop far more often than Eridium in Borderlands 2).",1700485854,1700485854,True,3,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

FU Garbagebox. Greedy feces. Obnoxious scum ad garbage in the main menu just to sell their garbage games. 

MULTIPLE TIMES they added their ad/malware and broke the game now. DONT BUY ANY 2K OR GEARBOX PRODUCT!

Edit: F BL3. Compared to that piece of waste everything, this could be seen as a masterpiece. it is not as good as BL1 or BL2, but still a solid 7.5/10 after the updates.

Buy the Handsome collection. BL1+2 are Masterpieces. This is a solid good game. dont support epic and dont support 2K/Gearbox. 

TLDR: DONT BUY BL3!

TLDR2:
* Claptastic Voyage is a nice addition. 
* Game is not polished and still has bugs left
* to fully enjoy get the gib.

after playing bl3, i thought this wasnt that bad. but its still that bad. 
I dont know how they effed up so much. 
the constant voice spam is just gamebreaking.
the hyperaimbot of some enemies is worse than all other games together.

Obviously it's not on par with the greatness of BL2, but it does provide you with some interesting mechanics and fun characters to play with in addition to providing you with more lore about the characters/events from BL2/TFTB. People have complained about things such as Oz kits and zero gravity but personally I found them to be enjoyable cause they made traversing the world a lot faster.

I wouldn't buy the Pre-Sequel at full price. However, it has had discounts of 75% (in some cases even 90%) in the past, so I'd definitely recommend getting it on sale if you enjoyed BL2/TFTB.

So much so that it suffers from the same stutter and bad optimization for modern systems that borderlands 2 did. It's in a way like a huge, huge DLC for borderlands 2.

They added some minor new things like laser weapons, cold elemental effect, Oz oxygen function, low gravity and slamming, some new vehicles. but generally just the same game so if you first played borderlands 2, you'll likely get a bit fed up with the mechanics and feeling after a while. I didn't even bother to play the dlcs or all optional quests because I got sick of it in the end. But it's still a good time waster and while I played solo, this game would be far, far funnier and better if you have a good friend to play it with.

What I loved the most was that claptrap/fragtrap is playable in this game. I really enjoyed his dialogue, just felt like there could've been a bit more. He's easily my favorite character so being able to play him was great. This game probably had some of the funniest dialogue yet in the series with plenty of moronic characters doing stupid crap all around.

But there were some glaring issues. There were way too many ""jumping"" puzzles and insane traveling for side quests. I absolutely hated the time I had to spend trying to do the side quests, I thought borderlands 2 was bad with this but this really took it a step further. Really annoying how much time was wasted just trying to rush through the same maps with just a tiny quest and goal in mind, wasting 30+ minutes just walking for a quest sometimes through a place you already visited before and don't care about anymore. Jumping around everywhere due to the ""fancy"" new low gravity and and air jump sucked, so much time wasted trying to solve stupid puzzles that had no clear solution at times, like where to jump from when there are 50 possible points that might work so you just have to walk around, start jumping and hope to find the right place.

It's the first game in the series where I got so fed up in the end that I didn't bother with the dlcs, I instead watched a walkthrough without talking and skipped to the dialogue parts to quickly absorb the story. I also couldn't care enough to finish the last few maps of side quests, it just bored me half to death at that point and I wanted to quit and try out borderlands 3 instead. This is probably in big part thanks to playing alone and having played borderlands and borderlands 2 with all dlcs and quests done right before over the last few weeks. This game is just too similar in all ways to borderlands 2 that I got sick of it and the looting hasn't really changed at all over these 3 games.

I will now try borderlands 3 and hope that it's actually going to change things enough that it's fun to play again. Will probably skip all side quests that strike me as uninteresting or bothersome too. Bet that will make it much more fun. If I had played this game with NO side quests, I would be singing far more praises than I'm doing now I think, but then I likely wouldn't even have been able to finish the last boss without cheating unless it scales.

Oh, and I played probably closer to 30 hours at least for this game, probably because I played in offline mode and then just quit steam without letting it sync properly, it isn't showing the proper playtime.",1699665078,1699665150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

now  some things are bad like the laser guns are so annoying to use but you get shot by them you die really fast and can get shot through walls.

The low gravity makes everything so much more tedious. I was constantly floating helplessly waiting to touch the ground again while enemies can jerk around and defy the physics however they please. None of their motion is natural making it extremely difficult to aim. Oh there's a small lip in the ground I can't walk over. Guess I'll jump way up here and slowly float to the ground to get over it.

The vehicle makes no sense. If there's no gravity when I'm not in the vehicle why is the vehicle stuck so hard to the ground? It doesn't take much to make it flip out. I tried to drive down a seemingly smooth hill only to have the slightest bump send the vehicle out of control and facing the opposite direction.

The quests sent me back to the same areas over and over respawning all of the enemies there and none of the ammo. The lack of fast travel forced me to run through hordes of enemies just trying to get from point A to point B. 

The level design is terrible. I  was exploring a ship doing the main quest and right near the end I saw a chest so I jumped down and opened it only to find that I was now stuck. Unable to jump high enough to escape and unable to kill myself with my measly 3 grenades I had to save and exit. When I came back I had to clear the entire level again just to get back to where I was. Two parts of the main quest had me using a vehicle to jump a gap that took multiple tries and cost me dearly. You need to build speed to make the jump but they didn't give me enough room to build it up or some random bump took it all away. I often found ledges I was sure I could reach but ended up hitting some invisible barrier that suddenly stopped my upward momentum. That rocky slope sure looks like I could use it to climb up that cliff. Nope I just slid smoothly down and got stuck in a hole instead.

Take two steps forward, fight a horde of enemies. Take another two steps forward to investigate the loot and fight another horde of enemies. Try again and yet another horde. The low gravity left the loot scattered everywhere and often in places I couldn't reach. Because of this it seemed like nothing every dropped.

I finally make it to the boss and somehow my shield is instantly gone and I'm burning alive. Try again and again until I am out of cash. Luckily my progress taking down his shield thingies carried between attempts and I was able to unload enough bullets into him while ""fighting for my life"".

It seemed to me the entire time I played I was fighting for my life or reloading or switching weapons. Reloading and switching weapons is painfully slow. Any weapon that reload fast enough isn't doing enough damage anyways. The game is needlessly difficult. They told me to find cover when my shield breaks but the reality is that my shield is almost always broken and there is no cover because I am surrounded.

The game did a poor job of showing me whether things were above or below me on the minimap.

I couldn't break the rocks with my rocket launcher or the missiles from my vehicle. Instead I had to go to the other side of the map, reclear everything in between, and get a few sticks of dynamite to do the job. 

I couldn't even fnish the game it was so tedious and difficult. If you are looking to play a borderlands game I would not recommend this one. If you are a die hard fan trying to finish them all then I commend your efforts. This one truly is a slog.

Apparently certain masochists who played the main campaign in this game complained that the final boss battle was too easy. I hope those deviants were pleasured voraciously by the DLC boss battle because I found it impossible to beat. So while the pre-sequel was a great game there was a sour taste at the end as I could not finish the claptrap DLC. 

The game had another DLC called Shock Drop Slaughter Pit but I never even encountered it in the game. No great loss as I have no interest in challenge gauntlets. I bought the game because I like Borderlands. I played B1, B2 and now this; next would be the point and click game. 

The lower gravity traversal was fun for me. I found enough moonstone to vastly increase my backpack space as this is essential for looting and selling. The new laser like weapons that shoot a constant stream of lightning or fire were also a cool addition. As I played the full version of the game I played as the Doppelganger which is incredibly thematic and hilarious. The Be Inspired skill is a blast to play with. These games have good progression and levelling up and such was the case in this game as well. I appreciated the plentiful golden chest key codes. I unlocked so many keys but I didn’t even use a fraction of them. Standard Borderlands cell shaded style stands the test of time always. Interesting prequel story and well done humour as expected.

However, despite all these good qualities it's important to remember that the studio that made this was shut down not long after the release of this game. Almost all of the game’s characters had the Australian accent, which is not bad but some more variety would have been appreciated. The Kraggons turned out to be the most annoying borderlands species of all time. I saw some reviews and internet comments saying this game showed a misunderstood side of Handsome Jack. Uh no, that's not the case because he remains the same egotistical psychotic maniac he always was. Nothing to sympathize with here. The air supply management was annoying but later loot negated this annoyance, mostly. Backtracking to turn in missions was annoying as usual as there are limited means of transport. Constantly re-spawning enemies are a hindrance as usual. The grinder mechanism did not provide good results for me and I did not use it afterwards.

Everybody has their own taste and IMO Borderlands the Pre-Sequal is better than Borderlands 2.
What I prefer in the Pre-Sequal is both the guns, as there is more variety given with the laser guns and the glitch rarity, and the story/characters. Now, I find the vault hunters we play as a lot more interesting in the Pre-Sequal compared to 2 and, more importantly, they feel more balanced. For instance; I like CL4P-TP/FR4G-TP for his dialog and his action skill and I also like Athena for her aspis, which is a strong throwable shield but also not TOO strong like Salvador's ability to hold two guns and once. The story I find more interesting, as it gives much insight as to why and how Jack became the villain that we know him as from 2. Still, both games are great if you're into Looter-Shooter and I think you should definately give them both a try. 8.75/10",1699109719,1699109889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Below are my thoughts after beating it with all achievements right after a 100% replays of Borderlands 1 & Borderlands 2. Also I used unofficial community patch for the whole playthrough.

[h3]Good:[/h3][list]
[*]main story showing Handsome Jack's rise to power and change from hero to psychopath
[*]gameplay cloned from Borderlands 2 with few nice tweaks like no oxygen atmosphere, lasers and jetpack boosts
[*]playable characters have plenty of voicelines, dialogues and interactions that are funny, well written and fantastically acted, but only during main story[/list]

[h3]Bad:[/h3][list]
[*]SIDEQUESTS - while these were one of the strongest features of BL2, here they're absolutely terrible - offering no interesting story at all, almost zero funny dialogues/comments, and no change in gameplay - to the point that there're at least 5 sidequests that are done in 10 seconds (literally you pick up a sidequest, monologue is being played at the scene, quests ends) - soooo lazy!
[*]NPCs - newly introduced NPCs are mostly cringe and terribly voiced with weird accents that make you want to mute the sound while they speak - no surprise that literally not even one of them returns in BL3
[*]DLCs - two of the dlcs are just arenas (at least one of them has like 3 minutes of story voiceover from BL2 characters... quality content much), while the only story DLC, Claptastic Voyage, was I guess supposed to be funny, but ended up sooooooo boring - I still wonder how can you take one of the most beloved character in the franchise (Claptrap), make dlc with him, supposedly, in the center - and end up with this kind of dull, humorless, weird garbage
[*]basically 2K Australia took all that was amazing in BL2, butchered it leaving only good main story, and weaseled out of doing the rest properly

[b]Ultimately it's better to just watch a recap of main story on youtube with all the dialogues, than waste time actually playing this game. You'll save few dozen hours with absolutely no loss of quality content.[/b]",1699049452,1699050072,False,2,0,0.497494608163833618,0,True,False,False

Today, I'm here to share my thoughts on ""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"" a game that, in my honest opinion, falls a bit short compared to its predecessor (Borderlands 2). Now, before we dive in, let me assure you that my quirky style and love for the franchise will remain intact throughout this review!

Gameplay-wise, I couldn't shake the feeling that ""The Pre-Sequel"" resembled more of an expansion pack to ""Borderlands 2"" rather than a standalone installment. It brought back familiar gameplay mechanics and graphics, which aren't a bad thing, mind you. It's like how ""Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood"" complemented ""Assassin's Creed 2"" but with laser guns and a fresh set of characters. There were some additional features like lower gravity.

Now, let's talk about performance. Things were running smoothly for me until I switched to an AMD 5600 XT graphics card, which should have been a solid choice for the game. However, Borderlands decided to give me a ""poopy"" experience (yes, I said it) and started acting up. If you encounter performance issues, I strongly suggest addressing them immediately, and if all else fails, don't hesitate to request a refund. It's a bit of a lottery with this title, unfortunately. At the moment, there are two fixes one can try, both on [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands:_The_Pre-Sequel]PCGamingWiki[/url]. You can try fully disabling PhysX or fully disabling Texture Streaming. After switching to a Ryzen 5 5600X + RX 6700 XT OC combo, what 100% fixed my performance issues was fully disabling PhysX using the PCGamingWiki instructions. Disabling Texture Streaming was causing me memory-related crashes for some reason.

One of the shining stars of ""The Pre-Sequel"" was Handsome Jack - his character was exceptionally well-portrayed, and the jokes delivered some hearty chuckles. The storyline managed to keep me interested. I must say, Athena and Claptrap were the real showstoppers, adding that extra flair to the overall experience. And let's not forget the epic last boss battle! It hands down earned its spot as the best boss in the series so far.

All in all, ""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"" comes across as a great prologue-like expansion to ""Borderlands 2."" If lady luck smiles upon you and it cooperates seamlessly with your PC, you might find some big enjoyment here. However, being the dedicated fan that I am, I couldn't help but have a bit higher expectations for this game.

For achievement hunters: the game has 63 achievements. As with all Borderlands titles, hunting for all the achievements is a huge, grinding, and time-consuming challenge. NOT for the faint-hearted.

In conclusion, while ""The Pre-Sequel"" may not reach the soaring heights of Borderlands 2, it still has its big moments of fun and charm. So, if you're a die-hard Borderlands enthusiast like me, you'll probably want to give it a shot. Just remember to cross your fingers for a smooth performance and enjoy the quirky adventure!

Happy vault hunting, fellow gamers!

[b]Worth a Buy?[/b]
Yes, if you want to play with others, but ideally you should only get this during a sale along with the collection of the other games. Additionally, this game is essentially a Borderlands 2's expansion that has been made into a standalone title. This game and Borderlands 2 share a lot of similarities. So if you will like this if you like the other.

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
- This review is based on a single-player experience, not the multiplayer co-op experience, so it does not accurately represent that.

[b]The Good:[/b]
- In comparison to Borderlands 2, protagonists now have dialogue to respond to in-game situations, as well as a personality.
- The new laser weapon type is a nice addition.
- Gravity movement mechanics such as double jumping and ground slamming can be entertaining.
- Blood and gore.
- Doesn't contain much DlC compared to the other Borderlands games.
- 10GB install size.
- The art is incredibly distinctive and iconic. It has the feeling of an interactive comic book.
- The game's visuals and aesthetic make it ageless.
- The UI design blends in effectively with the art style.
- When a character makes their initial appearance, a cool intro is played.
- Characters are enjoyable and memorable in a positive way.
- Great voice acting.
- Co-Op for 4 players.
- Solo gaming is still a viable alternative.
- Extremely replayable.
- The skill tree that can be respecced for a fee.
- Contains numerous secrets and easter eggs.
- There are two new game plus+ modes: ""True Vault Hunter Mode"" and ""Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.""
- The game serves as a nice explanation and prelude to Borderlands 2's events. It also clearly expresses Jack's perspective.
- The story writing is fair; it's surely much better than Borderlands 2.

[b]The Bad:[/b]
- Given that the majority of the game is set on a space station and a moon. When compared to Borderlands 2, the environments can feel quite similar.
- The post game is lacking compared to the other Borderlands games.
- The story pacing can feel slow at times.
- Unskippable cutscenes makes replaying very tedious.
- On current PCs, performance can be inconsistent necessitating the use of DXVK.
- The abundance of weapons and equipment in the game can feel overwhelming. As you advance, your equipment will also gradually become obsolete.  
- The limited number of slots and bank space you'll have, as mentioned above, makes this situation worse. Upgrades are a way to increase the amount. It remains too low, however, despite that. If you are a gaming hoarder, you will detest this. 
- The game restricts exploration by putting up invisible boundaries and kill zones.
- Echo devices, which are voice recordings, are not preserved in the game; instead, they respawn for some reason. 
- Other voicelines can cancel voicelines, which can be annoying. 
- You can't track multiple quests at a time.
- The game occasionally feels repetitive.

[b]The Neutral & Informational:[/b]
- You can bypass the initial start-up videos by typing ""NoStartupMovies"" in the Steam startup settings.
- A lot of extra optional side quests.
- It might be hit or miss when it comes to quirky dialogue. Though the quirky dialogue isn't as awful as in other games, if you dislike this type of dialogue, you may dislike this game.
- Is divided into segments in a semi-open world design.
- Has no fall damage, which is great but unrealistic.
- Cutscenes/Cinemamatics are capped at 30fps.
- Because levelling can feel a little slow, character building is mostly an end-game activity.
- Completing the main story and all of the side quests and DLC took me 33 hours. 

[b]Performance:
Windows 11, 165hz 1080p Monitor, GPU: 8GB RTX 3060Ti, CPU: Intel Core i7-12700F, 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM, SSD [/b]
- Performance can be easily fixed by installing DXVK and setting PhysX to low. https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk Extract the 'd3d9.dll' from 'x32' to 'BorderlandsPreSequel\Binaries\Win32\'. By doing this it solved all frame rate issues I had.

[b]Bugs & Glitches:[/b]
- When you initially start the game or alt-tab, it changes your default desktop resolution and refresh rate to match the game's. 
- During the mission ""Eye to Eye"" the audio is bugged.
- I encounter far more bugs in this game compared to Borderlands 2.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
- Since each player won't have the same equipment, the difficulty can vary depending on their gaming experience. As a result, the difficulty can fluctuate depending on the quality of your items. The degree of difficulty was reasonable during my time, and if a mission was too challenging, I would just do several side missions to level up and acquire stronger gear.

[b]Additional Information:[/b]
- Conclusion: This game has held up exceptionally well over time, just like Borderlands 2 did in terms of gameplay, graphics, and artistic design. This is essentially more of Borderlands 2, if you enjoyed that. Also the addition of Co-Op is great as always.",1698091112,1698091112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] ---{ Detail Notes }--- [/h1]

It's lot like borderlands 2 what was to be expected anyways seeing as its squeal it's in the name and so go overs what took place before the events of borderlands 2 with few things that for sure sets it apart seeing as your in, SPACCCEEEEEEEEE! Now. (sorry i still love space core) :3 

It still has most of the great writing and jokes that borderlands 2 did what i loved and got me quite few laughs but, the content within is quite lacking to what i know of borderlands are like. Really finished everything within 63 hours. (DLC's included btw for that total) The very first borderlands had more main, side and dlc length content then this. Also due to how short of it there are also way less bosses and i kinda feel 4 of them at least were quite lame to fight due to how lacking, i didn't feel the need to even play TVHM. (true vault hunter mode to anyone reading this that isn't in the know of that community term name its just a newgame+ kinda thing but harder enemies)


Oh and don't get me started on the moonstones it seems you need heaps of them to even get really great loot outside of farming some bosses or to upgrade your ammo storage/backpack/bank. The need for every single moonstone got so bad i always cried in pain to see a moonstone go off the edge, sometimes i would nearly die for it just to grabbing it mid air before it was lost to a edge or any instant death areas of the maps for real i would put my cash pocket at risk just for one single bit of moonstones.


As for major problems with this game is mainly the servers. They keep borderlands 1-2-3 and the from what i hear tiny tina one severs healthy too. But pre squeal, nah some days the connection is really poor where other then the host you be teleporting all over the place with how many times to connection dips and even then me and my bro trying to play this together also had days where the servers were fully down meaning we couldn't play together at all or even get any redeem codes. Out of all the BL games this is the far worst one to play co op with unless you ok with putting up with how bad the servers are for this game aka you wouldn't mind just suddenly being teleported back on like a jump pad to die and other BS stuff like that.

Oh and idk how but my very first day i played this game i broke the game so much it wouldn't even run without me reinstalling the whole thing luckly didn't get set back too much but the way i broke the game was crazy all i did was run over a enemy in the moonbuggy as soon as i unlocked the moonbuggy. And me and my bro playing together found quite few more other bugs too, for real what ever you do don't crouch up and down in most lifts when its moving you will phase through most of them by doing so and in some of them could solflock you to leave and rejoin.


Anyways spite it flaws and yeah kinda lacking content compared to the other games that came before it and the dang poor server connections. It was still quite a great fun borderlands to play, with sure enough, some epic and fun weapons and gameplay ahead of you in store, not as great as BL2 but it came tiny bit close. 

Yeah i do very much recommend to get this game on at least a small sale. And also get yourself the claptrap DLC while your at it, for real, its soooooo good and lets just say i no longer hate claptrap due to this dlc its changed my mind about him of like all the times i've laughed at him, even the boss battle in that dlc is so much more fun and epic then the main game ones.

This pre-sequal is built like a second floor to borderlands 2. sure, its a whole new floor to the masterpiece, but it doesn't do too much new. it gets its own type (ice), but like the other installments after bl2, i miss slag! or at least something that was as good as slag. ice is fun, powerful at the start, and it feels good to shatter things, but it also does one of the most annoying mechanics to experience for ones self, slow mechanics, where movement is restricted and options limited to P&P (panic and pray) that you get the chance to run away. Its not fun in TF2 to be bonked, its not fun to be shot with ice.
     If you like the Jack story arch (if you like villain stories especially) this is a great run through to hear all the dialogue. be mindful that a lot can cut each other off. i ran through one section and it happened twice in a row. the last voice line was a short quip about nothing.
     If you like completionist time sinks and you are done with bl2 play this.

The one major gripe with the game is that its kinda same-y with the other games, but we had to wait till bl3 for them to shake things up a lot game play wise.

almost forgot the slam mechanic. i use it movement rather than combat. its awkward i guess. not that useful but its nice when its there.

Overall its borderlands 2 but a borderlands 1 sized dlc with a couple neat tricks. its not as big or whatever as bl2, but its build on solid ground and steel frames and a nice story to go along with it. its hard to hate even with the small gripes.

Let me put this in bold so whomever is reading this can get the message clear:
[/b THE BORDERLANDS LEVELING SYSTEM SUCKS MASSIVE D​I​C​K AND BALLS]

IF YOUR GAME REQUIRES ME TO DO YOUR DOG​A​S​S SIDE MISSIONS IN ORDER TO DO MAIN MISSIONS,
I'M SORRY. BUT THAT'S R​E​T​A​R​D​E​D.
What if I don't care for side quests that don't do anything for the story? What if I don't feel like doing fetch quests? What if your ""humor"" isn't for me? These reasons and more are why I typically don't do a lot of side quests in video games because a lot of games don't do side quests right let alone fun. Borderlands, IN MY OPINION, does not do that right.

Back to the topic of leveling systems. Why in the flying f​u​c​k is it that if enemies are even A SINGLE level above me they can ground pound my a​s​s into oblivion despite me unloading 2 magazines with lead into their f​u​c​k​i​n​g skulls. Why is it when I fight same level or higher enemies they can just shred my entire shield while not using shock or corrosive weapons? Why is it when I fight the same level or higher enemies the only way I can reliably do damage THAT WILL KILL GUARANTEE is using snipers and rocket launchers??? I don't have an issue with leveling systems in games, I just hate how the world DOESN'T level with you. Until it does. By that, I mean, when I decided to do a few side quests (stopping my progress on the last mission) I went to the beginning areas and everything there is now my level. So this game will level around you?? but not on the final boss??? 

Brushing my issue with the level aside, idk wtf they did to the pc release but I've had constant frame drops during fights and just exploring the world, some quests straight up break and I have to reload, AI can't comprehend the moon gravity at times, sometimes certain events won't trigger so there will be a locked door blocking my progress. This game just hurts to play. The ""humor"" sucks and again, the humor is attached to the side quests THAT REALLY AREN'T SIDE MISSIONS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO AT LEAST SOME OF THEM to progress. Pistols, Rifles, and lasers feel AWFUL to use. A lot of the ""side"" characters are as interesting as my love life. 

Missions for some odd reason like to give you a straight goal but never make it simple to actually get to that objective. To elaborate. Lets say there was a mission where you had to go to the store to buy milk. In borderlands terms, you exit your house, find out your car doesn't have gas, walk out of your neighborhood and fight 20 enemies that come out of clown cars, find out a UFO crashed in the middle of the road so you have to jump off a bridge into a river, swim up creek and fight 20 more enemies that come out of clown caves, climb up a hill onto a construction site and fight 20 enemies that come out of clown forklifts, you go onto the street and have to plug in the intersection lights so the traffic jam in the street can be resolved, wait for the traffic to clear, enter a loading screen, then meet a character in a lab who won't have any plot relevance till the end of the game but first you have to fight 20 enemies that come out of clown tubes, THEN that guy gives you a jug of milk. Did I mention some annoying A​S​S​H​O​L​E AUSTRALIAN IS SPOUTING NONSENSE THAT ISN'T FUNNY AND JUST MAKES YOUR EARS BLEED, then he reveals himself in person to you, you fight him, kill him, then backtrack, fast travel, listen to boring dialogue, turn in, done. I wouldn't have an issue if there was a mission like this every here and there but unfortunately this is the entire mainline story quest.

Anyway,

L game

Play Persona 3 instead

Update 2020: Gearbox, in all their infinite wisdom, have updated Borderlands 2, and the Pre Seque, to add in additional DRM, in the form of mandatory SHiFT accounts to play. Even singleplayer!

All 2K games now come with a 2K launcher, which is not optional, and requires constant updating. Some titles (Xcom 2, Chimera Squad, Bioshock, Borderlands, etc) have had this launcher installed retroactively.

This launcher collects and shares your information, gathering it from your computer, and heaven knows what other connected devices within your home, and does whatever they wish with it!

[b] Overall : 5/10 [/b]

Borderlands the pre-Sequel is not a bad game per se, especially if you like the Borderlands serie. It remains the same, but where it fall short is basically on every aspect save the story of Handsome Jack. The introduction of Space is a nice concept, but it gets really boring after some time, affecting the gunplay and the movements in an uncool way (at least to me). The story is not very long compared to the main episodes, but you feel that it stretched across large areas with lots of back and forth, impacting negatively the pace of the story unfolding. You can definitely forget this one, and skip to Borderlands 2.

[b] Gameplay : 5/10 [/b]

I like the Borderlands serie, but this one really killed me with its overpresent Space environment. While cool at first, it gets really annoying after some time, especially with its impact on the gunplay. Otherwise, it plays like a usual Borderlands.

[b] Graphics : 6/10 [/b]

The game follows the Borderlands graphic design, i.e. cell shading style, so nothing impressive. It's ok, but definitely not the best of the serie.

[b] Story : 6/10 [/b]

Story wise, it's rather simple and quick, and the main interest is to unfold the backstory of Handsome Jack. And the guy is pretty cool, I'll give him that :). However, I felt it too stretched with no surprises.

[b] Achievements : 5/10 [/b]

For the hunters only. As usual, this Borderlands is pretty annoying for a 100%. You'll need to rank up all 4 characters to unlock their abilities, and 1 in particular is very annoying, with a luck based achievement. Nothing horrible, but it was not a cool 100% for me. At least, for the coop ones, you can get them solo through multiple instances in off-line mode, in case you are wondering.",1695589459,1695589459,False,2,0,0.496226131916046143,3,True,False,False

Also one of the best and refreshing story changes with writing that wasn't pure meme cringe. This game shakes up the meta by introduction zero g combat and massive open areas. Precision weaponry such as pistols, sniper rifles, or any weapon that has a unique modifier that makes it hyper accurate can now be useful at plinking flying or distant targets as you're not just confined to closer quarters combat. Incendinary stacking is also no longer the default go-to as in a vacuum there isn't oxygen for targets to burn. But there's some unique combat mechanics that make up for this such as being able to toggle oxygen generators with shock, jetpacking, and cryo weaponry.

-The gameplay we all love from Borderlands is still here, but with a fresh spin of low gravity, jump pads, and air boosting
-Lasers are a new fun weapon type, and the added element of ice makes shattering enemies enjoyable
-Slamming adds a new way of attacking and knockback, with the added bonus of elemental damage
-Venders actually sell decent gear, making money more than slots fodder
-The Grinder gives use to crappy weapons, making them more than vender fodder
-Uses legacy characters from Borderlands 1 and 2 well, including the playable vault hunters
-Moonstones is the new eridium, with the added bonus of Luneshine weapons with unique bonuses
-A new set of vehicles

The Bad:
-Story suffers from the prequel disease, not allowing it to do anything radical or stretch it's own wings because it has to play to the tune of Borderland's 2 plot and canon
-New characters are at their best forgettable and at worst annoying and unlikable

The ugly:
-Oxygen is an annoyance, especially in the beginning
-Map is riddled with death pits to account for low gravity air boosting

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel really didn't feel like a new ''game''. It honestly really just felt like a DLC.

Sure, it was really interesting to see what's been going on before shit hit the fan in Borderlands 2, but nothing else was new really. It felt just like Borderlands 2, and I felt like it needed more to be a new released game into the borderlands franchise.

In fact I would also say that this is the first game in the Borderlands series that actually feels like a SciFi game. The first two were set on the planet of Pandora, but there weren't really any Scifi elements to them.  They both had a more gritty and industrial feel to them. This game is instead set mostly on Pandora's moon (Elpis) and just the change of setting alone I feel helps to give this game its own identity and is overall a nice change of pace. The game looks amazing! It's actually breathtaking to stand on the moon and  look up into the sky and see the background of stars. The game-play is also much better and includes two big changes that I feel make this an overall better game.

Firstly the slag element is gone and has been replaced with ice/freeze. This new element can freeze the target in place and make them more vulnerable to melee attacks. It's a cool new idea that I feel works much better than slag from 2. 

Another new idea are Laser weapons, they are a vast improvement over both Eridium guns from the first game and E-Tech weapons from the second. These weapons always have an element attached and they have a good rate of fire too. Sometimes they fire a consecutive beam instead that you can use to hit targets for continuous damage. They stand out on their own and don't feel as though they replace any of the others, other weapon types will still be useful in the right circumstances (and also depends on the Class you're playing as). Again bringing in laser weapons helps this game feel more SciFi and I like how powerful lasers can be. One of my favorites being the ZX-1. I almost always keep a laser weapon in my inventory as I find them very useful. I hope laser weapons will come back in future.

I should also talk a bit about the Vault Hunters, they're an interesting group this time around, but honestly they feel more developed than in either of the previous games. They talk a lot more in this game and will comment on things as well as give their opinions on situations. This is something that was sort of present in the earlier games, but not utilized as much. Some VH had interesting personalities but this is the first game where I feel they all are more unique and more than just characters you play as. I love the new dialogue that they gave them as I feel it brings them to life in a way that wasn't done before, another feature I hope gets brought back in the future. Also it's good to see that the Vault Hunters in this game are all good. There's not one that's bad to play as, they each bring something useful to the table in their skills. The skill trees are a bit more refined in this game, overall it feels like most of the skills have a use and that they synergise better. Also you can start investing in skills at level 3 instead of 5 another GREAT improvement!

As for the story, well.... it's interesting to see some of the events that made Handsome Jack who he is. I say some of the events because even at the start you can kind of see that he's not exactly heroic. In a way the story is tragic because we know what's going to happen in the end, and it does a good job of both making you feel for Jack, but also showing that he may have brought some of it on himself. Although it's a ""prequel"" you should still probably play Borderlands 1 & 2 before playing this game to understand the story fully. I will say I did enjoy the story, it still has a lot of great writing that the series is known for, and while you might know it won't end well for Jack it is interesting to see some of the moments that ended up making him who he was and seeing him fall from hero to villain.

The only thing I really wish this game had done better was DLC. There's only one and it's a good DLC but I honestly wish there was more. Still if you buy this game at full price I'd say you're getting your money's worth. Overall a great game and a worthy follow-up to Borderlands 2.",1692851845,1693004282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This could well have been a unusual game and parallel to the [i]Borderlands[/i] universe as it was with [i]Wonderlands[/i]. It feels familiar and known, but at the same time something different: it’s spacey, cosmic and above all enthralling being outside of Pandora. This assumes two things: this pre-sequel was released after Borderlands 2, and you've played both games first. Since everything happens on Pandora, on solid land. In its epoch, it was something new and exciting: an RPG with a story and a gameplay in outer space.

The game seems to be born as a DLC. There was a need to expand the story, deliver more content and there is no better way than to craft a prologue to Handsome Jack. Although I still don’t understand the word of «pre-sequel» that it has in its title. But as would happen with Tina's dlc, it would soon be a separate game and, why not, a new game based on Borderlands. At first glance it offers: New playable characters, some difficult and challenging bosses, an art related to the myth of Eridium, everything pointed to another game. However, what is it that makes it dissimilar from the rest? And is it worth playing?

[h1]The comic descent of a hero[/h1]

Although I'm not sure if the developers intended to conceive an RPG with space gameplay, even though it indicates to something neoteric and innovative. Borderlands 2 has been depicted by having a good story to tell, with hilarity and captivate through a well-created script. This instance it presents something from Jack's past as a prologue. We’ve witnessed a hero suddenly becomes a villain seduced by power upon seeing the contents of the Vault. Since his story takes place between the Pandora’s moon and the space station of Hyperion. The mercenaries known as The Lost Legion commanded by Tungsteena Zarpedon take control the station. Its giant gun is used to fire on the planet. So the mission is to assist Jack stop them. But the plot twists in a startling way.

The mode to relate the story is performed through the memory of Athena, since she’s captured and taken to Sanctuary. By assent to her tell her tale, she becomes the protagonist. So hindsight and flashback are recurring in the game. This allows us to understand a little about their context of many characters in Borderlands 2 and how they came to be who they are. However, assuming the plot is comical that doesn't mean it can't give its story a little gravitas. Sometimes congruence is mislaid when characters like Lilith seem to have amnesia when hearkening about her encounter with Athena. Details are often not spelled out, so they’re filled in with vaguely elaborate narration where there are gaps.

It’s true, we have many new or familiar characters and an Eridium myth that take prompt courses in the story. The script and story are still good, but sometimes their characters require better personality development. Also the transformation from villain to hero was sudden, overnight, in a jump, without really taking us by the hand to feel that love-hate with Jack. Like Darth Vader who leans towards the dark side. The idea is good, but it isn’t being performed in the best way. I consider that the story would have been better created for a different universe, since it has the potential for something even deeper. Even so, it’s a worthy outline in the form of a prologue for an invention of a new adventure.

[h1]Into the Void: The art of outer space[/h1]

Something that’s worth noting is its art and soundtrack. Both constitute the integrity of the plot. Most of the time we can appreciate dark space from the moon. Those open areas whose view of the sky is the immensity of darkness. I be fond of the effect of the light of its star reflecting on pale land, while the giant H and Pandora can be perceived in the background. In some places it achieves to offer a feeling of abysmal loneliness and of floating in an infinite void. The locations are like colonies and alien creatures abide around them. Concordia is the small colony where it be noticeable as does the mesmerizing architecture of Hyperion. Although I deem where it steals the stare are the alien locations. It applies a colour palette common to Eridium, the purple, and organic symmetry because of its myth about that element. That will be picked up again in [i]Borderlands 3[/i].

The environmental proposal is also interesting: From the effects of the explosions to the opaque sound, assuming there is no air for the sound to travel through. Soundscapes are a stimulating experience. As for the soundtrack, it’s quite exotic and exquisite. It was composed by Jesper Kyd, Des Shore and Justin Mullins. They portray and interpret outer space, colonies and Eridian alien scenes. I like that unique combination of IDM, space disco and space ambient mainly. It offers a petrifying atmosphere of a distant, dark and unknown open space. Many of the most energetic, effervescent and vibrant musical pieces will be in the moments of combat. Instead, where we explore, ambient music predominates to give an inhospitable feeling of the moon. It’s an enjoyable soundtrack from beginning to end. It achieves its mission: to take us to other corners of the dark universe.

[h1]One small step for Pandora, one giant leap for Elpis[/h1]

If something be conspicuous quite a lot Borderlands is an outstanding combination of FPS with RPG. Always it brings characters with classes and perks with a clever imagination. New characters for a new story, why not. In such a way its gameplay has other elements that contrast from its well-known style. There’s something else. I fairly adore is its effect of slight gravity. It's fascinating to make big jumps and have a pack that propels me further. Although it depends on the oxygen. This is another plus point: the huge jumps, the big strides and a buoyant feeling when playing on the moon. Of course all guided by the narrative of the game.

If the plot takes place in a lunar setting, the gameplay will proceed and perform according to its atmosphere. Since there’s no breathable air, we must look for oxygen wells or air supplies. Another plus point. New objects such as the helmet or weapons that use freezing ammo were added, but without leaving the FPS style aside. Something that be prominent a lot —it’s due to its structure of the DLC with tough enemies— is the increase in difficulty of the bosses as progress is made. Some of them seem to be invincible. The advantage: you can level up quickly without the need to do side quests. Tungsteena Zarpedon was a taxing boss to beat, I died many times, but it was worth a try, just to mention one example. The rest of the game is familiar if you've played Borderlands 2.

[h1]Ending transmission[/h1]

Perhaps this game tries to unify both Borderlands. It can't do it, because it requires recurrent work on all characters, which they’d suffer from narrative wear and tear. Because it’ll be required to go to the origins. That would lead to a new game. Or bring more unnecessary releases. Although it also seems to be time lag. It was able to offer a new game, since it has the necessary elements to stand out. It just needs a steady step to explore new worlds —as Borderlands 3 did— in other possible ways.

First of all, I recommend you buy the game as a bundle. The game is long, although it gives the air of complementing or expanding the main story for Borderlands 2. It has the side quests and, as I mentioned, some tremendous bosses. Secondly, play it regardless of the order, since it oscillates between a «previous» stories but without going back to the origins. It's better to play it with friends, like I did; but if you play it alone, be prepared at all times. Despite having diverse characters and an effort at a new plot, maybe it’d have been cool to permit some dissimilar outfits, dressing up in a spacesuit. It wants to link both games, but I insist there’s an attempt to have created something new.

I would like to give TPS more credit - of its new mechanics, several of them are actually fun with the right playstyle. Double jumping is a good mechanic in absolutely any game and this isn't an exception (though sometimes climbing up places feels like it should work but doesn't because of some weird geometry) and the slam is actually a viable way to damage several enemies. The Grinder is a great way to make collecting loot more engaging than just selling them at vending stations and accumulating so much money you'll almost never use except for maybe getting a Shield or two (but there should be more than just the one in Concordia). The Ice element is absolutely the biggest winner of them all though, especially towards the end

In its quest construction and story structure I do find some fault though. The way it delivers that Jack is becoming a big enemy of Pandora is clumsy at best, and it feels like everyone is just as much of an ass as he is, except they're not destined to be the villain in the sequel so they get away with it. Quest structure wise it feels like there's one or two too few Fast Travel stations for some quests, and Jack's Office being a hub but having no facilities feels wrong and adds unnecessary load times. There are some quest lines that require you to go to a map, come back for the reward, and then there's an immediate follow up quest on that same map, and it just feels like too much backtracking. This is probably why immediately after finishing I didn't and don't feel like replaying with a new character, though after some months or maybe years I do plan to play it again and do the DLCs

ORIGINAL REVIEW AFTER ONE PLAYTHROUGH AS ATHENA

You can check my hours on the other Borderlands games compared to this for a benchmark. I like the base game qualities of a Borderlands game.

I've played through Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel once. I did do most of the sidequests up until the end, had no problem finishing one of the trees on my played character, and generally had quite a bit of fun with them, but had no inclination to replay it with a different class.

It has a slow start, but all of the Borderlands' do and there's not much you can do about that, as you need levels and interesting guns to start creating real chaos. The new air mechanic, however, does not make for fun movement and also removes usability of flame weapons, and as a person who really likes elemental weapons this wasn't very desirable. While the effects of being out-of-breath are fairly minimal and you can get oxygen very easily from enemies, the audio and video distortion made it really annoying and pushed you indoors as much as possible. Using shock also became a nightmare around the oxygen stations.

The ice elemental is wonderful, and I liked it a lot more than the purple from BL2. Freezing enemies in order to get a good shot at them is wonderfully cheap, and works on about every enemy. Add to that the fact that my entire build was around doing as much elemental damage as I could in order to build stacks, and my hop and shock gameplay was absurdly fun (with the exception of trying to defeat a helicopter. Defeating a helicopter has never been fun any BL).

My one major issue is that I felt no need to replay the game. None of the other classes looked as fun as the one I initially used. Every tree had a ""stacks"" theme to them, and by nature this means that your fun gets exponential the more you kill, but there are several, SEVERAL lulls in the game where you're fighting a small amount of enemies or none at all, and having very small effects from your skills at those times almost always feels underwhelming. 

I recommend this as a play-it-once kind of game, with the class you like (you probably know what kind of gameplay you prefer if you're into Borderlands).",1574124455,1691073502,True,2,0,0.541284441947937012,0,True,False,False

- The low-gravity jumping feature is fun at first but it seems to be a constant in the game. I had expected to move back to pandora or some other normal gravity location, but that doesn't seem like it's going to happen. The problem with the low-gravity is it undermines the unbridled mayhem that was a defining characteristic of other Borderlands games. It slows everything down. Fights are slower. Getting around is slower. 

- There are jumping challenges. They're not hard, though I could see where some might struggle with them, but my main complaint is I want to fight and kill stuff not bounce around trying to get to certain locations. The jumping detracts from gameplay, slowing the game down. 

- The writing is godawful. I think this is probably the same team who gave us B3. The characters yammer on and talk endlessly when all you want to do is get the quest and go do it. Dear writers: It's not funny to make me listen to what you think is funny when it doesn't even rise to the level of stoned teenager humor. 

Please stop trying to be the original writers of Borderlands. Oh, and get a copy of Strunk and White, and read it, please.

- Getting around is tiresome. Please respect gamers' time. Every game has realized we don't want to drive back across the world to hand in a quest. We can hand it in where we complete it or, at least, tp to the spot we need to hand it in. But not this game. 

Sure you can teleport but it's not convenient. 

- Too many golden keys. I got over 100 of them. Just take this out of the game. Why? Because they completely undermine the whole point of getting loot.  There's no fun in opening a loot box in regular gameplay if you know you can ""cheat"" the system by using one of your many golden keys.

- Not a major issue but the hover craft is a missed opportunity. They could have been fun if they had better flying options, but they handle like a bag of stones.

- I do like the new characters. Seems a crime to stick them in this version of Borderlands.

tldr:
- Combat is slow and crippled.
- The story writing is tedious and tries too hard to be funny when it isn't.
- Getting around is difficult and takes too much time.
- So many golden keys undermine the fun of getting loot.
- The hover craft is a fail when it should have been fun.
- The new characters and their skills are fun.",1690660375,1690750937,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's so much to be desired in this game, but after giving it a run through after not playing it for several years (and having to re-buy it thanks to only owning it on console) I can say I had a great casual playthrough with this game. laser guns are amazing and i really wish they stuck in the series, austrialians existing only on pandoras moon is funny, and the side quests are god awful. I still love the game and suggest you to play it, but it's something I can only suggest for people who 1. love borderlands and 2. don't mind that 2k australia dissapointed a LOT of people with this title back in it's life cycle. Thankfully, I could enjoy this unbiased and could enjoy the writing and story, although it did start off a tad dry after the first helios section and the story doesn't take any insane leaps, I loved jack's performance and how it showed how he not-so-slowly lost his marbles. Fun game, bit dissapointing and takes a bit of conditioning to get into, but damn did i enjoy my 20~ hours with the first playthrough.
(little side note after i wrote this review, didn't find it as replayable as borderlands 1 and 2 because of how overpowered doppelganger is. highly suggest leaving him for after your first playthrough if you want to squeeze replayability due to how braindead his increase in power is around the second half. i beat the final boss 4 levels under because of how overpowered the blue skill tree is.)",1690246383,1690337925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things done better than BL2:
[list]
[*][b]Level scaling[/b] - less grindy, you can progress through the story more naturally without stopping to level up. Stats for both players and enemies scale more slowly, so equipment retains utility for longer;
[*][b]Skill tree progression[/b] - getting the action skill at level 3 and being able to jump the third row of skill trees by only spending one point on a skill makes for a quicker progression to the skill tree's game-changing skill.
[/list]
Things done differently than BL2:
[list]
[*][b]Playable character dialogue[/b] - subject to player taste, some may like it, some may not;
[*][b]Movement[/b] - the lower gravity makes for more of a jumpy gameplay, so you gain more vertical exploration and the ability to get close and stun enemies by slamming downwards, but I felt like this nullifies sniper usage.
[/list]
Things done worse than BL2:
[list]
[*][b]Story[/b] - unnecessary, taints a bit on Jack's character;
[*][b]Pacing[/b] - too many sequences of dialogue that go on for minutes before allowing players to get back into the fun stuff;
[*][b]Enemy design[/b] - Elpis creatures are weird-looking, which makes it difficult to locate critical spots and understand their movement and attack animations;
[*][b]Soundtrack[/b] - fits the scenery, but the space vibe makes the music forgettable, kind of bland and empty.
[/list]

From ALL of Borderlands games (Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, The Pre-Sequel and Borderlands 3), The Pre-Sequel is hands down the best one of them!

It's not even a competition. It's just that good.

Heck, unlike Borderlands 2 - The Pre-Sequel actually feels like a proper sequel to the franchise.
Unlike Borderlands 3 - The Pre-Sequel actually have good content, good humour and zero cringe inducing whiny children.

Less boring and grindy sameish quests without dull story, 
less cringe humor, no horrible crappy boss fights and this time with a villian that did not exist purely for memes?

What sorcery is this?

A Borderlands? Being actually a good, fun video game for once???

I never even did smirk at those stupid memes and jokes in Borderlands 1 and 2 but The Pre-Sequel actually made me laugh.

Even Claptrap is actually funny this time. A freaking! Claptrap!

Borderlands The Pre-Sequel have entertaining script, engaging sidequests and good gameplay loop?

Handsome Jack is actually a great developed character now and not crappy voice from the sky that appear for like two in game scenes only?

There is no painfully average gunplay and playing boring as f*ck DLC's doesn't want me to kill myself?

I am shocked! Finally....... FINALLY I see some improvements in this franchise.

Low gravity combined with platforming, air mechanic 
and helmets giving you different boost feels actually super refreshing. 

All playable characters have this time unique and fun abilities, unlike characters in two previous game (which was just copy-pasted from each other anyway) makes this game so much better than Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2.

 The Pre-Sequel brings actually new ideas, new completely different and fun vehicles, good boss fights (including my favourite final boss in First Person Shooter over the past few years), 
new enemy types, new status effects, way more types of guns and weapon grinder improving loot farming SO much! 

Even Moonstone (aka Eridium from Borderlands 2) is not pain in the butt to find now and you can use it in way more different ways than just for ammo and backpack upgrades.

Overall Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is totally worth of your time, unlike majority of Borderlands 1 and 2.

* Classic Borderlands 2 formula with more stuff to shake the gameplay - gravity, oxygen, jumpads, laser weapons, cryo elemental damage - and to me all of them are super fun, especially lasers and cryo mechanics! I can see how oxygen and gravity can be annoying for less experienced players, but for seasoned Borderlands fans it's more good stuff - Oz kits have various bonuses bases on vacuum/atmosphere/amount of oxygen, and gravity makes combat much more fun with vertical layers, flying enemies and acrobatics in space!

* Fantastic playable characters and their skill trees, arguably the best in the series (even better than in Borderlands 3). Unlike in Borderlands 2, characters also talk, react in dialogues and overall have more personality. Moreover, we're playing as bad guys, which adds some spice, especially later in the story.

* The skill trees are not just passive bonuses, there are unique interactive elements to them. For example, Wilhelm changes his voice and visuals if you invest into ""Cyber Commando"" tree. Or Aurelia has tree that has coop-focused playstyle, where you make a ""contract"" with other player and you receive various bonuses for protecting each other.

* Each skill tree has multiple variations of playstyles you can do and there are corresponding Class Mod that improve skills for that playstyle. For example, Aurelia has ""Cold Blood"" skill tree that focuses on cryo damage, and it has 3 distinguished playstyles - being ""untouchable"" and doing heavy damage to enemies that attack you; an opposite of it, having smaller shield but very fast shield recharge, which is high risk, high reward gameplay - you basically spam cryo novas around you and kill everyone, but it's also easier to take you down; and lastly, the gun focused gameplay, where you throw your action skill and shoot into critical point, doing tons of cryo damage with gun through the shield. Of course, in later levels where you have 2 skill trees maxed you use everything at the same time, but these smart gameplay design decision is what makes The Pre-Sequel characters so unique and fun, especially on the first walkthrough in normal mode.

* Dialogues are maybe not as good as in B2, but story and lore itself are amazing. You can see how all of the Borderlands 2 world elements were created and players who pay attention will appreciate the story of Hyperion robots, moonshot cannon, skags, etc. And, of course, the story of Jack himself!

* Locations are beautiful and well designed. From big moon landscapes, to Hyperion space station. There are various points of interest and side quests to do, a lot of hidden chests and challenges to complete.

* PhysX is still great tech and well implemented in-game with various fluids and particles flying around, adding more ""oopmph"" to the game visuals.

* The soundtrack is chef kiss. Each location has its own ambient and battle theme.

* Claptrap DLC is one of the best Borderlands franchise DLC.",1625742714,1689420679,True,1,0,0.501510560512542725,0,True,False,False

[h1]Graphics & Sound: 10/10[/h1]
[h1]Narration: 9/10[/h1]

NB: I'm mostly copypasting my review from Borderlands 2 because it's mostly the same game, with a new story, some new mechanics, and a different group of playable characters.

✔️ Very beautiful graphics that age well.
✔️ Great juicy visual and sound effects.
✔️ Fun loot and progression systems, with cool character abilities that actually give personality to the different characters' gameplay.
✔️ Enjoyable story with colorful characters. Oh and you play bad guys.
✔️ Excellent completion of Borderlands 2 story focusing on what happened between Borderlands 1 and 2, with some additional sweet story about known characters (including some who barely had any story going on), as well as a few completely new ones.
✔️ Wonderful soundtrack.
✔️ Fun gravity-based gameplay.
✔️ The one and only story content DLC is excellent. Way better than most Borderlands 2 DLCs in my opinion.

❌ Co-op loot sharing is still a bit tedious, like in Borderlands 1 and 2 - you kinda need to fight for the loot that interests you, especially with teams of more than 2, since there aren't that many different kinds of weapons, and good weapons can be interesting for a lot of characters, so it requires a bit of organisation and diplomacy. The game would really have benefited from instantiated loot, or some kind of smarter interface that would put loot in common between players, I don't know.
❌ Like in Borderlands 1 and 2, the narration can play during tense battle moments with no way to replay it, which can make it a bit difficult to follow. And it's possible (and very easy) to start several dialogues at the same moment, which completely overrides the one started first, making you just irreversibly lose some plot.
❌ The oxygen system added by the game doesn't really do much for the experience in my opinion. And it's the best we could have hoped for, because if it did matter, it would have made things waaay too frustrating. Kinda feels like they realized it, but had invested too much into its development and refused to let it go.

A complete recommendation to anyone who played and enjoyed Borderlands 2. To anyone who would like to play it but DIDN'T play Borderlands 2 before - please do, the quality of the game is very close, and you'll get some major story spoilers about the events of Borderlands 2.

Minmaxing is VERY important in all the Borderlands games, and your equipment will become obsolete quicker than you can imagine. If your gun is more than like 3 levels below your current level, it won't save you. At all. Having said that, I love all the characters in Borderlands and all the humor is great. I beat BL2 a few times and the Pre Sequel I think just once, all on console. It's a hell of a lot easier with at least one other person to play with who can revive you when you can't seem to get an enemy to get close enough to you for a kill revive. Which happens very often. I find that I actually die more often from falling to my death though than anything else. Some of the vehicle jumps are particularly near-impossible and you will die trying them at least 4 or 5 times before you get it.  Being downed in combat is basically the key element of every Borderlands game, and you will spend a great deal of time in ""Fight for your life"" mode. Some enemies are so overpowered that they will one-shot you and sponge up so much of your DPS that you just want to run away. But you can't, because you have to beat them to progress. Expect to yell at your screen a lot. If you love a challenge, and like platforming FPS games, Borderlands is hard to beat.

Okay yes, there are additions. Moving the story to Elpis, Pandora's moon, allows the addition of a few interesting mechanics: low gravity and no oxygen means big jumps, boosting jumps by expending oxygen, slamming down on oppoents from on high in the middle of a jump, managing your oxygen resources, and shooting an opponent's face mask to make them asphyxiate. There's a new type of elemental damage, cryo, which allows you to freeze opponents solid and even smash them into bits (although the slag element from Borderlands 2 is gone), and a new type of weapon, lasers (although E-Tech weapons are gone). Aaaaaaaaaaand...that's it, really. We're playing the same game, essentially, just experiencing a new story within that game.

And how is that story? It's...okay, I guess. It takes place between the events of Borderlands and Borderlands 2, and gives the backstory of Handsome Jack and how he came to be the tyrant of Pandora. Your character is a mercenary summoned to Helios, the Hyperion space spation looming in the skybox of Borderlands 2, in order to help Handsome Jack, who has just arrived in said space station (they move around in the world of Borderlands, apparently – maybe this is taking place in the same universe as Star Wars?) in order to observe events on Pandora, namely the aftermath of the opening of the Vault in the first game.

 However as soon as you arrive the station is attacked by a mysterious force led by the equally mysterious Colonel Zarpedon, (and some other thing which doesn't even get a name), and you are sent down to Elpis in order to help (yeah, they explain within the game why that makes sense, but I'm not going into it here). From there it's pretty standard: the first act of the game you're working on getting ready to assault Helios, which has now started destroying Elpis in order to raise the stakes; the second act you're on some ill-defined revenge mission because the NPCs that were helping you previously suddenly decide they want to murder you (Lilith and Moxxi, who's now a technical genius in order to explain her inclusion in the story), then you're tracking and entering the Vault on Elpis in order to fight the giant monster that's in there, because that's what happened in the previous two games and video game writers don't know how else to end stories. It's all pretty underwhelming.

I'm not sure what else could have been done with the story, to be honest. The decision to have the next Borderlands game set between the previous two is an odd one. I heard that Gearbox wasn't ready to start making Borderlands 3, so gave 2K Australia the task of making a pre-sequel, in order to keep making more money, uh, I mean, give the fans what they want. Fair enough, I guess. But that makes even its reason for existing somehow lesser than a proper sequel. For the first time with a Borderlands game, I found myself regretting pre-ordering (and now that I've seen some of the DLC, I'm regretting my decision to get the Season's Pass, as well).

Another thing I found underwhelming this time around is the humour. The Borderlands series has a reputation for being fairly humourous at times, and while the style of humour isn't exactly Oscar Wilde (about 95% of it is either pop-culture references or some variation on “haha life sure is cheap on Pandora!”) I certainly got many chuckles, and a few outright belly laughs. Up until now. I'm sure a big part of it is the fact that this game was written by Australians, and humour has always been the most regional of beasts. What plays in Aus doesn't necessarily play in North America, and when your humour style consists chiefly of referencing other things, you may as well just give up. Practically every so-called joke fell completely flat, as I stared stone faced at the screen, utterly confused as to whether it was a reference that went over my head or whether it was just plain not funny. This is why refernence-checking is considered a low form of humour, folks.

And as a result of the game being underwhelming, all the little annoyances that I'd been willing to overlook on previous outings started to loom large. The inventory system is still not great – for reasons I won't go into here, comparing weapons is still not as smooth as it could be. Key quest- or story-related dialogue is routinely delivered while you're in the middle of a firefight, or broken up and distributed randomly over a map so that you might have 1/5 of a particular character's motivation, and that one part out of order. The game talks way too much, and I frequently found myself wishing the characters I was listening to would just shut the hell up already. And it's still way too easy to get hung up on a tiny little bump in the ground.

I do not dislike this game. I had fun playing through it, and as always the co-op multiplayer makes it worth the price of admission. But for this franchise to survive, Gearbox and 2K Games are going to need to shake things up. They've made exactly the same game 3 times in a row now, and it's time to challenge themselves. Mix stuff up. Tweak the art style. Change the tone. Come up with some new NPCs that don't suck (Janie Springs and Pickle are an accent and a cheerful attitude and absolutely nothing else). Find some way of expanding the mythology of the Vaults and the Eridians who created them. For the love of the gods, don't end the game by having the players open a Vault and fight a big monster that comes out. You're better than this.",1420760407,1688488213,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be fair, the game functions like Borderlands 2, which is great as the mechanics are all there and they all work very well, but the story itself is just quite lacking.

There's something wrong with the coding for flying human enemies. Multiple times I had those units clip through walls and get stuck outside the terrain. Once during a ""Kill Everyone"" objective, fortunately I was playing Baroness and her ability noclips and homes in on enemies.

I remember the hitboxes in BL2 being very tight. Not so here. Many cover objects have invisible fuzzy edges that block bullets. In addition, the Lost Legion Marines specifically have terrible hitboxes that don't match their models. Putting the crosshairs over the deltoid/jetpack region brings up their health bar but bullets pass through there with no damage. Semi-related: I never use the railgun weapons because they seem to have hit registration problems. Speaking of which there are several places where the terrain has invisible edges that you get stuck on trying to walk through and have to hop over. Minor but distractingly low build quality.

All of these critiques pale to the worst problem of all: BAD WRITING.
TL;DR BL2 is one of my most played games. At least one full playthrough of main storyline with every character. But Pre-Sequel? On my initial playthrough of Pre-Sequel I got so bored I put it in my backlog for 5 years before coming back to finish it this month. It just had so little hold on me. I left thinking I had only played 30% of the game and it might improve. Turns out I was basically at the finale (I stopped at the RK5 bossfight). It never got better. What a waste of anticipation.

I'd heard this game revealed Jack had a backstory that made him a tragic figure rather than the straight love-to-hate-him Joffrey-level bastard villain. Nope. He starts out ""normal"", not a villain, sure. But I expected some kind of reveal of a heroic sacrifice. Maybe he opened the Elpis Vault and took the brunt of some kind of Eridian energy blast that was about to kill the player's Vault Hunters and it cost him his sanity plus scarred his face? Nope. We have characters spoonfeed us that he's a good guy, look he's still a decent guy see? And then follows a disjointed, inorganic transformation into villain Handsome Jack. It's like the old trick I used to pull in highschool Algebra when given a formula and the answer and instructed to show my work. Sometimes I would just work from the formula until I got stuck then work backward from the answer and then hope my teacher wouldn't notice the seams.

I still give it a thumbs up because it's fun despite yadayada but this is another one of those times I wish Steam would allow verdicts of Neutral.",1687513653,1687513653,True,3,0,0.50346982479095459,0,True,False,False

The main reason why I liked this game is because I didn't expect much from it. Borderlands 2(B2) wasn't exactly the best gaming experience for me with its tedious story, boring locations and one-shotting bosses, so I thought that The Pre-Sequel(TPS) doesn't differ much from its predecessor... but I was wrong. 
Level design, playable characters, boss-fights, scaling system, writing(characters' lines) is where TPS does an awesome job in comparison to B2. Though there're some elements which might require some getting used to and those are: space setting, futuristic music, vacuum environment. From my own experience I can say that I got hooked only after 5-10 hours of gameplay which is funny because I had quite the opposite situation with BL2. 
TPS even managed to get me into grinding, not because I couldn't defeat a certain boss(as it was in B2) but because I was enjoying the game. 
Now, with that said, I want to add that the game is unpolished: poorly made textures, stucking enemies and NPCs, unfinished characters' lines, lines interrupting one another - those are the ones that lie on the surface but I'm certain it's not the end of the list.
It's a real shame that the game didn't get the time and attention it deserves because it definitely has much more to give.

It's a short romp in the BL universe with very poor, uninspired dialogue that tries too hard to be funny or edgy and sadly, consistently misses the mark in a big way, not to mention you are forced to listen to everything. All the time. Everywhere. There is no skip cinematic/dialogue button (AGAIN!) and with this game copy pasting the TVHM & UVHM from BL 2 you have to sit through this schlock 3 times just to get a max level character. I'm not even there yet, but the thought of having to do this is definitely turning me off the game in the long run. 

Combat is largely unchanged, super inaccurate ADS, any weapon under purple rarity is practically useless, Legendaries and uniques so far have been usable at best, honestly they are more of the same shit from prvious games, ""funny"" shot patterns, non-stop nova shields, that kind of stuff, sure they added Lazers in this game but nothing that truly feels new and exciting. 
Quests consist almost primarily of fetch quests, so look forward to trekking through the same large, barren areas again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again... You get the gist.

This is a lesser scion of greater ancestors, everything this games does it's predecessors did better. Every aspect of BL is overused and undercooked in this game. It feels like the gaming landscape evolved since BL2 but Gearbox and 2K decided to keep milking the desicated remains of this franchise. 

I still think BL 3 is the weakest BL game to date, but this is a close second. Avoid unless you are a fan of the series, but even then, wait til it's on sale.",1685439045,1685439045,False,4,0,0.478330343961715698,0,True,False,False

I would always join public games, because most of my friends are already with their own friends, so i am kinda all on my own now... sad isn't it?

Only good Borderlands remaining.. Maybe Borderlands 2 too.
But the point is that a Borderlands game without new character packs are boring.

Handsome Jack was my favorite DLC character to play in this.
Mecromancer was my favorite DLC character to play in BL2
Krieg was also my favorite DLC character to play in BL2.

What would be cool is being able to play characters we owned in Borderlands 2 & Pre-Sequel in Borderlands 3.
I do not own Borderlands 3 yet & do not plan on getting it until they bring in character packs.

This is a message to the developers & that loser who is in charged of all this.
Enough with these bullshit skins nobody gives a hoots about.

Give us the real content that makes players want to play.

Characters, maps, modes, etc.

In Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel a new group of vault hunters learn the story of Handsome Jack and the Hyperion company. The events take place between BL1 and BL2 but it is a flashback so you should complete BL2 first to avoid spoilers.

[H1]The good[/H1]
It has one of the best BL intros that I have seen so far: great music, a good story and cool visuals. There are six character classes to pick from - you can even play as Claptrap and the Doppelganger of Handsome Jack. The level design is different to that of BL2 - you play mostly on the moon for 2/3 of the game; so there is more of a space theme. There is less gravity on the moon and even the sound is different. 

Even though the game was released in 2014 the graphics are good. The HD texture pack helps although I ran into similar issues as with BL2 when playing the Claptastic DLC: the game is 32 bit and when it tries to address more than 4GB VRAM it will crash. The solution was to lower PhysicX and save often.

Most of the mechanics that made BL2 amazing are still present. The developer improved a couple of them: 
[olist]
[*] Vehicles are more interesting and have better weaponry. 
[*] In BL2 you could indicate whether an item was favourite, junk or no status. This is changed to if an item is not your favourite it's junk to improve the speed of selling it. 
[*] There are laser weapons.
[*] There is a crafting station called the grinder: add three weapons or combine it with other items and it will generate something new.
[/olist]

There are some great easter eggs hidden in the game.

[SPOILER]It's good that on normal there is a secret ""raid"" boss (Iwajira) that is do-able solo and you don't even have to pay any special currency[/SPOILER]

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
Why are there ads in the main menu in a full priced game?

There are so many tedious fetch quests in the game. There is also quite a lot of backtracking even in the main quests. As the environment isn't that interesting it feels like a drag. It felt that these mechanisms were put in to make the game feel longer than it really should be. If the fetch quests were not annoying enough, jump puzzles are added. The walking mechanics feel not as snappy as before: it's like you're skating. 

The game starts slow - especially if you already have completed BL1 and BL2: the first two hours you walk slowly over the moonscape with easy missions until you unlock your first vehicle. I wish there was an option to skip this part for returning players. Then the pace changes from a lot of stuff going on to almost nothing especially when you are back-tracking most of the time. What also doesn't help is that the great songs from BL2 are no longer there - I didn't find any music appealing. 

Most areas blend into each other; unlike BL2 or even BL1 where you could feel things were different when you enter a new location, in The Prequel it's all pretty much the same: there is not a soul to it, it’s mostly generic. This changes when you get to the space station though - that is definitely the better part of the game.

The developers fell back to the BL1 DLC philosophy with ""less fast travel points = better?"". Unfortunately, it's not and the work around is to just save-quit to main menu and then continue. It will have you start at the closest exit or fast travel point so you can quickly go to where you want to be.

Glitches:
[olist]
[*] Jack tried to ""moon walk"" into the elevator but got stuck on the elevator; I had to restart. 
[*] My character suddenly exploded while driving the moon buggy. 
[*] I had to manually collect money (like BL1) at several points.
[*] A mission objective was dropped out of the world: I had to restart the mission to complete it.
[*] At the Hyperion Hub of Heroism the screen got a yellow filter applied over all graphics. Something similar happened to the Eleseer level - possibly a limitation of the engine?
[*] Picking Up The Pieces: getting up on one of the pillars was glitchy - it took 14 attempts to hit the right spot and suddenly the pillar became walkable.
[*] Bugs can crawl through solid glass. 
[*] The mission Z8N-TP got stuck and it was not possible to progress further. Only when I completely quit the game and returned could I progress.
[*] The raid boss fight crashed every time I used my rocket launcher. I had to do the fight without it otherwise the game would just crash. 
[*] After I closed the game sometimes I couldn't restart using the desktop shortcut and I had to launch from Steam.
[*] I had multiple CTD while playing the Claptastic DLC.
[/olist]

Some achievements can be missed. Other achievements are multiplayer only. If you are unaware or can't find up to three friends to play with you, you won't be able to get 100% (and even if you do there are glitches that can stop progress on certain quests). 

The map achievements require that you need to find every single named location. This means you may have to click on something that is in the map even though you explored everything. [SPOILER]A great guide is given by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330160497] JagarKlato on Steam [/url][/SPOILER]

Some of the enemy hit boxes are not correct causing you to miss a target when you should have hit it. 

The voice acting is super annoying at times. Other time it is (also) performed badly; like some dude just winged while sitting inside a bathroom.

None of the bosses are interesting or memorable. 

[H1]The DLCs[/H1]
There are three DLCs that offer some new missions and locations (my rating: [x/5]). You should play them after you've completed the main game.

[olist]Claptastic Voyage[5/5]: Jack needs to get data that was put into Claptraps mind. Through a mind melt it's your task to retrieve it from the inside. This is one of the best BL DLCs that I've played. Amazing level design, interesting enemies and a good story. There is lots to discover with high level loot (including a new type of weapons), easter eggs and mechanics. The best of all: the great BL music is back. I really enjoyed it and consider it the best part of the Pre-Sequel (the side missions in the DLC were not so good and you can safely ignore those). 
[/olist]

[olist]Shock Drop Slaughter Pit [0/5]: On a map you have to fight five rounds of three waves of scaves. It's terrible. 
[/olist]

[olist]The Holodome Onslaught [2/5]: In six rounds of which each has three or more waves, you need to defeat the same enemies over and over again. The area is too large and the space floating mechanics don't help either. The DLC rewards you for being a camper using a sniper rifle. There is some nice loot and cosmetics but the DLC is not good. The only challenge is to have enough ammo. [/olist]

[H1]Summary[/H1] 
Borderlands: The Prequel is not as epic like BL2 and it misses the atmosphere from BL1. It does offer some QoL improvements, but it is a shorter game and even then, it is still too long. Having completed the game, it would have been better just to cut the moon part out of it together with two of the DLCs. The game mechanics that made BL1 and BL2 great are put aside for a part, and the game is riddled with tedious backtracking, jump puzzle style fetch quests in areas that all look the same. 

It was quite glitchy and buggy as well. I was not having so much fun and found myself having to put the game down several times. I did continue and found that the last 1/3 of the game is much better. 

The Claptastic Voyage was fantastic and is one of the best BL DLCs that you can play. You can skip the other DLCs as they are not good. 

If you played BL1 and BL2 before then you should definitely play the Pre-Sequel and especially the Claptastic Voyage. If you have never played a Borderlands game before, then play at least BL2 before you start with the Pre-Sequel.",1683158017,1683158550,True,2,0,0.514120638370513916,0,True,False,False

- fighting areas are bigger, so second wind is less valuable
- no atmosphere nerfs fire weapons
- enemies that butt slam with the new o2 jumping are very mobile, do high damage, and are bullet sponges
- tons of instant-death cliffs
- no atmosphere + low gravity + instant-death cliffs = tons of lost loot, including skins and moonstones
- laser weapons can't be dodged (even worse with bigger levels)
- flying enemies (not just aircraft) create a 3D fighting space (even worse with bigger levels)
- not a lot of fast travel points, at one point you won't return to the hub town for a considerable amount of time
- less side missions, that means you can't over-level for story missions like in Borderlands 2
- kraggons are just the worst
- enemies level-scale closer to the player, but that means a lot more dying
- most locations are just dead rock, not a lot of good variety

First time I played I quit midway through using whatever the Siren's name is in this one, and the second I used the DLC Doppleganger of Jack. A pretty bland character overall, with unexciting skill trees. 

The main story line is typical...whatever fare that this series has remains the same, but this one begins to slide into deeper levels than the previous ones as the perfect prequel to the more and more childish humor that time has passed, and dips it's toe a little bit into the cringe ""identity"" writing that follows. This game isn't quite yet there on the super annoying part, although has a few of those annoying characters in it like the girl ""scientist"" using the stupid sci-fi TV tropes that came around that time like ""SCIENCE! F** YEAH!"", and as dumb as ""EXPERIMENTS! YAY!"". Then of course failing miserably like all people who don't know s*** from Shinola would when pretending that watching a video makes them an expert on ""science"". 

Why I say it lacks depth is because the Main Story feels rather short, and the abundance of side missions you find in other entries feels to be very slim comparatively. 

The Season Pass consists of just one story DLC, which is a solid entry, ""The Claptastic Voyage"". The rest are the dreadful ""Hollowdome"" type of crap, and 2 extra characters. All the DLC can be obtained in the ""Handsome Jack Collection"", which also includes all of BL2, and has sold for as little as $5 many times. So never buy any of these 2 games outside of that pack. 

Let's talk a bit about Borderlands in general...

This game just makes me realize how stale the Borderland formula really is. The idea of creating a game where you can only upgrade to like half the total levels in a full run, then having to play a ""more difficult"", but identical runs, maybe even 3, or 4 like BL2 ended up as. Then having 6 characters in which you can do this as, making you have to play through the game no less than 12 times, while you experience IDENTICAL dialogue, and quests each of those times. Borderlands is the definition of tedium. 

Borderlands has even taken the same tactics that the Fallout series has in which they release games 1/4 of the way done, and require you to buy DLC, after DLC simply to just MAX LEVEL your character. BL3 split this up into TWO Season Passes btw. Using the ""+10 Levels"" formula as Season Pass portions, while giving you yet another stupid non-story DLC each time because they know you wouldn't buy them without the level increases. This one includes 2 new playable characters, Doppleganger Jack, and The Baroness. Jack is super boring skill trees, and the Baroness I haven't played, but it seems she's a beast with guns. Especially pistols. 

Unlike the Fallout series, however the amount of content provided for one play through isn't even remotely close to ""Max Level"" your characters in one run. So you are left with what I described above, playing through the game dozens of times. Achievements to get 100% are also made to force you to play through the game a minimum of 4 times, one with each main character to get them all. Not to mention, you have a handful of ONLINE ONLY achievements. Those you can likely cheat on with faking co-op partners, or whatever, but I don't care enough about cheevos to do anything remotely close to any of that. 

This series needs to improve their formula. Maybe make the game long enough, with enough quests, that even with the extra levels you can Max out in one playthrough. TVHM doesn't need to exist. Quests can easily open up, as they are all leveled quests as it is. Enemies level up. Everything levels up with you, so all you need is just a LONGER main story line, and more side quests that are consolidated into ONE playthrough. With a minimum of 4 characters in the main game alone, it would still be quite tedious to trudge through the same game 4 times, but at least the content would be much deeper, and you wouldn't have to play the exact same game 12 times. 

Also, this game has an easy formula that can be fixed entirely by doing one thing: STOP HIRING ACTIVISTS TO WRITE FOR VIDEO GAMES. Hire real writers, who aren't just out of woke college, and let them write coherent, well structured stories, with character development that isn't designed to make you cringe. ""Condescending"" isn't funny as EVERY JOKE. Watch this video to understand what NOT to do in writing anymore please:

https://youtu.be/FyHG8EfcA5c

6/10 game probably. If you like Borderlands it's passable, and has some interesting mechanics that won't be seen in any other BL game. Not to mention that the Borderlands 1 Eridium aliens come back to the main storyline to fight again, which were always awesome enemies.

That said, the game suffers from a bunch of issues that make it hard to recommend for extended play. The biggest problem being the movement mechanics. 

Everything feels extremely clunky. Low gravity is literally painful as everything feels like you are moving through molasses. Then, the regular gravity sections feel bad after getting used to the low gravity stuff.

Movement in video games should be consistent and fluid and this drops the ball something fierce.

[u]Note:[/u] I played Nisha through 3 playthroughs of the main story, 2 playthroughs of Claptastic Voyage, and 1 playthrough of the Holodome. I also ""speedran"" TVHM, beating it in about 7 hours to get on to UVHM as fast as possible. I ended at LV62 with about 80 hours of Steam time or 2:14:00:00 in-game.

First of all, there's a lot of small additions, tweaks, and quality of life adjustments made versus Borderlands 2.
+ Stat scaling is sort of a hybrid of the systems from Borderlands 1 and 2. For example, starting damage/health/etc in TPS is closer to that of BL1 than BL2. You also level up at the same XP values in all three, but TPS is shorter than 2, so you don't level quite as far in each playthrough (and skill tree progression is tweaked as a result). This is a refreshing change (one of many) that keeps the game from feeling like a reskin.
+ Very very good class design with tons of depth. I played Nisha, and coming from Gaige in BL2, Nisha feels broadly similar to play, but with a way more nuanced skill tree. I could tell that there are tons of slightly different adjustments you can make to skill point allocation to tweak your skills to fit your loadout. As just one example, you could build Nisha with an Oz kit that focuses on improving gun damage, and consequently spec more into skills focused on fire rate, movement speed, and health regen.
+ Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is noticeably easier than BL2, as enemies do not have health regen. It can be annoyingly challenging at times in BL2, so I welcomed this change.
+ The oxygen mechanic adds one more thing to keep track of, but generally speaking it's pretty easy to do so. This adds depth without feeling too annoying. Suffocation is rarely an issue in practical gameplay.
+ The grinder is a cool new way to deal with an excess of loot. I have some less positive things to say about it, but I'm glad it was added to the game, because it constantly changes how you approach inventory management, and can potentially make useless trash useful again. You may hold onto items 3-4 levels below your level in the case that you can get a high-damage blue or purple from the grinder. But, when you get to LV50+, you may only want to hold onto items 1-2 levels below, if that.
+ Although the item pool is smaller, there are some really cool new items, especially unique guns and shields -- Boomacorn, The Machine, MINAC's Atonement, E-GUN, Haymaker, etc. More thoughts on uniques later.
• The ability to mark an item as trash in inventory was removed.

Let's talk about low gravity...
+ On the one hand, it's fun to be able to jump long distances, and boost and slam as movement mechanics adds a whole new dimension to the skill ceiling. Mastering these skills can make combat way more fun!
• On the other hand, [i]the map design can make it way too easy to die due to the low gravity[/i]. I will call out Triton Flats in particular. It's a nightmare for vehicles, as you can very easily run into bad geometry trying to jump over a chasm, fall into lava, and die. (And, even as a massive Borderlands fan, I have to admit that some of the geometry in these games is impressively bad.) Similarly, the Drakensberg can be really bad for being blown off a ledge into the abyss, or falling to your death from a jump pad.
• On the subject of map design, the extra distance you cover is counteracted by the more spread-out and larger maps. This can run the risk of making travel feel slow and cumbersome.
- It always feels bad when you kill an enemy and their drops get launched at Mach 5 into the void, especially when those items are [i]mission items[/i]. For example, I had to relog into Stanton's Liver during one mission because a mission item was launched out of the map.

Now for nitpicks that stuck out during repeated playthroughs:
• A little too much dialogue that felt nagging or dragged the pace. Some missions I ended up outrunning the objectives of, because I knew where to go already.
• The raid boss is pathetic. I had never beaten a raid boss before because in BL1 and BL2 they're actually hard.
• The drop box for ""To Arms"" is located inside a bandit camp, so that means every time you deposit guns, you have to deal with a turret, a bunch of bandits, and potentially shugguraths. :(
• There are several Fast Travel stations that I would move or add, or one-way Fast Travels that I would make two-way, just for the sake of reducing the amount of travel. For example, the Outlands Canyon and Holodome stations are a bit out of the way. [b]Furthermore, I really dislike the Veins of Helios, and the lack of a Fast Travel there contributes to that.[/b]

Other nitpicks.
• I think uniques are a little bit too common or overpowered. You can easily obtain Boomacorn and E-GUN, which together are a disgustingly powerful combination that can last for multiple levels. Don't get me wrong, they're awesome weapons, but they're a little *too* meta.
• The blue color of Oz is too similar to the blue rarity. You adjust to it, but it was annoying at first.
• The side missions on Helios feel like a drag at times.
• The level cap of 70 is too high to reach in normal gameplay, IMO. It requires grinding or a fourth playthrough.
• To avoid the RNG of the grinder, you may need to ALT+F4 over and over. This makes the game very unhappy. Sure, moonstones exist, but the cost of a moonstone grind is too expensive to justify doing it regularly. Also, there are combinations that you can't use moonstones with, so you're forced to bash your head against the RNG if you want a legendary.

The story, quests, and characters were very strong but never struck me generally as more or equally impressive as Borderlands 2. Most of the enemies are very fun to fight against but I noticed that enemy types in the later parts of the game felt more annoying to fight with. It wasn't the increased level as previous enemy types that were similarly leveled to the new ones were still were fun to fight against, but rather just how the later enemy types fought. To be fair, most of the game isn't that however and I enjoyed myself throughout most of my experience.

The open world sections consist of lots of open space and jumping from air bubble to air bubble and when you do have a vehicle it feels very clunky. None of the guns or exploration feels rewarding either. I did have some fun playing it with a friend though, I mean it is tolerable when you have someone to screw around with.

[h1]""Hello, old friend. Been a while, hasn't it?
Let me tell you a story.""[/h1]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
Where to begin? I'll begin with the release of the new DLC for Borderlands 2, why there? Because I have played Borderlands games 1&2 mostly so many times that I don't feel like playing anymore anytime soon. That doesn't mean I don't love the game, it is, in fact, one of my beloved game franchises on my list of favorite games. The history and connection I have with this game is astounding. Now, where does the new DLC for Borderlands 2 factor into all of this you may ask? When I first played it, I remembered just how many fun Borderlands is when you play something new. It was so fun that I wanted to play some new, while Pre-Sequel wasn't exactly new because I did play it way back on the Xbox 360, it felt new as I had played years ago and only once. Whereas with Borderlands 1&2 I played countless times exceeding to at least the number 20. 

And let me tell you, a lot of people have mixed opinions on the game, some will even go as far to say that it is the worst Borderlands game to date. I will disagree, the game is essentially a clone of Borderlands 2 with some new gameplay features. I wouldn't say it's a clone in terms of locations, story and even gameplay but it is a clone in terms of the looks, art style and graphics of Borderlands 2, even has many of the issues that Borderlands 2 has.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
The story of Pre-Sequel is a direct Sequel to Borderlands 1 and a Pre-Sequel to Borderlands 2. It tells the story of some of the most well-known characters of Borderlands 1&2. Athena the ex Atlas employee, Wilhelm the Cyborg in Borderlands 2, Nisha the sheriff of Lyncwood and CL4T-P with his FR4GTP combat mode. Yes, Claptrap is in Pre-Sequel and you get to play as him, love the little guy. <3 all four of you are recruited by Jack, back when he was a low-level programmer on Hyperion and you're tasked with finding the secret Vault on Pandora's moon. Elpis. Only for that to be put on the side as an abandoned DAHL Brigade now known as the DAHL Lost Legion invades the under construction Eye of Helios in order to stop Jack and destroy the Vault on the moon. [b](Figures, DAHL loves to abandon their own people.)[/b] You're forced to now deal with not only an ex-Military unit but you also have to survive the wildlife on Elpis as well as it's local inhabitants.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
● Great plot [b](Not as good as Borderlands 2 but still very good.)[/b]
● Great character development [b](Learn how Jack rose to power and became the sadistic villain he is, learn how Claptrap ended up becoming the last robot in his production line, learn how Athena coped with her life after the fall of Atlas and more!)[/b]

● Lots of character comments [b](The player characters in Borderlands 2 were pretty dead, they rarely spoke apart from the usual battle chatter but never commented on missions and such, in TPS, the characters voice their opinions and minds on various topics making them feel more alive and developed.)[/b]

● Lots of fun and awesome side quests
● Steam Achievements
● Steam trading cards
● Well crafted soundtrack
● Awesome playable characters
● Very fun action skill & skill trees for characters
● CO-OP

● Cyro weaponry [b](Since it takes place before Borderlands 2, Slag hasn't been invented yet as an element and we instead have Cyro which let me go on record and say that it is 10x better than Slag. Slag sucks. Cyro rocks. Freezing enemies and shattering them is lots of fun.)[/b]

● Laser weapons [b](Alongside Cyro, we also have four different types of lasers, I have always wanted for Borderlands to add more unique and crazy weapons, I hope to see more in Borderlands 3. If you're sick of constantly having to use the same weapons all the time, you will be happy to find out that the four different types of laser rifles in TPS are lots of fun.[/b]

● More fluent movement [b](I love Borderlands 2, but playing TPS and then going back to Borderlands 2 feels wrong. The lack of double jumping, slamming and boost jumping is so much fun and it's a change that is really badly needed in Borderlands 3. Luckily we will have that change, there will sliding, barrel kicking and most likely lots more.)[/b]

● Awesome DLC [b](Claptastic Voyage)[/b]
● Well designed surface and locations

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
● Unoptimized for higher-end hardware [b](GTX 10 series, RTX series etc:)[/b]

● Locations can get boring over time [b](You're on the moon in the end, there is only so much that you can do make the surface of the moon look unique, whilst I love the locations and I think it is very well designed, some people might get bored of the same locations over and over.)[/b]

● Unfinished DLC [b](There was supposed to be another DLC for TPS called Luxy's Space Adventure, honestly when I learned about it I was extremely saddened and quite pi**ed, the entire premise of the DLC sounded so awesome and if you ask me. TPS needed a DLC like it but it ended up being canceled because of the poor sales of TPS making the DLC unfinished leaving you with only one story DLC and two-character packs. If you would like to learn more about it then check out this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDSEEILN7QA]video.[/url][/b])

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you're looking forward to Borderlands 3 like I am but have to wait till next year because of the Epic Bulls**t then this game will keep occupied for a while. Pre-Sequel is not a terrible game, it is a good game, sure it has some issues but no game is ever perfect, Pre-Sequel does improve upon may features from Borderlands 2 whilst still remaining that fun action-packed looter shooter. You will without a doubt get a good enjoyable experience wherever you purchase this game to play solo or CO-OP, full price or even heavily discounted. It won't be as long as Borderlands 2 but if you're planning to do multiple playthroughs then you will easily rack up 100 hours if not more.

The humor is still there, the weapons are still crazy, and the loot is still addictive. However, the game also suffers from some notable drawbacks that may frustrate players.

On the positive side, the game features some new gameplay elements that add to the fun. Players can now jump higher and further with the low gravity on the moon, which leads to some interesting combat scenarios. Additionally, there are new classes to play as, each with unique abilities and skill trees to explore.

Unfortunately, the game also suffers from some issues that may turn off some players. One of the most notable is the repetitive mission design. While the game still offers plenty of loot and shooting, the missions themselves can feel like they're just going through the motions. Additionally, the game's story is not as strong as its predecessors, leaving something to be desired for those who enjoyed the narrative in previous Borderlands games.

Another issue that may frustrate some players is the game's difficulty spikes. Some missions can be particularly challenging, with enemies dealing massive amounts of damage and the player's health and shields dwindling quickly. This can lead to some frustrating moments, especially when playing solo.

Overall, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a game that offers plenty of familiar fun for fans of the series, but it also suffers from some notable drawbacks. The new gameplay elements are interesting, but the repetitive mission design and weaker story may turn some players off. Additionally, the difficulty spikes can be frustrating at times.

The other criticism was that it's the same engine as BL2, but again, that game is so wildly popular and universally beloved that this criticism is null. TPS has its own slew of DLC, 6 playable characters, and a fairly interesting story, not to mention the same (if not slightly improved) gameplay as BL2.

It's what the developers built around the storyline that left something to be desired.
I enjoyed Borderlands 2. Played it...well,alot. Over and over. (That,along with other games
like it,is my background for this commentary.)
 On my play-through as Athena,I started to notice the game made you walk/run alot. If there
might have been a good spot for a fast travel,or an option to shorten that desert you had to
slog across,the game devs did not take the option. I slogged. On stopping for awhile and
quitting out of the game,I returned later to continue my progress only to find myself back at
the place I had started that area of the game. Forced to slog some more through baddies and 
navigate hazards again. And again. Annnnnnd..... You get the idea. Slog. That,and practically
anything you could think of that would make a game like this tedious. i.e. overly difficult 
opposition (for a first play-through). Playing though the story missions,you complete an area
and,in the context of the events taking place,proceed quickly to the next area. But when you
arrive you see the enemies all have little warning skulls next to their names. Yup. You need at
least 2 more levels before going on.
 And this happens quite a bit. So. I give this game 4 out of 5 'slogs'. And one big 'Why?'
Didn't the developers play this through themselves? Don't they know better,as professionals,
than to add immersion-breaking situations into a storied game? Flow? 
 Sorry. But not 'sorry'. And,believe it or not,it's still hard to give this game a thumbs down.
Because I'm a fan. But... Slog! Grrrrr.
...And another thing to the devs: The video game tradition of the 'Boss fight' goes back decades.
But...you've changed it,or at least taken the most tedious of options:
 The player fights the 'Boss' to the death,overcoming several minutes worth of hazards that challenge
his/her reflexes and skills. The reward? Another,fully refreshed Boss?!?! Like many things in games these days,you can't just give the player a bit of well-earned satisfaction? I mean,that's the other option. 
 I won't deny the apparent miles of hard work put into this game. Don't deny the players,please.

1) The dry humor i grew to love from BL1 makes a comeback. No more cringy incest jokes from BL2 Scooter.
2) The original Vault Hunters, for as little as you see them, act like their own selves again. No peabrain Roland, no lovestruck middle schooler Lilith, no drunkard Mordecai, and no ""i'm a white gangsta"" Brick.
3) The gameplay feels like it was created for singleplayer again, but optional co-op. No massive armies of enemies, no bullet sponge bosses and no getting melted within 3 seconds anymore.
4) You get to play as a CL4P-TR4P and it's actually a GOOD class instead of just being comic relief.
5) Having the Vault Hunter you play as actually comment on stuff makes them feel a lot more alive, like an actual person instead of a NPC. 
6) Pickle is the best Bri'ish lad, i say.

The only gripe i really had with this game was that it froze up on 4 occasions. This always seemed to happen whenever an enemy with a laser or elemental attack would strike me in melee range, as if the overload of close up particle effects froze up the engine. Luckily this never lead to massive setbacks because of the properly placed checkpoints, and was quite easily remedied by mastering the art of sniper rifle headshots. It's definitely my favorite entry in the 3 games i have played so far. Will check out BL3 in the future.",1679002931,1679002931,True,2,0,0.486345142126083374,0,True,False,False

The issue with TPS was/is mainly the lack of content. You've basically just got the main campaign, and then one DLC (Claptrap's). Two other DLCs are just for characters, and the others are garbage slaughter domes that have been a staple tacked onto every borderlands game. It's nice in moderation but very played out and needs to be done well (Torgue's in BL2). Aka not the main DLC for a game and not costing $10 for 20minutes of repetitive gameplay. 


Likewise, there are 2 major bosses you can fight endgame. Prior installments had several, and you could farm a ton of other bosses later in the game to get better legendary weapons to face said bosses. This game has none of those. A ton of the bosses are not able to be fought again and even more are in really annoying locations to run back to for farming. No invincibles, no great farming spots, etc. When people complained, Randy Shitford said go buy/play another game franchise (even though these were staples features of the game series you incompetent *****)

The gameplay is smooth and the verticality helps it stay fresh nearly a decade later. The base gameplay is great and outside of some slowdowns running through some long slog areas the base campaign and Claptraps voyage are really good. 

With the price its on sale for half the time its a great deal. It's mainly the fact that it comes after two fantastic videogame mainstays without their content but charging the same price. Whether or not that doomed 2k Australia is beyond me, but I'd hope that wasn't the nail in the coffin.

Enemy respawns are neverending and happen very fast (of course ammo crates don't respawn). Every time you kill 1 enemy 2-3 new ones will spawn out of thin air all around you.

So you have to run through the chaos of neverending enemies and turrets etc. trying to do the mission without having the time to clear them out. All the while one of the incredibly annoying voice actors jabber along without you having any chance of hearing what they say.

However, I have to say that I was really disappointed with this game. While the gameplay and humor are still present, the game just didn't feel as engaging as its predecessors. It feels like the game developers were trying to milk the franchise for all it's worth, without really adding anything new to the game.

One of the major problems with this game is the lack of content. The main story is short and doesn't provide much replayability. The side quests are fun but ultimately don't add much to the overall experience. Furthermore, the game suffers from a lack of variety in terms of enemies, environments and weapons. This made the game feel repetitive and boring after a while.

Another issue I had with the game was the character customization. While the previous games had a wide range of character customization options, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel felt like a step back. The characters look and feel uninspired, with limited options for customization. This was a real letdown for me, as I enjoy creating unique and interesting characters to play as.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. While the game has its moments, it just doesn't measure up to the previous games in the franchise. If you're a die-hard fan of the series, you may enjoy it, but if you're new to the franchise, I would suggest starting with the earlier games.",1638494887,1677129926,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting off with the story, while the Borderlands games aren't really known for good writing I think Pre-Sequel can stand on its own pretty well and does get a few laughs out of me every now and again but it's not a cinematic masterpiece by any means. It's great to hear more from Jack as Dameon Clarke did a great job voicing him, as he did in 2, and the banter from the vault hunters and other NPCs' is fairly charming and quite funny at times, The motive and descent into madness are fine but not overly focused on with is a bit of a shame as the whole point of this game is to be a Pre-Sequel to Borderlands 2, with Jacks descent into insanity feeling somewhat forced at times, but overall I can still say I somewhat like the story, though I guess as long as it's somewhat amusing I don't really mind the holes in it.


The gameplay is fairly good, Heck I even think it's a step above 2 at times! The Vault Hunters have more to their skill trees and more interesting abilities to boot with the DLC Characters in mind you have a diverse cast of characters to choose from, Athena the Gladiator a tanky and melee focused Character, Nisha the Lawbringer a high damage gunslinger, Wilhelm the Enforcer an allrounder Summoner type, and...Fragtrap, And the two DLC Characters are, Jack the Doppelganger a different flavor of Summoner that's made to look and sound like Jack And Aurelia the Baroness a cold-hearted hunter that does high damage at far ranges, with an ensemble like this it makes replaying the game a lot of fun and its even more fun with friends. the quest design however can be a bit lacking as most side quests lack diversity and while the main quests are fun the bosses leave something to be desired. The biggest disappointment was with legendary weapons, legendary weapons make up a huge part of what makes the Borderlands games so fun, and in this game, there is just a lack of spawn locations which makes the whole game feel a bit hollow as instead of killing a boss and getting some sweet loot you mostly just get Moonstone and some nothing weapons. The late game as a whole is lacking for the former reason and there's just not any real endgame content outside of New Game Plus which I'm not counting here while it's a big part of the Borderlands games it would be nice to have something else to do post ending besides killing one raid boss and finishing up all the side quests you missed.


The Graphics are pretty good, and a lot of the areas are well-lit with funky colors which makes them pop out more, everything has that signature cell-shaded look which helps it still look good 9 years later, and the general art direction is fairly decent, the weapons look great, even though the iron sights suck, the environment is often times gorgeous with some of my favorite areas being the nice reds and light blues of the early game, the fake industrial lighting of the Hyperion space station and the deep purple of the later game areas, really I think they knocked it out of the park on the visual design!


The music is kind of forgettable...that is all, hell as I was writing this I had to go back and write that the music exists I guess, nothing groundbreaking.


And Finally the DLC, ill keep it short. I've already talked about the DLC characters and I do really like them, it is just the other three that I think are...subpar. I won't add to the negative reviews on The Holodome Onslaught as I think it's fineish just a waste of money to buy it really as it doesn't add much and the 10 extra levels are incidental at best, I haven't and won't get the Shock Drop Slaughter Pit...I just won't. Finally, the Claptastic Voyage is fine, not great, and not terrible, if you can get it on sale then I'd say do so as the environments are still really cool, the ending is cathartic and the glitched weapons are pretty neat but that's about it really as the story is pretty bland overall the Claptrap is well... Claptrap so I guess buy at your own risk.


My closing thoughts even though my review isn't the most positive in the world is still one of my favorites Borderlands games as I think what it brings to the table is fairly unique looking at the franchise as a whole however I do understand why some people do not like or even hate this game as its nothing outstanding and it came after that titan that is Borderlands 2. Overall I can recommend this game but if you are still a bit iffy about it then I'd say if you want to play it wait on a sale first and get some friends together, just make sure to bully whoever plays Claptrap.",1676284363,1676318256,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[i]Mass Effect: Andromeda[/i], [i]Dead Space 3[/i], and [i]BioShock: Infinite[/i] are all games that I would describe as being heavily flawed, but still possessing a solid foundation in one way or another. I wouldn't ever lump this game in with the others though, as I consider it to be one of the most underappreciated sequels in gaming. 

Developed by the now-defunct 2K Australia, and set in-between the first and second Borderlands titles, [i]Borderlands: The Pre-sequel[/i] has you take on the role of one of four vault hunters hired by Hyperion to find a vault on Pandora's moon, Elpis. However, rather than focus on the hunt for the vault, the vast bulk of the game is spent chronicling the descent of a man named Jack into the villain known as Handsome Jack. You see him go from an affable antihero to a despot who will stop at nothing to take his revenge on those who slight him. 

[h1]PROS:[/h1]

 - Possibly the best set of playable characters in the series, with a diverse set of abilities, and what I consider to be the best character progression system in the series. 

 - Weapons feel far more diverse than BL2, although it still doesn't feel nearly as fleshed out as BL1s guns. Two new additions to the weapon generation system- the laser weapon type and the cryo elemental type- are fantastic additions that greatly enhance the player experience. 

 - The low-gravity movement and oxygen system is a fantastic addition that feels great to play around with, and gives players much more mobility through the game world. 

 - Other great gameplay features include the Grinder (which allows you to take old weapons and create newer and better weapons, meaning that even white-rarity weapons have a use now), bounce pads, and much faster access to character abilities than BL1 and BL2. 

 - Excellent character writing, including fully voiced player characters, a series first. 

 - Level design, while slightly less open than the second game, is well-done, with a wide variety of locations. 

 - The art style has also changed from the post-apocalyptic setting of Pandora to a more space-age look befitting Elpis. 

 - Music is also less western-inspired, and has a much greater focus on electronic instruments and synth-music. 

[h1]CONS:[/h1]

 - As a player character, Claptrap suffers from a very random special ability that often makes him a liability in multiplayer and singleplayer alike. The fact that the series' pet punching bag is also the fourth playable character is also quite annoying, as you will have to endure his frakking voice for twenty hours of the campaign if you pick him as your vault hunter. 

 - Boss fights are both rarer than in BL2, and suffer from reduced quality, smaller loot tables, and were initially not replayable outside of a UVHM New Game + run. Indeed, Zarpadon still cannot be fought a second time to get any unique loot you missed, meaning her boss fight feels less rewarding from a extrinsically motivated perspective. 
 
 - The balancing in this game is extremely poor. I completed almost every side quest I came across, and still ran into beefy enemies who downed me very quickly in the end game. Even in the early game, you will often run into enemies who down you very quickly regardless of whether you've been grinding out levels and loot the entire time. 

 - While the story is fantastically written, it is one of the worst paced stories I've ever experienced, with a endgame that drags on for far too long, and suffers from extreme checkpoint starvation. Sidequests also dry up around the time you finish the Helios section of the game, so good luck getting more levels without endlessly grinding enemies in the world! 

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]

Overall, I would say that fans are often way too harsh on this game, considering how much it experiments with the Borderlands formula. [i]Borderlands 3[/i], while I haven't played it yet, seems to be far weaker than this game, with the main antagonists being bloody [i]Twitch Streamers[/i] for crying out loud. While this game suffers from problems that could have been remedied with more resources and more post-launch content, it is far better as a story, and has far greater potential as a elevator pitch. 8.5/10, recommended.",1674962375,1674962375,True,18,0,0.663299202919006348,0,True,False,False

---{ Summary }---
It's like Borderlands 2 but with moon gravity and Australian accents. Be prepared to spend a lot of time ranking up and trying to pick the best load out. There are tons of weapons, armor, relics, and what not. The story is pretty decent, but not as good as I expected from Borderlands. The game play is pretty straight forward, easy to learn. The enemies can be very tough, so bring a friend!

I have tried, and tried, and tried to play this game by myself and I never can, I know I can turn on matchmaking but it's different playing games with a friend you've been playing games with for years and playing a game with a random person you have no connection with. I don't recommend this game because every time I try having fun in it I'm always shafted, every time I start having fun in it I get pulled to another game by the same people who got me to buy Borderlands in the first place.

That's because most of the people who will ever decide to play this game is for the sole purpose of Knowing more about jack.  This game is a story about how Timothy Jack became Handsome jack...
This game is lacking in all aspects...that make it replayable.  I played through it once and can't replay it quite like BL2,  I'll try but sometimes I sadly have to force myself.  The only saving grace of this game is the DLC Claptastic Voyage.  That's a great story arc too because it features....Claptrap.  and I always loved claptrap.  He's the first face you see in both games.  
At this point of the review I'm just ranting about the game and my feelings towards the BL franchise....
I remember the first time I tried Borderlands 2.  It was for a free weekend.  and I tried it and played Co-op with my friend who reccomended it to me.  I remember doing the Bunker Run during a stormy night.  The storm was raging and I kept on playing BL2....sadly I had to log off that night because of it.  I couldn't wait to wake up and keep playing.  That's how good BL2  Is!!!  
 (at the time I couldn't really buy games because I Didnt get an allowance and I was too young btw to use a card or go to gamestop because my parents were very overprotective).  
I remember asking my best friend to go to gamestop for me and to buy me Borderlands 2.  I remember playing it all day and almost all night...
Borderlands 2 has a huge impact of my life....and the fact that 2K Australia abandoned this game really hurts because this game had potential...this game still has potential......it just needs some TLC and a couple more DLCs cmon.",1672451064,1672451064,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Adds low gravity, oxygen management, and double jump/boost to BL2 formula. Play as Claptrap if you don't want to deal with Oxygen BS (it's a tiny DoT if you run out). Unfortunately the world design is the same as 2 with invisible walls and fake objects/floors so you're always paranoid about what you can actually land on without getting pushed off or slipping through to your death, which kind of discourages exploration in some bits. I also constantly got stuck on...nothing (misplaced collision walls on the floor?) forcing me to jump to continue moving.

Maybe I got lucky, but weapon drops were much more generous than BL2 in my normal mode playthrough. 

The story (Jack's descent into madness) was good...when the audio isn't bugging out and skipping lines. It's a darker story obviously and the humor is about the same as 2.

CLAPTASTIC VOYAGE dlc is also excellent and I would wholeheartedly recommend buying that too.

The mechanics aren't fun, the gameplay isn't enjoyable, and it's definitely not a game you're likely to play solo successfully. It's like they took everything that wasn't fun from 2 and doubled down on it, then added new things along those lines to make this even worse. It took them a significant amount of time to even address the character types that were bizarrely omitted, that made previous games remotely enjoyable or even playable.

There are some inspired parts, but overall this isn't likely to keep you coming back. I can't imagine even if you liked the series that you would enjoy this. As someone who liked the first one fine but hasn't been that impressed by attempts to follow it up, this is just painful and not something anyone should really feel obligated to play, ever. Amusing voice acting here and there can't make up for how unpleasant this is to play. The oxygen mechanic alone only adds inconvenience, not complexity or more exciting gameplay, and thus becomes an obstacle to enjoyment rather than something that enhances it. It is a textbook example of a perhaps well-intentioned idea that was not realized well at all, and thus it brought down the quality of the whole by its inclusion.

Don't bother. Just get the original on sale sometime. That's the only one that's at all impressive.

OLD Review : I honestly believe that TPS was hated because it wasn't borderlands 2 again. It was different. It stood out compared to 1 and 2. The story was/is good, not as good as 2s but it IS a good story, the game-play mechanics were/are good(better than 2s in my opinion), the characters in it are individualistic and honestly had more life breathed into them here than in 1(once again BL2 had it better but that doesn't mean TPS isn't good.) People wanted to play the same game again but have it have the ' new game feeling '. 

TPS is worth $60 with all the DLC at this point, but I paid full price at release and still believe it was worth it. Lots of fun to be had. Worth the price, catch on a sale if you're skeptical of the game.",1666112657,1671534076,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gun play is identical to Borderlands 2, but with the addition of laser guns, which are pretty cool. The changes to UVHM that make it so slag (cryo in this game) isn't essential to be able to play the game like it was in Borderlands 2 is nice.

The Vault Hunters in this game all feel super unique and fun to play, which is true of all of the Vault Hunters in the Borderlands franchise. All the skill trees have something interesting and unique to offer. The fact that each Vault Hunter has unique voice lines and interactions with the characters just makes me feel more engaged than in any other Borderlands game. While overall the story isn't as good as Borderlands 2 I felt disconnected from the story in Borderlands 2, but the fact that the Vault Hunters actually speak and have interactions with people makes it feel much more alive.

It's a little buggy, starting quest-lines occasionally doesn't trigger special events. Can be rectified by quitting out and re-entering the game but this is mainly a problem when multiplayer because you and your friend can't as easily disconnect, so the Quest location needs to be exited and re-entered which is slightly more troublesome luckily this is a rare occurrence.

The characters are in my opinion the most interesting with multiple builds in this game as oppose to the others games. This game is the first that I have thought of multiple builds for one character AND wanted to re-play through the game to try the build. All characters have subtle Co-op potential which makes playing with friends more fun.

At first glance and early play I assumed the Low-gravity space setting wouldn't fit for Borderlands, but I enjoyed some of the platforming involving the low-gravity. 

Unlike Borderlands 1 and 3, the Pre-sequal does not have many tedious quests. One side-quest involves donating 50 common quality weapons. This is the only quest that feels like an absolute drag to get through. The rest are fun!

The game needs more content, only one endgame raid boss, maybe you could count the Earworm boss at the end of Claptraps voyage as a raid boss? (WHICH TOTALLY NEEDS A UNIQUE OZ KIT CALLED ""THE BOOMBOX"" AND IT CONSTANTLY PLAYS MAINFRAME WHILE EQUIPPED!) As it is an optional boss that is unlocked after beating the last boss of the DLC? But it isn't advertised as such. The game does lack bosses, bosses are fun and they truly challenge your character (Or team if you're playing with friends). And for endgame raid bosses, something about grinding Raid bosses for extra rare-currencies or unique items feels very rewarding.

I assume they made this game purely to build some story and didn't expect or plan for it to be as fun as Borderlands 2 or be played as much as Borderlands 2. But I think another DLC for it would be worth it if it included an extra NG+, some kind of new area (that isn't an Arena) an extra Raid boss or two. Maybe it could elaborate a little on another corperation that isn't touched upon as much as Torgue or Hyperian. And maybe a couple of high grind high reward items just to top everything off to make a final goal for those players that like that sort of thing.

The movement feels like you're floating in a zero gravity atmosphere since you're exploring the moon, Elpis. This sucked in the beginning since it had a different feel from the previous Borderlands games, but I got used to it eventually. The oz kit system where you had to prevent your oxygen from depleting still sucked though.

Characters from previous installments were introduced as the new generation of Vault Hunters. Surprisingly, one of the characters was Claptrap. The one who we all hate apparently. There's a downloadable content for this game that Claptrap was heavily involved in. I highly suggest playing the DLC after finishing the main story. It's fun, quirky, and it also introduces a bunch of overpowered weapons, and the hardest Borderlands boss I've fought to date.

I highly suggest any Borderlands fan to try this game out as it adds additional lore to the game and bridges the gap between the first and second games. The game is shorter and has fewer content than the first and second games developed in the series, so make sure to get this game while it's on sale to get the most bang for your buck.

It is perhaps one of the worst entries in the series, but it is still pretty god damn good. On a scale of one to ten, I'd generally give it a seven or an eight. It does some things slightly worse than other titles, but it is fun in spite of it. After hearing the reviews from longtime fans, I was ready to let this game rot in my steam inventory. But now that I've PLAYED it, I can say firmly that this game rocks just as much as the rest of the series. 

      The Pre Sequel may not be the best of the titles, but It is leagues beyond anything I could have expected out of it. It often goes on sale for cheap either stand alone or as part of a borderlands 2 bundle deal, so If that happens, take a shot at it. Also, its comedic and story writing is pretty much just as good as Borderlands 2. Much more than can be said about certain, newer titles in the series. It is definitely a few leagues above New Tales From The Borderlands in this regard. The only thing this particular entry falls short of consistently is small things in level and quest design. It can be slightly more repetitive and grind centered than other entries, but it is not as as bad as it sounds.

I'm not really a fan of the low gravity and dealing with O2. It honestly feels like a chore to play this slog of a game, but I will play it a few more times, hoping that I just haven't reached the fun part yet, otherwise I'll be putting the game down for good. To me, I just feel no excitement playing this game, just the same ol' boring fetch stuff side quests, brainless combat, and running sim. 

And my god, is it just me or does Athena's ability feel like non-existent. I remember in BL1 when you used Brick's fists, Roland's turret, Mordecai's bird, or Lillith's phasewalk it felt awesome, but this shield thing just feels garbage and so insubstantial. I know the game is a few years old, but there are some games that really are timeless...this is not one of them, I am bored to death playing this. It feels soooo antiquated.

More on the traversal in this game; it's not that I despise the low gravity, it's the fact that you can't clamber in this game. It's so damn annoying when you feel like you should be able to make a jump only to miss it slightly, and then fall back down, and then have to rinse and repeat again. Maybe the thrusters you have access to become more powerful later on ig, I hope they do because they feel useless.

Overall, it feels like they put so little effort into making this feel like a different BL game from the first two, largely disappointed so far. I've seen a lot of negative comments dismiss this as a BL2 DLC and now I see why; the game does not stand on its own two feet whatsoever.",1667195178,1667195970,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

The story and characters are fun but the gameplay and design is horrible. I can't even count how many times I yelled at my screen ""What happened!?"" after dying. I died about five times outside my own fault in Borderlands 2; the Pre-sequel has killed me out of nowhere dozens of times. You can do everything perfect and the game will still find a way to cheaply kill you. I am fine with a challenge but this is just straight difficult due to game design. It makes no difference what level you are or how much shielding you have, you will still get one-shotted by most enemies and objects. In fact, in my experience, you will mostly be killed by people and objects that you won't even see or appear on-screen or on the mini map. You will be in a fight, hiding behind a corner out of sight when all of sudden you are fighting for your life and die due to no one being around to gain a second wind off of. 

Worse than dying for no reason may be all the backtracking in this game and how lost you can get. You have to continually revisit places you were just at, over and over again. It makes this game incredibly monotonous. You have to continually fight the same group of bad guys a bunch of times.  And if the map design doesn't kill you, it will surely frustrate you as you spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to get to your destination. There were a bunch of times I had no idea how to get to where I was supposed to go or how to accomplish the mission’s goal. I don’t think I ever got lost once or didn't know what to do in the first two games, they were very intuitive; not the Pre-Sequel. The map design is just so bad that it really hinders the enjoyment of this game.

I really wanted to like this game but the longer I played, the more frustrated I became - the exact opposite of Borderlands 1 and 2. I cannot recommend this game until they fix all the cheap, unnecessary dying and completely overhaul the map design to actually make it fun rather than punishing.

I decided to try out Pre Sequel after getting it as part of a bundle and without having heard of the middling reviews from its launch period.

This game has less to it than Borderlands 2- Having played some of that one and all of this one I can tell the criticisms have merit- but even then, I enjoyed my first playthrough (as a combat-modded Claptrap unit no less!) enough to immediately start a new game as Jack's body double.

The alternate lines pertaining to your character (and the re-telling of the story for New Game +) are great fun, the low gravity/jump mechanics are an interesting spin on the old format, and the ability to freeze flying enemies solid then watch them fall and shatter never got old for me.

If anything, this was a great contained experience that has made me more excited about trying 2 again

The interactions with characters is a very nice touch. Everything else is pretty standard.

This game is very far from bad but it just doesn't have the same charm of Borderlands 2.

Side quests are boring as hell, even more so when you've play through the game multiple times. A lot of waiting around and doing menial tasks.

Don't pay full price for the game. Get it as part of the Handsome Collection when on frequent sale and it's only a few bucks.

+Fleshes out background on many characters and events
+LOL'd (after the early areas...have I mentioned how bad they are?)
+New energy weapons
+An airborne slam attack
+Skippable opening cutscenes!
+Grinder vendor to attempt to recycle drops into better items
+Tons of BL guides available online at this point
+Pickle

[h1]YMMV[/h1]
~It's basically Borderlands 2 DLC. Not much really changes.
~Early game can be difficult based on RNG
~Swearing is toned down and often bleeped (personally prefer this to BL2's overuse)
~Some characters are optimized for limited weapon types or coop play
~Slightly more emphasis on melee attacks
~Voice actors obviously re-used on too many characters

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
-First few areas of the game are very dull and lack fast travel
-Same BL invisible walls, unmarked instant death areas, clippable surfaces
-Melee attacks still lack visceral oomph! and indication that they landed
-Dead enemies still occasionally graphically spaz out
-Inventory/shop menus still occasionally select wrong items
-Enemies fly through or get stuck in or under surfaces
-Vehicles still occasionally handle strangely
-A number of frustrating vehicle jumps
-The oxygen meter discourages early exploration (especially for challenges)
-NPCs using laser weapons are ridiculously accurate - even across the map

   [*] +Decent gunplay and a large variety of weapons to find and use
   [*] +Low gravity lets you jump around higher and further, giving you more ways to move around
   [*] +Your character talks, adding to the story
   [*] +Four different characters to play as (six including the two dlc characters), each with their own skill trees

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
   [*] -Loot sometimes goes flying in low gravity areas, meaning that you might not get it
   [*] -Some areas feel like they are too big and feel empty. There are not many fast travel points either, making traveling tedious at times.
   [*] -If you mainly focus on the main quests, you will be underleveled, meaning enemies will feel like they have quite a bit of health. You will need to do the side quests to level up, but some of these quests send you to different areas and can take a little while to complete due to the large maps. This can make the gameplay repetitive.
   [*] -The main story is not that interesting

When I first started playing Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, I found it enjoyable. However, after a while, it started getting boring. The main reason is some areas feel like they are too big. In addition, there aren’t many fast travel stations, making traveling tedious at times since some side quests take you to different areas. Even some of the main quests involve you running around a lot. I cannot recommend buying Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel because of this. I did have fun playing as the Doppelganger, but the large areas, few fast travel points and quests that involve you going to different areas made me stop playing the game.",1661372783,1661372783,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It feels tacked on, with nothing new. The guns, missions, characters, and even the jokes are boring. It all seems like a rehash of things in the previous titles. Also, the environments are fairly monochromatic and monotonous. The low gravity atmosphere is annoying; it makes your character is little hard to control.

Honestly, the developers tried to make a good game, so I'm a little hesitant to give it a thumbs down, but this could have been better.",1661321817,1661322125,False,6,0,0.575042068958282471,0,True,False,False

However, the main thing I disliked was the fact that it didn't provide as nearly enough DLC like Borderlands 2 and also the drops for Legendaries in this game seem pretty bad but maybe that's just me, considering I'm having to have to fight the Invincible Sentinel to get the Prismatic Bulwark (very low chance of drop; i.e invite other players to increase Loot Drop rate, although that doesn't always help). The only shield that I've gotten was the Black Hole. Also, another thing to note is that there isn't any OP levels for this game, though I am not sure, as I never did attempt to do the Holodome DLC. Nonetheless, Borderlands series has been fun for me with BL2 being the obvious favorite (Never played BL3 but will do so once I finish installing my new gaming PC).",1661304007,1661304007,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get to play as ClapTrap (if you dare) which is pretty cool.

I don't know what it is, but just like the others. Very repetitive; do this quest do that quest shoot stuff b

Make a difficulty slider that can be used to change the difficulty level for players so all player can play at a difficulty level they are happy with.

Great game, nothing out of this world however definitely worth the purchase.

If you havent played Borderlands 2 I'd recommend buying that instead. 

Pros - 
Second half of the game has great visuals.
Great roster of vault hunters to play as.
Adding lasers as a weapon type was pretty cool. 
The Claptrap DLC was great and the glitch weapons added are some of the coolest in the series. 

Cons - 
Pacing is poor, especially for the first half of the game. 
Most of the side missions aren't great. 
Feels like a giant lack in content compared to Borderlands 2, even if you just compare both base games. 
Far less hidden items making you feel unrewarded searching around.

Thank you to the cunt that fucked up this game with the 27 February 2020 patch. I guess eventually every company will piss away the good will with the player base for America's obsession with always online. Don't buy this game, it now stutter's in a mother fucker!!!

Follow up to the stutter issue:
I fixed it myself because that is how it now works in the always online age...
If you have the stutter:
Go to network setting and change from Offline to Online friends only.
I found that Online friends only's sub-setting does not effect this.
You might have the change booting you in a pseudo in-game boot loop...
Alt-F4 the game till you have the settings manually apply or 
it sometimes defaults back to Online friends only.

Oh yeah, damn it, I'm not a hideout hunter - S-U-R-P-R-I-Z!
Slightly improved graphics, a few new locations, new - as many as TWO - vehicles, low gravity imitation (in the end, the place of the event requires, and the Australians did it very well - in general) well, and perhaps everything. How not everything? Oh yes, of course - we play for evil, but the evil that only sleeps, sleeps and waits to be awakened - by someone or something. An attempt to show the reverse side of the coin, to show where Jack came from and what happened to him, the developers succeeded with a bang. The plot in the game is interesting and reveals most of the unresolved issues that could arise after passing the first two parts.
In the game, as before, everything is fine: the Easter eggs, and the sound, and the picture, and most importantly - the plot did not let us down, and the atmosphere in the game was created with taste for details, and secret achievements ... but, as usual, there is a spoon in a barrel of honey tar ... there are several of them, I’ll name a couple:
-probably the first is a set of weapons... the developer assured us that there is a huge selection of weapons in the game, yes, there is a large selection of weapons in the game, BUT no... except for the fact that CREO weapons were added to the game instead of SLAG weapons, there are no changes as such at all... everything the same weapons, sometimes even copies of guns from Borderlands 2 - and this is sad.
-the second thing that upset this value for money ... for the money that they asked for pre-order is too small a story, albeit interesting and good, BUT small ... one can only hope for future DLCs, as a rule they are of high quality to the game and do not weakly add hours of gameplay time.
-the third is the classes in the game, if in the first two there was some kind of division into: serena, contact, support, sniper, now it's all combined in each of the 3 heroes, but it develops over time in its own way. (but this is IMHO, maybe of course I just read superficially in the classes)
-the fourth is, to my regret, Clap-trap... oooh yes, I so hoped to play for him, probably like many Borderlands players, but no one expected that he would be such a ""hero""... this is probably the most SOLO player for all Borda that I know, because burying his companions is as easy for him ... as nothing even crosses my mind. In general, in a company with such a character, you often ask not to turn on skills than to turn on and help, I'm upset, although as a hero, he certainly invigorates and amuses.
Probably these are the pros and cons of my IMHO, as well as questions and the desire of the developers to tell a different story of all the same participants and events related to Pandora. It inspired the creation of the PRE-Sequel, and it's... it's brilliant and simple.
In short: the game is fun, good, made with love and feeling, it is clear that the developers have put a lot of effort into showing the story of Jack in such a way that you no longer know whether to feel sorry for him or hate him ... I behaved in his place?!""",1658721510,1658721510,True,1,0,0.481438517570495605,0,True,False,False

If you choose to get only one game in the series I highly reccomend getting Borderlands 2 even though this is currently the newest. The Borderlands series is a First Person shooter with RPG elements including character building and different methods of completing various missions. Character building includes choosing perk trees to fill as well as unlocking and choosing from a variety of differnt class skins and head customisation. 

BTPS QUALITY AND DLC: It may not be as good as the first two Borderlands entries but it's still definitely worth getting. Despite what some people may say I don't consider this entry in the series to be a cash-grab. I do believe they charged a bit much for DLC than they should have this time around. The first two Borderlands entries featured quality DLC that was well worth the amount charged for it. I still reccommend getting the season pass for Pre-Sequel however but only if you plan on trying out ""Lady Hammerlock"", ""The Doppleganger"" and Claptastic Voyage as iIt's personally my favorite part about The Pre-Sequel.  

VEHICLES AND TRAVELING ELPIS: Compared to the first two games the best part that makes this entry stand out is how fun it is getting around with low gravity and jump pads. There are only 2 vehicles in BTPS. The Moon Buggy is basically the light runner with lasers or ice missle clusters rather than heavy machine gun fire or missiles. The stingray is a one-person hoverbike style vehicle perfect for low gravity.

HUMOR AND CHARACTERS/VAULT HUNTERS: BTPS features memorable characters from the first two Borderlands entries as well as some new ones which will be seen in Borderlands 3.  The game's humor still feels like it belongs in a Borderlands game. I have had a decent amount of experience with every Vault Hunter in every Borderlands game and the Vault Hunters in The Pre-Sequel stand out well.",1528867786,1658461211,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel at the end of the day is essentially, a standalone expansion for Borderlands 2 that offers extended story context of the events before and after Borderlands 2. So if You enjoyed BL2, You'll probably enjoy this too.


In typical Borderlands fashion, our story begins following 1-4 of the 6 playable vault hunters as they arrive (or rather crash) aboard Hyperion's flagship orbital space station, Helios. Our ""Heroes"", answering lucrative hails of mercenary work for any to assist acutely-assailed Hyperion executive, Jack (Before the Great Handsome-ing of 2661). 


Instead of the usual locale of Pandora, T.P.S (mostly) takes place on Elpis, Pandora's Moon. It shows both the rise of Weapons and Tech Conglomerate Hyperion, and the Descent of Jack into everybody's least favorite villian; Handsome Jack.

You'll spend most of your time on Elpis, exploring the barren moonscapes and craters of a post-cataclysm event Lunar Surface speckled with the remnants of Dahl's Industrial and Research facilities occasionally dotted about breaking up the monotony of such an empty setting. Don't be fooled, even the moon is infested with all kinds of baddies to blow apart in traditional series fashion, and certainly isn't lacking in interesting locations and settlements. 

Later areas impress, featuring a return to monolithic space stations sprawled with Labyrinthian corridors clad with futuristic advertising, dripping with cyberpunk flair and hyper-corporatism chic, or mythical alien vaults containing unimaginable power and wealth, guarded dearly by an ancient race of powerful Promethean beings.

Quest design this time is kinda lackluster, featuring almost exclusively collect-a-thons and escort quests, and most of the time, underwhelming rewards. I have nothing noteworthy to say, I did every sidequest and don't really have a standout. They're *ok*

The gun-play and Inventory systems are identical to that of Borderlands 2. Major differences being the replacement of premium currency Eridian, for Moonstone, and the addition of the Laser category of weaponry in a wide assortment of variations from blasters to beam guns. Slag has been replaced with the Cryo element as-well, which functions in much the same way while immobilizing the target as-well. Finally, due to the lack of a native atmosphere, oxygen is a precious resource on Elpis, and the addition of ""Oz"" kits and an additional gear slot, you can increase the time you spend in the bitter vacuum of space.


===FINAL SAY===
Besides some small changes to freshen the experience, and a new planet, you really do just have Borderlands 2 here with a different set of Vault Hunters. This time assisting Jack instead of assailing the pompous arse.

I can definitely see where some popular criticisms of the game hold up, and my main complaint is among them, Elpis is poorly designed, and frankly just annoying to trek across. Outside of a lot of tedious backtracking in one-off areas for side quests in ""filler"" areas used in the story, this is my main complaint.

Overall, It's a shorter, less cohesive Borderlands 2 with a tedious setting and arguably weaker story, but I still enjoyed my time. 

7/10 - Worth a play for series enthusiasts, or those who like the full story.

Sure, it has a few bugs, like sometimes you can cause the dialog to interrupt itself, making you miss some of it. And yes, it's not as long (play time-wise) as BL2, but let's be honest: BL2 got a lot more add-on content than most games, even the good ones. (Not complaining about that, the add-ons were awesome, it's just an unfairly high standard to measure other games to.) But over all, if you like Borderlands 2, you'll like this game,

====
Edit: After finally getting around to finishing the 100% of this game, I still love it. I did have to wait for my....dislike of BL3 to die down first though. If I had to pick between the two, I'd pick this game, not BL3. Unless they actually fixed every last bug in BL3. Then maybe I'd reconsider. As for how this compares to BL2...eh, hard to say. I think this would have stood up to BL2 if it had gotten that cruise ship DLC, but as it is it's too close to call. Meanwhile, still doing the BL1's (trying to wrap up BL1 OG b4 importing to BL1 Remastered) so idk how they compare.

Short version: I will still gladly play this game after the 100%. A very rare compliment, which less than a handful of games (N<5) have gotten from me. So, yeah, game is good.",1577384287,1657555554,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

It's not quite Borderlands 2, but that doesn't have to be a bad thing. It's a game with a very creative atmosphere and levels, as well as introducing some new mechanics, sometimes while ditching old ones (goodbye slag, hello cryo!) which end up being positive additions/changes.

This time you play on the side of Jack and learn about his backstory and how the events in BL2 were shaped. In a way, it feels like an extension of BL2, but it is its own unique game that can be enjoyed individually, regardless of the rest of the series. It once again has six characters to pick from, but somehow I always end up picking Wilhelm, who can later be seen in BL2 in his fully augmented form.

A fun game that has amassed some negative attention, but I think most (if not all of it) is bogus. It's a great game and I'll gladly play it over and over, just as I have with BL2.

tootally enjoyed the game. but it is not-recommended game for me because..
1st: FELT LIKE A DLC! EXCEPT IT HAS LOWER GRAVITY, JUMP BOOST AND LAAAAASSSSSEEEEEERRRSSSSS!!! (which feels more like a speed boost more than a jump boost)
2nd: WHERE THE F*** ARE MY DLCS?! YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO RELEASE THOSE DLCS YOU PROMISED! (they're releasing a teaser for BL3)
3rd: BROKEN A**** GAME eg doesn't have respawnable unique enemies like bl2 does.

I personally think this is a mediocre game in the franchise. Having since played and owned borderlands 2 since its release, I was shocked to find out that this game was coming back then. Despite me wanting it on my Xbox 360 previously, I lost interest as time passed on. Eight years later, I bought the game alongside borderlands 2 because there was a sale for $15. Speaking of the game I'll be explaining the takeaways and drawbacks of this game.

[h2][u] Takeaways[/u]
Starting with the positive side of the game, it's pretty cool just to see how the campaign went through. Playing as familiar characters in the pre-sequel was a bit strange at first but it seems like you've been playing an existing character. There were no custom characters that represented each class. It was all from scratch and you would have to make it your own. The story was very good and I got to experience how Jack was the villain the whole time throughout the end when other characters saw his corruption in the vault.

[h3][u] Drawbacks[u]
Things I don't like about the game:
[*] It's kinda short compared to Borderlands 2 (from what I remember)
[*] Bosses are very difficult around the end
[*] Too many irrevelant side quests",1656250449,1656250559,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally don't get why people seem to dislike this game or think it's out of place. In fact, I can even confidently say some parts are better.

The gameplay adds a few new things. The main part is the addition of oxygen tanks, which you need to go across Elpis or else your health will slowly dwindle. It doesn't really change much, but it does allow for new special effects like Eridian artifacts as well as modifying ground slams (low gravity and ground slams are also a great addition to movement). Additionally, instead of having slag that just makes enemies get hit harder you have cryo that damages enemies but also slows them down, which in my opinion is a welcome change. The story itself is also great, which is essentially Handsome Jacks' origin story. The whole storyline gives you a whole new perspective on who he is as a character as well as the characters who were supposedly your allies, and you can really see how Jack changes throughout the story. Great game overall.

I had a bit of fun, but my brother moved away before we had the chance to even get halfway through the story(about drakensburg). I picked it up again with the handsome collection sometime in 2018/19, and played it a bit, about an hour, and it was kinda fun. But recently, I decided to play through all of the Borderlands games with my partner, and by far, this has been the worst of the experiences.

1. Design
The design of this game is a bit lackluster. Everything from the levels to the enemies just feels rather unintuitive. The bossfights having up to 6 phases, the new laser additions really only serving the same purpose as every other gun, it being confusing where to go during the main missions, it just feels a bit off. Now, I do like the O2 system. I enjoy jumping around and slamming into my enemies, but this also plays into its downfall, as when my weapons start to drop off, I just stunlock every enemy and either throw them off a cliff or just keep stunlocking them until they die, and it makes it really easy to get underleveled and overwhelmed later in the story.
2. Story
While the story is nice, it's really frustrating that the audio prompts keep clipping into each other. This feels like what Mass Effect: Andromeda was at launch, but these issues just haven't been fixed 8 years later. I'm aware the studio went defunct after DLC 2, but that's after DLC 2. This should've been fixed, and rather quickly. Handsome Jack clearly carries this story, and everyone else feels a bit out of character, especially Lilith, feeling more like a common bandit in this entry than a proper, nuanced former protagonist, and former deuteragonist, and former tritagonist in the series. It just feels wrong, somehow.
3. Gunplay
The gunplay just isn't the best. Most of the weapons I find are kinda trash, Torgue weapons especially suffer here, as there's just no reason to use anything under a legendary, which you really won't find during a casual playthrough, I found 2 drops, and got 3 from the grinder, after using ~200 golden keys. Unless you're a dedicated farmer, there's really nothing that makes the gunplay special like borderlands 2 or 3, or even 1 for that matter, with some of its unique blue/purples. While the laser weapons seem like a nice addition, it's pretty clear why they don't make a return in the proper sequel.
4. Characters
This is where borderlands usually shines, and this game is no different. The characters are absolutely amazing. for our run, we picked CL4P-TP and Nisha, and they complement each other really well, which is something even other borderlands games struggle to do at times. With their sometimes weird, sometimes quirky voice lines, and their solid skill trees, it makes up a bit for the lack of proper gunplay
5. Pace
The game just lacks pace. Deadlift, Sentinel, RK5, all 3 are just, weird skill gaps, deadlift being 2 levels above you usually, unless you do the ONLY available side missions, and all of them, RK5 being about 3 levels above you, and Sentinel, we started with it being 6 levels above us, and ended with it being 4 levels above us. We leveled up twice during the fight alone. This is probably a subjective point, given we weren't really interested enough in the game to do most of the side missions, some of which do give a proper exp boost, but the game should definitely scale a bit better on the low end.
6. Bugs.
Lots of them, and not the fun kind. If you travel through areas and use your action skill, sometimes it just locks you in an animation. Some characters just A pose the whole time. Sometimes you get stuck in completely random places. Sometimes the audio clips. Every time I restart the game, I get 60 golden keys. It just feels littered with a lack of polish, and definitely could've gone an extra month or two with some touching up, even if 2K Australia was on borrowed time.
That's mostly my gripes with the game, I wanted to like it a lot, given the Borderlands series has had a lot of impact on my adolescent and even prepubescent years, but this one just doesn't do it for me. If you prefer story, play Borderlands 2, see if it floats your boat, that game has a lot of mods, a lot of unique guns, a lot of proper DLC content, and a lot of lore, as well as some decent, but similar gunplay to this. Borderlands 3, I would recommend to anyone who prefers a more fluid gunplay experience; its story is rather lackluster, but it's nothing that detracts from the experience in any way. It has a ton of replayability, it's fun in almost every way, its characters are not as good as in this game but still solid, and its gunplay is just *mwah*.

Unless you're a diehard Borderlands fan, I would say to skip this one, and maybe watch a longplay, see if it's your thing. It wasn't mine, and that's alright, that doesn't make this a bad game by any means. I'm just disappointed at the overall lack of creativity brought to the table in a spinoff game. Because spinoffs are meant to take the original formula and actually do something with it, or throw the original formula out of the cards, like Tales from the Borderlands does, which is another solid entry in the franchise. It's just not for me, and I can't really recommend it. Thanks",1654454227,1654454227,False,7,1,0.584600150585174561,2,True,False,False

Gearbox had a huge hit on its hands with Borderlands 2, and there is not much reason to mess with a winning formula.

To be clear, a lot of what matters is new. The story, playable characters, environments, dialogue, and physics are all new. Despite that, it all feels very familiar. Where a number of core systems were significantly upgraded between the first and second games in the series, The Pre-Sequel‘s additions are much less pronounced.

Set between the first two games. Specifically, it is set after the events of Claptrap’s New Robot Revolution. Taking place largely on Pandora’s moon Elpis, the first regressive parallel to the original title in the series reveals itself: the moon is largely made up of desolate gray-blue rock dotted with industrial complexes. In the same way that our first adventure to Pandora spent entirely too much time in vast brown deserts, the first half of the romp across Elpis occurs in areas that are indistinct from one another. 

Some of the smaller areas have no Fast Travel station, an annoyance compounded by side missions that require returning multiple times. On top of that, not every area has vending machines near the entrance, which makes dumping junk loot a bit of a pain when visiting the offending locales. One area in particular (Stanton’s Liver) has everything going against it: unmemorable environmental art design, no Fast Travel, no vending machines, and several optional missions pointing toward it.

A lot of the time, traversing the environments is made easy through circuitous layouts and the new freedom afforded by the low gravity of Elpis and the Vault Hunters’ ability to double jump. Indeed, one of the most touted new features of fighting on Elpis as opposed to Pandora is the use of the moon’s lower gravity. On paper, it does not seem like a big deal, but it surprised me to find out just how much it affects gameplay. In addition to being able to jump higher, the double jump allows for a lot of aerial control, and the new Gravity Slam move is both satisfying and useful.

In fact, the low gravity combat is so fun that I became noticeably irritated when the story takes the Vault Hunters back to Helios, where there is more standard, Pandora-like gravity. It is not that the standard combat is bad, it is just that the moon combat is so good.

The story opens in Sanctuary as it floats among the clouds. Clearly taking place after the events of Borderlands 2, Athena is forced to tell the story of the time she helped Handsome Jack years before. The playable portion of The Pre-Sequel is all told as Athena’s flashback, regardless of which of the four available Vault Hunters is in play. What Athena describes is meeting Jack, a middle management Hyperion employee who saves her life and eventually the lives of countless people living on Elpis. Players get to see firsthand why Jack considers himself a hero, and they get to watch his slow decline into depravity, and his eventual transformation into Handsome Jack, the man wearing the mask.

Without spoiling too much, the ending upset me initially. I felt betrayed, and I felt like it would not have and should not have happened like it did. Upon further reflection, I realize that while it caused me to see a character in a different light than I previously had, it perfectly encapsulates a major theme in the series. The bad guys are at least a little bit good and the good guys are at least a little bit bad. Sometimes it is difficult to tell which is which. (But Lilith is still a bÌtch)

On the downside, the plot left open a few points that I was expecting to be addressed. Clearly, Athena is alive and in Pandora’s vicinity between the point of her introduction in The Secret Armory and some indeterminate point after the events of Borderlands 2, so she lives through the Pre-Sequel, but the story never gives an explicit explanation on her whereabouts during Handsome Jack’s tenure as CEO of Hyperion. Considering she was there to witness his insidious rise to power, there should be a good narrative reason that she would not help to bring him down.

The writing as a whole maintains the classic Borderlands charm, though it does seem a little less wacky than that found in Borderlands 2, again striking a balance between the two previous titles. A few familiar faces show up; most current characters have at least small speaking roles. There are several new characters as well: the eastern European Nurse Nina, the not-quite-as-lovable-as-Tiny-Tina child Pickle, and my favorite new character Janey Springs.

Springs is one of many denizens of Elpis, most of whom are the Australians to Pandora’s Americans. She is immediately endearing, and has some of the best lines in the game. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, and overall the writing is smart and snappy. 

One of the best new developments for the writing in Borderlands was the decision to have the Vault Hunters participate in conversations, giving each one more personality, and offering a non-gameplay reason to play through with multiple characters. This is especially important through Jack’s campaign to save Elpis, as each character will react differently to his methods and evolving morality. Although Athena is my girl, the morally bankrupt sadist Nisha has some of the most hilarious retorts and insults.

A new weapon element makes an appearance with cryo, which slows enemies, damages them over time, and can eventually freeze them solid to be shattered into hundreds of shards.
 
Lasers also appear as a separate weapon type. There are several different flavors of laser weapons, including Ghostbusters-style streams, Star Wars-esque blasters, and powerful railguns. Most useful is that laser weapons generally have low recoil and good hip fire accuracy. This pairs extremely well with the aforementioned low gravity combat. It is common to double jump across a pit and headshot an enemy with a railgun from the hip in the process, and it feels totally rad to do it. Where combat in Borderlands was like Call of Duty in a lot of ways, the fighting in The Pre-Sequel feels more akin to Halo.

Of course, some of the most fun in Borderlands comes with multiplayer, and The Pre-Sequel has made some strides to make this even more interesting. While each of the four Vault Hunters can be built to play solo, Athena, Wilhelm, and Claptrap have skills that benefit the whole team in unusual ways. 

In case it is not already obvious, I love the Borderlands series. I have followed it since its debut in 2009, and I have put hundreds of hours into using bullets to make numbers pop out of bad guys, digging into the lore, and hanging out with friends. Loving the series means knowing just how good it can be, and it means always measuring it against those high standards.

2K Australia nailed the combat with The Pre-Sequel. It is fast, fresh, and more tactically interesting than ever before. The writing hits the right notes, although the overarching plot is not quite as emotionally powerful as other entries have been. For many, that is enough to be a great experience. 

Despite that glowing praise, I am torn, because I also recognize that it is far from perfect. The environmental art direction gets dull too quickly, the level design is lacking in basic conveniences, and a general sloppiness is present when looking closely. Some of the cool new features like multi-leveled areas and combining weapons could have been enhanced further if the user interface and systems had been updated to play to those strengths. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was a solid entry to the series, but I wish that 2K Australia had the chance to take some of the failings to heart and deliver further excellence in the future but sadly they'll never get that chance now.

if you played borderlands 2, then you already played borderlands the pre-sequel as well. similarly to the case of bioshock 1 & 2, borderlands tps is the exact same game like its predecessor, apart from the different story and two or three very small and unimportant gameplay changes. 

the story takes place on a moon now and is set between borderlands 1 and 2, to show how handsome jack turned from an inconspicuous hyperion employee to the evil villain he is in borderlands 2. it’s an interesting premise, but since the gameplay gets extremely dull and repetitive very quickly again, you‘ll end up not caring too much about the narrative either.

there are three little changes compared to borderlands 2:
1. there are laser weapons now, too. (pewpew meh)
2. since it is set on a moon there is much lower gravity.
3. you have to handle your oxygen level when on the moon surface.

like the game itself, those changes are not for the better or worse, they are just completely unnecessary. the only slightly positive thing i noticed after roughly 20 hours of gameplay is, that there are not as much enemies that downright annoy you like some of the foes in borderlands 2. the enemy roster is slightly stripped back to mostly humanoid foes, which makes the fights slightly more fun and faster paced. trading stations seem to be a bit more frequent as well now.

when it comes to the technical aspects, there is not a single change here as well. the only thing that might be worth mentioning is that the music, while certainly far from bad, sounds more like an unimpressive copy of the mass effect soundtrack than an original score to me.

in the end those minor changes do next to nothing to differentiate borderlands tps from its predecessor or improve on it. it is literally the same experience with all its many strengths (interesting cel-shade grafics, satisfying gunplay, freaky characters, ideas and humor) and many more weaknesses (repetitive gameplay, inconsistent difficulty, a couple of really unbalanced areas and bossfights, technical hickups like crashes and glitches, longwinded and contrived quest design, a serious amount of filler content, etc.).
not that the game is worse than borderlands 1 or 2, but it is a completely unnecessary game with an unnecessary story, unnecessary characters and unnecessary gameplay changes. the game is still good, but there is not one single aspect that hasn’t gotten very old at this point, especially in case of the humor. needless to say that just like borderlands 1 and 2 the pre-sequel produces a serious gameplay fatigue that sets in no later than the 30 hour mark. the game may hold your interest until the main questline is completed, but anything else beyond this point, wether it be any remaining side quests or the available dlc, just drags and leaves you totally oversatured.

if this would be sold as a dlc for its predecessor i could certainly speak more fondly of it, but borderlands tps is a rather blatant trick played on the consumer: it strongly feels like DLC from start to end, yet is sold as a full prized „new“ game.
nevertheless, the quality of the game itself is stable. if you are looking to get into the borderlands series, this is as good a point of entry than any other preceding borderlands game, and if you are a big fan of borderlands than there is no way of skipping this. Those who don’t fit into either of those two groups of people won’t miss out on much if they let this game go by. and that‘s what ultimately gets the game it‘s final score: viewed only by itself it’s a legitimate 5/8 with one or two strengths of its own, but when put in context of the series, it simply has too few new things and improvements to offer to be anything more than decent.

Release: Q4 2014

( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made. Don't waste any money on this.
( ) 1/8 Bad. Seriously flawed with barely any redeeming qualities. Worth a couple of Cents at best, if at all.
( ) 2/8 Sub-par. Only for hardcore-fans of respective genre / series. Don't pay more than 5 bucks.
( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre. It‘s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.
(X) 4/8 Decent, but not for everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.
( ) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.
( ) 6/8 Great game, universal recommendation. 30 bucks would be a steal for this.
( ) 7/8 Outstanding game, a milestone of it‘s respective genre. Definitely worth its full prize.
( ) 8/8 Simply one of the best games ever made. Get this, the prize doesn't matter.",1605525887,1653994607,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an opinion that'll divide the entire community but it's just the way it is. Everything about it is fantastic. The story is compelling and gives you insight into a villain you already know the end of, the new guns are cool, the bosses are unique and an experience to fight and the difficulty is JUST right. It's neither too hard ala Borderlands 2 or too easy ala 3. Characters are great too. Each one has compelling, unique abilities  that make you want to play them all. My personal favourite is Wilhelm who ranks only barely above Claptrap for the progression he makes as you get more and more cybernetics. His voice grows more and more robotic with each specific skill, adding a sense of change that fits the overall theme of the story.
Claptrap, while a plague upon the ears to listen to for a playthrough, is hilariously fun to play with his random ultimate. You have no idea whether you'll be decimating everything you can see or put into a position where you're absolutely screwed and I love that little touch of random.

Combine this with the fact that we get to truly understand WHY Handsome Jack turned out the way he did, and we get a fantastic game even without the equally great DLC.

While it retains a lot of the core elements that make Borderlands 2 so good, it also lacks a lot of what people keep coming back to that game for. The story is much worse, feeling forced and badly executed. A lot of the new characters are forgettable and unlikable. The only ones I found that I liked were the ones I'd seen before or were fleshed out in other games. The humor is not as funny as in 1 and 2, it falls flat most of the time, however that is mostly personal.

From here on I will be delving into spoiler territory so skip to the second last paragraph if you don't want any.

When I'm talking about the story being forced I mean when Jack basically becomes a psychopath. I can understand him turning into one right after seeing some crazy shit in the vault, his ""friends"" turning on him and making him feeling betrayed. Really? He barely knew Roland and Lillith, Moxxi is just a whore who's slept with most people that you meet. We already know that he doesn't care much about Moxxi as he talks about them being together more like a one night stand. I can somewhat understand Jack being upset with Moxxi betraying him, however Lillith and Roland are just very experienced mercenaries to him as we barely see them interact outside of Jack giving them an objective. This is a part of what terms him into the Handsome Jack we know? Him being betrayed by two people he just met and a one night stand? This is what people point to the most when I ask how and/or why he turned out as he did. No. This is not how people would act especially someone who's as self righteous as Jack was in the beginning of the game. On another note God are the children annoying in this game. Pickle is a little kid who annoys the fuck out of me. Would he just shut up!? And don't even get me started on Lunestalker...

This game has a lot of flaws that I have experienced first hand, however I cannot bring myself to give it a negative review as I still enjoyed myself a lot with it. As I said in the beginning it retains some core elements to 2 that made it still pretty good in the gameplay department. It also made some welcome to spruce up the gameplay a bit. For example the addition of an entirely new element was a nice gameplay change and it quickly became my most used element, and favorite. The low gravity also made you rethink a lot of the game and how you approached some things. The skill trees of the new characters are also very unique and fun to level up and use (although I haven't played as all of the characters, just the base four).

I'd recommend to buy this game in the Handsome collection so you also get Borderlands 2, which is one of the greatest games of all time and a much better start if you want to get into the series. I'd recommend playing this game after Borderlands 2 (although chronologically speaking TPS comes first).

This is particularly funny because that's exactly what The Pre-Sequel is. It's not like original developer Gearbox isn't in on the joke. This is the first Borderlands game developed outside of the Plano, Texas-based studio, as they've handed the reins to 2K Australia.

The result is ... well, more Borderlands, really. In many ways, shy of a setting full of Australian accents (no, really, it is), it's an exercise in covering the series' bases as competently as possible without rocking any boats. But Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel stakes a valid claim on the series with a mechanical quirk that sounds like just another bullet point on an off-year sequel's checklist.

In the event that you haven't played a Borderlands game, here goes: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a hybrid loot-based action role playing game and first person shooter. As a Vault Hunter, you'll gain levels and earn more health and unique ability modifiers for your character as you complete missions and take down enemies.

Set primarily on the Pandoran moon Elpis, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is populated by a mostly different cast of characters than its bookends. Taking place between the first and second games, it's an origin story for Borderlands 2 villain Handsome Jack, ostensibly to show how he ""fell"" from hero-ish to big bad. He's not the only origin story though. All of the new character classes in The Pre-Sequel appear in various capacities in Borderlands and Borderlands 2, as friends or not-so-much.

Three out of the four ""new"" characters (I'm talking about the four default characters not the DLC ones) are relatively recognizable to Borderlands vets. I personally preferred the Lawbringer, who focuses on revolvers and sniper rifles with a skill that gives a brief period of auto targeting and rapid fire. Then there's the Gladiator, who absorbs enemy damage in a shield that she can later use as a weapon; the Enforcer adds more and more tech and augmentations over time. 
The only truly new-feeling class is Claptrap, newly christened the Fragtrap. Claptrap has been given new programming that takes bits of each pre-existing vault hunter class and sort of ""remixes"" them when you activate his special ability. It is completely unpredictable — there's no way to know if you'll pull out an identical, second weapon and fire both until you're out of ammo, or, say, a spinning rainbow disco deathball. This unpredictability is fun ... assuming you're not running solo. Claptrap is easily the character most dependent on other classes to stay alive.

Not that death means much. Maybe more than either previous Borderlands game, The Pre-Sequel doesn't really care if you die (outside of boss battles, that is, where dying allows heavies to regain their health and shields). There's not much penalty or consequence aside from the same minor respawn fee that's always been there. You can keep throwing yourself into the same firefights until you conquer them, if that's what you want to do.

It's all very Borderlands. And that's ... sort of The Pre-Sequel's biggest problem. This is the least essential game of the series. It feels smaller than either previous Borderlands. There's less variety in environments and enemies, and it's considerably shorter — about 18-24 hours to mainline the main story with some side missions thrown in. And if that were all that was there, just about anybody could skip The Pre-Sequel and continue living their life without worry or care.
But Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel fixes one of the biggest detriments to the series' moment-to-moment play: It makes movement fun.

Before, simply getting from point a to point b in a mission was tedious and plodding. Areas were frequently gated by low platforms that you had to find a way around to make your way up. Combat movement was the same circle strafing and mild bunny hopping over and over again.

Apparently, low-gravity is the answer to all of this.

As Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel takes place mostly on the surface of a moon (or in deep space), gravity isn't the hindrance it is on Pandora. This allows for absurd jumps and, once you have a life-saving oxygen kit, the ability to give yourself an extra bump, slow your descent, and even change direction while in the air.

This does several things. First, it allows for even more involved vertical traversal problems that are fun to solve in a way nothing in the previous Borderlands games was. Second, it adds a new kind of item to the game with O2, or ""Oz"" kits as they're called, each of which has its own perks and allow for variations on the air stomp attack you have when you're hovering. For a game like Borderlands, more kinds of loot and more gear to min-max is a great thing.

But most importantly, it's more fun to move around, and it's more fun to fight enemies with that newfound mobility. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel has better gunplay than any previous installment because there's more to do at any given time.

This is assisted by a less jagged gating of parts of the world than Borderlands 2 exhibited. There are fewer instances where I collided with enemies I couldn't kill while sticking to the critical path of the game. It's worth mentioning that some sidequests hid entire systems as rewards, such as an item grinder that lets you break down unwanted items for randomized new gear. This makes for a mostly easier game, but it also allows you to finish the main campaign and unlock harder, more loot-rewarding game options. It also means solo-ing the game the first time through is a reasonable option, underlined by boss fights that aren't extended damage sponges — at least in comparison to previous games.

This revitalized movement and gunplay keeps Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel interesting to play once the series' routine gear-grind has set in, and it makes moving through previously explored areas on the way to new missions much less of a chore. It's the kind of thing that seems like a complete no-brainer once you've used it, and the idea of playing another Borderlands without it is barely fathomable.

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel doesn't feel like a game that needs to be, exactly. It's a story filling in gaps, adding a bit of nuance to a world that's already had two games worth of exposition rather than exploring new ground.  It's the same recipe that's driven two full, long games and a host of downloadable content. But the lark of low gravity proves that the tedious parts of previous games don't have to stay an anchor holding the series down. That addition makes this one last run through the world of Pandora (or its moon, anyway).",1650962227,1651845634,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

1. The levels are a poorly thought out design, some maps are definitely better then others, however some are so bad it feels like a sloppy game of *throw shapes at a board* and whatever sticks is how we'll make this map. They tried leaning to heavily on the jump pad mechanic, which was a fun introduction, but it would have been fun if they left it at just randomly placed jump pads used for basic/non essential travel/exploration as well as it did make for some fun innovative combat, Like I said they leaned to heavily on it and basically made labrynth maps based solely on figuring out jump puzzles, this isn't portal or darksiders, its borderlands. 
2. Jacks not so lead character. Some characters were fun while others not so much.  Jack was very memorable in BL2 and in TPS he is the protagonist, yet I don't remember him at all. He had really no good lines or anything that truly popped like in BL2. The worst part is you're running missions for him, constantly interacting with him, following him around listening to him mumble on and nothing stuck. 
3. The DLC's. The DLC for the arena (shock drop slaughter pit I believe)  was way to big  you spent more time running around the arena trying to find enemies then you did fighting them. Not to mention the arenas are kind of getting boring after each game. Claptraps caltastic voyage was an interesting yet dark story actually. However again with the sloppy map design.
4. Claptraps character skill ability. 
Holy mothertrucking hell what an idiotic idea that was, whoever thought of it, I hate you. 15 RANDOM SKILLS that 75% of the time don't really help that much.
Funzerker- Cool thanks for wasting all my ammo. 
One shot wonder- Great I love being launched off the map 
Clap in a box- Hopefully there is any enemy nearby or I guess Im dead, and even then sometimes it still puts you in fight for your life. (This skill removes your gun/melee and places a bomb that isn't guarented to kill all enemies in 1 hit) in your hands and you have seconds to explode it by someone or go into fight for your life) AGAIN, sometimes even detonating it by someone you still go into fight for your life.

Smaller game, feels a lot like an expansion for Borderlands 2 but certainly worth the money.

- Story is much simpler and yet it feels like there is so much at stake. You will get a closer look into Jack's past and meet some cool new characters. The game however has many weak points. The main story is great apart from the scenes where Jack kills people for the first time. His comments feel kinda weird. There are some events that only closely fit the canon. If you pay attention to the story you will probably notice things like that. For example (spoiler) Lilith questions Athena about what happened during the pre-sequel, while Lilith herself is present in most of the events of Athena's story. You'll have to come up with an explanation like: Lilith just wasn't paying attention half the time. (end of spoiler) Sidequests are a mixed bag. Some are good and funny and some are really annoying to complete with weak writing that tries to be funny.

- Atmosphere is good, it really feels like Borderlands on the moon. Gameplay is the same, with new elements which are very well done. You can again pick up only what you need by holding ""pick up"" like in Borderlands 1. However the navigation is awfull. Quest pointers point directly to the place you should get to and don't mark the way there, which is annoying since the new areas are complex and huge both horizontaly and veticaly.

- The DLC characters are great. The holodome DLC is just a huge arena with minimal story but the second one is nice again.

Also I have to mention: at one point Mr. Torgue says friendzone is misogenistic... WTF? Makes no sense! That said, this is the only such stupidity in this game.",1591203758,1651515390,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

The game takes place on the moon of Pandora so your movement is floaty because of the reduced gravity which makes sense but the level design fully utilizes it to its advantage to give a unique feel to the game the other games couldnt do.  The comedy for me wasn't as wity as the other titles but still funny, I did find more jokes falling flat though.  The characters abilities work perfectly fine and the loot is still as good as ever, because its a looter shooter so that makes perfect sense.  The games story seems to be perfectly fine for the series nothing glaringly wrong with any of it, but I doubt anyone plays Borderlands for the plot but I am not saying the plot is bad anyway.  

Though it is sad to not see the normal psychos and skags like in the other games but they still might show up because I haven't even finished my first playthrough.

This game feels more difficult than the second and third game but easier than first in terms of difficulty and definatly starts you off in the action quick which even the characters in the game mention.

Neutral:
- I don't mind this being more of the same. Laser guns/stomping/oxygen management are all right. I don't love or hate them in particular.

Pros:
- Moon-jumping adds verticality to the action.
- Cryo element is a lot cooler than slag.
- While the new character classes aren't anything to write home about, it's refreshing to see the devs try something new.

Cons:
- The biggest con: You don't feel progressively more powerful. By the end of the game at level 27, my Enforcer still lost all his shield and half his health to just a few shots. Enemies are annoyingly bullet-spongy if you don't carry guns with the right elements to deal with them. And they spawn behind you and shoot you from off-camera all the time. That makes your character feel flimsy, even with 2 character levels above the mission level.

- Loot drops are crappy. By the end of the game, you're still getting the influx of white and green stuff. At level 27, I still had to hold on to my level 16 shock-beam gun because other guns barely damaged the shield on Lost Legion soldiers and the Guardians. I can see that the devs probably nerfed the drop rates of higher-tier weapons to push players to use the Grinder, but that leads to the next con.

- The Grinder is RNG-based. You can kind of control what you get. For example, putting in 3 pistols will likely net you a new pistol. But it doesn't always give you a new gun of the next tier. I put in 12 green guns in a row and ended up with 4 worse green guns. You can up the odds by throwing in some Moonstones but those are not easy to come by and you'd better save them for expanding your ammo and item bag capacity because...

- The game can be stingy with ammo and money, especially in the early game. I'd never played a Borderland game where I used up all ammo and money (to buy ammo) before. So, I ended up having a dilemma between grinding all guns and risk getting nothing or selling all guns for ammo, medicine, and respawning. This situation improved in the latter half of the game, but by that time, I already got sick of it.

It's more Borderlands but very restrictive in many aspects, therefore, less fun. But it's still worth a try, when on sale.",1649643655,1649644228,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story and particularly the side missions are a slog to get through and it only gets better if you own the Claptastic Voyage DLC.
It's kinda funny that a story DLC is better than the main game.

Some of the gripes I have with the game:

> All the bosses you encounter in the story are a complete joke and they pose no challenge whatsoever.
> Places look samey and the lack of vehicles on some big maps is infuriatingly annoying
> Drops from enemies are mostly useless so you rely mostly on vendor guns
> They clearly upped the chances of getting legendary items and as a result most of them suck ass and are worse than purple or even blue guns which is just stupid
> Oxygen while cool on paper is just annoying to manage
> Bad framerates on some maps even with PhysX on low

Overall I would say this game is mediocre and with the Claptastic Voyage DLC it makes it worth it to atleast play it once.
Pick it up on sale or go with Borderlands 2, It's much much better and has a lot more content.

+ The main story greatly enhances the main story of Borderlands 2 by providing a good history of what led to Handsome Jacks maniac genocidal attempt to cleanse the borderlands of all ""bandits"". Many of the key bad characters are the main classes of this game.
+ The player characters talk for the first time during various conversations providing additional insight into the character you play as and some comedy.
+ Laser weapons are a nice extra weapon class.
+ Cryo. The freezing element replaces the worthless slag element. Freezing has a meaningful impact to combat and also adds some visual details with enemies shattering into blocks of ice and slowing moving through the air in low gravity.
+ New Classes have great variety and meaningful skill trees.
+ DLC. The Claptrap expansion is welcome and fun story taking place in Claptraps mind. Learn about him and see the worlds events through his prespective.
+ Full experience. The claim that this should have been DLC for Borderlands 2 is false. This is a shorter, but full experience. The stories are just as entertaining. Fetch, kill and talk quests are all borderlands quests so its no surprise that there is more here.
+ Physx. The physics supported SFX are back and are even more visually interesting in low gravity environments.

+/- O2 Mechanic. This mechanic is serves as a challenge to the players movement while giving you access to the ground slam and light thrusts. IMO this worked out well and its impact is greatly overstated. The slam is a great attack opportunity allowing you to exploit long drops and turn them into powerful attacks. It does help immerse you into the environments as well.
+/- Gravity. This has been typically been pretty light in past borderlands games, but this time it varies depending on where you are from stronger to even more weak. 

- Weapon grinding is poorly balanced and doesn't offer anything impactful. Its entirely obsolete.
- Some unique weapons simply aren't useful as their oddities often result in them being to unusable compared to other weapons.
- Respawning limitations on some unique enemies is a big negative on replayability and collection of some unique weapons.
- Glitch weapons are cool, but simply aren't strong enough to compensate for their short comings in most scenarios.",1649123751,1649167472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think it is a pretty underrated IMO. i would say its probably the worst borderlands game but still not a bad game by any means. It does feel pretty much the same as any other borderlands other than the zero gravity and oxygen systems. Some people get annoyed about the oxygen but tbh The oxygen really isnt that bad. It takes a while to use all your oxygen and there are easy fill ups everywhere pretty much. You also get oxygen whenever you kill an enemy so I never pay attention to it and its not a problem. And if i ever do somehow run out then you lose HP pretty slow so its not really annoying IMO. And if you do care that much i think, (not 100% sure) that if you play as Claptrap, then you dont have to worry about oxygen at all (because you are a robot). Not whole lot else to say.

The base vault hunters are ok, nisha is op as fuck, claptrap is really strong (I use the flakker and magnum while spec into the explosive build), Athena is tanky and has a really strong melee build but then gearbox nerf the shooting star shield and I just never really liked playing Wilhelm he uses lazer weapons and has two drones not much to say (he goes pewpewpewpewpew).

The story is ok but when ever I play (***SPOILER ALERT***) and get to the Felicity part of the game where you are going through the Titan Robot Production Plant I just lose interest in the game, idk what about it bores me, also the entire game is just go somewhere and go back to Concordia to where BL2 just seem to have more places to it (by this i mean large sub areas that dont only have one or two missions to them) and just felt like it had more to do mission wise.

Loot wise %70 of the legendarily in the game are just reused from BL2 (Flakker, Sham, Magnum, logans gun, maggie, shredifier and manny more) and with the grinder its so easy to get the legendary you want all you need is to grind one boss to get the same crappy legendary over and over again then you can just grind it into what ever legendary gun you want, in BL2 I farmed pyro pete, lee, doc mercy, the warrior and the bunker for countless hours trying to get the orange loot and you dont want to know how many times ive gotton the bitch for the fucking bunker when all i wanted was a fucking sham (I know I could just get shit dooped but that really take most of the fun out of game like borderlands)

so if I was to rate BL:TPS I would give it a 6.5/10 was a complete bust no, I still enjoyed playing it for the time I did but did I enjoy it as much as I hoped no, I do not think the game is worth a full $60 and an extra $30 for the season pass but if it gets put on sale and your a BL fan sure I wouldn't say dont buy it, But you have been warned",1434054933,1648763811,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This part of the story is set between Borderlands and Borderlands 2, where the three former Vault Hunters Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai interrogate Athena after having captured her from the Atlas Domes. Athena then recounts her story about helping Handsome Jack with three other vault hunters. But they witness him slowly transforming into a ruthless tyrant murderer, to the man he is in Borderlands 2

If you enjoyed the first and second Borderlands, you will most likely enjoy The Pre-Sequel as well. Other than low gravity and limited air gimmicks, it's pretty much the same as Borderlands 2 but you're on Jacks side. There's a lot less story in this one but if you're into the Borderlands storyline I would buy this game without any hesitation... besides, the humour is amazing!

So many laughs to be made if you're playing with friends 8.5/10 rating, i'm expecting more from this story!

Pros

- Cool laser weapons. Some are pretty powerful and awesome to use when you find the right ones
- Decent story and humour, about what you'd expect from borderlands
- Enjoyable gameplay. Great timesink
- Love the double-jump and launchpad mechanics. Good platforming

Cons

- Killing enemies in low grav spits the loot everywhere and is sometimes impossible to grab. Gets really irritating at times.
- Some of the mapping feels lazy - invisible boundaries, bad terrain for driving etc
- Weapon progression and side quest rewards could have been better IMO. There's an excess of garbage-quality guns and not enough powerful ones.
- Some of the humour is downright cringey but this is barely a factor being honest

Overall, the Pre-Sequel is a mixed bag but does enough right to get a good recommendation. Worth playing if you've never tried it before. Get it on sale.",1645531360,1645627663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game looks, feels, and plays exactly like the sequel. Same gameplay, same menus, same inventory system, pretty much the same guns. The point of the game is to describe the events… before the sequel. So you do get a new story, new environments, new characters with new abilities, and a new weapon element and category (which basically translates to 3 new gun types). Another difference is in the way you get to move around with a glide jump and a little double jump boost. It was pretty fun to glide around the map and slam to the ground on command; it’s something different, a welcome addition.

This game is pretty much an obligatory playthrough for any fan of the series. If you like the franchise, its humor, its crazy story and characters, then I don’t see why you would not want to play this game.

In Borderlands 2 he was perhaps the most gleefully sadistic, and effective video game villain since Final Fantasy 6's Kefka. Seeing his journey from hero to maniac is perhaps the biggest reason to make the 20-or-so-hour trek across Pandora’s moon, Elpis. Writer Anthony Burch shows a real knack for storytelling here, drawing a more sympathetic portrait of Jack without ever making him into the clichéd misunderstood villain. He's every bit the hilarious, ego-centric asshat here that we remember him as, and his excellently written and delivered dialogue is responsible for the lion's share of the laughs.

It’s a good thing too, because those laughs were often all there was to carry me through the long stretches of purposeless wandering around with barely anything to fight. This is part of a problem Borderlands has had since the beginning, and The Pre-Sequel hasn’t solved it. The inadequate waypoint system that doesn’t save you from going in circles while looking for your next objective, the boring trek back to your quest-giver at mission’s end… it’s all still here. The early hours on the moon were particularly trying, since everything is incredibly spread out, and every low-gravity jump takes seemingly forever. I just don’t want to walk towards a diamond on my mini-map for god knows how long to get to where the fun is.

And I really don’t want to go on a multi-step wild switch hunt to trigger said fun once I get there. The Pre-Sequel is cardinally guilty of this one. Apparently neither the Hyperion or Dahl corporations know how to make doors in space, because almost every single one you need to go through requires you to throw a breaker or manual override somewhere back in the area you just slogged through. In a game about shooting and looting, I should be doing those things almost constantly, but in The Pre-Sequel there were times when 10 or more minutes could easily pass without me doing much of either. Things do pick up in the latter half of the campaign, but this sort of buck-and-stall pacing has plagued the series for years, and it gets harder to forgive with each iteration.
But once The Pre-Sequel hits its stride, we get down to what Borderlands has always done best: the bullets start flying, the loot starts dropping, and joyful chaos ensues. The Pre-Sequel delivers a whole lot of that, starting with its four new playable characters and their positively nutty skill trees. Their action skills feel wildly different from one another, and from any of the vault hunters that have preceded them.

Wilhelm’s flying drone duo, Wolf and Saint, really stands out. Not only does one of them go on automated bombing runs against nearby enemies, but the other hangs back to heal him, or even your allies with the proper skill points invested. Nisha’s washes the screen in classic Western sepia, turning her into a godless, gunslinging killing machine for a short while, which is a bit more straightforward, but no less satisfying. Athena’s shield allows her to go all Captain America on fools, but Claptrap’s is by far the craziest, granting him different abilities depending on the situation at hand. Those who love a more anarchic, unpredictable approach to combat will get all the mayhem they’d like out of it.
In fact, everyone’s  skill trees are flush with abilities that reward specific playstyles with powerful temporary effects, like mini achievements you unlock over and over. Borderlands’ mascot robot Claptrap, now playable for the first time, is the best example. I happen to be a compulsive reloader with a mild death wish, so his Boomtrap skill tree seems to have been made just for me. By rapidly reloading, I can get a variety of big buffs that have explosive results, but at the cost of some health and accuracy. Oh and I have chance of actually griefing my teammates with my action skill (serves you right for joining my game without an invite...jerk). Just reading some of the other characters’ high-level skills made me think, “How does THAT work?” A copy of whatever gun I’m holding appears in my off-hand? I turn into a walking nuclear bomb? I just had to try this stuff out.

The Pre-Sequel has a few other tricks up its sleeve too, and most of them work out. Not the new Stingray hovercraft – which handles like a wet mop with a ceiling fan strapped to it – but the new low-gravity mechanics are a success. Coming to grips with my elongated jumps took a while, but once it clicked, I started using my new freedom to deadly effect. It becomes so easy to put space between you and your enemies that sniping becomes a more viable option, and being able to bound over cover to slam down behind your foes’ cover makes getting up close and personal easier, and more satisfying than ever.
The new gearing options are a blast too. Freezing enemies solid with cold-based attacks and burning them to a crisp with the new laser-class weapons feels great, but just wait until you see some of the mods that come on the Oz kits that keep you breathing in space. Some grant you accuracy and damage bonuses while airborne, while others give you an entirely different set of buffs depending on whether you’re in vacuum or atmosphere. The Pre-Sequel is really generous with loot, too, so you’ll have plenty of opportunities to shape your character in interesting ways. I mean, my Claptrap basically waltzes into the middle of groups of enemies and decimates them exclusively by reloading and dying. I can’t think of another game I can do that in.
Despite its tendency to make you jump through hoops before getting to the good stuff, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel delivers where I expect it to as a Borderlands fan. The new gear and low-gravity mechanics mixed with the zany skill trees makes for a fresh experience, and with Jack at the center driving the story forward, you get a deeper dive into the always entertaining, if well-traveled universe of Borderlands.",1645383483,1645383483,True,5,0,0.594594597816467285,0,True,False,False

as a fan of the borderland series I played this after borderland 2.

The story is decent but don't expect borderland 1,2 level story going into this. It's interesting to see how handsome jack went insane. 

The 4 characters are alright. The main star is claptrap. The movement graphic and overall feel is the same as the previous games but I enjoyed this only but only if the game is on sale or if you are buying the handsome jack collection.

At this point, if you haven't bought this game but you've enjoyed whatever other one you've already played and you're now here reading this review, you'll enjoy this game too. 

While the plot is a bit wonky and has some weird plot holes, it was still funnier and better than BL3. Gameplay wise, low gravity was a very fun take. If you have played BL3's low gravity mission *Space Laser-Tag,* don't worry, you should know that those mechanics were a serious downgrade over this game. The low gravity feels very natural and fluid, and some O2 tanks can provide you with even more control mid air (the rest are mostly the usual gun, health and shield buffs, including mid air specific ones). Gearbox Australia did a really nice job with this game, to the point where i would argue that the mechanics and gunplay were superior to BL2!

Oh, and vending machines are actually useful and regularly provide blue and purple gear, unlike BL2 99% of the time!",1465758219,1644978846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another adventure in the world of Pandora with all the familiar game play, style and wit we know from the previous games. This is probably best played after some time has passed since you played BL1/2, to bring you back into that familiar world, but in a different location.

Very similar structure to BL2, not much difference in how the game plays. At times it feels like an expansion pack for BL2, but it's enough to be its own episode and worth it on sale.

[h1]Positive[/h1]
Familiar game play from BL2 wrapped in a new story and location. Bring backs some good memories from BL series

Aussie voice acting reminds you of the similarities between Pandora and the Mad Max world.

I liked the sound track, ambient space synth sounds.

[h1]Negative[/h1]
AI has issues sometimes where they get stuck or can't follow you from outdoor into indoor sections.

Lot of enemies have different names but look and behave similar to ones you met in BL2. That's why this sometimes feels like an expansion pack for BL2. Though still plenty of original locations, art and story.

+ Handsome Jack origin story

+ Traditional Borderlands loot system

+ Challenging enemies

+ Able to beat main story without doing any sidequests and underleveled

+ Last boss feels like an epic finale to the game

+ Harder difficulty after beating the main game to get upgraded loot


[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Weapon variety suprisingly lacking

- Fire and Corrosion elements feel weak

- Low gravity areas are irritating, makes the movement a lot slower and floatier

- Oxygen is an unimportant gimick

- Strange hitboxes for some objects and enemies; bullets will seemingly travel right through enemies at times or hit an invisible surface right in front of you

- Lack of Badasses

There are a few changes in this game that are not part of the aforementioned game which is all a plus in my books.  I find the Pre-sequel to be very unbalanced towards cooperative players.  It is the most grindish of all Borderlands titles including the newest one Borderlands 3 which was excellent (I bought upon release from Epic) conversely it is the least liked game in the series from my perspective given the above gripes and with the need to purchase from Epic Store being one of them.
The new mechanic features this really annoying floating feature and ground slams.  This seems a bit cartoon'y even for a Borderlands game furthermore it makes moving around the map tedious and time consuming not too mention very little control while airborne.
As a 100% solo player the game is grind due to enemies always having a higher level then you and/or having very lousy gear available in the first quarter.  Weapons are pretty cool for the most part...it's space so I have a penchant for the laser guns.
The story is quirky, the environments are pretty neat although the story pales in comparison to Borderlands 2 but does provide a linear lead up as intended.  There is a good variety of characters for the player to choose from, in fact one could even say the game offers the best choice of all the other games especially since this feature has yet to be introduced in Borderlands 3. Borderlands 2 character selections are merely upgrades of the original Borderlands characters.
Plenty of popular culture references and assorted tokens of geekdom throughout the game.  I think the 2nd half was better than the first.  I can't bring myself to down thumb this game because after all it's a Borderlands title and ALL the main instalments are winners in my opinion.",1643469500,1643472270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

261640,50169957,76561197983290992,0,68,3577,0,344,1589432196,"Back at its release, this game got mixed reviews from gamers: it was accused of being too much similar to ""Borderlands 2"". I absolutely loved ""BL2"", but let's all agree we don't want games being the same thing again and again. And so, sceptical as I am about expending my hard-earned money, I decided to ignore this game for a while. Until I saw that the game had got a lot cheaper, so I finally decided to give it a shot. Here's what I think.

The game indeed looks a lot like the previous game, and all the basic mechanics are there. In fact, one would be justified in believing this was originally meant to be a DLC for ""BL2"", but got so big that 2K decided to make it a stand-alone game.

The game is set in Pandora's moon Elpis, which means lower gravity, longer jumps and trickier platforming. But the gravity slam is actually awesome, and floating around with the trusters is great (just be warned it costs oxygen). You'll also come across a lot of jump pads, and they are as fun as they sound. But the maps, while not big, can be confusing, lacking that simplicity of ""BL2"" - this may be because the maps now are much more vertical, with more climbing and platforming required.

On top of that, there's no oxygen outdoors, but thankfully this is not so much of an issue since you can find pockets of oxygen, breathing domes and oxygen canisters everywhere - otherwise, playing the game would be a frustrating experience. Besides, playing with Claptrap nulls this issue entirely.

Because the game takes place in space, the developers may have thought the inclusion of lasers would be a good idea. But they're not very accurate, meaning you need to get close and personal for them to work. Needless to say, you may find yourself using only a few of them.

The game claims that is both a prequel and a sequel to ""BL2"". But it's not a really a sequel: all of the events you partake in take place before the events of ""BL2"", and the story is narrated from afterwards. The story also portrays Handsome Jack differently, presenting him at first as a relatable down-on-his-luck anti-hero. But as the story unfolds, we get to see his ""transformation"", from a poor sod in a bad spot to an ambitious monster. Also, playing as Claptrap is great, not only from a gameplay aspect (again, he doesn't require oxygen), but the game becomes immediately funnier with him, with his voice lines and abilities. In fact, I think playing as Claptrap was the main reason I finally gave in on buying this game. Who wouldn't want that?

And speaking of which, the characters now are much more responsive to dialogues. In the previous game, they would just listen to orders while muted, as if they were Gordon Freeman. They would say some things during combat, but nothing beyond that. In here, they actually respond accordingly to what they hear - and each character has different responses, and hear different lines.

The ""Borderlands"" franchise has always been known for having some great electronic music, and here is no different - specially given the space setting. The soundtrack goes for a synthwave vibe, putting this new genre to good use. Both the ambient and combat tunes are great, and the soundtrack doesn't make a big show of itself.

This game was largely developed by 2K Australia, and by God, this shows. Everybody has Aussie accents, almost as if Elpis was meant to be the Australia of the ""Borderlands"" universe. I was half-way expecting a ""Mad Max"" reference to pop up somewhere, and lo and behold, there's this mission in which you take on a dwarf riding on a massive scavenger, like in ""Beyond the Thurderdome"" (plus, they're collectively called ""Red Kelly"", because of course). I feel there should have been a sniping achievement called ""Sniping's a good job, mate"". Also, since this a ""Borderlands"" game is set in space, there obviously must be references to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Star Wars"".

All in all, the game is very worthy to buy on a sale. It may be shorter than ""BL2"", but it packs quite a punch from beginning to end. I know that right now, people are review-bombing this game because Randy Pitchford is as terrible at being a CEO as he is at being a magician - or a basic human being, for that matter. But in this ""Borderlands 3"" hype we're at, I decided to finally play this game just to see what's what. And my sincere opinion is that, even with its flaws, it's a very good game after all.

I'll be waiting for ""BL3"" in 2020. Six months aren't so much time.",1555480891,1642321735,True,6,0,0.557692945003509521,0,True,False,False

I recommend to play Borderlands 2(BL2) before.
Please keep in mind i review full game(with all DLCs)/or if i compare to BL2 i also mean full game(with all DLCs) as its the way how to play them now(imo).
Technically very similar to Borderlands 2.

[b]What i like:[/b]
Graphics looks nice, you can tell its not new game but still holds up very well.
Runs good and dont have many big bugs(didnt encounter any crash, few times needed to reload to continue quest/or if i was stuck).
Gameplay is solid, weapons feels as they should.
Game is semi open world, bigger areas have vehicles you can drive and also shoot.
Playable characters now talk(with other NPCs and during story moments) and its great, adds more personality and its more interesting to play story with all characters.
Golden Keys(SHIFT codes), can get great gear and they still release codes to this day. Its must be random but i got more grenade mods/shields/class mods/pistols and less other weapons compared to BL2
CO-OP but its optional and you can play solo if you want.
Have many playable characters with different skills and is meant to play multiple times so if you like this game you have tens hours of enjoyment.
Claptastic Voyage DLC is really good, some consider its best in series.
Levels/difficulty is imo better than in BL2, also less content so you can't accidentally overlevel too much.
Laser weapons.
Cryo elemental effect(freezes enemies), Slag is missing but im happy with it.
Low gravity/double jump/slam damage(everybody may not be enjoying it but i like it and helps to distinguish from BL2).
Story is good and interesting see how Jack became the villain(its take place before BL2). Also can see some other familiar characters.
Have many Challenges you can complete to get little bonuses(kill x enemies y times, get x kills with certain gun etc), it feels you always working towards something.
Glitch rarity weapons are good and something different.
Moonstones(BL2 Eridium equivalent) have more uses(Grinder) and drop more frequently.
Mainframe song :P :D

[b]What i dislike:[/b]
Much less content than in BL2, also less varied.
Sadly have only one story DLC(BL2 have one great and 4 good ones).
Some maps feels little bit empty and boring.
Good for playing once/twice but not to get max level or complete UVHM.
Holodome sucks, arena is too big and rounds take too long also need to chase enemies.
Much less popular than BL2 so it may be harder to play CO-OP.
Same QOL things like in BL2(dont collect Moonstones automatically, cant refill ammo with one button press etc).
Vechicles steer with mouse, you get used to it but still it would be nice if have option to use keyboard.
When starting with new character you get annoying tutorial text popups you cant close few seconds.

[b]Which version to buy?[/b]
Not worth full price, wait sale.
Best and imo only right option is Borderlands: The Handsome Collection(BL2+DLCs + Pre-Sequel+DLCs) even if you have BL2(its still cheaper than Pre-Sequel+SP). Pre-Sequel dont have GOTY(base+DLCs) version, you can only buy base game + Season Pass(or DLCs separetly).

[b]Achievements(if you care :P):[/b]
Not bad for such big and replay minded game, but takes some time.
Most can be obtained solo. Some need CO-OP, hardest is complete certain mission with 4 player(mission is not hard but findings 3 other players can be). 
For Fragtrap class specific achievement you need to be level 25 to complete it(its almoust full playtrough and need to play briefly CO-OP but CO-OP part takes only few minutes), other charaters can complete theirs with low level and fast.
If you played BL2 then good news is there is no stupidly grindy challenge(no Jimmy Jenkins) :P",1642256609,1642256609,True,5,0,0.603280246257781982,0,True,False,False

You are intentionally made underpowered, and it shows after a while. Played for 10 hours and I'm only level 14, my guns have low damage, are uncommon, with slowest fire rate ever. I've been dying a lot, because I cannot deal enough damage to get a Second Wind (slow fire rate with + reduced bleeding out timer = no bueno). I have never been dying so many times in a Borderlands game.
Someone's obsession with turrets deserves special mentioning - what is up with that?! 
One of the most annoying things - melee attacks. No matter how far or high you move away before the attack - you're getting hit with it. Oh, yes.

The Pre-Sequel is to Borderlands 2 what Saints Row 4 is to Saints Row 3. Even though it's technically made by a different developer, it recycles a lot of elements from BL2 to expand the story, pretty much like a game-sized DLC.

Story-wise, this is the best Borderlands game (even compared to 3) since it actually made me care about the series' [I]lore[/i] than Borderlands 2. The latter felt like it focused entirely on Jack and Angel's storyline, and never really dived into Hyperion, the other weapons manufacturers, or how the previous Vault Hunters ended up where they are now. In this game, you play as NPCs/villains from past/future Borderlands games, and TPS' purpose is to humanize the antagonists of those games by showing us their point of view and struggles. This spin-off could've only truly worked for Borderlands 2 since there was no character in this series like [I]Handsome Jack[/i], and seeing his descent into madness seemed justified with respect to how the world treated him. Even though the voice acting behind every character in the series was supreme, Dameon Clarke takes the cake in terms of materializing a character like Jack into an otherwise goofy game.

Gameplay-wise, it's pretty much identical to BL2's gunplay except for the Moon Gravity and stomping. At first, I thought the Oxygen mechanic was gonna be a pain, but after a while, I didn't seem to mind it as it was abundantly placed across the levels and truly does differentiate it from the other games with its atmosphere-[i]'spheres'[/i] and cosmic/iridescent aesthetic.

[b][u]Nisha Appreciation Paragraph:[/u][/b] But if we're talking about the difference in gameplay, the newest thing about any Borderlands game is its new set of Vault Hunters. While I started co-op with a friend, I picked Nisha (the Indian Sherrif of Lynchwood) and he picked Clap-trap (Hyperion's greatest invention). Since I main'd Gaige in BL2, I didn't play any other character on that game, so trying a new Vault Hunter was the first time was refreshing. Nisha is the complete opposite of Gaige in a sense... they have the opposite focus on accuracy; Nisha loves it while Gaige hates it. Nisha has one of the shortest Action Skill Cooldowns, while Gaige has the longest. Talking about Action Skills, her power is the most game-changing and impactful one to use as it basically gives you [i]aimbot[/i] and you're chaining kill combos by flicking your mouse to a direction while aiming down sights. The duration of this mode is extended with each kill, rewarding you upon using your power when there are more enemies around rather than spraying into a boss like a tank (Gunzerker, Moze, etc). Deathtrap doesn't stand a chance against the sheer adrenalin you get when helping out in co-op with Nisha's Action Skill. Her Passive Skill (which is Dual-Wielding pistols at the final skill tree) doesn't come close to Gaige's [I]Anarchy[/i] though.

[b][u]Co-op Troubles:[/u][/b] Unlike BL2, this game had terrible desync, and someone tells me that it's due to terrible netcode. Apparently, it existed with BL2 too, but it wasn't anywhere as abhorrent as here. Whenever anyone other than the host is playing with a slightly above normal ping, their physical character rubberbands throughout the stage (in an almost [i]'dedicated server'[/i] fashion) even though the game is P2P. You are pushed and pulled without your consent and every time you jump, something or the other makes you teleport back down. Your bullets don't do any damage because the host server thinks none of it is connecting even though you are literally spraying the entire magazine onto an area where you think the enemy is. This gets WAAAY worse when there are multiple small enemies on screen as compared to 1 or 2 high-HP enemies. And since sometimes enemies push you/move your position in the hosts' side, you are teleported into a nearby pit without giving you sufficient time to react and adjust your position accordingly. In the Holodome, the Guardian Gondors and Ophas are annoying as they push you down into the spinning blades even when you use jump pads... (which now that I think of it, are ripped straight out of Portal 2, sound effect and all)

Another curious case of stuttering was on the [spoiler]'Subconscious' map in the Claptrap DLC, and it was getting to a point in which I never saw any map made in Unreal Engine stutter as much as it did period. It was terrible to play the missions that took place on it.[/spoiler]

However, the movement in this game (the low-gravity combined with the slam attack) mad the game's jankiness more bearable, and surprisingly I had a great time during the game's first half. However, when I got to Helios the game becomes a pain in the ass, and it's also when I started to notice the game's problems. First off the section with Helios gets rid of the low-gravity mechanic (except for one section) meaning that I have less options to move around. Second, the gunplay in this game sucks (somehow worse than borderlands 2). The best way I can describe it is by comparing it ti another gearbox game Aliens Colonial Marines, as in your bullets don't always go where you're aiming, and this is worse with laser weapons because I often see my lasers go through enemies and yet they don't deal any damage. An example of why the gunplay sucks is when you get a sidequest that tells you to find a code in one room and quickly enter that code in another room before it cahnges. The problem with that quest is that you can only change the combination by shooting the arrows next to each number because the combination is out of reach, but when I shoot the arrows most my bullets don't do shit, so by the time I had put in the code (despite the game screwing me over), the code had already changed so I got to do that bullshit again. I mention this one specific mission because it made it plain as day that the shooting in this game sucks.
[strike]I'm still gonna try finishing this game like I did with borderlands 2 (despite my problems with both games), but after that I'm only gonna play borderlands 3 for my shooter-looter fix because at least the guns in that game function properly.[/strike] Nevermind.

I finished Borderlands 2 recently after not playing it for oh....  6 years. I fired up The Pre-Sequel and like most people, choose the doppelganger. I enjoyed the story yet the humor was lacking compared to BL2. I only did around 25 side missions and didn't touch the expansions until after beating the main story. I beat the game at 23 hours with the side 25 quests.

After finishing it, it really pumped me up to play BL2 again and not this. The floaty gameplay and uninteresting Boss fights don't scream second play through for me. Still enjoyed playing it.

First thing is that it runs smoothly on Linux with Proton with no tweaking involved.  I couldn't get the free texture pack to install and have read it might be a Linux thing, but I din't really test it that hard and it wasn't a big deal anyway.

It does a lot of new things such as you now fight on a moon with an appropriate mechanic - oxygen.  If you run out you take damage until you get more or die.  You get something to equip much like a shield and enemies have ""bubbles"" on their heads you burst. so they also take damage when in space.  There are various areas where you can refill it.  Nice touch is fire doesn't work in space - you can't set people on fire in it (as expected) and you can put out a fire by running into space.

I thought getting affected by elements was particularly annoying as too often I seemed to get affected after the last enemy was defeated so I was left with no one to kille for second wind.

Since there was low gravity, you can jump a little higher (and boost yourself at the cost of oxygen).  The game was designed around this as there are lots of areas where you have to figure out the best way to jump up to get to an objective.  This jumping also carried over to vehicles as there are lots of areas where you have to jump ravines with your car and will fall to your death. Something that was way too common for me -  I think I died more from failing jumps than i did to getting killed by enemies in the entire series (1, 2, and pre-sequel).

I don't really play Borderlands for story (which I don't think is anything special), but this one seemed even worse than what I noticed in Borderlands 1 & 2).  Also annoying was the fact that characters scream at you for not doing something fast enough... even if you literally just accepted a quest from them and had no time to even begin to do what they asked.

New Review: Yeah i made the old review very quickly, but i do think this is an underrated gem
Maybe it's because everyone praises Borderlands 2 as the Holy Grail, and everyone considers Pre-Sequel that ""You can skip it"" kinda game, but i do think this is the better game if given the choice.
The New Gameplay elements are fantastic, the story is on par with 2, and the characters (Yes i did play as claptrap on my first playthrough) are great, and the shorter length compared to Borderlands 2 makes it much more accesible.

That said there are a couple of thing i didn't really like:
1. Half of the characters are nothing special. Jack, Claptrap and the Cowgirl were my favorite characters, the rest were just kinda there.
2. There's barely anything to do after you complete the game. There's only one extra campaign DLC, and it's super short but i do think it's one of the better ones.
3. This game REALLY benefits from playing with friends....Too bad my friends prefer CS:GO so pfffft

Other than that, a hidden gem, definetly worth it, it's on sale for 10 bucks, you might as well (Just don't play it right after you finish Borderlands 2, or you'll burnout quick)

After the Borderlands 2 soundtrack and the short preview video with Sanctuary that welcomes us at the opening, we come to the character selection screen and the great humor of Borderlands shows itself before the game even starts. (I don't want to write the detail that made me laugh at the character selection screen, you should see it first hand)

Unlike the first two games, the Pre-Sequel has new classes along with new characters. I'm not going to take a quick look at all the classes and talk about their strengths and weaknesses, as I haven't spent a lot of time with them.

[b]But it is useful to take a look at our new characters, albeit a little.[/b]

Athena: We can say that she is the most 'tank' character in the game thanks to her special ability. Introduced as a 'gladiator' at the beginning of the game, Athena uses a special shield. This shield absorbs the energy of direct attacks and when you throw it at the enemy, it both damages itself and the energy it collects.

Willhelm: Remember the giant, yellow robot that came after you blew up the train with Tiny Tina's help in Borderlands 2? Here Willhelm becomes the old version of this friend. Willhelm, who is trying to turn himself into a cyborg to make himself a better warrior, uses two drones with his special ability. While one of them is constantly trying to keep you alive, the other attacks the opponents. In fact, we can say that it is the new version of Wilhelm, Axton and Roland.

Nisha: He's kind of a berserker. When Nisha, a former bandit and then got bored of it and started bandit hunting for fun and profit, uses her Showdown ability to upgrade all her weapon characteristics and automatically locks onto enemies and attacks with 100% accuracy.

Claptrap: aka Fragtrap. He is perhaps the most enjoyable character in the game. Unlike the other three classes, Claptrap doesn't specialize in anything other than talking all the time. When Claptrap uses his special ability, vaulthunter.exe, he analyzes the situation he is in and uses an ability accordingly. By the way, the abilities that Claptrap uses are not the abilities of the new characters, but the abilities of the old characters. When you use vaulthunter.exe with Claptrap, you can also have an ax in your hand to jump on your opponents, you can also throw a turret like Axton's. Get ready for surprises and laughter.

We start the game by coming out of a wreck again. This time we are a Vault Hunter recruited by Hyperion and Jack, against whom we fought before. Compared to the previous game, Jack gives us goosebumps with his sane, even trying to help appearance.
After reluctantly saving Jack from our enemies, we can say that the game starts slowly. Because it is only the music and low gravity that can break the atmosphere of Borderlands 2, which is the whole game.
Jack saves us and sends us to Pandora's moon Elpis. As soon as we land on the surface of Elpis, we meet the low gravity and Oz capsules, the new addition to the game.
Because there is no or very sparse atmosphere on the Elpis surface, we need these capsules to breathe. We use oz capsules not only for breathing but also for movement. The low gravity atmosphere of Elpis allows you to make higher and longer jumps when you jump. When you press the jump button while in the air, you can throw yourself forward or you can press the tilt button to land suddenly and stun your enemies by creating a jolt around you.
This feature, which you don't mind too much at first, turns into a very fun job when you get used to it, and allows you to make strategic moves or find great sniper positions during combat.
New laser weapons, features such as freezing your enemies and a tool called Stingray have been added to the game. We can say that the Stingray is a motorcycle that can float in the air and can make vertical jumps.
The atmosphere of the closed/non-Oz areas in the game, the menus, Badass ranks and the vendors you can buy items are exactly the same as Borderlands 2. In order to feel the difference of Pre-Sequel, you have to go out to open areas.
I can say Jack and Claptrap are the most crucial things in the Pre-Sequel or the things that make the game unique.
It was really interesting and nice to see how the sane and heroic personality of Jack, who appears in the game, gradually changes and turns into an old psychopathic Jack.
Claptrap, on the other hand, is a subject in itself and I think a special article should be written for it. Claptrap's useless conversations, non-funny jokes and great (!) intelligence are always with you with the playable character, and most of the time you can't hit the target because of laughter.

[b]Pros[/b]
 - Playing with Claptrap
- new classes
- low gravity
- Jack's story
- Borderlands' great sense of humor

[b]Cons[/b]
- Too close to Borderlands 2
- It did not bring any tangible innovation to the series.

[h1]Decision[/h1]
Although the Pre-Sequel may not seem like a Borderlands 2 imitation in many respects, one should not be fooled by this. The interaction of the new characters in the game with the story, the fact that Claptrap is a playable character and the usual great Borderlands humor are details that should be experienced especially for the followers of the series. Pre-Sequel may not sound very binding or enjoyable when you play it alone. But when you play co-op with your friends, everything changes and you can find yourself in a great fun. If you are a Borderlands follower the Pre-Sequel will give you what you expect from Borderlands.

Seems like they've fixed the issue that didn't allow players to play together. All in all, I'd have to say, this is my favorite modern Borderlands. The game itself is padded, because the game was originally supposed to be a DLC for Borderlands 2 (yay, exactly what we all needed, another DLC for a game that has too many DLCs). But they had to instead flesh the game out enough to make it a whole game. That can be felt quite a bit at quite a bit of places.

That out of the way though, there are a lot of fun things that this DLC has to offer, and all in all, I really like this game. Ever since I played through Borderlands 1 back when it came out, I wanted Cryo weapons, that's here in this game. They got rid of Slag, which is amazing. All in all, expect Borderlands 2, but with Space, and Aussies. I think they really did a good one with the atmosphere here, making it really feel like a different place when compared to that of Pandora (by making everybody an Aussie).

To me it doesnt just feel like a dlc like how some criticism will say, due to the differences and length of the story. There is a lack of side missions compared to other borderlands entries possibly and lack of raid bosses but this was due to the fact that production was under means. Seeing Jack go bad is already a reason that i really enjoyed this game, He is the best video game villian I've personally seen in the games I've played at least. yes it plays just like bl2 but the differences make it stand out in a different way. I almost feel like no one talks about this game, people are missing out. very fresh. I've almost played all borderlands games fully and i LOVE all of them for different reasons. 2 is my favorite though probably if I had to pick, so TPS definitely in certain areas i like just as much (still doesnt compare tho), its enjoyable and has certain game mechanics that are extremely fun. Claptastic voyage DLC  is so on point. favorite BL dlc so far other than pirates booty. The claptrap song had me GEEKING. Life without claptrap is a joke, such a lovely robot. best song ever. Also seeing the entire claptrap population get merked is kinda equally sad and funny. The color palette and atmosphere, story progression/ areas to explore and their coexistence, as well as being different but similar as with all other borderlands games this does what it needs to achieve. as well as having interesting new loot (yes some is recycled from bl2 i know which is annoying but whatever) and fun new mobs &bosses (lack of raid bosses tho, but shadow trap is SO FUN and hard)  9.4/10 (maybe im generous) I took off mostly for pacing being slow in the first quarter, and LACK of content and raid bosses/ new legendaries that werent from bl2. but this was due to the lack of hype for the game which you cant control. I understand that production inevitably controls art forms in the real world, rather than the means of production.

It's funny. When I got in late with BL2, I wrote in my review that I wish I would have gotten it at release instead of many years later due to how much of an awesome and fun game it was. I even wrote down that when and if BL3 drops, I'll pick it up day one.

But then the Epic Games Store exclusivity happened, and I vowed not to purchase BL3 even when it came to Steam like a year later. I won't be buying BL3 until it's super low on sale with all of its DLC. They can kiss my bass after pulling that nonsense.

So instead, I picked up the Pre-Sequel and finished it from beginning to end with a friend, and I felt that same feeling I did when I first played BL2. Why didn't I play this as soon as it came out, or when I first finished BL2? I have no idea. It's such a good game. It felt a lot shorter compared to BL2, but I still enjoyed my time with it.

First negative is the glitching. Maybe some people don't get this problem but I played with someone and a jump-pad glitched them so they were offset and we had to quit. They could see themselves stuck in a corner whereas i could see them aimlessly running around the surface. We had jumps in the car that sometimes just wouldn't work even fully boosted, random de-sync/crashes, and once a car exploded because it nudged a rock.

Second is the dogshit humor. Most of it relies on ""look how australian we are"",  like yeah theres memes about australia but its not THAT funny.  Some parts like claptrap randomly mentioning ""staging a revolution"" are really lazy ham-fisted references to make people say ""omg they mentioned that thing from another game"" because they couldnt find a way to organically bring it up in dialogue. 

Third is the terrible voice acting/dialogue. It was shit in general but certain characters that shared a voice actor (janey/cybil for example) just didnt sound any different at all. 


The mild pros are the oxygen system was okayish, the boost-jump and slam were nice to use.

Moxxi ""Balloon Tits"" without make up
Can play as Cl4p Trap and Handsome Jack
Your character can talk 
New play style
More cute girl characters
Moonstone easy to find
You can balance all skill build

Cons:
Not as hardcore or crazy as Borderlands 2
Small map 
Short story 
Less guns
Less gear
Less health (By this i mean level 70 can only get like 72k hp intead of like 7.2m hp)
Less guns damage
Some bugs and glitch 
That Roland ""Allergic to smiling"" i know him but i don't like him
More Cl4p Trap unit ""Non-stop annoying stupid robots"" almost everywhere
Moonstone doesn't look that special as eridium

Overall: it's a pre sequel so short story, small map make sense 
Feel like alien games still good
Some of it's cons I'm just joking

Outside of the low-gravity environments that allow for some of the new mechanics to shine most of the level design before the final chapters feels kind of samey and uninspired.

The combat is fast and satisfying, but the game is lacking in a few other areas- especially pacing issues the unnecessary backtracking grind.

Not a bad entry to the franchise, but I can see why this one is not as beloved or replayed as 2.

1) The low-gravity gimmick gets really old really fast. It makes movement difficult and tedious, especially when swapping between this game and games which have normal gravity. Having to jump 10 times to reach *just the right spot* five meters up a wall to stick a poster (as a mission goal) is not fun, it's just frustrating, especially when...

2) i cannot tolerate (HATE *HATE* **HATE**) timers on in-game missions and this game effectively adds a timer to *everything* via its quickly-depleting oxygen tank. That flat-out ruins the game for me. i could, in time, get over point (1), but this one is an absolute experience-killer for me.

Honestly, I don't have the slightest idea why people seemed to hate this one so much. The oz kits were a fun mechanic but never killed me, the new laser weapons were a blast, and I personally found the jokes hilarious. Sure, the humor was [i]different[/i] on account of being made by 2K Australia, but... I thought it was funny. It still felt like Borderlands.

I liked the story and thought it did a decent job at following continuity. It had flaws here and there, but that's pretty standard for these games. It had the best playable characters, referring to the [i]character[/i] part, with narrative dialog actually varying depending on the vault hunter. Something the next installment scrapped for some bizarre reason.

It only got one campaign DLC due to 2K Aussie getting shut down, but that DLC rocked so hard.

now that i'm living in australia, some of its jokes, names and overall humor make sense and it's nice to see that the developers added them, gives the game some soul. but everything else is contentious to have any sort of positive arguments on my side. the space theme makes the game slow, bordering a walking simulator in some parts. backtracking is constant. enemies are the same for the rest of the game after you play the first hour of it (ignoring the end part which is even worse somehow). the loot is never satisfying (at least on a first playthrough, i wouldn't be surprised if they only drop the good stuff after you grind for it as usual). sigh, anyway.

Sure the game looks and plays like Borderlands 2 but the constant travelling, the backtracking is more than enough to make the game feel like a chore to play. It's a lesson in how bad mission structure and level design can really hamper the core gameplay. Its flaws are also more pronounced due to being a 2014 game. Gunplay feels stiff, UI is clunky, your character not being able to sprint slide. I might be able to look past those issues in Borderlands 2 because that game was released in 2012. For a 2014 game though, considering what its contemporaries at the time brought to the FPS genre, it's unacceptable and the game was clearly constrained by the PS3/X360 era of video games.

I don't think the game is straight up bad, As of writing this, halfway into 2021, I'm having a harder time understanding why this game needed to exist. It feels like it could have been a DLC, but instead, the whole experience feels padded and stretched out with mindnumbling backtracking and fetch quests.

the game doesn't give you the ability to level up properly, im currently level 20 but entering into the retaking of helios section of the game i was a level 17 fighting enemies that eventually went on to be level 23. i had no problem beating them because ive dumped a few hours into other borderlands game but if this were my first experence with borderlands id quit the game like i originally did with BL2. the thing is this is after doing litterly every side quest in concordia which is supposed to be the equivalent of sanctuary which i still havent cleared all the side quests of on my maya save file. not only does the story line not give you enough levels to fight through the story line itself the main area where all the shops and characters are don't either. this requires you to either throw your body at the story line over and over until you get lucky enough to win or actively roam the maps to find side quests to fill a sliver of your exp bar which as a person who just likes to run the story line then do side quest later isn't very fun in my opinion.

the second gripe i have is that despite the game a full release and a standalone game the story line feels like a DLC. ive only sunk 6 hours into the game so far which was one night of gaming and ive already made it the the beginning of the end. the story really needs more substance to it whether that be a boss or more, more could of been done with felicity for example or the lost legion could of sent more bosses other than the two they do send. 

the game is extremely fun though and if you've played BL2 before and really enjoyed it like me id suggest grabbing this game to give a playthrough. it provides alot of lore to the world and helps kill the time.

Many people complain about the O2 system, which in my opinion does not have any drawbacks as it is rare to die from lack of O2. As a trade off, you get the boost jump which is both fun and really tactical. The movement is so much better than that of BL2, and it is fun to fly and slam enemies.

For weapons, yes, they are mostly reused from BL2. Is it bad? I don't think so. They are still good, and even better compared to its BL2 counterpart which is due to the game's better balance, so that weapons which were discouraged in BL2 UVHM are actually really viable in TPS's UVHM. The introduction of Cryo is really nice as it is not something everyone must has in later game, instead it is an element designed to make the game easier. Unlike slag, you dont need to always equip a Cryo weapon in UVHM thanks to much better balance and actually a ""hard mode"", rather than ridiculous x4 health pool of all enemies.

The story explains many plot holes in BL2: Jack's backstory, his rise to power, his relationship with Moxxi, his hatred for the 4 original VH and even Claptrap. The story also feels sadder as it centers around betrayal, especially what happened to Jack and Claptrap. 

The classes are more unique than BL1 and 2. There's no the typical sentry/turret, siren or sniper. In TPS we have a Botmaster some sort, a defensive based class, an aimbot class and FragTrap. They are unique, they are new and especially much more fun to play as.

My only real complain is: Australians in space?

The campaign is short and consists mostly of running from place to place fighting bandits and soldiers who have stupidly accurate aim and will knock off your shield and health with only two or three shots if they are just one level higher than you. There aren't many bosses and pretty much all of the sidequests are busywork meant to pad out the game and give you extra experience so that you can level up high enough to match the main campaign's level.
The writing is chock full of retcons and poorly thought out character motivations. Lilith blames Athena for Roland's death when it's just as much her fault for not killing Jack when she had the chance, for example. But you don't play Borderlands for the writing.

Recent update has also made the game total garbage.  I drop s**ts that better than this. Now suddenly all Fight for Life moments last 2 seconds, then you dead. Boss fights are so widely varied, that you could be just starting out, at level 5 or 6, and the boss will be at level 70, which means you die on the first hit.   2k Games has abandoned all of their titles, for the newest hot piece of garbage, Wonderland.

The oxygen management is a cool idea along with the gravity butt slam on paper, however it doesn't change combat for the better. Fire is indirectly nerfed because you need to be in an oxygen bubble or area for fire to actually ignite otherwise it'll do piss poor damage. On the other hand, the new element Cryo is pretty damn sick because it helped against enemies who keep running away and lets them take even more damage when frozen. The laser guns sound cool as well, they're pretty much just smgs with barely any recoil and a longer(?) range except that they consume a bit too much ammo.

In terms of content, the story is basically there to fill in most of plot holes from the previous games (Borderlands 1 & 2) specifically about Jack's backstory and his relationships with other titular characters in the series. I'd say that the plot is pretty damn good compared to Borderlands 3, [spoiler]which pretty much retconned this plot and had Aurelia turn into a bitch boss[/spoiler].

Interesting story, cool characters , environments of the game are nice. 
Aurelia  is badass, her action skill is the best (because finds enemies even they are in cover). Other vault hunters are cool too. 
Claptrap dlc is great.
The best thing for me that vault hunters have almost what to say in many situations or missions (on Borderlands 2 vault hunters said something only on dlc something interesting, on main game haven't said anything at all on missions). 
So grab this game and enoy.

The DLC are pretty great, story is good and seeing Jack before the events of 2 is fun and interesting, end game is where this instalment really struggles, if you truly are looking to do all the end game content there isn't much for you, you will be farming the same boss and chucking his weapon into the grinder hoping you get what you need, it suffers a lot like BL3 in that almost nothing had dedicated drops and just had to farm the same boss over and over.

You will play as a group of Vault Hunters that Jack hired to help him save the world! (Pandora) Some of them you might already know, such as Nisha or Wilhelm. You follow Handsome Jack on his quest to be the hero and defeat the Lost Legion led by Colonel Tungsteena ZARPEDOOOOON! 

Playing through the story using the new additions as Elpis' low gravity and laser guns you will come to realize what a monster you were in Borderlands 2 and you destined Pandora to an endless cycle of violence, death and misery and stopped the only man... nay, HERO! who might have turned things around and that Lilith and her merry band of child killing psychopats were the reason Handsome Jack became who he was. And it was the pain and betrayal they inflicted upon him made him go a bit far in his dream to civilize Pandora and bring peace and order to the hostile planet.

After you finish this game, you will get a daunting feeling of regret everytime you think back to the ending of Borderlands 2 and Jack's final words and only then you realize that you truly and absolutely chose the wrong side in this story.


For serious now:
Good stuff:
- Laser Guns
- Low Gravity
- Low Gravity Super Slams
- More Handsome Jack

Not so good stuff:
- Game is shorter
- Ending feels rushed
- No worthwhile DLC's (Claptastic Voyage is the only story DLC, others are arenas and pretty bad ones at that)

Bad stuff:
- It's short
- Worth only on sale (I got Borderlands 2 and PreSequel with all DLC's pack for pretty cheap)


All and all, I'd recommend this for the fans of the series and Handsome Jack. Get the Borderlands 2 first and play that.

basically every new thing they added to the game from borderlands 2 was a downgrade from it
this game has significantly more glitches/less polish than borderlands 2
where for example it wasn't uncommon to see enemies phase through solid objects, randomly have flat ground that requires jumping over an invisible little bump, see walls that are not aligned correctly letting you see through the cracks where no level design was made, I had a few enemies unaggro against me during fights and though rarer sometimes I swear I had bad hit registration

was the game atrocious..... no
but basically if you haven't played borderlands play borderlands 2 instead and if you decided that you really liked it and want a worse dlc type of addon to that experience then you can also buy this game

basically I was wondering why borderlands 2 got so much praise while the pre sequel got so little attention from reviews and the reason is that because it is just an ok game while borderlands 2 was great",1629531710,1629531710,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TPS in general is much faster paced in its gameplay, and that alone gets a win from me.

The said, even though I do love the series, this game is not without a few flaws. 

One. The Oxygen system is an annoying gimmick that rarely punishes you since there are so many air spots for you to breath in.  Even if you run out of air, if you have a big enough health pool you can literally spend minutes standing in one place without fear of dying.  Not including combat scenarios. 

two. Kinda wish we had more to look at than the moon.  Borderlands 2 had you go from place to place with unique looking areas and crazy new people to talk to.  This version just has the moon. .  and more moon stuff.  oh, look a big building to walk through, oh look, a giant factory!  Only two places give you some unique vibes like the Helios space station or the vault door itself.  Nothing else to write home too.

three. The grinder system isn't that great. I thought it would be more fun, but the recipe system is pretty simple once you look it up. But I rarely use it, since I normally just sell my guns and move on, even with the moonstone boost your guns get from it. I generally don't see much difference in performance. 

four. The story kinda drags on a little too long in the finale, once Jack loses his collective shit. I was just ready to be done with this game move on to something else. 

That's really all I can think at the moment, but other than these issues. I still find myself buying this game again on Steam.

You play as one of Athena's team working for Jack before he became Handsome Jack. Colonel Zarpadone has taken over Hyperion. You and Jack need to retake control of the Hyperion. Playing through the game, you will unveil parts of the buildup towards Borderlands 2. The main objective of the game is to level up, kill monsters and bosses, collect loot, rinse and repeat.

Gameplay-wise, it's a First-Person-Shooter. Shoot, level up, loot, rinse and repeat. As long as your level is higher than the creeps, you win the battle. If you're significantly lower, go do stupid grinding to level up and win. 

I played as Claptrap. This was a really lucky choice as I didn't know there was an oxygen mechanic. You play mostly on a moon and in space. If you run out of oxygen, you start to lose health points rapidly. If you are Claptrap i.e. a robot, you don't need to worry about oxygen.
The same oxygen is also used for boosting your jump and can only be refilled in atmosphere.

If you fight and kill the Sentinel at the end, you get to play the inside of Claptrap. It's meant to be an additional stage after Sentinel but it's so draggy. You have to access Deck 13.5 to trigger it.

Conclusion, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal is so grindy. I couldn't play any further once I got to the inside of Claptrap. The overall world design is extremely disjointed. You have bits and pieces of weird parts that don't make sense. 

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Simple to Play
Jump, point and shoot.

2. Decent Amount of Stuff
I thought killing Colonel Zarpadone was the end but no, there's the Sentinel. It will backfire later with Claptrap

3. Low Gravity
sv_gravity 0.3 is a good idea. Keep it. Traverse the map so much faster. 

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. So Repetitive, It's Boring
The gameplay just grinds on any positive emotions I had for the game. Just be a higher level with high level weapons and you win the bosses. Just grind to victory, it's so boring. The general phase is shoot, level, loot, rinse and repeat.

2. Half-assed Combat Design
The bosses just do the same thing over and over again with different colours. E.g. Sentinel battle part 2, Lightning, Corrosive, Armour. All of the faces do the same action, floor damage with floating rocks, blackhole ball, explosion floor, etc

3. Smash Pads
Copy, paste, rotate 360? Why are there smash pads that explode in random locations?

4. No World Building
It's just randomly outsourced maps. There's no world that they built. E.g. Random Lovecraftian creatures like the Shuggarath. It's disjointed. Like combining horror mental creatures into sci-fi and steampunk. 

5. Dead World
Yea, it's just full of lamp posts. The world is really boring. Concordia is really boring. It looks like the concept for Mad Max. On top of a tower.

6. Vehicles Don't Have Space to Play
You don't have huge flat land to drive about. There's pitfalls and random buildings in the middle of nowhere in space.

7. Stupid Side Quests in the Main Mission
You get to Hyperion, it's filled with Lost Legion. You have to take over ASAP and..... side quests on Hyperion. WTF? 

[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]
1. Concept of Claptrap's Insides
Looked good at the start but the random glitches and fragmented memories. OMG.

[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]
1. Better World Design
Since Borderlands 3 is due by 13 September 2019, I think there's nothing much you can do in such a short time, but could you work on a Citadel? *cough* Titanfall

2. MMO Gunner
You have dedicated servers. Why not send players into an MMOG from the start of the game? Players will enter a central city and play with other players. It will help reduce the extreme grindiness. *cough* Destiny

3. AI Help
At the very least, could you give us the option to add AI as a meat shield?

4. Huge Flat Map Solely for Vehicle Combat
Stingray and Buggy are extremely limited. I know you have a sand skiff. Please add that into BDL 3. Make a giant snake monster that burrows in and out of the sand. Then you drive around avoiding its attacks and shooting the sand monster in its weak spots. Like those arcade shooters, Time Crisis or Resident Evil. Vehicle dies, you die. You don't get the luxury of running around on that map.

5. Train Fights
Moving train, time limit. Start from the back and work your way to the engine. Engine compartment has a boss. I have a few twist and turns to add but I'll see if you do it.

6. Change The World as The Game Progresses
Change the environment, bring new characters to Concordia. E.g. Spring was brought to Concordia. Bring Pickle, then Torque, then Marcus Munitions, etc. You already have Nina.

7. Make A Torque Dispenser
Only Marcus Munitions the whole game? Give Torque his Explodie dispenser. 

8. Make a Pickle Dispenser
Shields, special grenades and what-not

9. Claptrap Dispenser
Now, a dispenser that dispenses robots. Hmmmm....

10. Quests
Make a quest to find all the Torque/Pickle Dispensers in the game",1561058780,1629124611,False,0,0,0.367156177759170532,0,True,False,False

And since I obtained this stupid thing in a bundle, I've had it staring at me from my library of Steam games. If you're looking for a sunshiny disposition to accompany this review, you're barking up the wrong tree.

As a gamer, I am specifically drawn to story elements (for the most part). If a game doesn't offer boundless sandbox building capabilities, it needs to have a narrative that draws the player in and immerses you in the world. The Borderlands series doesn't have that. It's shiny on the outside, and utterly hollow. Once you strip away the game-play mechanics, there is absolutely nothing that this game offers. There's little in terms of story, and what story remains can be summarized in one sentence: One nut-job tries to destroy a moon as the player helps a different nut-job save the moon before nut-job number two becomes the Borderlands 2 villain. That's it. There's no nuance to it. It's drawn out with ornate but ultimately tedious set-dressing and meaningless obstacles. That's all there is.

I'm not saying that you might not enjoy this series, but I'm at the very least going to be honest about it.

 It tells the backstory leading up to Borderlands the earlier Borderlands. 

Overall if you are familiar with the Borderlands franchise, well it follow the formula to a T. You pick a class, you shoot things, you get loot, you shoot more things, there's some kind of story in there but really that's not what you came for anyways. 

The biggest twist between this one and the others is that this one seems Aussie made with many Aussie accents, and what I would guess is Aussie humor. This is good or bad depending how much you enjoy such Aussie humor. Me? I can take or leave it depending so I found it at times great and some times terrible. It seemed the longer the game went the worse it got. 

Also a big change from all the other games is that the game takes place in space. In space areas you can just very high and floaty. You also get and have to manage an oxygen supply, but honestly it's really only a factor in the early parts of the game. Eventually you get so much oxygen dropping form killing enemies that it really does not become much of an issue. Both of these mechanics are a downgrade in your experience in every way.

The game is somewhat short at ~15 hours to complete, but toward the mid and late game I didn't do that many side missions and pushed through somewhat under-leveled. The side missions seemed mostly forgettable.

This game does have some really interesting classes though which I thought where interesting. I played though as a body double of Hansom Jack for example, but there is a Clap Trap wizard class that I thought was pretty interesting too.

When I compare this game to others in the series it seems like a very mediocre game. Don't get me wrong it was still enjoyable but not really memorable in any way. If you enjoy any of the other games in the franchise then you should give it a go.",1628209660,1628209660,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Up to a certain point it's all fine and dandy but there comes a point where you realize you are playing a running simulator, rather than what you'd expect from a Borderlands game. The missions become a real chore.

We're gonna need that, go pick it up''. Which I would have much less of a problem if most of the maps didn't look the same. I was really hyped to play Borderlands in space, only to be let down by the poor map design.

It feels like 2k Australia tried to stretch the missions out as far as possible. Also, I didn't give zero sh**s about the characters. I just wanted them to shut up so I could go on about my day. 

I thought the grinder would be a welcome addition but it kinda ruins co op gameplay in my opinion because everybody wants weapons they can grind. Because hey ''3 blues equal a purple''. It's not like in BL2 where if a blue dropped and nobody needed it, it wouldn't matter who gets it.

STORY/LORE - 8/10

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is great for the sole fact that you get to finally find out what caused all the events of the Borderlands franchise, especially around Handsome Jack and Claptrap. I’m not going to lie, they’re both hilarious and just to see how they became what they are is more than enough for wanting to play this game. It’s basically a continuation of Borderlands 2 but in my opinion, there really was no need to make another brand new game that’s a pre-sequel to the first two games of the franchise at that point in time.

This could have been a mega huge DLC at $30 and put into Borderlands 2 after all the other DLC was done as a final DLC, then repackaged as “Borderlands 2: The Complete Edition” or something along those lines. Either way, the story is good as you’ll meet some familiar faces and connect the dots to why things happened in Borderlands 1 & 2.

GAMEPLAY - 7/10

LASERS!!! All jokes aside, the laser weapons in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel are amazing and a ton of fun to use. The only problem is, you tend to not get them until you’re halfway if not almost done with the game. You start out with pretty much the same weapons in Borderlands 2 and nothing really fun or big comes along until much later down the road. Of course, it all depends on people’s games since it’s a looter shooter/randomized loot kind of experience so maybe it just was that case for me. Perhaps others get some fun weapons in the beginning and go from there but unfortunately, that wasn’t the case for me.

The biggest letdown to the gameplay was the loot that dropped from bosses. You’d expect some pretty insanely unique weapons that let you rip through enemies but nope, I didn’t get any cool weapons until I was nearly done with the game. Besides that, the boss fights are pretty linear, not all that challenging, and it’s a breeze to get through Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. This furthers my opinion that this really should have just been added to Borderlands 2, there isn’t anything new to experience here except the ultra-fun laser weapons and the campaign.

I also absolutely hated the mechanic of fighting in space and needing to get oxygen all the time until you found better oxygen items to basically hold your breath as you explored and fought enemies. Sure, oxygen canisters were dropped by every single enemy in the game but I felt this was an unnecessary part of this game. This was beyond annoying as one of the big features of Borderlands is exploring, looting, and killing. Not exploring, looting, killing, and trying to find “breathing areas” to reset your oxygen because it slowly eats away at your health and will kill you if you let it go on long enough. I get that this is in space and everything but it was annoying to have something else to keep track of as you played the game.

GRAPHICS - 10/10

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel came out in 2014 and still holds up to this very day. The graphics are nice, level design is good, and all the details to some awesome looking weapons are great. It’s Borderlands and well, the cartoony graphics that is a signature staple of this gaming franchise continues to get the job done.

SOUNDTRACK - 7/10

I didn’t like the soundtrack all that much in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel as it’s a bit generic. It has that spooky space feeling to things that I guess was designed to bring that kind of immersion to the game. Either way, whenever you got into fights or boss fights, it did change but eh, nothing all that epic or fun. This would have been a 6/10 in my book if not for the Claptrap song in the final DLC of this game, that alone bumped it up to a 7/10!

MULTIPLAYER - N/A

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is an old video game and nobody is playing this at all. I’m sure you might see a few people jumping in but the multiplayer functionality is a hot mess and has a ton of problems trying to connect with others online. If you’re looking to get any of the co-op Steam Achievements or anything involving multiplayer, your best bet is to get some friends to jump in with you that are specifically looking to go through this game and focus on playing together at the same time progressing. If not, sorry, this will be a single-player experience from beginning to end.

FINAL SCORE - 7/10

Overall, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was a fun experience but basically a continuation of Borderlands 2 just done to fill in the storyline gaps. There isn’t anything groundbreaking or all that new except obviously the tons of new weapons you can use with an emphasis on laser weapons. Let me tell you, burning through waves of enemies with laser weapons was a lot of fun and that was the biggest highlight of the game for me.

The bosses are easy but don’t drop any extraordinary loot as in Borderlands 1 & 2 with the exception of two or three tops that I can remember. The characters are fun, and well, Handsome Jack and Claptrap stole the show. The banter between these two, especially in the DLC was hilarious to go through. I still feel that Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel would have been better off as a massive DLC for Borderlands 2 but that’s just me. Either way, if you love the Borderlands franchise as much as I do, I highly recommend playing this game just to continue the story and be kept in the loop as the franchise currently continues on in future video games and even an upcoming live-action movie. I hope we get to see Claptrap dance in real life...",1627422896,1627422896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Get your Greed on with endless Gun Loot.. this time in a zero gravity space setting.

You will have to manage oxygen and traversing large rough landscapes, I personally was not as big of a fan with the Zero Gs, I loved the first and second borderlands a lot more.

Getting a great sniper rilfe will help quiet a bit in the big wide open areas

Still a great game with a seriously hard end boss, I played as handsome Jack and really enjoyed his character Arch.

Overall the NPCs and towns you visit just seem like they are missing the same charm as the first two games.

There definitely should have been more fast-travel stations (especially on Helios) because all the running around makes things take longer than they should, which is unfortunate considering the devs seemed to be avoiding that. For example, those god-awful timed side missions all over the place in BL2 are FAR fewer in the Pre-Sequel! The oxygen, jump pad, slam, low-gravity and cryo mechanics are incredibly fun and innovative for the franchise.

Even though I see many deem it as a ""black sheep"" of the series in many ways.

I think some highlight features for me would be the story, Vault hunters, and setting.
Seeing the origins of Handsome Jack, and how he became the villain in Borderlands 2 was really neat.
And as for the Vault Hunters; I just found their playstyles and skilltrees more fun to use than in Borderlands 2. Even though I think 2 had better Action Skills. And while yes, the Pre-Sequel's action skills are more simple overall, I felt like there was a lot more going on in their skilltrees that made many of the classes more fun to play overall. (My personal favorites being the Doppelganger and Baroness classes.)

And as for setting: while I love the wasteland setting of Borderlands 2 (Especially the beginning with the icy tundras), I absolutely love the space aesthetic, and it also gives some unique additions to th gameplay I like. Such as the low gravity, jump boost/slam abilities with the Oz Kits, and the differences of atmospheres with and without oxygen.

So...yeah. I really love the game. And while it's not as big as games like Borderlands 2 and 3, I actually kinda prefer the more compact nature the game has.

(Also on another side-note: Cryo element is super fun. And that alone is a big plus in comparison to Borderlands 2 for me.)",1627090245,1627090245,True,1,0,0.493716329336166382,0,True,False,False

-The balance of guns and damage and how good enemies are is slightly above average
- Depending on your sense of humor, the game can provide comedic relief

-Side quests can be obnoxiously long
-Some characters are just so annoying that it can make you depressed
-Game can be really quick in a co op with experienced borderlands players or just good players in general

Being able to interact with Handsome Jack (just Jack in this game) more is great. His character is that jerk that everyone loves. What I like about this game is that it doesn't just feel like Borderlands 2 with different environments and storylines. The additional of the Oz kits means you have to not only think about oxygen deposits, stations, etc. but it also adds the function of being able to glide and use your remaining oxygen to perform a melee attack that can have elemental damage depending on what kit you have equipped. There are plenty of wonderful NPCs to interact with and fun new classes/characters to experiment with. The fact that there is a doppelganger class of Jack and a type of ClapTrap to use means that there is so many ways to experience the story and game. Great for varying play styles and replay value since the characters have different ways they react to dialogue in the game. Just like the 2nd this one has missions to play after you beat the main game and a new game plus which is great for an extra challenge as well as a way to beef up your character to take on any side missions/expansion missions.

I wanna point out that I am a huge fan of Borderlands series, so my opinion might not be so objectiv as I wanted, but I will try my best.

[u] Gameplay: [/u]
 This game runs on the same engine as BL 2 with some changes, for example lower gravity. I dont know why, but lot of people tends to hate on low gravity, but I really like it actually. But thats personal preference right?
We got some new weapon types which are really fun to use, we got oxygen which could get a little anoying and we got slams and something like a double jump/glide thingy, Big plus for me are the playable characters. They all are well-known characters either from the past or the future. Timothy and Aurelia was in BL3, we got Athena from BL1 and Tales, Wilhelm and Nisha from BL2 and of course Claptrap. Like tell me this isnt one of the best sets of characters ever? And the best thing here are the skills. There are so many different and unique skills, that I was really mind-blowned how deep the skills trees are. So guys, in short, the gameplay is good, its almost like BL2. 

[u] Story: [/u]
Story in Borderlands Pre-Sequel is probably the strongest part here. Atleast if you love Jack as much as me, because this is story about him, the story about how he became the greatest villian of all time. You are a victim of his fall, you see those moments that really changed him and made him who he was in BL2. And I really like that. Its just perfect prequel and sequel, which is actually funny. For me the story is really good, the stronger part of this game.  

[u] Final thoughts: [/u]
I wanted to make this review, because I really think this game is underrated. It has its downsides, but if you love this series, if you love Jack, just play it. Lots of people probably got this in Handsome collection, so atleast give it a try. I really struggled, but now I am finally finishing this and I am happy, because its great game. After BL3, its really refreshing and the story does not suck. The last thing I wanna do is write down pros and cons so you can have a nice recap. So I hope I encouraged you to try this game, you will not regret. Hope you have a nice day and see ya around kiddos! 

[u] Pros: [/u]
-BL2 gameplay.
-Good story.
-IDK how is the price but its included in Handsome Collection and I think its pretty cheap.
-16,145,310 guns.
-Handsome Jack
-Handsome Jack
-Handsome Jack

[u] Cons: [/u]
-Pretty old, some could not like the graphics right zoomers? (not me thou)
-Some bugs, really didnt encouter almost any in my playthrought. But BL is known for exploits and bugs.
-I dont really have anything. Buy it

I do not like this game. I'm not saying it has no redeeming qualities, as the laser guns, Oz kits, low gravity and actions skills are good, and story is better than 3's, The downside are that, unless you're fine dying to bosses higher, or hell, equal level to you, you're going to not be happy. I did somehow manage to complete the game and it's dlc a while back, but I did die many times fighting the bosses. Playing it again more recently only shows why I uninstalled it. Death is to be expected, and while I know I am not a god, I do often get frustrated at the fact that I often go down, due to status effects, with enemies either far away behind cover, or there being no enemies at all. As well, the economy of this game is annoying, as it's cheaper to die and respawn with full health than buy health boost from vending machines, since the spawn rate for health boosts from supply chest, barrels and other sources. 

I really want to like this game, since it does attempt to make a name from itself from Borderlands 2. But it just makes itself feel like a chore with it's boss battles and many deaths that will most often slow you down. If you're buying it as a part of the handsome collection, that's fine. but if you're going to buy it on it's own, I would advice you to reconsider.",1625242039,1625242194,False,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,True,False

As the crowd that originally played the first one gets older, the audience for Borderlands in general seems to get younger each iteration--that seems to show with the overall design/plot/dialogue of the game. The story is painstakingly long and drawn out, nothing really hits the original humor of the first one, and as with many modern games, there is a lot of wokeness to overcome to enjoy (or to prevent enjoying) any of the actual characters. Speaking of, if your main character is the Baroness--first thing you need to do is to find the dialogue volume knob and crank that shit all the way to the left. The quests in this game follow an annoying format: find the thing, wait for a few minutes of dialogue to progress, put the thing somewhere, rotate the thing, stack the thing on top of something else, listen to more dialogue, observe the thing, dialogue, touch the thing again, dialogue... Pretty annoying--especially because you can't skip dialogue to progress the quest faster. 

On the flip side I think this is still a few tiers above the second one which I thought was a chore to play. Although this one lacks the charm that the first one had in RPG terms (character leveling is not as exciting and loot in general is horribly bland--especially if you are sitting on any more than like 30 golden keys), the guns themselves aren't as weird and wonky as they are in the second one, and some of them are even fun to use. The environment is a... breath of fresh air... so to speak. The addition of the whole space environment thing led to some cool mechanics, double jumping, new vehicles that served somewhat of a purpose--all of which I thought was welcome. Also, I thought adding cold as an element was much more enjoyable than slag. The grinder utility is a neat idea, and a third type of currency that can be used for upgrading storage is ok. I still miss rescuing clap-traps for inventory expansion, but it is fair to allow the player decide what they want to focus on in terms of storage.",1624743115,1624743198,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Finally, I managed to master all the parts of the legendary Borderlands and now I'm ready to express my opinion about this wonderful series. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a kind of prologue to the second part. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a wonderful experience of exploring a mysterious and unexplored area-a satellite of the Earth-the Moon.

The main part

At first glance, most would not have believed that this is Borderlands, if not for the original and easily recognizable drawing. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a rather dubious part of the great Borderlands series, since it is short and there is no Legendary Pandora familiar to players in it. On the other hand, this part brought a lot of new and interesting mechanics, a new gaming experience in the Borderlands series.

Personal notes

DLC is the weak side of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, however, for me personally, they will still be more interesting than the DLC for the first part.

Conclusion

Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel should not be bypassed, at least in order to find out how the great Hyperion company was born and how Handsome Jack became the way we used to see him from the second part.",1624727758,1624727758,True,4,0,0.567893147468566895,0,True,False,False

A few of the good points are:
The new Oz system is, in a way, an ingenious way of adding vertical movement to an otherwise standard movement system.
The laser weapons are a way of revamping your arsenal of already great weapons, though they can be mistaken for E-Tech weapons sometimes by the way they are handled.
The new Vault Hunters are unique without being too out of the box, except for Claptrap, which was a wildcard that paid off weirdly.
Having another story in which you hear Jack's voice constantly is a plus.
Some of the bad points are:
You always need to be sure that you have enough Oxigen when going outside a building unless you are playing as Claptrap.
The vehicles are too bland and simple.

As the title suggests, it treats events before Borderlands 2, but was released after that. It introduces some new game mechanisms : the air supply, the jump redirection through a single air jet. Some places will have reduced gravity, allowing for longer jumps, and there will be also frequent jumppads, that propel you over great distances. The meta currency will be called Moonstones, but will act exactly as Elerium in the previous game. At release there were 4 classes, and 2 new classes were added through DLCs. I got this game through the Handsome Collection, and as such had all the DLCs available. I intended only a single playthrough, and wanted to play with the easiest class. In Borderlends2 I played as the gunzerker, and that was an easy mode. Here I chose Handsome Jack doppelganger as my character. Based on some internet research I wasn’t sure whether it will be the easy mode character, but by playing through the game I can say that past level 30 he is probably the most easy/safe character to play. That is due to his decoy summons, which capture almost all of the enemy aggro. Not only that, but they do put out a decent damage too. I chose to complete the middle talent tree at first, and some entries there increased the offensive capabilities of the summons greatly, like the addition of more powerful weapons, or the triggering of an explosion when they are summoned, which deals damage only to the enemies. At higher levels when I got overwhelmed, I just summoned them, and literally run into the packs of enemies. They targeted my decoys, and as they were resummoned (they are kept resummoned automatically frequently, as long as the skill is active), each times they dealt explosive damage to the enemies. By holding down the special skill button, the skill can be ended prematurely. The benefit of that is a slight decrease in the cool-down of the skill.

As it is a shooter, I naturally played it with keyboard-mouse, I didn’t even bother to check for controller support. The save system is the same as in Borderlands 2. You cannot save manually, but there are scattered savepoints, where you will be resurrected after deaths. Also there are “hard” savepoints, usually at the entrance of the map. If you exit the game, you will start from this hard savepoints, not from the place where you logged off, or the closest savepoint. Also all enemies will respawn after a new load. Later maps might have hard savepoints at specific locations, so you are not required to fight through the map again if you log out with a lot of progress on a story mission. Also the final save point before the Claptrap story DLC boss fight preserved the defeated state of the first boss. Had it not been for this feature, I would have given up on completing that DLC, as fighting two tedious boss fights where a single death resets everything would have meant me stopping wasting my time on tries. And I am glad that I persevered, because there will be a cinematics after that detailing the fate of the Claptraps, and seemingly a few more quests are unlocked after that, which I enjoyed playing through. 

There are local quests marked with a yellow exclamation mark on the map. They are also listed as undiscovered in the zone list for quests, so at least their zone will be known. Going there the yellow exclamation mark will be visible on the map. However that doesn’t mean that getting to them will be trivial. Some quests can be reached only by very convoluted ways, not readily apparent. For example, in the Claptrap story DLC, you will have to drop out from the auto transport tubes with the slam button, a mechanism that is not explained. Also some zones can be accessed only by progressing the main story line. The main story-line is marked by a distinct vault symbol in the quest list. For the selected quest a target rectangle will appear in the map, so it can reached following that. If it continues in a different zone, multiple target rectangles may appear, some leading to the adjacent zone toward it, some to a quick travel post. The quick travel posts are some predetermined save points. Once you unlock them, you can return to them freely from any other quick travel post.

Some zones will have no air. There are still cracks leaking air, where you can refill mid-field, clearly marked on the mini-map. Also there are air generator stations, which can be switched on or off, and entering any air containing building will replenish the air too.

The voice acting is excellent, as usual for the Borderlands games. There are a lot of returning persons from previous games, some just for a cameo, some are given more time. The two characters with the most speaking is Handsome Jack and Claptrap. The music is the generic music associated with Borderlands, with the Claptrap story DLC having a lot of chiptune music.

The graphics of the game are on par with Borderlands2, but with some completely different sceneries / themes. Also in the Claptrap story DLC, there will be a few levels with parts from previous games, as a kind of homage to those games.

The weapons are largely similar to the ones in Borderlands 2. The two notable additions are the laser weapons and the cold effect. The laser weapons use a different kind of ammo, and come in different roles : some are fast firing with high accuracy (similar to a rifle), some are slow firing with high scattering (similar to a shotgun). The cold effect does cold damage, and also has a chance to freeze enemies. Frozen enemies won’t be able to move/fight, and are susceptible to shatter attacks. Probably explosive weapons are great against them, but I just resorted to simply punching them to death. That way I didn’t loose time on switching to another weapon and back, and also saved some ammo. Weapons can have moonshine effect, which is another source of modifiers for them. Also in the Claptrap story DLC there are pink rarity level weapons, on par / higher than legendaries. They will have glitch effects. The only one I understood was rapid fire, which can trigger randomly when firing.

There is a grinder in the central hub of the game, where you can sacrifice 3 weapons of the same rarity, and obtain a random weapon of the same rarity or one higher. I expended a lot of weapons there, generally getting crap. A safer method of upgrade is selling the weapons, and buying some deal of the day items from the wending machines. Every now and then there will be a nice upgrade available there. The downside of that is that on death you will loose a good chunk of your amassed money.

There are two character DLCs, one for the Handsome Jack doppelganger, one for the baroness. I played with the doppelganger. There is an arena DLC, and the Claptrap story DLC. The arena DLC I largely ignored. I only used it after unknowingly started the Claptrap story DLC prematurely at level 29. That DLC will drop weapons of level 30+, so I couldn’t equip any drop from that DLC at the start, even more so because soon I got level 31, 32 weapons too. So I went to the Arena DLC and kept trying to progress there till I got past level 30. After that I didn’t bother with the arena. You fight several large waves of enemies there. If you have the Claptrap story DLC, after completing a quest there you will get access to a much shorter version of a repeatable arena, where you will have to complete 3 small waves. There you will have to choose some modifier effects before start. In the single run I did, I choose lower gravity and higher slam damage. Also you can dial the difficulty manually from 1 to 10.

Gearbox has built a solid reputation in the gaming industry and this game only strengthens it. The Pre-Sequel builds on top of the success that Borderlands 2 had in 2012, even using the same engine from before. It's actually pretty impressive that Gearbox cranked out this game in 2 years of development with the quality that the game has. If you've played Borderlands 2, I would say this game has the combined quality and quantity of content that roughly 5 Borderlands 2 DLCs would provide. Many people criticize the Oz (O2) system in place of Borderlands 2 Relics, but it never bothered me. If you're a Borderlands fan, the Pre-Sequel would be a fine addition to your collection. *General Grievous wheezes in his grave*

===[ $ Price Index: ]===
☐ Worth even MORE than full price
☑ Completely worth full price
☐ Wait for a sale
☐ Be prepared to refund this title
☐ Please don't buy it

The game is currently $40 on Steam, which is a pretty decent starting price. I've seen this game dip to $20 and below on sales, which is a great price for this game.

===[ ۞ Playtime/Replay Value: ]===
☐ Highly replayable (> 250 hours)
☑ Long (100 ~ 250 hours)
☑ Average (50 ~ 100 hours)
☑ Short (10 ~ 50 hours)
☐ Minuscule (0 ~ 10 hours)

You're likely to get...
☐ Addicted
☑ Hooked
☑ Interested
☐ Bored
☐ Disgusted

Since this game closely follows the core gameplay loop that Borderlands 2 has, it doesn't retain the same replay value. It's still definitely replayable, especially with friends, but my desire to play this game suffers just because it feels very similar to Borderlands 2. There's still a lot to be seen at least once, however.

It took me roughly 15 hours to complete the main story once before I unlocked New Game +. For some, the first playthrough might be enough for them. Because of this, I give the playtime rating a score between Short and Long (10 to 250 hours). Some people might want to play even longer, and more power to them. But I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of people will not invest more than 250 hours in this game.

===[ ☀ Story: ] ===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Memorable
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Garbage
☐ None (Will not factor into aggregate score)

The Pre-Sequel does a great job portraying the events that lead up to Borderlands 2. It feels like a great story by itself, but it's also interesting to see how it makes references to things that will happen in Borderlands 2. Without spoiling anything in the Pre-Sequel, all I can say is that it's very engaging. It definitely meets Gearbox's storytelling reputation.

===[ ☼ Visuals/Graphics: ]===
☐ Masterpiece
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Poor
☐ Visual catastrophe

===[ ♬ Sounds/Music: ]===
☐ Masterpiece (Beethoven is smiling in his grave)
☑ Memorable

☐ Horrible

===[ ☣ Hardware Requirements: ]===
☐ A stone tablet should be able to run it
☐ Minimum
☑ Average
☐ High End
☐ Need a quantum computer

===[ § Bugs: ]===
☐ None to report
☑ Some, but still completely playable
☐ Several annoying bugs
☐ Unplayable

On one of the boss fights, the boss basically fell through the floor and I had to commit suicide to get them to spawn again. That's the only bug I experienced that had me raising an eyebrow, but committing suicide to correct the problem seems like such a Borderlands thing to do.

Terrible story: Uninteresting and boring, the story is nothing more than what should have been a Borderlands 2 DLC.

The weapons have no-where near the diversity of Borderlands 2 either which just makes the game feel like a random space FPS rather than a Borderlands game.

What was great about the first Borderlands was the prospect of adventure.
It was new RPG with customisation and unique gameplay. It had good world building that didn't feel like it had jumped the gun, and a central goal: finding the vault - purpose with some story telling. And a few jokes along the way..

""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"" is a non-sensical, meaningless and random mess of a game, that begins with copious amounts of cut-scenes that you can't skip, and boring dialog dribble that adds nothing to the story or character progression/development. In my first hour of gameplay I spent more time watching cut-scenes I didn't want to watch and listening to inane monologues about garbage I didn't care to listen to, than I actually got to experience the actual gameplay itself. The people who created dialog for this game need to see a psychologist ASAP. 
Their ideas of funny quips and nods to pop culture and their own borderlands references remind me of an old out-of-touch indie hipster that wrongfully conflates indifference and apathy to their incredibly obnoxious personality, to a lack of intelligence, when in reality, a wacky personality does not equate to good comedy, it's weird, not funny.

True inside most facilities its O2 sealed, but I also find it harder to keep progressing with the to gear found.  It is not as balanced and working well as all other titles to help you in your progression from area-to-area.  Its not just bad RNG it just how the game is throughout.  I know eventually you get this & thats with more time played, but when comparing it to the better titles its horrible!  I am just going to stick with BL2 and BL3 and just forget this bad purchase of a loved series.

That's not even mentioning the brilliant story and voice acting that carried my attention throughout the entire game. Now this game is not as big of a step as borderlands 2 was but it is still extremely high quality. In my opinion the game ends up feeling like an extremely large borderlands 2 dlc. I think the games story is another top notch one showing a steady and angry fall from grace as you see handsome jack lose his mind.

Pros:
- Aero/low gravity combat
- Loot, grinding loot for better loot, LOOT!
- Stupid, over-the-top characters
- Watching Jack turn into a psychopath
- Claptastic voyage
- Puns, insider jokes, the humour overall is on point for me

Cons:
- For some reason I liked the loot better in B2 - can't really put my finger on it (maybe the novelty wore off for me)
- I don't love the story but I wouldn't not recommend the game over it
- As with all Borderlands games, the latter playthroughs are a drag especially if you want to try new characters..yes, you need to get to grips with a new character and how they behave but it is what it is

It does very much feel like a DLC for BL2, it has many of the same guns, while adding many new ones. I enjoyed the fact that it seems easier to access these weapons earlier in the game than at a comparable level in BL2. The addition of laser weapons is neat and adds an interesting, albeit challenging element to the game when they end up in bandit hands, as they often possess very high accuracy and obscene projectile velocity. 

The main difference that gives TPS its real flavor is the areas that take place in the vacuum of space, either on a moon without an atmosphere or the exterior of a massive space station. I played mainly as Claptrap, which sidesteps the issue of a limited air-supply, but I also played as the Baroness for a bit, and it added a challenging element to the game without feeling like a hassle. You gain a new method of attack, basically a ""butt slam"" made via high jump in low gravity that deals splash damage, and your currently equipped oxygen cylinder can boost the slam damage, change its elemental damage type, and even add other bonuses much like BL2's relics (because the TPS oxygen cylinder equipment slot replaces the BL2 relic).

I am a huge BL fan, and I absolutely loved playing as Claptrap. And despite the impression the game gives you that Claptrap might be a little challenging to play is misleading, as at higher levels, with the right build Claptrap can be an absolute beast in combat.

Pre-Sequel is an otherwise normal Borderlands 2 DLC that has been drawn out into a full-release title. In nearly every sense it's a step backwards from the refinements of BL2, even when you take into account the changes due to setting and so on, it just doesn't make the game any more fun. It makes things more tedious, unfortunately.

Several of my friends bought this, tried it once and returned it and I can understand why. You get new classes which is a good thing, but you are hamstrung by Oz, which is a bad thing. You have new vehicles, which is a good thing, but they're not that fun to use and the landscapes tend to just be a mix of gray with a pretty skybox, which is a bad thing. The enemies are almost all new, which is a good thing, but they just don't give us that much extra variety, mixed with the above two, which is a bad thing.

I'm Aussie so I like the injection of Aussie vernacular and especially loved the cameo of Shazza as a shotgun, great call on that. For pretty much everyone else I think this just annoyed them to no end. Everyone remembers the legendarily annoying Australian marine from Halo, it's practically a meme. Well, Gearbox made an entire game that acts exactly like that guy. Just... so much that could be good, ends up not working out the way I think they had hoped. I appreciate them trying on this one though.

I left the worst for last though - the story. My God is it horrible. The actual character arc of Jack is good, I like that part, but almost everything else is either (A) designed to draw out your quests to make them take way longer than they have any right to or (B) completely useless exposition that has absolutely no bearing on anything of great consequence, just running the clock out. The good parts are there, they are just buried in a mountain of waiting and backtracking and wishing the game would just get on with itself. It was difficult to make it the whole way through, I won't lie.

All in all, Pre-Sequel feels like an entire game of the bad BL2 DLC made into a game. If it was an expansion to BL2 with all the additions being cross-compatible this would be an awesome addition because it augments the base game with the additions, while allowing you to choose to ignore the negatives it might introduce (such as Oz in moon areas, boring landscapes, enemies etc). Unfortunately, as a release title it just doesn't stack up.

Grab it cheap, or give this one a miss.",1621920472,1621920591,False,28,1,0.659157395362854004,0,True,False,False

For the game, it's more like a DLC. Gun count and the lack of interesting enemies or even character skill trees makes it less likely to replay that often.
Edit: I'm simply going to recommend it because I like Borderlands. Wish they at least used the already functioning mechanics from BL2 here, kind of uninteresting. Like every character story build up, needs more action on introduction, the lack of need to test out different load outs and skills, not many loot options (I never got a legendary item in any of the container during the 200 hours. this made the special weapon cases less exciting), even the legendaries - only the odd ones from BL2 are here.

      All of the Borderlands games are a blast. Almost all of the attainable items are randomly generated, and every playable character has a unique skill tree. The Main story is good, and the side-quests and DLC are even better.
     This game may be easy at times, but there are some particularly frustrating areas. Some bosses are annoying, and a few of the weapons are a bit unbalanced.

There are features that are expected in every Borderlands. The amount of travelling, the grindy festival of enemies everywhere, and the loot, which I personally don't like, but this one adds another gimmick:

A gravity with less gravitational pull than what we're used to. Jumps are higher, falls are slower, and the damage from it is smaller. It also is very boring; it can be fun for a while, but after ten hours of watching your character slowly falling or jumping, you irremediably get tired of it, it wastes your time. This, adding the negligible amount of vehicles, and the useless they are (since there are rifts and stones everywhere), makes for a pretty time consuming travelling, which you'll have to do all the time in quests and between them.

The humor and writing are without doubt worse than what we're used to in the saga. Maybe they grew stale since we've seen the same randomness and type of comedy over and over again, with little evolution. Or maybe it's because they lack a certain quality, but what I can confirm is that I didn't really enjoy them.

Ive found myself spending a lot of my time growing up enjoying most of the games. ive had fond memories of playing with my friends and what an amazing adventure it was. Most is the key word in the review though, as what id barely even describe as a functioning working ""game"" and more of person hell, consider it the modern age ""The Twelve Labors""

The first point of issue with this carcinogenic divine comedy, is that despite having a near flawless foundation to build upon, the mongoloid cretins devs at 2K Australia, dropped the ball so hard it crashed through thier floor and shutdown their pathetic excuses of ""game development"" and the studio as a whole. now celebrate not, as their personal magnum opus resides in a world that we as people can put ourselves through, that is, of course if you can even get the game to fucking launch. Who and how are my biggest questions here, but enough of that tangent. My game could barely maintain a state of even running while having a somewhat solid build for a pc. This shit should not be happening and its not my end. Unless someone in the office is completely oblivious to the prerequisite of how a game functions this should be a red flag for the torture me and my friend induced onto each other.
My second point to make about this smouldering pile of 2k Australias ashes, The moon.
i understand the context behind setting some of this game on the moon, its the story that's being told and its relevant. I didn't pay for a 30 hour long water level, that's all the zero g combat can be compared to, is an amalgamation of all the reason why you shouldn't fucking run a game Solely on the moon. I hope you like the colour grey, that's all your gonna be seeing. you'd think that anyone with half a mind would put some colour somewhere, anywhere fuck me. 30 hours of being colourblind and i get to experience what its like to constant have to gunfight underwater. Oh and there is a handy feature of the gun play that makes every gun you use feel like its got a quarter of a second hit registry, its like trying to muster up some form of woodworking while you've just downed 8 bars and 6 shots of vodka.
The Third reason i find this ""video game"" to be less enjoyable than being waterboarded in a viet-kong prisoner camp, Voice acting.
I live in Australia so i hear different accents all the time from all parts of this great nation. I've yet to find anyone push wind through their body and have to sound strikingly similar to jamming hammer drill into my nasal canal and performing a self lobotomy, every character is Australian bar the returning character, and you'll hate each and every single one of them. If you've ever wondered what its like to go to the smoking area at an Australian brothel this is the closest you'll come to hearing it, every whiny nasally fucking voice, has its own special way of penetrating your eardrums and leaving you with the same hearing as an Israeli street vendor.
my final thoughts on one of the single worst games i've ever played.
the only real thing i can say about this game and the people who enjoy it. take a hard look. this is the reason why the gaming industry is heading towards a creative collapse. people consume and digest this trash and preach about this amazing experience riddled with their own subconscious need to want the game to be good. don't buy this. don't gift this. and for fuck sake, save yourself the trouble and don't even launch the game. fuck knows its not gonna launch. R.I.P. 2k Australia. Randy Pitchford you foreskin gobbling money hungry big nosed jew fuck. if your reading this, quit your job, get in your car and hit the highway at 160.

So lets begin.

[h1]Story[/h1]

This is an interesting take for the prequel to Borderlands 2. The story essentially is the reason that BL2 takes place. Jack or who'd be known as Handsome Jack later is the guy who employs different vault hunters for his work. There are some neat twists and turns around in the story and I can say that it was nice.

[h1]Characters[/h1]

I haven't played all the characters yet but they do represent different characteristics in themselves. Some like Wilhelm, Nisha are pure mercenaries with no real morals while others like Athena, Claptrap show hesitation doing some nasty stuff and also relate a bit to the humane side. I'd say that's great so you can pick up a Vault Hunter of your choice.

Talking about skills and abilities, i feel all are pretty unique and fun to try out. I definitely dont want to list them all here but just check em out. It feels different from BL2 very different gameplay.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

There are a couple of unique elements added into the game compared to borderlands 2, mainly the lack of atmosphere and new weapons : LASER.  The new high jump with a boost felt pretty good and fun to play around with and was absolutely needed given how HUGE the areas are. All the guns types from BL2 return (changing BANDIT to SCAV, they need a name change after going to moon cmon!). Though new weapon type LASER was added in TPS. Overall say on weapons, most seem good enough (AR's actually feel better than the shitshow from BL2) and some lasers feel pretty OP with insane damage outputs (the beam lasers) but also eat ammo pretty damn fast. I'd like to know what the laser ammo is and how is the gun powered.

In short, some new and fun elements to check out.

[h1]Map Design[/h1]

Coming from BL2, I was [b]DISAPPOINTED[/b] with the map design. The moon maps are TOO big and almost oversaturated with stuff. I liked the BL2 maps, they weren't large and were properly accessible whether on vehicle or foot. TPS map sections feel too large, dull and just filled with Scav camps around for no apparent reason. For example, take Triton Flats. It's the biggest part of the moon which connects to numerous places, it's filled with so much stuff that whenever I want to just do a mission nearby it's a pain to navigate through and those damn big Shuggarths just basically everywhere. 
The jump pads look cool but in some places (e.g. Pity's Fall Drakensberg) it feels like they overused the pads. I don't like a map design where the only way into a ship wreck is some weirdly placed jump pads. There is an entire bandit camp inside, it just doesnt make sense to have some weird jump pads around as the sole entrance and most of the navigation. Same for the maintenance section in Helios, unnecessarily high number of jump pads. How do people even perform maintenance work there like that?

I DO NOT like the map design in this game, the gameplay elements are unique and fun but I will always hate the map design. Only place I like on the map is Concordia because it's not overly saturated, isn't big asf and looks better. Borderlands is not an open-world game so small but meaningful map pockets feel better than big ones.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

To summarize, I feel it's obviously a nice game to play around but I feel it would've been even better if the map design wasnt as horrible as it is. This game will make you hate Jack even more if you're coming from BL2. A great game with a bit off execution imo.

[b]6.5/10[/b]

I am clearly not the target demographic tho, as I am not a father with a deeply unsatisfied wife, dead end job, and needs something that distracts him from real life because real life intimidates him. His destiny is to produce a fine ass daughter to bang Chad, and with any luck, Chad will wife her up if she's a virgin and under 20, thereby producing more Chads to spread their Chad genes into this weak world. If not, he'll play this type of video game for years, completely ignoring his baby girl's descent into deviant behavior until she either gets a sex change, or morphs into an aging spinster who's favorite time of the week is wine-o-clock. The humor in this game is tailored exactly to these types. Just watch, everything is a thinly veiled dad joke with that extra cringe. Time goes on and Lame Dad retires to this game most nights with his favorite overpriced craft brew giving him bitch tits. ""ooooh what LOOT am I going to get today?"" he croons, putting his Turtle Beach headset on so he doesn't hear his wife melting in utter writhing pleasure while her personal trainer slams her still-tight beaver (dad only ever got some a week after the honeymoon). ""It's ok though, she's going to the gym every day and getting healthy so I can brag to my fantasy football friends about how hot my wife is. At least her getting pounded by him prevents her from asking me to take the trash out. I love her so much!"" Years down the road he's at his parent's funeral. He feels very little because he is a pathetic bugman and doesn't believe in God. All he's thinking about is the marginally better loot he will get after sinking another 5 hours into Boringlands. He retreats to the church bathroom and looks up Moxxie on his Soyphone X and, staying on the first few results of google images, jerks his frail mushroom tip. He lets out a slight grunt after climaxing into a single ply piece of toilet paper. Good thing he's a dribbler and not a shooter, otherwise he'd have to carry around an extra sock in his pocket...and he *hates* doing his own laundry. Later, at the reception, he loads his plate with the mac-n-cheese instead of the steak because he still harbors infantile cravings and could care less about taking care of his body. An old friend from high school shows up and gives him condolences, and not 5 minutes into the conversation, Lame Dad tries to insert a reference to Borderlands, probing for someone else as uninteresting as him. To his luck, his old friend lights up and starts talking about the shiny orange rarity gun he got in that one dungeon that has 5 barrels and shoots laser rockets with fire elemental damage and every bullet has a 1% chance of turning the enemy NPC into a rubber ducky. He mentions that his wife and daughters don't understand his love for this game. Lame Dad shows more enthusiasm than ever before for the next 3 hours. ""Why am I wearing this suit? Who died?"", Lame Dad wonders. He returns to the table after getting his 5th Bud Light from the open bar because the NFL advertises it alot. He is genuinely happy that he found someone just like him. Birds of a feather really do flock together! They agree to play online together when they get home, and Lame Dad and Lame Friend sheepishly play together for a long time. Suddenly around the New Year, Lame Dad finds out he has asshole cancer. ""Dang shouldn't have eaten that paint chip when I was a child,"" says Lame Dad as he schedules his 50th covid vaccine. ""At least I'm safe from this deadly disease. If we all don't get vaccinated, there will only be 99.9998% of us left!"" Lame Dad righteously struts into the emergency immunization pod and gets jabbed. After, he stops by the grocery store to pick up some tv dinners, salt and vinegar chips, and Beyond Meat for the wife to cook. He still wears a double mask because you can never be too safe. After he gets home he opens the chip bag. 

Suddenly his eyes start to water, his throat gets tingly, it gets hard to breathe, and rashes start appearing all over his skin. He tries to get out of his $300 gaming chair but he ends up falling over. Uh oh, his legs are paralyzed. He tries to scream for help but can't due to his throat being so swollen. Everything gets hot, and he passes out before dying from asphyxiation. His wife discovers him the next morning after she goes in to tell him she's going to the gym to train. His death was ruled a covid death, and Lame Friend gives a eulogy at his funeral, using it as a platform to use tongue in cheek life metaphors based on their travels in Borderlands. ""He was the best skallywag hunter around. No bullet sponge boss could contend with his super rare fancy gun. Rest in pepperoni my fellow vault hunter. May you be reconstructed in the afterlife if there was an afterlife.""

The added O2 mechanic adds a satisfying layer of latent difficulty. The addition of Cryo elemental damage isn't vitally important, but it does add to the versatility of elemental damage types overall, in the sense of both what you can dish out and what you'll have to prepare against.

A friend and I have been playing through each of the Borderlands games and this was the one that we were skeptical about returning to. Now that I've played it again I actually enjoy this game for what it's worth. A lot of complaints about this game come from the fact that it lacks content and is too close to Borderlands 2. These complaints are understandable, as yes, the game does lack end-game content other than 2 below average DLC packs and a disappointing raid boss. However, the actual main story of this game was a lot of fun to return to. The features added in this game were all great: Cryo weapons, lasers, OZ kits + oxygen mechanics. While a lot of the visual style and charm of this game is clearly taken straight from Borderlands 2, the playable characters are still unique and have their own special builds and styles. The music was actually a really nice surprise too as I hadn't really paid much attention to it when I first played it. The new NPCs in this game are, to put it bluntly, obnoxious and annoying. There weren't many that I enjoyed, and in fact, I found myself disliking returning characters such as Lilith, Roland, and Moxxi because of their actions in the story. Overall, I don't think this game deserves as much hate as it gets. It's definitely flawed and lacks its own unique personality but it's still fun for what it is.

261640,87349754,76561198111728874,0,16,2259,0,1583,1614805785,"""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"" has a rather clear intention in its name. It narrates the events leading up to Borderlands 2, more specifically the character arc of Handsome Jack. Rather than being an antagonist, he is the one leading your character this time around. As such, you see a different side of him, still grating and endearing. There is also the opportunity to meet other Borderlands characters and see them from a different point of view. While I enjoyed the ending overall, I found it a bit abrupt. Also, the beginning of the game is rather weak. Couple this with how boring of a villain Zarpedon is. It is not until the mid-game that the story picks up in my opinion.

The side quests are great and keep a generally consistent quality. Some of them are tedious, such as one mission that has you farm 50 common weapons, but most are, thankfully, quite entertaining. My favourite has to be one relating to a window. I'm certain fans of the game will know what I mean. The writing is once again a major component to the storytelling's success, yet I found it weaker than BL2. It's not bad, but I found it rough in places. Some jokes very much did not land and left me rolling my eyes. Nonetheless, most of the humour was entertaining and the serious moments were able to pack a punch.

Perhaps my biggest issue with the game is its art direction. While it makes sense due to the space thematic, everything is so dark in The Pre-Sequel! Even colourful locales have such an unpleasant tint that I can hardly recall any of the environments in the game. No matter how different some of them try to look, it all blends in together, creating a rather boring world to explore. I won't say that locations stood out that much in ""Borderlands 2"", but I certainly found them to be more pleasant and inviting than the dim lighting here.

What separates gameplay here is once more related to space, specifically the mechanics of gravity. Being able to float around and mess with these forces adds a whole new level of verticality that brings more action and thrill to an already exciting form of combat. I was constantly on the move here, flying in all directions, trying to hit my enemies. Furthermore, the mechanics are complicated and detailed. There is an oxygen meter to look after, as it will deplete in low-oxygen environments and with each boost you use. More interestingly, playing as Fragtrap, a robot, the game gladly joked about how I need not worry about breathing. And speaking of classes, there's a decent chunk to pick from here, with two additional DLCs. I chose Fragtrap, and as RNG-based as he is, the good ol' bot is just too much fun to play. Collecting loot was a driving force behind my playthrough, and was made far more interesting by a mechanic as simple as the Grinder. I wish the annoying dude didn't need to spit sexual innuendo every 10 seconds, though. It was funny the first two times, and annoying every other one.

Graphics-wise, The Pre-Sequel is almost iddentical to the second game. In fact, some might argue that there are too few things to separate the game from it and it's no more than glorified DLC, but if you play the game for yourself, I'm sure you'll disagree. There's more than enough content here to justify its separation.

All in all, ""Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel"" is a good game, a 7/10 in my book. I enjoyed playing through it and will recommend it readily to ""Borderalnds 2"" fans. Not anyone else, however. If you have the choice, opt for BL2. It's a much more memorable and ambitious experience, whereas this is meant to expand on it further. Worthwhile if you want to learn more about Handsome Jack and/or wish to play more Borderlands.

That being said, while the game is cross platform, you can't easily play it in that way. The version on each platform is not in sync so you have to downgrade the Windows version if you want to play with someone on Linux.

The alternative is to play the Windows version in Proton (though deep down I bought the game to support native Linux game development).",1613378195,1613378195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Perhaps it was the reviews saying this wasn't that good or something. Well. I have now played through the campaign by myself and with a friend Co-op and I have no reason why I thought that way at all. 
Sure, it doesn't have that much content as Borderlands 2. Sure, it has less variety than Borderlands 2. Sure, it has less interesting characters and plot than Borderlands 2. Big Deal. As a standalone game it has it's merits and works quite well. The story was a good introduction to the characters in the universe and was actually interesting how the Handsome Jack character came to be. 
The campaign was okay to play through and had some funny (well..quite outdated memes to be exact) moments and Claptrap DLC was excellent. It had lasers and cryo weapons and they were so much more fun than anything in Borderlands 2. 
I played with Nisha and Doppelganger and they both played quite unique. Tho Nisha did WAY more damage in the end and was a bit unbalanced. Playing with Doppelganger it felt so much slower and not as fun. 
Only thing this game was lacking was some endgame. Only couple big bosses and nothing else is kinda meh and it kinda drops the replayability a bit. I played Borderlands 2 way more just because the varied DLCs you could do. 

But in the end it's a fun game and you can get this CHEAP nowadays with Borderland packages. And it has cross platform multiplayer so I could play it with my friend who had it on Epic Store. Tons of things to do for a while.",1613337686,1613337686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're not a fan though, TPS doesn't do anything radically different from the previous entries in the franchise that you'll end up liking this one, hell, many people who like BL2 don't like TPS.

 [h1]What's Good.....[/h1] 
[hr][/hr]
[list]
    [*] Skill trees are much more robust and personalized for each character. The final skills in each tree are wild and very fun to use.
    [*] Seriously, all characters are so much fun and different to play from each other.
    [*] Characters are actually voiced and react differently during story and side quests in-game.
    [*] Lasers.
    [*] Low Gravity combat makes combat less tedious and much more fluid.
    [*] Dahl Soldiers are much more fun to fight than Hyperion loaders.
    [*] If you're a fan, the backstory of Jack and his Vault hunters is pretty cool.
    [*] Game still looks pretty, environments are cool but mostly same throughout.
[/list] 
[hr][/hr]
[h1]What's Hood.....[/h1] 
[hr][/hr]
[list]
    [*]There are only 2 basic Environments - Helios space station and Ellpis, the Barren Moon. Both of them are pretty well designed but they eventually get stale half way through the game because there's only 2 of them. Remember BL2 had glaciers, tundras ,dust bowls and everything else in between.
    [*] Side quests are not as fun in fact, main quests are a bit of a drag as well.
    [*] Newer Wildlife not from BL2 like Kraggons and Shuggarths are too easy to kill and never pose a challenge. 
    [*] DLCs are mediocre and no where near as good as BL2.
    [*] I had trouble finding people to Co-op this game because most people play either BL3 or BL2 these days.

Maybe I'm a bit biased because I absolutely just love the character interactions that happen throughout the game, It's a lot like Bl3 in that aspect, just not a trash story like Bl3 is. The story in this is really good, second best to Tftbl. If you really like a game with good story, then this is probably going to be a great game for you. I personally disliked Bl3's story, and coming off of playing that to playing this was very refreshing. 

Spoilers below:

It depicts the story of what happens regarding the vault on Elpis and Jack taking over Helios. I personally really like it because before playing this game, I just hated Jack because he was an awful man. Great villain, honestly, but I just hated his character because of that. Because he's made to be hateable. But TPS shows a different side to him, shows how he was before he became like how he is in Bl2. I can really appreciate him as a character now and even feel a little bit of sympathy towards him because of it, even if I still hate the guy for all the bad stuff he's done. 

With that said, the game also made me rather dislike Lilith and Roland. I was never really fans of them both in bl1 and bl2, and after playing this I can say that it only gave me more reason to dislike them. I didn't really see a reason for them to betray Jack, and I can say that it probably only fueled his becoming into Handsome Jack even more. 

The game gives you an understanding into the events that shaped the whole ""Handsome Jack"" persona that Jack plays into in bl2, and makes you feel sympathy for the villain of the series. Which is something I never thought I would do. It is pretty well written, the characters feel developed and like they play a part in the story, and the ECHO logs throughout certain parts give even more backstory on the Vault Hunters in this game. Which I really really liked. I'm a huge lore nerd and character development nerd, so I love seeing these sides to the characters and seeing them grow through playing. For example, Timothy starts off as just trying too hard to be like Jack, but then ends up having his true personality shine through a bit. The personality you see in the bl3 dlc where he's just annoyed with Jack and having to act like him. But there's reasons why he doesn't act like that for the entirety of TPS, which I really did enjoy learning. 

Also claptrap as a playable character is great. 10/10.",1612319158,1612319158,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

So tedious to play compared to the other entries in the franchise.

They reused all they could from BL2, from gun design to Stalkers (on a freaking space station), down to even the bands that play the OST. It feels very cheap and rushed. The features they introduced seem poorly thought-out, such as the whole movement system which has you jump in slow motion all game long. Basically Borderlands 2, but not as nice, and standalone to try and justify the price tag.

My recommendation: 
Buy it if you are a hardcore fan who wants the Handsome Jack backstory and isn't happy watching it on Youtube, or for a VERY discounted price.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

The classes are great, far better than any other Borderlands game I have played.  I played Claptrap and it was hilarious the things that were happening with his ult and the combinations I would come up with.  It was also nice to see a variety of locations and colors in the game.  Borderlands 1 and 2 felt drab, so this was a good change of pace.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

There is too much story in my FPS.  The NPCs talk forever and it gets old after awhile.  There were times I felt like the shooting was getting in the way of the talking.  Also, I died in so many stupid ways it wasn't even funny.  It was annoying.  Dying is a part of a FPS game, but it just felt stupid in this case.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I beat it!  And I enjoyed it, at least when I was able to shoot things and not die.  I know it's not a fan favorite, but it's my favorite Borderlands game by far.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.

Good:
1. Cryo based stuff is interesting in a way
2. Classes with expanded skill trees and more options when it comes to fine tuning a character to suite your playstyle
3. They have learned some things from previous games, and improved upon it (i.e. Critical Ascensi0n from Zer0 is split on Aurelia)
4. Generally there is [i]some[/i] improvements, fresh-ish content (Oz kits are better than Relics in BL2 for instance) and so on

Bad:
1. The XP and health curve is not set right. Enemies have, in general, too much hit points while you're playing the storyline
2. The storyline is an insufferable drag that just goes on and on with a lack of fluidity. You get the sense that that because of point (3) below, they extended it with redirects and blocks, meaningless tasks and high HP enemies to make it work. It's not even that great of a story either: honestly, if you want to see the story, just watch a Let's Play on YouTube and be done with it
3. There is very little to do after you complete the storylines and DLC content except farm kit and weapons. The other games have a similar situation but I feel like there is less ""to do"" or ""test out"" or try out different things
4. The sidequests have to be done as soon as they become available to keep ahead of the XP ladder, otherwise you'll be looking at skulls pretty soon and dying a lot unless you really know what you're doing (speedrunners for instance)
5. The gear that drops or is available in vendors is not adequate enough in quality to complete the storyline and/or deal with enemies sufficiently. You have to farm the SHiFT chest in Concordia to have decent enough shields, COMs, Oz kits and weapons. Honestly without having the Gibbed save editor available to you to transfer kit from character to character and stuff the game isn't even worth playing
6. Like many ""Post 2010"" games producers/designers still haven't learned from lessons in the past: Unskippable cutscenes, boring plots, characters that just ramble and ramble (Pickle comes to mind), badly designed bosses (Deadlift is really really hard to beat with trash tier kit, which you'd be using all the game gave you anyways, there's other examples), badly designed enemies (Stalkers with huge health pools, their high damage and other properties would be fine if they had low HP for example, then there's the Lost Legion Eternals). Most of enemy flaws can be corrected by fixing the HP/XP curve, I feel, however that's never going to happen

The [url=https://hardcoregamer.com/2014/10/13/review-borderlands-the-pre-sequel/]Hardcore Gamer[/url] review is probably the most accurate from my point of view. In short, if you get this game for peanuts, or as part of the Handsome Jack BL2 collection (as I did, so it was effectively free), that's fine, but [u]you should not pay full price for this game[/u]. It's simply not worth it. You should get this game to round out your collection, check out the content and the characters (yay FR4G-TP!) but if you didn't like Borderlands 1 and/or 2, do not buy this game. It's too half-baked.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: I should also mention I've had to rely on a lot of exploits / glitches / save scumming / bit of Gibbed save editor work to make this game work enough for me to tolerate it.

Exploits such as: The UVHM reset progress XP method done about 120 times gets you from Level 50 to 70 (only took like 5 days to do that); locking your profile.bin OR save0001.sav file to farm the SHiFT chest OR farm legendaries (respectively); save scumming / locking your save file to farm a specific mission reward; Gibbed save editing to copy items from character to character and editing the character level to Level 29 (P1), Level 50 (P2) to skip all the annoying grinding of side missions. 

It's got a lot of neat things, such as mentioned above, but also a lot of downsides (vehicle control was something Gearbox never really figured out) and many other annoyances that tips the balance scales in a negative way. Also the entire weapon scheme was literally copied from BL2 and many of the Unique items and Legendaries are copied straight from BL2, so if you love them there you'll like them here too. If not then well it's not going to be that great. 

I think overall there's probably a big reason there's still a more vibrant Borderlands 1 community (in terms of activity and resources) than TPS. Which is sad.",1611168961,1611249806,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I'm replaying it now with friends, and am finding many of the jokes unfunny; some of the acting (e.g. Nakayama's) overdone (it's supposed to be funny, but isn't); and the gameplay is noticeably worse than in Borderlands 3. You spend too much time trekking around the game world because quick travel isn't available. You can't mark items as crap and sell all crap with one keypress. You can't zoom out to see the entire map. The story is OK, but the player characters are mostly not very relatable.

Game five of my 2021 challenge to finish all the games in my Steam library and write a review of them. My challenge for this game was to finish the main quest line (and do a few sidequests on the way) - in total it took me around 25 hours.

A few hours into Borderlands The Pre-Sequel I thought I was really going to have to push through this one. Although there were hints of the combat mechanics from Borderlands 2 the space / low grav element and some properly annoying jumping segments really got to me. But as I continued playing and the story developed I found myself enjoying it more and more. 

Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is published by an Australian company and the accents work well in the 'space hillbilly' universe of the game - which happens to be my favourite sci-fi concept. There's level design that keeps the same open exploration of BL2, with interesting things to be found off the beaten path that aren't always telegraphed. There's also the looty shooty combat with the enemies becoming more interesting and varied the further into the game I got, some epic bosses toward the end it had all the elements I loved in BL2, plus a plot that takes you into the origin of one of the best video game baddies of all time.

I'd played Borderlands 3 to the end last year and although I'd finished it, those long, linear levels made me want to give up long before the end. This is far more of a spiritual (pre)-sequel and if you haven't bought this game yet and didn't like BL3, or played it a bit and got annoyed with the space elements I'd recommend playing and pushing on for more of your Borderlands fix.

It's a Borderlands game for sure, but not everyone who liked the first two were into this one. I had some fun playing it, but got stuck with the waypoint system leading me to dead ends. Most likely operator error.

Like all Borderlands games, I prefer to play these single player. Over many years friends have asked me to play Borderlands with them, and honestly I just don't have the same goals they do. They're always focused on some goal or mission and I'm always out of my element just along for the ride watching the game go by wondering why any of this matters to me. I play Borderlands to make weird things happen. Most of my time is spent trying to exploit glitches or simply do things the wrong way for fun. So you can guess my joy to be able to use Clap Trap's skill that just makes weird things happen.(sometimes with great benefit)

I was level 27 and thought it would be worth a try.  After all, if I didn't like it, I could at least go back and pick up the game in ""Normal"" mode, right?  WRONG!

Once you agree to try UVHM, THE GAME STARTS OVER FROM THE BEGINNING AND *ALL* OF YOUR PROGRESS IS LOST!!!  This means, you have to go through all of the gameplay you so diligently fought through AGAIN.  ARRGH!

Oh, and at the level you left off at.  You might be thinking, ""What's the big deal?  The NPCs are level 1 and you are level 27.""  No so fast, grasshopper.  All the NPCs are at your level, just like before... EXCEPT they are 2-3 times harder to kill and you still have your crappy 1/3 powered weapons to rely on.  Needless to say, expect to do a lot of dying, WAY more than the first time around.  

The new weapon drops are more powerful, but no where near powerful enough to make up for how much more powerful the NPCs are compared to you (same shield and health).  I must have died about 20+ times trying to kill DeadLift because he can kill you with 2-3 shots... and almost never misses.

I'm still not sure I'm going to try to play through the game again.  It is VERY disappointing that there was NO INFORMATION provided to guide the decision, just ""Whoohoo!  You can be a super duper ""Ultimate Vault Hunter"".  Wanna try it?""  

As Wilhelm would say, ""Uh, sure?""  

CL4PTP:  ""Whoops!  We forgot to tell you that you are starting over.  Ooopsie!  Silly us!  Have fun dying!  And starting all over!""

And don't even TRY grinding unless you are using moonstones as you will likely get ""leveled up"" (e.g. green to blue), but lower powered weapons than you put into the grinder.  I lost A LOT of really nice weapons before I realized that (yeah, my bad).

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This game has been much better to play than I thought it would be.  I was afraid that the ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006 movie starring Keanu Reeves) style of graphics would really be a turn-off during game play.  Yeah, I guess I was a bit of a graphics snob.

However, the gameplay dynamics have been good enough that I don't mind them at all.  In fact, I believe that they help keep the framerates up when other games would struggle on my GTX 1080Ti.  I have experienced ZERO lag while playing and I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear that people with lower end graphics cards have a similar experience.

Anyway, I'd highly recommend the game.  It takes a bit to get used to this game's quirks, but once you do, it is smooth sailing.  

I'm looking forward to trying Borderlands 2, which is supposed to be pretty similar.

PS.  I initially had some trouble getting the game to play.  It wouldn't start because of some permissions issues in the ""Documents"" folder, where the Borderlands save config and progress files.  I had to go into Windows 10 Firewall an explicitly allow the game .exe files to access that folder.  I don't know why this game had this problem.  I have already installed Borderlands 2 and it didn't have a problem.

The only thing I can think of is that they haven't talked to Microsoft to get this particular .exe file permissions in Windows Firewall.  I hope I'm alone in this, but if I'm not, then I hope this helps others get the game installed and running correctly.  It's worth playing, especially at 50+% off!",1609802979,1610225681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, Pros:
-New weapons are cool, but not exactly much of a deviation
-Cool characters to play as
-Different setting
Cons:
-Not funny or interesting in terms of writing and story
-Gravity is often annoying
-Weapon scaling is gone; one of my favorite parts about Borderlands 1 & 2, as you felt like you were getting stronger. Here, you might keep the same weapon for 5+ levels, and most of the weapons are garbage.
-In Borderlands 1 & 2, it felt as though you were reaching benchmarks. For example, in Borderlands 2, you have to fight your way through the Fridge to get back to Sanctuary, and it's difficult. But anytime you go back there after you level up a few times, every enemy dies after one shot. It's hard to explain why that aspect is so fun, but it is completely missing in this game, and none of the locations are at all interesting. Honestly, just go play Borderlands 2 again.

This game is not as good as Borderlands 2 but I say better than BL3
Borderlands 2 > Borderlands 1 > Borderlands Pre-sequel > Borderlands 3
The issue with Borderlands 3 is the very bad story. Remember the high school essay that you wrote the last minute pretending that you spent weeks on it? That is the quality of material you find in Borderlands 3.
The positives:
-The double jump because you can go on the moon and do a double jump
-They present a different side of handsome Jack. However, I must say that he is still not a ""good guy"" he did human experimentations in BL2
-Did I say Chryo and Laser weapons so cool!
-Gear does not become obsolete as quickly.
-I like the characters and it does have a lot of variety! You can play Claptrap, Handsome Jack and Nisha! 
-Drop rates feel better than BL2 (that was awful)
Negatives:
-Navigation can be a problem. You think this is the way but no it is the other way
-Sometimes it feels like you are fetching items and the story and game play aspects can make it seem repetitive at times but not always.
-Unbalanced DLC characters
-The devs got a bit lazy some of the bosses look like re-skinned versions of BL2

While the overall story is not bad, the main flow is interrupted by numerous slow and boring quests and the end is quite unclear and makes no sense. Also, I was expecting a deep psychological story of Jack's descent into madness, but nope - he just turns into a jerk and that's it. Most of the (newly introduced) characters are redundant, uninspiring cannon fodders and the story would work fine without them. The jokes are really bad.
Gameplay-wise, I appreciate the addition of laser weapons. The rest of weaponry seems rather unsatisfying - in previous games, I always found a revolver/rifle/shotgun/something that was both effective and fun to play with. In Pre-Sequel, the only weapons I can really play with are either lasers or sniper rifle. The rest is just so inaccurate and low-damaging they quickly lead to frustration.

But at least you have broken ass lazers. Get it on sale so you can try it out, but don't spend your money at full price. [/h1]

In long: 

[u] The Plot [/u] - This game takes place between Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2, detailing a bit of Jack's rise to power and how he became a massive dickwad. You'll be playing on Elpis, one of Pandora's moon's as well as Helios, Hyperion's space station. You play as some vault hunters doing a job for Jacky Baby. These characters are the reason why people even get this game a chance. Three of them are villains while  two of them are forced to work for him and one feels like they are obligated to finish the job. This gives a kinda different feel to everything, as you get to play as the characters you eventually fight in other games. 

[u]The Gameplay[/u] - Like I said, Borderlands 2. If you like Borderlands 2, this gameplay is more of the same. Replace slag with cyro. Problem is since you are in s p a c e, there's low gravity that even effects drops. This means that if someone drops something, there's a high chance they will kick it into a pit. Or better yet, be a flying enemy that drops an legendary (Boomer :v).

[b]The Problem[/b] - Why is this game seen as a black sheep then? Some people may not like the story, others may think that this game took too much from Borderlands 2 to be called a full game. The most problematic thing about this game is that if you even so much as compare it to Borderlands 2, this game just pales in comparsion on paper. Even with the base story of Borderlands 2, you get sooo much more than this game. 
Not to mention that since this game didn't get that much on launch, it didn't get that much on DLC. By the time Claptastic Voyage came out (great dlc btw), this game was already dead. 

Now I'm just going to list a bit of grievances that I have with the game that I don't know how to put into a single section without going on a rant lol

- Only one raid boss, and it's just the same boss as the ending boss, but just one shots you. Imagine if Borderlands 2 had the Warrior as a raid boss but just one shots you.

- I know I already said this, but FUCK loot being kicked off into space. Some of the scavs you fight has this animation that actually fucking kicks the loot they drop. Also the ned fight takes place were there are cracks in the surface of the place that leads to a kill zone. The fact that Ned can drop a fucking Skullmasher into a hole makes me MALT. Not Mald, MALT. I'm legit turning into foam at the thought of this shit happening.

- The general lack of fast travels. ESPECIALLY DURING THE VEINS OF HELIOS. With levels being way larger than Borderlands 2 levels on average, the lack of fast travels really makes this game feel like alot of running around. Which gets me to...

- Poor pacing in enemy spawns. Coupled with the long time of just large empty spaces you can go, this is why this game feels like alot of running around. Also, if you wipe the map, the enemies won't respawn.

- The lack of dedicated drops for legendaries and uniques. If you've played Borderlands 2, you'd know how some farms can be done for some weapons. Boll for the Fastball, Warrior for the Volcano, BNK-3R for the Bitch, etc etc. There's alot of returning legendaries that don't have a dedicated person to farm it from, which also leads too...

- Iwajira farming. This is one reason why the game died. Iwajira is a boss that drops a legendary. It doesn't matter what legendary it was, the point is that players would farm this boss for a legendary, take mutiples and then try their luck in the Grinder to get other legendaries. Because of the lack of dedicated drops + the fact that people were fighting the same boss over and over again, was one reason why this game died.

- Lack of refarmable bosses. Yes, some bosses on launch were non-farmable. Meaning, if you wanted to farm them, you would have to alt+f4 each time you don't get what you want. There's alot of mini bosses that now can be farmed, but there's still many bosses that are one and done. Want a Nuke'em? Fuck you. Want to fight Zarpadon again? Sike.  

- Lastly, the fact that Borderlands 2 and 3 exists. Hell, even Borderlands 1 can seem more fun than this. Huge amounts of DLC that really brings out the game or its good sides. This game only has two DLC's and one of them is just a combat arena. 

In conclusion: Fun game, No content other than Clap's, many issues with the base game. I probably missed a few issues, but that's why I allow comments. If you really care that much, then please correct me or add more issues that I finished. I can't recommend this game at full price, but I sure can recommend at least a full playthrough of this game on at least one character that isn't Claptrap* during a sale.

*Claptrap is my least favorite character because most of the time, I die after hitting F, meaning I don't even get whatever package that I'm going to get. Plus, most of his damage comes from Pirate Ship mode + Explosive boosts.",1608659914,1608659914,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have other supporting characters like Torgue that provide some entertaining commentary and conversations throughout the journey as well so that was a nice touch too. 

Much like the first two Borderlands games, the mechanics here are identical but the additional of an O2 (Oxygen) system that allows for new build diversity specifically for Melee characters, and can be taken advantage of by other classes as well. They also had a lot of fun in creating the skill trees as well, so there's new skills for you to play around with, specifically Calptrap who has this RNG built into his abilities that can be a double edged sword at times.

Sure, it runs on the same engine as Borderlands 2, but that just makes the new elements seem that much stranger; there's a familiar look and feel, but something is just... off.  Spend some time with it, though, and approach it with an open mind, and you might find that The Pre-Sequel has a lot to offer.  It's certainly not without its frustrations, but there are a lot of unique elements here, and once you get your footing, it's a total blast.  I had my doubts at first, but it planted a seed that blossomed into something wonderful.

The first thing you're likely to notice, once you get into the game proper, is that a lot of the game takes place in low-gravity areas.  This, along with the fact that you can perform a mid-air boost with your oxygen unit, took me quite some time to get used to, since the boosts aren't just a simple double-jump; how they'll affect your jump and its trajectory will be determined by where you are in your jump arc.  This consumes oxygen, which you'll also have to worry about while you're in a vacuum, and they actually thought to make it impossible to light enemies on fire where there is no oxygen; not a good sign.  But then, I had this moment: I was ducking in a trench, where there was an air pocket, while scavengers were above, firing at me, and there was only one solution: flying low-g headshots.  This was my moment; this is when it all clicked, and I understood the sheer joy of the experience.  You have to learn to work with it, but once you do, the mechanics are SO satisfying; it's like nothing I've ever played before.

The RPG elements are great, too, both the new and the old.  For starters, the new laser weapons are fun to use, and the new cryo element adds the satisfaction of shattering enemies in a variety of ways.  The character classes are all interesting, too; the first game didn't stray too far from the old wizard/rogue/brick/balanced archetypes, and 2 put those in a blender, but here you have a Captain America/Wonder Woman hybrid, a big dude with an entire skill tree devoted to adding cybernetic enhancements to his body, a sadomasochist cowgirl, a clone who fights with holograms, an aristocrat with ice magic, and Claptrap.  Friggin' Claptrap; I haven't seen a character like this since the goof-offs from Dragon Warrior 3!  The only real drawbacks in the gameplay department are that the challenges haven't had their quantities decreased to meet the much shorter length of the game (not a [i]huge[/i] deal), and that the enemy leveling is a bit aggressive; it wasn't unusual to have massive hordes or even bosses spawn several levels higher than I was, and I did every sidequest available, just like always.  Well, that and once you get toward the end of Helios, they get REALLY carried away with escort missions; can we just finally agree that nobody likes these?

The visuals are just unbelievable; the amount of thought put into the environments is jaw-dropping.  I've been on plenty of video game moons before, but I wouldn't hesitate to say that Elpis is the best of them all.  There's something romantic about going to the moon, standing alone on a pale, rocky surface as you stare up into space with all manner of celestial objects scintillating above, like a black-sand beach glimmering in the midday sun, and they completely nailed that.  Space is also terrifying, so by day, the surface is an uncomfortable shade of yellow, and above you is a black void of burning horror; they nailed that, too.  What really ties it all together is the music, which sounds appropriately spacey at times, and just desolate and unfriendly at others.  You get some neat high-tech areas, and the scav weapons - the bandit analog, and the only ones that really look different from Borderlands 2 - have some cool patterns, but the real star of the show is the surface of that moon.

The story's not bad; its job was to fill in some of the blanks between the first 2 Borderlands games, and it does that very well, with a few surprises here and there.  It was interesting selecting player characters from a pool of NPCs you already knew from previous games, and they're fleshed out a bit more here; they even respond to certain NPC dialogue.  What really stands out is the uncomfortable atmosphere of most of the game; there are very few moments of the usual over-the-top lunacy that you've come to know from previous entries, for one thing.  For another, many familiar faces are replaced with new ones; Nurse Nina really grew on me, and Janey Springs has her moments, but you miss Dr. Zed and Scooter.  Concordia is no Sanctuary, either; rather than feeling like your own base - like home - you're just in some run-down spaceport where even the random NPCs are largely hostile toward or at least dismissive of you.  I think that's the point, though; it wasn't going to be Borderlands 2-2, because you're technically playing as the bad guys, and you know that going in.  If you loved Chrono Trigger/Secret of Mana and hated Cross/Evermore, you're probably not going to like the tone of this, either, but if you're willing to try something a bit different, there's a lot of good to be found here.

There isn't much in the way of DLC this time; you have 2 new characters, 2 expansions that are nothing more than arena modes, and one more expansion that's actually quite good.  If you play any of the expansions, Claptastic Voyage is the way to go; you take a trip into the mind of Claptrap, and while that goes largely as expected, there are a few very cool surprises, too.  The early areas are very cool futuristic cyber environments, and they're really neat to explore.  What comes later, though are some old memories, some new memories, and one of those ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"" types of deals.  These are great on their own, but they don't entirely ditch the cyber elements, so the end result is a unique and [b]gorgeous[/b] experience all the way to the end.  As expected, the story and tone are partially humorous, but also awkward and uncomfortable; what better way to cap off an experience like The Pre-Sequel.",1608223232,1608223232,True,1,0,0.526749014854431152,0,True,False,False

It tried so hard to be a further telling of the backstory to BL2 and to play just like it...but it falls flat on it's face. 

Got nothing against Australians, but a little less Australia in my SPACE ALIEN GUN LOOT game would have been a nice touch.

Also, the main Antagonist was awful, can't believed they even bothered to write lines for her, didn't see a point to someone talking when they are featured for only the entirety of 5 minutes. 

Bland, boring, overly-Australian characters and no real new gameplay and deceptiveley linear environments made this a waste of money for me. Won't even bother bearing through the Claptastic Voyage after this. 

Use your money to buy Borderlands 1 and/or 2 and all the DLC's instead.

This past weekend, we finally finished the main game, and now have gone back again in True Vault Hunter Mode to see what that has in store for us.

We've been having a [i]lot[/i] of fun with the game.  The game does not have a lot of big UI or engine differences from [i]Borderlands 2[/i], except for four, and those range from pretty fun to really fun.

[h1]The Additions[/h1]
First, they've introduced cryo as an element type: after you freeze then melee-shatter your first enemy, you'll be hooked too.

Second, large areas of the game are low gravity, which means your character can jump a long, long way.  In combination with the Oz kits (oxygen kits for breathing in those areas without air), the low gravity also allows for double-jumps (for extra floaty spacetime fun) and for gravity slams (""butt slams""), where you power your character downward from a low-gravity jump by releasing oxygen from their kit and then slam into the ground, knocking back any nearby enemies.  (Oz Kits also come with elemental modifications so you can do, for example, electrical or corrosive butt slams.)

Third, they've included a new weapon type: lasers.  Lasers vary anywhere from single-shot and burst-shot varieties into a full, continuous beam I like to call ""firehose mode"", which can be a great deal of fun, too -- just point and spray damage at your enemies.

Fourth, but not least, there is a new vehicle -- the Stingray.  There is the standard two-person, four-wheeled vehicle which, in [i]B:TPS[/i], called the Moon Buggy (or the Moon Zoomy). but the Stingray is a single-person hovercraft that can jump and slam; think of it like a space bike.

[h1]The Characters and Classes[/h1]
There are four classes to play in the base game; as they introduce them, we have Athena as the Gladiator, Wilhelm as the Enforcer, Nisha as the Lawbringer, and Claptrap as a Mistake.

Athena you may remember as an NPC from [i]The Secret Armory of General Knoxx[/i] DLC.  Athena's skills focus on shotgun and SMG, with her special ability being the Aspis, a shield that absorbs damage coming from in front of her and can be thrown to deal damage — in fact, this shield is why her preferred weapons are the point-and-shoot variety rather than the precise-aiming variety since, with the Aspis out, she cannot zoom in for a scoped shot.

Wilhelm you may recall as an NPC from [i]Borderlands 2[/i] where he was the first major boss faced by the Vault Hunters in that game.  Wilhelm's skills focus on heavy weapons, especially lasers (but he's pretty good with all guns).  His special ability is Wolf and Saint: Wolf is an aggressive attack drone and Saint is a passive support drone, and they can get quite powerful.

Nisha may be remembered as the Sheriff of Lynchwood in [i]Borderlands 2[/i].  Her general focus is on pistols, and her special ability, Showdown, puts her in an auto-aim mode that drastically increases her gun damage, fire rate, accuracy, reload speed, and bullet speed.  Her skill tree allows her to dual wield pistols, as well, though she does loose the right-mouse aim mode when doing this.

Finally, there's CL4P-TP, who needs really no introduction as Claptrap.  Except he's actually FR4G-TP -- the same Claptrap as the Interplanetary Ninja Assassin Claptrap from the [i]Claptrap's New Robot Revolution[/i] DLC.  Was he meant as a serious character and class?  It's hard to say but do note that in choosing Claptrap as your character, you have to confirm  more than once that this is what you really want to do.  Claptrap's special ability is VaultHunter.EXE, a somewhat random collection of things that occur when the ability is triggered -- some may be quite effective, others humorous, and some potentially disastrous.  His skill tree is equally ludicrous, with specializations of ""Boomtrap"" (explosive damage and guns), ""I Love You Guys!"" (support), and ""Fragmented Fragtrap"" (rewarding versatility and adaptability as his strengths and weaknesses periodically change).

[h1]The Milieu[/h1]
[i]B:TPS[/i] takes place on Pandora's moon, Elpis, and on the Hyperion space station that you can see in the sky in the other Borderlands games (you know, that giant H-shaped satellite by the moon).  Time-wise, the story takes place between [i]Borderlands[/i] and [i]Borderlands 2[/i] -- in playing [i]B:TPS[/i] you get to find out what happened to Brick, Mordecai, Lilith, and Roland from the original game in the immediate aftermath of the Vault's opening, and what made Handsome Jack (and Wilhelm and Nisha) into the characters you meet in [i]Borderlands 2[/i].  Some old favorites make appearances as well -- Moxxi in particular shows up as the proprietor of Moxxi's Up Over (a pub on the moon).  It can be a little confusing at first, though, because the story you're experiencing is actually being told to Lilith by Athena after the events of [i]Borderlands 2[/i].

While the bulk of Pandora's denizens in the first two games are voiced with American accents, Elpis is, apparently, Pandora's Oceania.  A good many of the accents are Australian, and a lot of the jokes and references are Australian, too.  This is fairly pervasive, from the O2 kits being called ""Oz Kits"", place names such as Burraburra, and ""Springy Shiela"" grenade mods, to talk of billabongs, jumbucks, and tuckerbags, and a roving enemy known as the Swagman.  While some people seem to really hate this aspect of the voice acting and find the thick Aussie accents distracting or annoying, I find it pretty charming and a nice change from the North American hicks and rednecks of [i]Borderlands[/i] and [i]Borderlands 2[/i].

[h1]The Game[/h1]
The game itself seemed a little short to me, but not so short that it's ""just another DLC"" as some complain.  It can actually take a lot of time to do all the side quests and to work on challenges and achievements, if you're a die-hard completionist.  The extra game features and four new classes add enough that it's definitely a whole new game in the franchise.  I think the ""too short"" impression mostly comes about because the writing in the latter third or fourth of the game seems rushed and a little disjointed, and those story missions are prone to push, push, push you through too far quickly if you let their intense urgency get to you.

There are some annoying aspects.  There are bugs that really should've been worked out by now, and by this I primarily mean mobs clipping into walls where they can shoot your character but not, apparently, be shot by your toon.  And it's bad that it's so damned easy to fall through the scenery and die that I've done it at least a dozen times just in the course of normal hunt-for-Vault-symbols style exploration.  A few days ago my co-op partner and I took down one of the ""secret"" boss mobs only to find that it was bugged, and didn't spawn the exit it was supposed to, and so our characters had to die to get out of its lair which shouldn't happen.  My co-op partner and I also found a too-large number of Challenges that could only be triggered by one character in the zone (we had to reload the zone for the other of us to be able to get it) and at least one that I have not been able to complete even though he got the completion on it when my character picked up the fifth of the five necessary items.

Still, if you like the Borderlands series, this is more of the same and you will enjoy it, and it's actually a very fun ride to boot.",1415564534,1606571905,True,6,0,0.581287920475006104,4,True,False,False

The movement in this game feels even less restrictive than Borderlands 2 with all of its low-gravity environments (and the little speederbike - called a Stingray - you get later on, love that thing). The lazer weaponry was a lot of fun to play around with, legendary weapons all felt extremely unique, and the final boss was one heck of a fight. The voice acting was great.

I played as Nisha in my playthrough and honestly her Ability is so much fun to use - if a little short-lived compared to the others. Her other class bonuses make up for this though. Even while playing BL3, I often find myself missing Nisha's abilities and still wishing I could be using them to play the other games now. By far my favorite playstyle in the Borderlands Franchise. Her voice lines were also great - she was a bad guy through and through, playing an Antihero like her is a lot of fun.

The charisma of characters from BL2 ( especially Jack) are so impressive that it overshadows anyone else in this game. 
BL TPS has a much more developed and well-designed balances and level-scaling, i.e. few characters' essential gears are obtained from the mainstory; better drop rates; manageable fights with outleveled weapons. (Meaning: less grindy and more smooth game experience). Skill designs for all 6 main characters are really fun (especially Fragtrap's/Claptrap's); background story, relationships and characteristics of most characters in the game are either directly or indirectly depicted or implied in side quests. 
(Yes, Homage to the long gone 2K Aussie)

The issue most complain about is regarding its small volume: short story (of a DLC scale in BL2), little to no end game content.

You get it? Like BOOB? Fantastic. Also some SJW nonsense going on, with characters reminding you which sexuality they like the most and feminist BS showing up in needless places. Bosses are also much worse then BL2, they are not creatively interesting and barely have any relevance to the plot. The only cool one was the final boss. Replacing slag with ice was a good idea, but the oxygen tanks need to go. You've effectively turned an open world into a giant underwater level where you have to monitor your breath. This is not Subnautica survival game, this is a shooter. Levels are also pointlessly large and amazingly empty. Side quests are generic and unfunny and seek only to waste time, and you may have to complete a few as this game has quite a few difficulty spikes. The main characters (besides the DLC bimbo) are actually well crafted and their skills and skill trees are interesting to invest in, it's a shame that they were wasted in this garbage story, which we already have a pretty decent understanding of seeing as how it's a prequel.

If You'r a fan of the franchise (like me) - i recommend it. You wont regret it.
If You'r new to BL universe, don't start with this game. Get BL1 first to check if You like this madhouse. 

If Yoy play'd Borderland 1 and/or 2 You know what to expect. It will be exactly that what You've faced in 2nd part + a lot more low grav conditions.
Something new are vacuum areas where You need to watch for air reserve. In exchange for Slag-element from 2nd game here we have Ice-ellement that slows down or even freezes enemies completly.
The game seems to be shorter then BL2 but longer than BL1. 
Storywise... well... Since it tells the story set between 1 & 2 we know what will happen and how it has to end. The scenarios for BL1 & BL2 where IMO great, because they had a lot of turns of action and whre generally unpredictable. Here this element is lost, but it's a prequel as the title says.

I understand that it is probably silly to moralize about forcing someone to do something against their will in a game where you blow people into bloody chunks, but here we are.  

This moment was clearly meant to be a story beat to develop Jack from who he was at the beginning of the game to who he is in BL2, but it isn't Jack taking the action, it is you. In order to progress, you have to choose to carry out his orders even though your own character's voice over says its a crappy thing to do.  So instead I uninstalled the game and dropped it into the ""will never play"" bin in my steam library.

As far as the gameplay goes, it was fun enough if you enjoy the other BL games (I've completed 1 & 2) but not super compelling.  I may have lost my tolerance for grinding as I've grown older, but it definitely seemed to weigh this game more than I remember from the earlier entries.  The weapons didn't feel as varied or as impactful as I remember, and there seems to be a lot more junk/grinder fodder.

If I hadn't run into this narrative issue, I would probably have finished the game and given it a moderate recommendation (in the realm of a 6/10 unless there was a significant improvement or decline in the latter part of the game).

I said this in my Borderlands 2 review and I'll say it in this review, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel's gameplay and balancing is terrible. I know leveling up is a part of the game because it's a RPG, but I think other RPG's like Fallout 4 and Elder Scrolls Skyrim does things better when it comes to a level up system. With Fallout 4 and Elder Scrolls Skyrim you can play through the main quest without leveling up to lets say 30 just to progress in the story, but Borderlands the Pre-Sequel you have to grind your way through the main quest. And yes I know the whole point of an RPG is to grind, but I think that type of grind only works with side quests only instead of the main quest(as in side quests are optionable). 

If you want more info about the gameplay just go read my Borderlands 2 review, the gameplay is practically identical.

Then when you switch to the harder mode things start one shotting you and the gameplay feels like a mess.  Definitely the worst of the lot so far.

Issues I have with this game are:
Grenade spam, every freaking thing throws grenades and they are dead on with their aim.  Even if they don't see you.
Enemies shooting through walls.
Enemies move about two to three times as fast as you.
Enemies spaz out, they move very strange and it doesn't feel right at all.
Bullet Sponges, what is up with the amount of bullets I have to pump into enemies?
Enemies bugging out or falling through the world. 
Getting stuck, way too many places are traps that you just get stuck in.

It is like they took the previous two games and sucked the fun out of them.

EDIT:
Just played through the DLC, and yup just as terrible as the rest of the game.  I am really disappointed with this entire experience.

Video lag
Falling through the map
Really bad bullet sponges, I mean terrible design
There idea of a boss fight is make you fight the same boss 3 times in a row, great idea! Well designed!

In order to appreciate how bad the level design is you have to understand that there is a persistent low gravity mechanic, complete with a double jump. It's slow.

Also the writing is not great, the game does not advance the overall Borderlands story in any meaningful way. Before playing this I knew from Borderlands 2 mentions that Jack became the CEO of Hyperion and eliminated all the Claptraps. When playing this I've seen him do just that, but he kinda just does it.
 
To my point about balancing: try searching the web for tips on leveling your character. When one of the top suggestions is ""play the first mission over and over"", there may be something wrong with the game.

Far and away better than the turd that is Borderlands 3.

You also get more Handsome (or in this game for the most part just 'Jack') Jack in a story that whilst not amazing does a decent job of explaining who Jack is, why is is and how he got to where he is.

[h1] 💻 Description: [/h1]
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a very underrated game that unfortunately got the title of the ‘Black Sheep’ in the family. Even though, the concept of space as well as the introduction of new playable characters (including  fr**cking Claptrap) was an interesting idea, that alone was not enough to satisfy the needs of the [b] hungry [/b] fanbase. According to many the game offers nothing more than the same concept and style of it’s predecessor, making all the hype and wait for nothing. I beg to defer for so many reasons!

[h1] 📖 Plot: [/h1]
The plot by far hands down [b] the best [/b] that the franchise has ever offered. Not only you get to know the backstory of Handsome Jack, as well as other important characters, but you also  explore the moral dilemmas and the reasons that Pandora quote: “Ain’t no place for a hero”. The concept of space is very appealing, there all lots of quests that make you die laughing and genuinely have an amazing time. Loot, guns, more guns, blood and original jokes, all are included and well mixed in the package, as expected from a Borderlands game.

[h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1]
There are some twists here and there that make Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel unique to it’s own way. A good example is the newly added gravity/O2 limitation. Even though, the art style remains the same, the introduction of the grinder, the oz kit as well as a new type of weapon and effect are the main recipes that lead to [b] fun [/b]. Like any other Borderlands  game it focuses on hard grinding and repetition, so don’t be afraid to grab a friend and start the adventure.

[h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1]
Borderlands the Pre-Sequel had a very bad start in the beginning. Non farmable bosses as well as many bugs made the overhyped fanbase mad, which in the end led to the game’s downfall. It  was supposed to be a completely new Borderlands experience, considering the time passed into making it, but unfortunately it could not live up to the expectations.

[h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1]
Overall, I really like The Pre-Sequel, the price may be little spicy, but that's not a problem for our good friend [b] steam [/b] here. I highly recommend for players not familiar with the franchise to start with [b] this [/b] game, before moving to Borderlands 2, in order to enjoy it's full potential!",1601539190,1602261486,True,26,0,0.738008499145507813,5,True,False,False

+Lazers (but it's kinda clunky in use and not really interesting)
+Cryo weapons (fun)
+Glitched (DLC) mechanics is great and should be added/expanded in any way in Borderlands 3
+You got to see what happend before Jack went nuts and story shows you a different perspective.

-Game is short. About 8-10 hours short if you skip most side quests.
-Writing is so bad it hurts.
-Where's all the humour?! It's gone!
-Classes are so immesurably boring after Borderlands 2. After Krieg or Gage the only interesting dude here is...a robot. But it's mostly for coop play.  So out of all characters only Wilhelm and Fragtrap are somewhat okay-ish in terms of skill trees. Athena is really well balanced, but boring in terms of gameplay. Also, she's like Roland, but female. I wanted to say ""she has the same boring personality that Rolad possess"", but you can't use ""Roland"" and ""personality"" in the same sentence.
-Season pass is a cash grab. Buy it only on discount.
-Unlockable skins and heads are quite bland. Default heads are the best.
-Also a couple of words about car controls and quests with time limits: they fucking suck cock ass cunt bitch the fuck who even came up with that fucking shitty idea that it would be great??!

You should give this game a try, but only when it's on a discount. For a full price? NO.

But in the end I decided no, you shouldn't. This game is no where as good as Borderlands 2 and I don't think anyone should support 2k, Gearbox, or Take-Two.
So first we have the bad map design… It’s just not fun. It’s hard to explain why, but I can say near the start of the game it expects you to jump over death pits with a car using turbo boost. Now… the cars in this game suck. Their handling sucks. And multiple times I couldn’t make it because right before I jumped I hit some small rock that slowed me to my death. Also the main hub area sucks because it has this top side to it that is pointless and no one uses. 
Moonstone chests are a good idea since they give the user extra buffs on their weapons, but there is no confirmation screen if you want to open them. Meaning when I first saw one I just mashed open and lost all my moonstones without knowing. 
On multiple occasions I have had sound effects and dialog break on me in story missions. One time I left a story mission and went back only to find an important door you need to open to proceed was broken because I left.
None of the bosses feel unique and you have a lot less bosses in this game than in Borderlands 2.
The whole oxygen system, and the ground pound abilities just annoying and useless. 
Lastly we have the skills… A lot of them don’t seem that fun and none of the characters are really balanced… Not to mention a lot of them aren’t funny and lack personality when they talk during missions. A big flaw I noticed is some of the skills actually require you to be playing with another person to use. As in… they have no buffs and are pointless to get if you play single player.",1521146170,1601203418,False,6,0,0.590470194816589355,0,True,False,False

The game takes place before borderlands 2 and after borderlands 1 so right in the middle.  The story is about how jack became handsome jack. For the whole game, you are on the moon of pandora while some crazy ass bitch is trying to blow it up with Hyperions mining Lazer thing. You have to play it yourself it understand. The game is basically borderlands two without gravity. Most of the enemies are just remodels and every character pretty much has the same voice actor. There isn't that much creativity its like the game was made just to fill a gap of the story and not for the actual gameplay after a while it feels like you are playing a dumbed-down version of borderlands 2. The story isn't that long, the sidequest takes up most of your time. With the other Borderlands games, I felt motivated to go and 100% the game on every character. With the pre-sequel, I only feel motivated to beat it with one character (Athena, the one telling the story and the one you are supposed to play as). There isn't any replayability is what I am trying to say. It doesn't feel like you can grind it either there is one type of new weapon that's a laser but that's it. Everything else is just copy-pasted from the previous games. Buying the DLC's isn't worth it either since the game technically tells you to play with Athena and the story DLC... Good luck making it past the original story first. Was the most boring one out of all. there are 3 parts. The context part. the preparation mission and the end. But it stretches it out and adds a bunch of unnecessary additions into it that makes it feel more like a task than a mission. I didn't really enjoy it at all because of that. They probably could've made this whole game into a 5-minute cutscene. Which is funny cause it pretty much is. The game starts with Lilith brick and mortice capturing Athena and asking her why she helped jack, then you play through her memory the whole game. That's what I mean by it is kind of forcing you to play athena cause that's who's eyes your seeing it through. Also the whole game you can hear the voices of the characters talking which ruins the emersion (not like there was any)

As a fan of Borderlands 2, it's fun. If you've never played Borderlands 2, play it first. The Pre-Sequel brings a lot of new loot, while still having the Borderlands' trademark looting style. As far as combat, the whole ""space"" fighting style is easy to get used to, but hard to master. Kind of like BL2. The story, however, is quite a treat for Borderlands fans, although confusing at times. Seeing Handsome Jack's past shows a completely new perspective on him, and gives his character more depth. Characters are refreshing and unique, with good overall design. They also all tie to the Borderlands world closely, which is cool. Assuming you didn't buy the Handsome Collection (you should), the character DLCs are also well designed but not 100% worth it. Other DLCs aren't the best, but with the campaign being shorter than BL2 and there being less side-quests, getting them can be quite worth it depending on how much you enjoyed the game. Buy this game when it's on sale.

Overall, 10/10 Brands on Handsome Jack's Face",1601029568,1601029568,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But it's not going to be everyone's [i]cup of tea[/i] for a few reasons.[list]
[*] [b]Borderlands burnout[/b]—This game originally came out in a time when most people were [i]still[/i] playing Borderlands 2 and “more of the same but slightly different” wasn't enough to grab people when they had already been saturated.
[*] [b]Triton Flats[/b]—This is an area right off of Concordia (the main city) that is needlessly convoluted and rife with environmental hazards that will get you insta-killed if you're not paying attention. There are also 2 very noticeable things beyond that, lack of nearby fast travel locations and a heightened sense of level scaling. Triton Flats acts as a sort of HUB area just outside of Concordia. Kind of like Fyrestone in Borderlands 1—so you'll be galumphing through this area repeatedly. [b]Makes the first 3-6 hours a bit of a slog.[/b]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198126740
[*] O2 kits are required for all air breathing characters. This isn't as bad or annoying as it seems at first. But it's something you need to manage in addition to everything else and that won't sit well with people that like exploring. However, O2 veins, canisters and any place inside an airlock you can refill your O2. It's not really an issue unless you're boosting every 2 seconds.[/list]

[h1]Pacing is all over the place.[/h1]
The game is set on Elpis, Pandora's moon. And Helios, the big space station that orbits it is bombarding the moon with a giant laser. It's heavily implied that this is destroying the moon. The intro of the game is such that Jack is no longer in control of Helios because Colonel  Zarpedon of Dahl has taken it over. So you feel some amount of urgency to stop this laser and retake Helios. But you'll find a bunch of humorous quest givers the series is known for in the meantime. Someone asking you to raise a flag while he salutes it and asks you to protect him from waves and waves of enemies for example. Making the game feel slightly disjointed. 

[h1]The story of this game is largely how Handsome Jack became a sort of 'Joker' archetype.[/h1]
The quests in this game have a loose undertone of Jack's slow decent into madness. Taking place in between the events Borderlands 1 and 2. You might have noticed Jack wears a mask and isn't the most respectable personality in BL2—You play as a Vault Hunter, as in any of the other games, but under Jack's employ in this.

[h1]Laser Beams, Physics and Cryostasis on Elpis.[/h1]
In Pre-Sequel, slag isn't a usable commodity yet—despite being in Borderlands 2. Instead, Pre-Sequel introduces laser type weapons which can include all sorts of variables. Typically having sustained fire multiplying damage. As well as a new 'element' in being able to do cryo damage. Expectedly, you can freeze people. And they'll shatter like a Martin Finnegan art project from Bioshock. Additionally, due to being able to boost around with your O2 kit combined with the low gravity, you're able to freeze people 'mid-flight' and have them fall to the ground for extra damage. 

You can also find O2 kits with variable stat boosts dependent on whether or not you're in a vacuum. There are still class mods and shields but O2 kits behave more like relics from Borderlands 2. And [u][b]this whole game does feel like Borderlands 2 DLC.[/b][/u] I still hold Borderlands 1 higher than the rest as weapon proficiencies actually mattered in that. You'd get accuracy, damage and recoil reduction the more you used a certain gun type. Pre-Sequel borrows the BL2 model in having “Badass” tokens earned from doing challenges. A system I don't really care for.

As mentioned, some of the game takes place on Helios itself. So you'll revisit familiar places from BL2. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198128590

Eridium is replaced with Moonstone. The currency you use to buy the ability to hold more ammo, or backpack/bank slots. Additionally, moonstones can be used in the grinder in conjunction with weapons, shields or grenade mods.  Stuff that you'd most likely sell otherwise. Moonstones can increase the value of what comes out of the grinder. A sort of slot machine that costs items instead of money.

[i][b]THE GIST:
Pre-Sequel is understandably more polarizing than its predecessors. But I think it's more unique in what it does with the minute to minute fights. The verticality of the combat, popping helmets/air supply of enemies. It feels markedly different. And at the time of writing this, I've not played Borderlands 3 and don't know anything about it. This game feels very much like the Civilization Beyond Earth to Civilization V if you catch my drift. But it has it's own thing going on.[/b][/i]
[quote]If you've read this far, consider following my curation — [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/28295405/]Station Argus[/url][/quote]

There are other places in the game that are cool in theory. Nice [i]set piece[/i] moments. But in practice they very nearly become obnoxious to traverse repeatedly to complete side missions. Such as the 'Veins of Helios'.

The latter works to keep players from hunkering down in one spot for fear of running out of air. The lack of atmosphere also affects fire weapons (you can't exactly catch fire without oxygen, can you?) and lasers, this game's new weapon type, adding another layer of strategic complexity to familiar situations. The low gravity part of the equation, however, was more of a miss.

Moon jumps, and the new double jump supported by spending a little precious oxygen, were never quite as satisfying as they seemed like they should be. Worse, this new mechanic encouraged adding more platforming-styled challenges to the mix which first person shooters are just not built for. Most areas are filled with bottomless holes, meaning any enemy charge could result in instant death and there will be plenty of enemy charges. Everything from bandits to torks were designed around the prevalence of low gravity, so just about every one of them wants to leap across the map and appear right behind you. It seemed like there was always someone behind me, a problem I don't remember having in the previous two games. It does make the combat more frantic and fast-paced, but at the cost of eliminating any control the player previously had over the battlefield. This is especially annoying while playing as Athena whose action skill is designed around blocking only the damage that hits the shield in front of her.

Athena is also the one that tells the game's story, a good choice as she occupies a moral middle ground in a game that isn't shy about its heroes being villains. However, using a player character's recollections to narrate the game's events means when playing as any other character the game won't quite match up with her commentary. Not that the storyline is the focus of this game or any other in the Borderlands series. And for that reason, I was surprised to find that the True Vault Hunter Mode playthrough, while not actually changing any events, did change who Athena was telling the story to, thus adding a slightly different flavor to what is usually just a retread with a more powerful character. 

Other than those handful of improvements, as double-edged as they may be, The Pre-Sequel is exactly what you've come to expect from the Borderlands series: a mad world full of zany characters, a group of Vault Hunters who are just different enough to warrant trying them all, and more guns than an American doomsday prepper has ever seen in his entire life.",1598909047,1598909047,True,2,0,0.504320979118347168,0,True,False,False

I went in with a rather lukewarm expectation due to a lot of the hate I see for this game, but it really surpassed most of my expectations. It really is just Borderlands 2.5, but that’s not really a bad thing. The addition of low-grav jumping and ground-pounding adds verticality to the combat, which makes things even more chaotic than before. 

The story is actually pretty interesting too. I was super distracted in the beginning by the Aussie accents, but after a few hours, I grew pretty accustomed to it. After thinking on it a bit, it kind of makes sense lore-wise, since the inhabitants of the moon are on a different “planet” so to speak, so it would make sense for its inhabitants to speak a different language or have a different accent...or maybe it was just more cost-effective for 2K Australia to use Aussie VAs. 

I really didn’t like how under-leveled our characters were without grinding through some of the side quests. Nearing the end of the game, at level 21, the next mission showed that it was [url=https://i.imgur.com/H6rSdMP.jpg]”Impossible.”[/url]. We did maybe 5-7 side quests and really didn’t earn that much XP, so we just went ahead and did the final quest, and yeah, it was pretty fucking hard. I died countless times, but we finished it. I’m not really sure how I feel about the level design for the last mission, [url=https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beginning_of_the_End]“Beginning of the End.”[/url] For one, it was extremely pretty, but it just felt like it kept going and going for no reason. 

This was my first playthrough of the [i]Pre-Sequel[/i], and I played as Athena. My two other friends played as the Jack Doppelganger and Claptrap. It was considerably shorter than [i]Borderlands 2[/i], but still enjoyable (except for Pickle. Fuck Pickle.) If you’re okay with grinding side quests to be appropriately leveled for the main quests, and you’re looking for more Borderlands 2, then this was a lot of fun to play through with friends. 

Finally, here’s my [url=https://imgur.com/a/FKZGPpU]1440p ultrawide screenshot album for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel[/url].

Pretty much a spin-off game, but it still got the same core gunplay mechanics like previous titles. Choose your character, team up with friends and loot and shoot your way on Elpis, Pandora's moon.

Lillith interrogates Athena, a former Vault Hunter, after the events of Borderlands 2 as Athena relays her time as a Vault Hunter, which took place before Borderlands 2....I know it's a little complicated just pretend that the whole thing's a prequel honestly it's easier that way. Walk in the boots of four new(?) Vault Hunters, all of which are faces you've seen before: Athena the Gladiator, Wilhelm the Enforcer, Nisha the Lawbringer, and Claptrap the Fragtrap. A new vault has been discovered IN SPACE, and you've been tasked with uncovering it before the Dahl Corporation (I think?) gets there first! At the same time, you'll be working alongside some other familiar faces, including Roland, Lillith, and John, better known as Handsome Jack. Watch as John starts as a lowly Hyperion intern and ascends the corporate ladder and descends into madness, turning from friend to foe as the allure of power corrupts him.

Story-wise, it's pretty cool. It's interesting to see the origins of some famous BL2 villains, especially Handsome Jack, and the connections made between BL2 and TPS are quite interesting as you see some loose ends tied up. The involvement of aliens and the Eridian beings gets a little surreal at some points, and tbh I still don't quite understand some of their intentions and all, but it's a really cool break from all the very real, very redneck nonsense of the original BL games. 

Gameplay, it's for the most part pretty similar to BL2, but it's in SPACE. Low gravity is enabled in some environments, and in addition to a health and shield bar, you'll also have an oxygen meter. Oz kits replace relics in this game, providing unique benefits to consuming oxygen and your ground slam and jetpack moves, which you can use by consuming oxygen. Don't run out of oxygen though, or else your health will drain, unless if you're Claptrap, cause ya know, he's a robot (Claptrap also takes increased corrosive damage and reduced fire damage by default). Eridium has been replaced with Moonstone, though they function pretty much the same. Slag has not been discovered yet as a weapon element, but Cryo has been introduced, which slows and eventually freezes your enemies solid, and it's honestly my favorite element ever besides Explosive. Guns are relatively unremarkable, some neat legendaries but there's not a whole lot to comment on, it's much of the same of BL2. Laser guns however are super fucking cool and I want more of them. TPS does have significantly less raid bosses though, so if that's your thing, sorry.

The DLC for this game is pretty good in my opinion. The Claptrap story DLC is personally one of my favorite DLC's in the BL franchise, good story, good gameplay, and the new Glitch weapons are a lot of fun to use. Fair warning though, the final boss of the DLC is incredibly difficult, so get ready for them. Timothy the Doppleganger is a really fun character, and Aurelia  the Baroness seems like a really cool one as well (more about them next paragraph).

I think the characters in this game are super fun to play as. I personally have played as Claptrap, Wilhelm, and Timothy, though I've seen all of their gameplay before in videos. Claptrap is an incredibly fun spin-the-wheel type character where every fight turns into an absolute fiesta of nonsense, Wilhelm is a pretty cool take on Axton from BL2, and Timothy is a lot of fun with cool clones while also ""playing"" as Handsome Jack. Athena can be an elemental goddess or a melee warrior with destructive power, seems pretty fun. Nisha is a high caliber outlaw with damage levels nearing Salvador's from BL2. Aurelia is from what I understand an elemental sniper or a kinda gimmicky co-op mechanic, with another skill tree specifically dedicated to turning a co-op partner into your ""bitch"". All of the characters have some pretty cool skills, and I think Claptrap and Timothy have some of the coolest and most unique skill trees of the Borderlands series.

A TL;DR and some PROS/CONS-
PROS:
-Some of the same fun gameplay of BL2
-SPACE AND MOONS AND STUFF
-New cryo element is awesome
-Very fun characters to play as
-One of the better BL games to play with co-op partners
-LASER GUNS
CONS:
-Not a whole lot of ""new stuff"" introduced
-Story is kinda eh
-The game is often very geared towards co-op players, with dialogue addressing multiple people and entire skills and skill trees dedicated to co-op play
-Few raid bosses
-Relatively tame legendaries

TL;DR I think it's a pretty good time. It's definitely not the BL game you'll sink the most time into, but if you're looking for something just a little different to spice things up every now and then, go ahead and pick it up for $25 or less. 7.5/10

EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention, this game was produced by 2K Australia, meaning a SIGNIFICANT portion of the new voice acting is from people with heavy Australian or similar accents. This can be a CON as for some people the heavy redneck Australian accents can become very annoying after several hours of play.

Good game that could have been great.

Plays better than borderlands 2, new playable characters are absolutely AWESOME to play, Playable characters now have unique dialouge through the entire game, and balancing is better in some areas, but it lacks environment variety and is VERY lacking in content compared to BL2. Game still has three playthroughs, but only one (Really good) DLC campaign, few farmable bosses (Most legendaries dont have an assigned drop, so you will need to learn to use the grinder), and the sidequests are not as enjoyable as they are in two. The endgame feels really repetitive (even if UVHM here isnt as bullshit as it is in 2). Unless you are like me and willing to playthrough the same exact campaign dozens of times just to see how every character plays at high level, you probably will only play through the game once. However, that one playthrough will be very enjoyable. Low gravity gives you a LOT more mobility, the new oz kits are much more fun than relics were, lasers are dope, and again, each characters skill trees are AMAZING.",1597366623,1597366623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ok, ok to be honest its not all bad. The Pre sequel is a flashback tale told by the Athena the gladiator, (not to be confused with captain americas apprentice) and the action takes place predominantly on Pandora's moon, Elpis. Here, Jack unites the vault hunters - Athena the (Marvel didnt copyright shield tossing) gladiator, Wilhelm the (im addicted to body mods, and drone spawning) enforcer, Nisha the (I have 2 pistols!) gunslinger, and Fragtrap the (Bask in the warmth of my humorous references!) Claptrap unit. The main filling of this fps rpg omfg shooter is the storyline of the Lost Legion (crazy dahl military rogues) from destroying  the moon, and witness Jack become more and more sadistic and psychotic.

As you might expect, the story is packed with humor, although most of it was weak, with Jack and claptrap once again providing the majority of the laughs, even with his more sympathetic characterization, and his gradual acceptance of a more sadistic way of doing things is amusing - and somewhat disturbing - to witness. The rest of the characters do eventually become relatable, and you start to see how the story of borderlands 2 developed, but this is lost in what was a poor attempt at adding to the borderlands universe.

The technical issues of this game were abhorrent, painful and game breaking, to the point I had to use multiple strategies to fix.
From early on in the game there are visual glitches, ridiculous amounts of clipping and pathcollision problems (both I and NPCsMobs getting stuck, etc). The framerate stuttered at times, connection problems were frequent (even on a local network), the ping was uncomfortably high most of the time and the lag was insulting. Not what I would expect from a title in an established franchise. 

Then there's the 'in your face' sexuality. The seemingly arbitrary homosexual references really pissed me off. For example, Janey Springs is a lesbian, so is Baroness Hammerlock (Sir Hammerlocks sister), and this sexual acceptance was alluded to more than once, like a lot, like they were trying too hard to make it known, like staging lgbt pride outside of Westboro Baptist Church. Sir Hammerlock is also referred to as gay. I get that 2K and gearbox are pro LGBT and I also get that the developers are Australian. But this adds nothing of comedy value to the game, unlike what was achieved within Borderlands 2. Not that I have anything against LGBT people, but I find it very insulting that the writers had to shoehorn another gay character in there and wave it in my face. I mean, Springs, which I think was one of the few more charming characters, had several dialogue sequences in which the main subject being that she was a lesbian. Great, you're a woman that likes other women. So what? I couldn't care less. If a character's defining trait is their sexual orientation, then you're a horrible writer. 

OMG the humour was dry, bland, and it felt like it was written by Australians, for Australians. Clearly 2K Australia was screaming for attention with this creation. Elpis is sparsely populated with npcs packing the Australian accent. There's all sorts of Aussie humor from O2 kits refferred to as Oz kits and billabongs to jumbucks. While I miss the usual soundbites, the changes are entertaining in their own right, and help give Elpis its own flavor, trouble is theres too much of the australian flavour. This can be seen as hypocritical, given in the in your face sexualisation of the game. That said, the coincidental fact that characters from previous games all happened to be on the moon at the exact same time - including unlikely folks such as Moxxi and Crazy Earl, it all feels a little bit like a safety net for the developers.

Ill admit that the low gravity mechanic feels like a breath of fresh air its also particularly well implemented. This makes the terrain being much more explorable, and you'll have to inspect every roof of every building to make sure you haven't missed a chest somewhere. Its combat use is very limited. You can do a ground slam but it seems a bit dated after the 50th use. Of course being on the moon means you need oxygen to breathe. The O2 kit implentation is an intriguing mechanic which does emphasis what a player does with there time, and is restrictive of where a player can go. In the time ive spent on the game its a restrictive but quirky mechanic which doesnt offer strong influence on the gameplay. 

The shift code machine in concordia is an interesting change for inputting your shift codes for the highly coveted golden keys, if it actually worked, because it doesnt always work. My advice use the main menu for the shift code entry and not the concordia machine.

The button for 'inspecting' another player is an interesting mechanic for players to show off there loadout, but its a token gesture on this game. Theres no need or requirement of it, it was clearly implented to give the impression of 'innovation' which this game is lacking.

The level design in the 'nudge-nudge wink-wink open world' maps renders the vehicles often useless. In fact, the game forces you to use the low gravityand jumping excessively in areas that could have allowed vehicles. You spend most of your time running and backtracking. Combat is not satisfying enough compared with the critical strike points of enemies in Borderlands 2 and with the world space feeling smaller and more isolated than Borderlands 2, it rapidly 
becomes incredibly repetitive.

The game just doesn't seem to be as funny or as enjoyable as Borderlands 2, and I think I understand why. 

This does not feel like a full game, it feels more like a DLC trying to be a game.

Now I understand that developers are trying to make money. However, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is a blatant squeeze for money in a brazenly insipid way. It’s a paint-by-numbers effort, almost from top to bottom. And thats the sad part, because this game actually introduced new mechanics pushing towards a far greater game, but resulted in wasted potential.

Although I do recommend buying this game, I strongly recommend you buy it when its on sale for less than £15 (including all dlc, skins and extras).",1542885917,1597320500,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

2. The story use a bit of work, it's clear they tried to have a storyline like the 2nd game which isn't too bad it just makes some storylines and characters feel too close to just being remixs of the 2's story, that said i still love the story & characters
3.

Every single playable character is very unique and fun to play with. The guns are as fun and even more unique due to the inclusion of both the amazing cryo element, as well as the laser weapons.

Regarding the Claptastic Voyage, the entire DLC is fun up until the final boss and ending, due to the final boss being a MASSIVE BULLET SPONGE, where you're easily going to run out of ammo during the fight.

The story is fairly engaging (exploring the origin of Handsome Jack was pretty cool), the guns and gameplay were solid with new additions like low gravity, and the visuals were on par with the series.

This is a game you want to play with friends, be it couch-side or online, as it adds a much more enjoyable element to the game. The dialogue and references are still witty, sarcastic, and down-right absurd in just the right places. Normally when a secondary studio (no insult to 2K Australia) takes over an IP, it doesn't do very well. However they seemed to nail just about everything with BLTPS, including an appropriately themed and well executed score.

The only problem my friend and I had with the game is that we went through most of the game without finding much loot better than our own. We traded out items and guns maybe 3 or four times at the most. That's a terribly low amount considering the game prides itself on its loot system and variety and weaponry. It was disappointing to go through the game with hardly any upgrades than from those we got back at level 11 (we ended around level 29).

Overall BLTPS was a fun and solid game with great characters, story, and gunplay, but seemingly broken loot system and bug encounters took away a good portion of the enjoyability of the game.",1596421518,1596421518,True,8,0,0.627446532249450684,0,True,False,False

First, this is a typical Borderlands game. It has the unique and awesome Borderlands comic book style; the graphics are beautiful, and the skill tree is great. Nevertheless, the story is worse than the one in Borderlands 2. Well, the whole game is worse than Borderlands 2 to be honest. 

But let’s take a closer look at it as a standalone title: The controls are fluid, the graphics are nice, the story is solid, and the difficulty is the typical Borderlands difficulty. Unfortunately, this made me really mad. I normally love that the enemies get harder and harder the weaker you are (in terms of level). But the end boss fights in Borderlands: The Presequel were absolutely horrible. 

Let me explain: I have been playing the whole game with a friend of mine. We finished the game in 13 hours (main story and some side quests) even though apparently most people finish the main mission in 18 hours.  The logical consequence was, that our level was way lower than recommended. And I totally get that. I knew that the bosses would be hard, but as a good gamer, I knew that I (/we) could do it. So there we were, both level 24 in front of the first big boss (I won’t explain this any further, because I don’t want to spoiler you). The issue was, that my mate couldn’t deal any damage. No matter what weapon he used. I don’t know if he is just too bad or what the problem was, but I had to fight the end bosses alone. ALL of them. And as you may know, if you played Borderlands, the more you are in a lobby, the harder the enemies get. The boss was therefore twice as strong, but I was alone to fight him (and I was already way too low – concerning my level). Just a short explanation: You will have to fight the boss… let’s say: various times… Many times. 

I somehow was able to finish all the bosses in my first run, but I kept dying and it took me 1 hour to beat all of them. This was just not fun. I know, you could blame me for being lvl 24 in a boss fight and for having a mate that wasn’t able to help, but why the fuck do you need that many bosses? That’s just annoying and not fun anymore.

So, this part really got on my nerves and felt like the worst decision the developers could have taken. In addition, it was very repetitive and the final boss fights were much worse than that epic Borderlands 2 boss fight, that you will never forget.

Other than that, the game was pretty awesome, like the other Borderlands games. It’s just the end that killed it for me… But that doesn’t make the whole game a bad game.

I am curious to play Borderlands 3, as many people criticise it.

If you are new to the Borderlands series, I definitely recommend you playing Borderlands 2. It’s the best one in my decent opinion.",1596292567,1596292567,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Handsome Jack is still great (voice acting + character arc)
+ Fun to see characters before they turn evil
+ Manages to be funny, sometimes
+ Fun with friends
+ Strong art direction (specially the gorgeous skyboxes)
(+ Mostly everything you liked about Borderlands 2 is still here)

Cons:
- Empty, boring maps
- Uninspired, repetitive quests (specially the side quests)
- Feels like DLC for Borderlands 2
- Barely any new gameplay features (the new implementations also feel gimmicky)
- Some inconsistent writing and characters
(- Most of Borderlands 2’s problems are still here, some even got worse)

""Long"" version:
Shortly after [u]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel[/u]’s release it went on a 90-something % sale on Steam. It was clearly a mistake, but I managed to secure my purchase. I got it for 4€.  That being said, I will still review it having the original price in mind.

[u]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel[/u] is brought to us by 2K and it is a prequel to the events of [u]Borderlands 2[/u]. You can choose between 4 playable characters (6 if you have the DLC) - which were all bosses or NPCs from the previous game - and you will follow Handsome Jack’s descent into madness and villainy… IN SPACE! [spoiler]—Featuring glorious 3D stereophonic sound and 3D color by technicolor! — [/spoiler]

The story in this game is serviceable, as Handsome Jack is a compelling character with enough nuance to carry most of it; however, some of the writing is inconsistent; the story seems unfocused at times and some of the characters are poorly written and downright annoying. Having Claptrap as a side character gives you a good dose of wackiness sprinkled throughout the story but having him as a main character proved super obnoxious for me. Some of the other playable characters also lack personality and end up forgettable. I used Athena during my first playthrough and she started off as a wet blanket but got some mild character development later on, not enough to be considered redeemable though. 
While the game can have humor that works, sometimes, a lot of the jokes do not land (I would say 60% of them are just the easiest, laziest kind of jokes).
The side quests are repetitive and make you backtrack plenty of times around the empty, lifeless maps looking for items or enemies and they got boring, really fast.

[u]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel[/u]’s gameplay is just like its predecessor’s. It is chaotic, action-packed and… Not very deep. While the game retains most of the good aspects of the series’ second entry, it also features all of its flaws, some of which have been aggravated.

Each character has a special ability on a cooldown and also gets one Skill Point every time they level up and said points can be spent on three different skill trees that focus on different areas, such as survival, cooldowns or damage over time. It is just like the ones present in [u]Borderlands 2[/u].
The shooting is satisfying but the enemies feel as bullet-spongy as ever. There is no actual strategy to the combat, you spam bullets until your enemies drop, in case you get downed, you have the second-wind mechanic that allows you to get back up on your own if you score a kill before you die. Thing is, this mechanic is lame – some enemies deal absurd amounts of damage and then randomly hide behind walls so there is nothing you can do. Multiplayer alleviates this somewhat, but it is still a poor excuse to mask unbalanced gameplay.
The developers introduced a new movement mechanic in [u]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel[/u] – now you can sort of boost yourself forward with your oxygen tank. This introduction feels like a gimmick. Sure, you can cover greater distances, but maps are also bigger in return; it feels good at first, as it is different from the very grounded movement of the second installment, but it gets tedious after a while. It seems as you are just slowly floating towards the objectives at a snail’s pace.
That oxygen tank I mentioned before also allows you to breathe outside… IN SPACE! Again, a gimmick; it is super annoying when its capacity is low at first and you have to run from breathable area to breathable area and it becomes an obsolete mechanic you do not have to worry about after the first 30 minutes or so. It does allow you to do a ground-pound that sends enemies flying – that was cool, but not that innovative.

Driving is a welcome inclusion to traverse longer distances, but the controls are not that great. There are two vehicle types – a more durable tank-like unit and a sort of hover-bike that is overall faster but weaker.

The game looks good – really good, sometimes. The moon setting allowed the developers to vary the color pallet way more – however, this praise is geared mostly towards the skyboxes, that feature beautiful colors. Everything else, specially the interior areas gave me the “been there, done that” feeling. The enemy design is strong, but they are just slight variations of the creatures that you fought in Pandora.

The soundtrack is fine and voice actors are OK for the most part. Most of them are certainly charismatic. I have grown a bit tired of the constant over-the-top characters of Borderlands and having random characters shout utter non-sense in an attempt at comedy did not really work for me – it might, for other, though.

I managed to get around 90 hours’ worth of content and, considering how much I paid for it, it is certainly worth playing; however, this still feels like DLC, not a full-fledged game that stands on its own. The DLC is also uninspired and feels bland and rehashed from the other two games.

Even though I do not “hate” [u]Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel[/u] I only kept playing it because I did so with friends, but they soon grew tired of it and I ended up playing quite a large chunk of it by myself. What started out as a decent-enough experience with friends that unfortunately felt too familiar, ended up being really boring and generic by the end of my playthroughs.
Certainly recommended on a sale and if you have friends to play it with, but I am not sure how to feel about 2K releasing a game that is a downgrade from the previous installment in terms of story and innovation and charging full price for it and its DLC. Maybe that is why it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Final score: 6 out of 10.

Oz cans are a unique way to make the game have  greater mobility, but they lose their punch when you rarely ever need to worry about the oxygen itself, and they end up functioning like relics anyway. The characters on paper all sound more interesting than the ones in previous games, but in practice all characters just have a ""kill-all"" ability that doesn't really diversify the characters from eachother enough to motivate multiple playthroughs. The level design took the greatest hit from everything carried over from BL2. Where in BL2 you would see gorgeous vistas with varied combat arenas, TPS has two variations of the moon surface, for the entire game. The story is another massive flop. BL2 while having a flawed narrative, still told a uniquely compelling story through it's mistakes, but TPS takes the mistakes too far. The entire plot is contrived as hell, the ""plot-twist"" if you can even call it that, that supposedly turned Jack into who he was in BL2 was contrived to hell and back. It makes established characters seem worse than they actually were, mainly Moxxi and Wilhelm.
The DLCs aren't exactly mind-boggling either. The claptastic voyage is pretty interesting on a first playthrough and incredibly frustratingly long on any repeat ones. The Shockdrop thunderdome is just a repeat of Moxxi's thunderdome from 1 with all of the character removed, and all of the mistakes of that DLC carried over directly. there is no true ""End Game"" state, like with BL2's OP8 and BL3's Mayhem 10, which makes legendaries incredibly pointless too often. The new Cryo element while interesting on it's own, isn't enough to replace the now gone Slag, which made combat in 2 very unique in its own right. Also, TPS has a tiny pool of new Legendaries, mainly Cryo weapons and Oz kits, with about 80% of it's legendary pool being a repeat of 2's. Overall, very underwhelming at best, really miserable at worst. The game fails to make itself unique in the BL series, that has, for the most part, been able to have each entry stand on it's own two legs despite any flaws each had. BL1 had it's bleak atmosphere and darker tone, BL2 had it's story and incredibly deep and challenging End Game content, and BL3 has it's incredibly fun, fast-paced vertical gameplay. TPS has nothing. Play only if you're a diehard fan of the BL series, or if you are Australian.",1596104649,1596105333,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you've played BL2, this is a great little add-on to both story and gameplay mechanics. 

I would not reccomend picking this up by itself, as it adds in a lot of movement and stat mechanics that could be overwhelming if you are not familiar with the base borderlands gameplay.

The story by itself is great, and holds it's own. However, it has much more weight and meaning if you know the story of borderlands 2.

I purchased the full game and all of the DLC for a ridiculously good price (thanks to handsome collection). It's only worth buying at full price if you truly enjoyed the former game and are looking for more.

One MAJOR flaw that makes this game far worse than the other Borderlands games is the extreme focus on killing tons and tons of really lame ""trash"" enemies over and over again because you have to visit the same locations multiple times. The other Borderlands games had their fair share of this, but in those cases it was fine because you could always finish your visit with killing the area's boss for a chance to get some sweet loot. NO SUCH THING in BL - TPS. Except for the last boss, no boss in the entire game respawn. Your main sources of high end gear are the Golden Loot Chest and a machine that lets you recycle gear for a chance to maybe get something better.

[Initial impressions] If you enjoyed Borderlands 2, you won't be disappointed. The game has a few tweaks compared to its predecessor. Firstly, the dialogue is more two-way than earlier and that makes the characters seem more alive and it really contributes to the story. Secondly, moonstones (similar to eridium in BL2) is always usefull, even after you've bought every inventory upgrade from Crazy ""Whatyawant?"" Earl.

Those are the main pros so far, but there are cons as well. The game is slightly buggy even a few months after release. I've seen quite a few enemies get stuck in terrain or worse, glitch through the floor, including a boss, which made the fight unfinishable. This, luckily, is a rare occurrence though.

Of all the Borderlands games so far, this is the worst one. The price tag isn't really worth it and the game is at best a sloppy imitation of Borderlands 2 with many copy+pasted elements.",1419715556,1595057678,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn’t make it worthwhile at all, you lose so much character development value because of this frustrating 0 gravity, a shame because on the good side the character and their abilities they’re so good, the fighting mode of each one is extremely fun, the missions, stories, dialogs ... A massive waste. The real villain is this damn zero gravity, for Jack's sake this is a Borderlands Universe, makes a moon without feeling a moon! Removing that gravity would already be a leap.

Ever since the release of the first Borderlands game, BL:PS has gotten so much better (obviously) while sticking true to its roots, which is a rarity in a game franchise lasting for so long. The replayability, the story, the animation, and the art style all makes it feel so realistically cartoonish which makes it feel truly like its own expirence. I owned this on Xbox 360 since launch day back in 2014, and the amount of love and affection 2K put into this modern masterpiece is truly astonishing. The only complaint I have about this game is that the majority of the DLC was a cash grab and nothing more. It was all recycled missions, predictable plots and overall not interesting. However, the best dlc was the Claptastic Voyage because it was all poking fun at claptrap and his phycopathic mind. It was funny and original, and if I remember correctly, it even touched on some darker topics(which may not seem dark as an adult, but playing this through my teen years really struck home with hard topics such as abandanment and such).

I ended up buying it and recently i convinced my dawg to play it while we wait for the next Borderlands 3 DLC and are in the mood. So i opened it and after the merge to Shift it lost a lot of my progress. I was before the eye of Helios, instead of on the TVHM after finishing the DLC.

With all the usual Borderlands stupidity, here there’s always a grain of sincerity across the whole writing. As if the mining mission of Borderlands 2 was a template for the whole game. This is the only Borderlands story which meets the minimal requirements to be called one. The devs chose to do Jack’s prequel in the edgy dindunuffin key. Basically Joker (2019).

Gameplay-wise Borderlands 2 is a direct minor upgrade on everything, and this total conversion add-on is a next step on the road to be actually playable. While the gun-play is not as terrible as in the first game, it’s still not okay. Plying the third and the remaster of the first game at the same time as this one made it really clear, that shooting is still pretty bad (as if it wasn’t obvious from the start). Refreshing my memory on Pre-Sequel showed me just how many mechanics from here were carried over to the next game. Also it confirmed that Pre-Sequel has the best movement system out of them all. Ledge-grabs and stupid sliding has nothing on variable gravity and jump boosters. On top of being already cool, boosters use your oxygen to work, so there’s also resource management layer to it. Ground slams in the third game are useless without the booster, and here they are pretty useful and easy to execute. The levels are filled with jump-pads. Last time i saw these it probably was Quake 3. Stingray is still the best vehicle, but at least all transport got a hover upgrade in the B3. Strafing introduced with Sandskiff has remedied the terrible vehicular controls, and in this game it’s not limited to just one DLC.
Pre-sequel even has its horadric cube — you can grind your weapons together to up their quality, get the desired type, or even get luneshine bonuses if you spend shmeridium.
With half of the game taking place in the outer space your artefact slot is taken by an oxygen-device, and those come with an impressive range of different bonuses. They can even be similar to The Bee — pure increase to gun damage.
One new weapon type is lasers, and they are really cool: you have sniping railguns, shotgun splitters, automatic blasters and close-range beams. They are always elemental, and due to the low oxygen fire-type weapons became much more involved. Another thing B3 takes from here is the cold element. It’s not very effective at anything, but it slows the enemies (or you) and can even freeze your target before it’s out of HP. Then you can shoot or smash it. Flyers get fall damage, and the cold beautifully synergizes with PhysX making this old game look amazing.

I don’t remember how it went last time, but now on Win10 the game randomly crashes from time to time. Not as often to be really bad, but often enough to be irritating.

Pre-Sequel has a lot of above-average achievements, something beyond just grinding the levels and progressing through the story. But sometimes they are too involved. Coercing one person to help you get Claptrap’s RNG achievement is one thing. But assembling four people for one side-quest is another. It’s sounds cute on paper, but with “one challenge in one hands” rule during the co-op and missable triggers it’s really unnerving. Assembling four people for a mission in the middle of the game is the biggest challenge. Even if you try hitting Steam-forums filled with other people trying to do it, chances of actually hooking up together are really slim.

The rest didn't fit into steam:

The new aspects to this game like story, mechanics, and quests bring all the worst Borderlands components and adds a few poorly implemented, bad ideas. For its sake, the story tries. Jack isn't a bad character and some of the conflicts aren't half bad, but the story isn't a highlight either which isn't a shock. 

The quests and missions are tedious. Go here, shoot this thing, go back the way you came, shoot the same thing again. Real boring. The anti grav means any contact sends you flying through the air, and contact is impossible to avoid as every single AI charges straight at you. One of the most frustrating features is the amount of shaky cam and digital vomit spewed across the screen. It's not pretty, even on high settings, and just takes away from being present and enjoying the game. 

The monotony and grind of cookie cutter, rinse and repeat quests meant I completed the game as quickly as possible just to say I did. I stopped completing side quests halfway through.

It's a bizarre game on many levels. It never quite figures out whether it wanted to be a DLC, a true sequel, a standalone expansion pack - and its kind of sat between them all. The new Vault Hunters are for the most part, people you will have already seen (and killed in the case of two of them, ironically) in Borderlands 2.

That's odd, because it sums up its major issues. It kind of feels like its trying to fix B2's problems while not replacing it - as it takes place on Pandora's moon, there are plenty of new mechanics like limited oxygen, low gravity, lasers, new opponents... but a lot of these can get a bit old fast, and the new jumping mechanics are really cool until you realise they highlight the crappy physics B2 had.

Storyline-wise though, its fascinating. Charting Handsome Jack's rise to power, it gives an interesting backstory to B2's main villain.

Since it doesn't deviate too much from B2, and expands the universe's storyline, it should suit you if you're a fan of B2. It *isn't* as good as B2 though. Keep that in mind, and you should enjoy it.",1593366153,1593366153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The third entry into the Borderlands series, the story takes place between the first and second games. Gameplay is similar to the other Borderlands games; I believe it originally started off as an expansion to Borderlands 2 before becoming it's own game.

There's a lot to like about the Pre-Sequel through. The game has much better mechanics than the first two games. Vault Hunters have their own personalities which makes new runs more interesting and I personally found them better balanced and interesting than earlier entries. UVHM was intended from the start and is better implemented. Slag has been replaced with cryo - this element allows you to freeze enemies and is great for dealing with badasses and the like. Addition of double jumping, low gravity and butt slams to the franchise and the new laser weapon type. Has a terrific story driven DLC.

On the negative side, there's a LOT less content than B2. There's a bit of a general lack of side quests at times compared to previous games. A few areas where difficulty jumps really quickly, TVHM scales up really fast for example. Not to mention that while the game got a great DLC in Claptastic Voyage, it's the only one it got as Holodome is just a big arena. So there's a lack of end game stuff. Getting to max level in UVHM can be really grindy. Other DLC is for new character (both Doppleganger and Aurelia are great through)

One other thing, the game was made by an Australian studio. So it contains Australian voice actors. And Australian references. And Australian humour. YMMV about this.",1592620752,1592620752,True,2,0,0.536954998970031738,0,True,False,False

Ok lets get this out of the way first ! This is the worst one in the series . You can tell it was rushed and coded badly and Windows 10 has given it some minor issues as well as Steams API change . Main thing is the gun play ! You aim right on someone no matter the type of gun or how far or close you are from the target and the shot goes way to the left or the right. Also enemies can shoot through objects and hit you but you cant hit them....so makes fighting large groups a pain in the @ss . 

I'm a huge fan of this series but this one was a major let down for me , big time coming off of playing Borderlands 2 witch i think is the best one to date for many reasons. If any game needs a redux its this one 100% and not just a gfx HD update lol Also it seems the AI never miss as if all rounds from them find there target 100% ! I sure hope Gearbox does better with Borderlands 3 then this pile of bad code. This one just doesn't have the same feel as 1 or 2 for some reason. 

I wanted to put maybe but i voted NO being Only buy if you are a fan of the series or want the full collection ! Stick with Borderlands 1 GOTY Enhanced and Borderlands 2 GOTY ! And lets hope the best for Borderlands 3 :)

[h1][b]**Update 5/18/2020**[/b][/h1] Ok as I was stating in the review up top the game was stuttering all over. So I decided to try and google more and I came across this one saying if you open your network devices and if you have more then one ethernet adapter on your motherboard or installed in your system just select both and bridge the connections. So I tried this and it didn't work being for some reason the bridge would not connect to the internet. 

So I just selected the adapter that I was not using and right clicked it and disabled it fully. Then I went into the game and set it up gfx and rez and all that stuff and then I opened Nvidia setting and just mirrored the settings I selected for the game and saved. Now when I run it its Smooth and no Stutter or Lag at all ! I'm also running it at 1080p 144hz , Capped at 120 on Ultra and all else on and even with PhysX on Ultra the game runs smooth and no stutter now. So my review will remain till i can play it more then it might change but this game isn't as good as 1 , 2 and now 3. So we will see lol

 I think the lag or stutter is the game checking the connection for players or active connections and being one is being used and the other is not the game doesn't see that and keeps checking it causing the game to stutter. Anyway hope this helps !

[h1][b]** UPDATE Kind Of 6/14/2020 ** [/b][/h1]

Well something odd I was messing with . When Epic Games gave away the Handsome Collection I decided to install it from Epic and see if anything was different . For some Reason the Epic Version ,which I have no clue is different then the Steam version package or installer wise seems to play better. When I started to play it I could see right off the bat there was no stutter anymore at all . Also the frame rates are higher and smoother then the Steam version. Only time the games frames drop is having PhysX very high and lots of stuff going on screen at once. 

Truth even though I still think this is the worst one in the franchise I am enjoying it more with out all the stutters and low frame rates . So something to look into and check for yourself and see if you get the same results I am . Also should note the Steam version I had to Tweak INI setting and run and admin and all that crazy stuff to get it to run OK  to play . With the Epic one I just installed and played . No tweaking or editing a thing.",1559944885,1592119471,False,25,3,0.539513289928436279,10,True,False,False

I admit that I am a casual BL player - I've been playing since launch, but have never really bothered to play past middle difficulty and while I do enjoy the BL2 engine - it is pretty dated at this point.

Of the three, I think this one actually has the best story both in terms of main-thread, but it also has some pretty well-done side quests.  That said, it has some of the most boring loot (which is saying a lot for Borderlands),   Scaling works in such a way that weapons just drop off effectiveness too quickly to actually feel important.

Borderlands with low gravity means a lot of badass kills that you'll be thinking about for days on.

Inconsistent game design to the point of sometimes being annoying

BL1 had shortcomings on the technical side but of course it was much older, this game however, feels like it took the base looter mechanics of BL2 and just smacked on some shit on top of it.

Characters.
One of the main things I loved about BL2 were the characters, specifically Handsome Jack making every character interaction worth listening to. The characters in this installment feel like a cheap attempt at reproducing the previous ones. I did not care for any of them and their dialogue got maybe 1 sharp exhale out of 10 attempts.
In terms of abilities, they are all pretty average. I remember having a hard time selecting one as none of them really grabbed my interest. Reflect damage and throw shield with captain american girl, Mcree uses Dead eye, Claptrap is just RNG nonsense that can sometimes be fun but is mostly annoying, Drone man has, well drones, Jack has drones in the shape of himself and ice girl is pretty frackin powerful.

Gameplay. 

Nothing really changed except the new O2 system which overall is ok. It's existence doesn't add any new mechanics worth writing home about but it's not a horrendous change at all. At worst its an inconvenience to manage the new resource and at best it occasionally finds a use in combat. So all things considered, the main gameplay is still great but has not been improved.

The weapons in this game are about at the same destructive level with BL2. They aren't any memorable additions I can think of off the top of my head. It's not worse than BL2 but I wouldn't call it an upgrade either. This area is fine all things considered.

The maps in this game, oh god the maps. They are all very bland and can be confusing with multi floors. I remember having to backtrack a lot as well.

So in summary, the best analogy I can make is they took the meat of BL2 and cooked it without seasoning. It feels very bland and uninspired but the gameplay portion is just like BL2 for the most part. I would not recommend this game on its own or its dlc. You will get more enjoyment out of other installments in the series but if you want more Borderlands, this will give you more borderlands.

Opening a box to loot ammo/money, ""cool,"" but there's a high chance that it will just get YEET out into the abyss or directly upwards, forcing you to scramble to pick up something as menial as ammo or money.
Melee enemies have had their annoyance cranked up to 11, constantly leaping toward you (which is more akin to teleporting as they will phase right through terrain and obstacles) and spamming a ridiculous ground slam that will knock you away.
All enemies have a melee attack as expected, but this attack has quite the knockback on it, rendering melee builds that much more tedious, and only made worse if you're in a low-gravity environment which knocks you further and with a slower fall.
The damage enemies dish out is overall quite high, especially noted with enemies that wield laser weapons, with exceedingly good aim, considerable damage considering how often they land their shots, and a penchant for hitting you even from behind cover.
Badass enemies, and even just regular enemies with rocket launchers are absurdly dangerous, travel time on rockets is borderline hit-scan at times, there is no indicator or warning, simply an explosion and, best case scenario, the single rocket (which is usually rapid-fire, by the way) has chewed through your entire shield, and about 70% of your health, and if you're lucky, it's not an elemental DoT that will surely finish you off.

[b][h1]► The game in a nutshell ◄[/h1][/b]
The Pre-Sequel is surprisingly better than BL2. I was expecting less tbh. The appearance is slightly better. The Story is very good. The loot and gameplay is a bit better. I played the game to the end but I did not play more than I had to to beat the boss. I did not play more than 2 characters. I don't think I will play the game again because I don't see the point why I should. It's a mediocre game with enough content.

I strongly recommend to get this game if you enjoyed BL2.

[h1]▷ Appearance ◁[/h1]
The setting is all about space, spaceships, rocks, ice and a fancy space station. And the developers did their job. All levels are well designed and have alot of detail. The characters look less weird in comparison to BL2. Sadly alot of weapons are still cancer for the eye like it was in BL2. The main improvement here is the general level design. But man the weapons still suck...

[h1]▷ Story ◁[/h1]
Borderlands 1 has a slightly confusing but still motivating storyline. Borderlands 2 has a clearly better story but you miss some information about the circumstances. Well The Pre-Sequel explains most of it. While the story itself is told in an excellent way, the characters improved also.

[h1]▷ Gameplay ◁[/h1]
The gameplay improved somehow. I found some weapons which were really awesome and fun to play throughout the game. In BL2 you constantly switch weapons because the old ones suck really fast while advancing in your level. The skilltrees are okay I think. The action skills are more innovative compared to BL2s'. I still miss the overall usefulness of all weapon types like it was in Borderlands 1. Go with a shotgun for CQB, get a Rocket Launcher for ugly situations and get a sniper for clearing the rest. Forget Assault rifles, SMGs, Pistols, Revolvers and so on. They are crap and completely useless in comparison (god I miss BL1 gameplay). Anyway the gameplay improved ""a bit"".

Every now and then you may stumble upon an RPG which offers very unlikable characters. You can't relate to any of the offered choices, but you want to play the game regardless. Well, for me, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was one of those experiences. A long, dull and dragged experience.

I honestly believe that The Pre-Sequel is nowhere as good or polished as it's precursors. It's just a way to milk some more money by compiling a list of different ideas.

What bothers me the most at this particular Borderlands game is the lack of balancing and the weapons. I feel that most of the legendaries are put there for show, without much purpose. Unique, blue items are generally better, but fall-off quickly because they don't scale in level. Every 3 or 4 levels you need to redo your arsenal and that just takes too much time. Save scumming is needed to get better gear, otherwise you could just use whatever you find along the story line, but you'll generally find yourself underpowered.

The enemies are harder and more unforgiving. You have health skills to compensate, but the whole game is centered around playing co-op. Some characters even have whole sections of their skill tree dedicated to co-op and that's just weird. Sure, put some co-op skills, but don't lock a whole tree just for that...

Overall I didn't get too much kick out of this installment. I felt that the Claptastic Voyage was a hole lot better than the base game, but even that DLC, felt full of cliches and somewhat bland.

I still recommend this game to Borderlands fans. Maybe you'll like the characters and have a better experience than I had.",1590262462,1590262462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only bad thing is at the end of the game if you get the DLC claptrap when you go into his mind, the final boss battle on that DLC  is pretty much impossible. There were two of us playing both about level 36 and we couldn't do anything. You jump off the platform into the fight and the boss kills you before you hit the ground, so there's nothing you can do.
