It was back when it had no story, no guide, no helpful info on the UI, systems, or crafting. They just dropped you in world after Char creation and turned you loose.

It's come a long way since them but I am going to have to recommend against purchase because the game is still to unpolished to be any real fun (for me anyway). I do recommend following it though and in roughly a year or 2 it should actually be fun to play this!

The issues I had were; 
1) Terrible optimization, it spins my 2070 super to max regardless of the settings. 

2) Quest objective map updates, It will spawn a quest point on your map once your there but it wont remove it once you pick up the objective which leads to a VERY cluttered compass.
Possible Fix: Adjust programming to remove a quest objective from the map once its picked up.

3) Dying is a respawn at base/loss of items which REALLY sucks when your way out from your main base and there is no fast travel. I say this because the first trip out I kill/loot everything so the time passes quickly but the second time out its literally walking for 10 minutes in real life and I am bored out of my skull.
Possible fix: Have a fast travel to corpse option, have a fast travel option, respawn nearish corpse.

4) Evening/Early morning hours. I find these times to be SUPER annoying. Maybe later in the game you've enough that your occupied during this time but for me I just have to sit around from hour 22 to hour 5 waiting. There is a brief respite of the zombie wave but that's like a in game hour leaving you a CRAP ton of time twiddling your fingers bored.
Possible fix: have the option to ""sleep"" after the wave waking at the predawn hours of 0500 or 0600

5) Sound track in the game is under whelming. I mean why even have it? I just turn music off and the game improve 10 times imho.

Make no mistake, I like this game and I will continue to play it. The game is truly realistic in some aspects. The dark in this game is a perfect example, it is pitch black cant see a hand in front of your face. Makes it REALLY easy for zombies, wolves, and bears, to catch you unaware. Journeying at night is a REALLY bad idea (Hence point 4). 

The flash light isn't a second sun, the cone on the light behaves very close too, if not precisely, like real life. This is immersive but it also kinda sucks because unless you get a more powerful one later you're gonna have  REAL hard time with nights/interiors.

The traps hurt you too! REALLY refreshing take here. 

It has a very strong Resident evil vibe which I find to be really enjoyable.

I wish steam had a ""not in early access"" or ""wait awhile"" button instead of yes/no. If you are the kind of person (like me) who enjoys subnautica, satisfactory, factorio, and such you will most likely really enjoy the game with the above caveats being drawbacks and not game killers for you.

Now to be perfectly fair I didn't make it to vehicles and such because after grabbing the polymerchem book I was killed and didn't feel like retracing my steps from an hour prior, So gave up for today.


Now I know there is a save function that can avoid this but I (personally) like to challenge myself in these survival games so I only save on my exit thus I create the challenge of ""not dying so I don't lose a few hours of progress"" This is a personal thing and not something I fault the company for I just wish the corpse retrieval was a little easier.",1708539043,1708539043,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

and you are not getting lost in this game. The walkie talkie, thank god, brings a life into this game. The movement of the
player is well made and for me it feels very smooth to play, love it.

+ 31 Gb install. Not much. It is ok.
+ The Menu is well made. Simple and good looking.
+ The game runs very stable. It is very smooth. However, it depends on the system. Got a 4070 ti and it runs like butter.
+ DLSS and DX 12 support + Lumen! Lumen is one of the most important things these days to get the perfect area lighting effects! I love it since ""No one survived"".
+ You have a lot of options to adjust the game behaviour (you can edit these when a savegame exists and before loading the game).
+ You can create your own character. It is very detailed.
+ It is very scary. Jumpscares ahead. A lot of zombies can suddenly appear over the corner.
+ A lot of freedom to build.
+ Items have different rarity and are modifiable.
+ You can upgrade your buildings and structures.
+ Waves!
+ Funny traps
+ Big Map
+ Story
+ Wolves, birds, deers and rabbits to hunt. Walkie talkie buddies explain that these animals can mutate!^^
+ Good voices coming with the walkie talkie.
+ Tutorial is well done.
+ Lots of Quests.
+ Third Person / First Person view, in my eyes one of the most important things in survival games to have both options. Well made!
+ No game crashes so far!
+ You can level up you character and adjust the stats.
+ Newbie friendly.
+ Zombies stop chasing you when you run far enough. And it is not far. Thanks for this. Very important. Not like ""No one survived"".
+ It is not that frustrating. Thanks developers!
+ Updates for the game still exist!


- Zombies are not very responsive. They only react if you looted something and not during looting.
- Zombies are not very noisy. It is hard to detect them.
- You cannot change/adjust your body.
- No modding
- Graphics look a bit outdated. However, I saw the upcoming changes and I would love to see the upcoming graphics changes.
- A lot of clothes have been removed but will see the upcoming updates this quarter.
- You have long tracks to get to something.
- Trees and Stones do not appear over time again. You have to explicitly activate this in the game options but it increases the difficulty? Something i do not understand.

This is what I have to tell you guys about the game now. Developers you did a great job on this however you have to improve the zombies
because this is one of the things I struggle to stay at the game as it is. They have to be more aggressive and more responsive. You have 
to show us hell on earth! Screaming zombie hordes at far distance running towards you can be so exciting. The distance for the sound should
also be like they were coming closer and closer. Also when you adjust the game in the way that zombies would walk instead of run.

This game has a lot of potential and I hope it will be more exciting in the future. But please don't take to long because the attention span of people
won't hold on that long to reach a big player base.",1705869790,1705869790,True,12,0,0.650476634502410889,0,True,False,True

I'll start with Just a few things I hope you guys can change and add in the future. Just a note, I'm a massive 7days, and Conan Fan, so this game tickles that itch. Now I know i'm pointing out some things I personally would love to see added/changed, I really have enjoyed the game so far. 

- Better (human) Voice acting. The AI voice acting is hilarious at times, but it's more off putting then anything.
- More Block destroying abilities. Why can't we break windows, walls, and other parts of buildings?
- Multiplayer Mod Support. One map is nice, and I get it's tied to the story, but alternative multiplayer maps would be amazing. Along with other quality of life mods people would be able to make.
- I get this is an Alpha, but the building has it's glitches. The snap feature is pretty nice but there are times where if you're not careful and it looks like it's lined up, the walls, doors, or whatever you are placing are not aligned.
- The bow animations are... meh? Along with a bunch of the other animations that could see some improvements. When cutting trees or mining and you are clearly hitting the resource, the tool is just bouncing around. Probably a easy fix. 

Keep it up! This has a lot of potential. I haven't had this much fun in a survival games since I first play 7Days. Can't wait to see what the team brings to the table in future updates.",1704687509,1704687625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

So, there's a lot to like about this game and some to be irritated by.

I've come to the conclusion that the game devs originally planned on this being a story game, but the part that really stuck with players was the base building/waves part of the game.  The story is still in here, but it's really just there to give you something to do in between base building/horde attack sessions and to guide you through progression.

If you want to just charge through the story, you can actually crush most of the waves without a base at all - just using melee weapons, so the story and the base building/tower defense games are completely independent of each-other.  I would consider them completely separate.

The story at this point is kinda thumbs down.  The story bosses are pure bullet sponges and honestly, they're about the only things I actually use bullets on, as the first half of the game has exclusively (sans phase bosses) enemies you can melee massacre without even bothering with the parry and dodge mechanics.  The base building tower defense portion of the story is a solid thumbs up, as it's by far the best game of it's (almost completely empty) genre.

Oh yeah, don't bother with the shotgun, as it does shit dps and only effective up close and slows you down so much when you're trying to reload (and has THE WORST reload time) that it's like trying to commit suicide.  A close second in horrible weapons is the sniper rifle (maybe good for animals?) with the pistol actually being superior.  The SMG and assault rifles are easily the only weapons effective against enemies, with the assault rifles being the best in the story progression.",1696725249,1703469857,True,0,0,0.597536206245422363,0,True,False,True

building, traps, gears, dungeons (they said there is more comes in the future) all is good there is one thing u might see it boring is looting the buildings cuz they almost looks all the same from inside but u can avoid that by looting each day a small place

It is a mixture of tower defense and zombie fighting.  I haven't finished the game yet, but so far the bosses are a little wonky.  They have high HP and weird mechanics.  Just get some gear and bring some healing items beforehand.  Most of the zombies, if you have a lot of FPS experience, are easy to dodge and kill even if they are overpowered.  The base building is regulated based on how far you have proceeded on the mission and what research books you have.  The game allows you to change multiple settings to play the way you want.

The game has progressed fantastically. Multiplayer support has expanded. The game itself looks great and is incredibly fun. For a zombie survival game, this one is better than so many others. The amount of content has grown by a great deal. It has a fantastic replay factor. I believe the game has more than doubled it's content since I bought it, thats just awesome. I really think that this game is at the point where if you put a bit more polish on it, quite a bit, it could end up very popular.

I think the game needs: 
More organic / less buggy zombie pathing. 
Random but sequential bookshelf book drops. 
(No duplicates unless all books acquired from region, higher price kiosk)
Animals have short pause animations if you are stealth/no noise for X duration and/or never alerted animal.

even Rust has full nudity.

but seriously, I really wanted to like it since I'm a sucker for crafting survival games.

The tutorial is really annoying, an HOUR, I played a full hour and it felt like all I was doing was a tutorial, with the really annoying computer generated voices. JUST LET US PLAY, the computer generated voices are really bad, the emotions behind the words are all wrong. I wanted to just play the game but you are forced to do the tutorial and you have to wait for the NPCS to stop talking, if you craft what pops up before they stop talking it doesn't count and you have to do it all over again.

 There is no official Discord to keep up with the development of the game.
Enemy AI is pretty bad as you can imagine, the gameplay is what you would expect from an early access game. but I was willing to overlook this as it is still early access but the computer generated voices along with the forced tutorial are just that bad.

 I'm currently also trying The Front, I decided to keep that game and not refund it because devs are constantly making updates and interacting with the community. If this game ever improves I'll buy it at full price(got it during a sale) but for now I am refunding it, that's why I was not willing to play longer than 1 hour.

Love the Tower Defense Maze style of Game play & Customization of my zombies.


What I would love have added to the game to take it to that next level! 

Must Haves: 
- QOL:  Crafting Pulls from Containers.
- Companions: Wandering npc that you can hire, don't have to be OP but some interaction and a buddy/waifu to run around with
-- World feels empty, so after playing solo for hours I move back to 7DTD for the janky life it has there
- AOE Repair/Reload Method:  Have a Machine or item like other games that will auto repair and reload as long as they have the needed items in inventory. Really limits my base when I have to build Rat runs so I can restock paths 
-- Idea - Make a Smaller drone that flys around fixing and reloading base so you can focus on what you want to do.
-- Boy likes to flamethrower the dead & the wife is often fishing lol
--Drone does not need to have collusion or be attackable just more of a visual of the machine working on your base to bring more life the the dying (but not dead yet) world. 

Would Like to Change:
-First Person:
--Improve 1st person Combat and zombies make noise so I don't keep getting b***** slapped by a Ninja zombie cause I am trying out 1st person mode. 
- Expand on in-game store 
-- Need to be able to pickup or move the stalls to my base
-- Sell Materials and items for money to be able to buy books - trying to hunt those down are not fun for EVERYTHING

First off, this is a great game!  Even before the recent updates, it was very good, and after update 14 there is so much more potential here!  It plays well solo, supports multiplayer (which is where I think it would shine, but the game really hasn't had enough coverage for enough people to know about it), and has a ton of replayability.

There are still some bugs in the game, which is to be expected.  Some of the electricity still has some glitches, but ... there is electricity!  All in all, I fully expected the bugs and glitches to be ironed out, including balancing.  The developers seem very responsive and efficient.

While the game definitely allows base building and a good deal of creativity, it is at its core kind of a tower defense type of game.  Much like 7 Days to Die, with the core difference being that in Night of the Dead, hordes hit you every night instead of once a week.  It would be nice if the hordes were more configurable in NIght of the Dead, but there it is.  The days, however, are long enough that it's not that big a deal that you need to deal with the nightly hordes - especially since you can build out your base defenses so that they are low enough maintenance and can ""ride"" through several horde nights.

The one big criticism I have with the game may become a non-issue as the development cycle continues, and this may actually be something that others LOVE:  the non-destructible structures in the game.  While in some cases, they are nice (i.e. a wall providing an invincible barrier that you can use to screen zombies from one or more sides), in other cases it is a real pain as you cannot clear those structures to build over.  Instead, you have to either build in a different location or work around those obstructions.

Combat in this game is by far better than others that I have encountered in the genre.  There is an active dodge that adds meaning to the combat, and there is a pretty good (maybe a little OP) shield defense mechanic.  In the early days, it may be difficult to take on the zombies on the higher difficulties, but as the game progresses and you get better gear and skills, the combat becomes very fun - though I will caveat this here by saying that at some point, the combat becomes a little trite as you face many zombies and the kills start to become a little too easy.  Some balancing is needed here, perhaps slowing progression in order to keep the game challenging in a meaningful way.

The problem with balancing is exacerbated by the nightly waves, and how they are currently constructed.  While some games tailor these difficulties by a ""game stage"" or by the survivors' levels or skills, Night of the Dead seems to base this solely on the passage of time.  On day 3, you may get your first ""flammable"" zombies (and fire is a thing if you've got wooden structures!), on day 6 you start getting more meaningful amounts of heavy zombies, and on day 10 you start getting giant zombies.  It's the giant zombies, really, that are a potential problem, as you really need to have either the ammunition and firepower to deal with them, or you need the traps (Ballista, Minigun turret, Multiple Rocket Launcher, Trebuchet, etc) to deal with them.  The problem is that some of those traps are gated behind boss encounters or story points that you may not have gotten to yet.  I read one review here that said the boss fights were way too hard.  On higher difficulties, I totally agree.  On normal or hard difficulty, though, they are very doable though they may test your skills at using a shield and/or dodging.  At survival difficulty, those bosses do start to hit hard enough to one or two shot you, and they have a ton of hit points.  That can definitely use some balancing, but it's not that big of a deal unless you consider that what traps and structures you can build are gated behind these events.  I'm not a huge fan of that approach.  The main story should be something the player can casually take the time to do as they get to it without feeling rushed because you need to kill Boss 'X' in order to implement electricity.

The game does degenerate into a grind at some point, where you're constantly looking for more fuel, copper, plastic, leaves, branches, etc - unless you've managed to get enough oil pumps and ore machines up to compensate.  This is so that you can continue to maintain your power grid, some of your traps and vehicles, and expand your horde base to account for the larger amounts of zombies that show up as time progresses.  I'd say that hits right around day 14 or so, while you're able to keep up mostly by doing journal quests and looting around the cities.

The current version makes crafting almost an afterthought, as most of the things you will craft you'll find out in the world as drops, or by combining items.  The combination of items is one of the things I think breaks my immersion - that and the equipment upgrade system.  I like the idea of breaking down a piece of gear into its components (though the current breakdown system leaves a lot to be desired), but taking 5 random items and making a random item out of them based on their ""tier"" really isn't realistic and (while it does give you something to do with all of that extra loot) often leads to you obtaining items that you wouldn't have been able to get out in the world at your current progression, and you certainly couldn't craft.  This (plus the looting) makes crafting items pretty much obsolete, as the only items you ever do craft are on pretty much on day 1 when you craft your first pieces of gear.

This leads to the gear upgrade system.  It is slightly better than before update 14, but it is still wildly unrealistic.  While I could possibly see using leather, duct tape, and some other items to upgrade items, the idea of using fish bones, feathers (in some cases specific feathers or specific hides) to upgrade an item really just points to the inability to make fishing and hunting more useful.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVE that there is fishing and hunting in the game, but there should be more uses for the output from these things, like a more meaningful crafting system that allows you to use those products in crafting through a carefully thought out progression system.  Currently, there's really only the upgrade system and foods.  While this update did introduce more meaningful foods (some of which are really key to defeating some of the bosses on higher difficulties), the crafting has kind of suffered by not using these items more effectively.

I think the map is a very good size for this kind of game.  Unfortunately, it is a fixed map.  This means that books and bosses and POIs are always in the same places.  While this means those things are now easier to find, that can be handled through the journal entries telling you where to find those things.  The ability to randomly generate a map, and to vary that map's size, would be a very good addition to the game and increase its replayability a great deal.  It would also add another challenge to players as they would now need to look around for a good place to make their home and horde base.

All in all, I do love this game, and I see in it a vast potential based on the elements that are already in it.  Time will tell, though, as it's not there yet, and I don't see much in the way of modding support (which is huge for a gaming community these days).  I am excited for what will come next.  I don't see this as ""the game"" at this date, but it is definitely a contender and could very easily see this coming up on top if some necessary improvements are made.

I don't have videos of version 14 content, but have some videos of pre-version 14 content that highlight the horde waves and some of the combat system.

First off; this is a Survival Tower Defense game, not a survival base building game. 
Secondly; please stop spamming social media (the players not jacktostudios) saying that there are NPCs in the game. Voice actors talking over a walkie talkie does not count as an NPC.

I would very much love this game if there was actual base building involved. As nice as Multiplayer is, I don't really have many friends interested in these types of games so I am usually forced to play solo. When playing solo I absolutely LOVE having NPCs I can control. I LOVE making massive bases and sometimes cities just for the hell of it (sometimes to even roleplay). 

The graphics on this game are pretty amazing. The introduction quests are nice, however, can get annoying if you pass too many things at the same time. The map is WAAAAYYYY too big. Like way too big. This is what I mean when I say it'd be nice to have some NPCs. 

This game is highly recommended for people with friends that love this game or people that like to challenge themselves on solo, hard to win, speedruns.

Notes to devs-

-It's not clear if I can still leave the island or not. e.g. I've finished the main quest line and am not sure if that's it and now im just fighting waves...until more content is added. How do I unlock the harder custom difficulties, after googling it appeared there used to be journals so I spent time in game trying to determine if those still exist.

-It's unclear that I need to progress to areas to unlock new building capabilities. I had many quest items that needed a wrench and spent hours trying to figure out why I couldn't make the bench to make one. ( apparently I had to go to the pool area to unlock the workbench for that )

-Please change all ""build"" to ""possession"" or create an ""exists"". I frequently would do many things ahead of them appearing in the journal. It may be worth showing all quests but greying those out that have dependencies so I can see what I should or should not do in advance. 

^^^-->>> put a huge disclaimer that the game is best enjoyed if you follow quests

-I can craft turbocharger, etc but don't know what its for so im questioning if I missed visiting a certain area to unlock additional cars

-Do mines regenerate? I'm out of magnesium and gold and it's a lengthy process to find gear to upgrade to then recycle into these materials or find the money to buy them.

-- I don't know how to activate sandbox if that is still a thing or what commands exists, can you index them and add a help command for console line
-Pls make glass breakable, just do a sloppy replacement of the texture with a new glass break object on hit detect :D
-I have the mutant substance but am not sure what its for
-I have the microchips but am not sure what they are for

Buildings are completely empty, making looting and adventuring extremely boring. While playing the game I got the chance to witness many crashes which both affected me and my friends, making me want to save every X time to be sure I wouldn't lose 20 minutes of progress every time. The combat feels absolutely horrible and hitting an enemy doesn't feel like anything at all, really. You'll be punching that enemy and they'll barely even flinch. Looting can be resumed by a few book shelves or boxes on the ground inside of buildings which barely anything in them, there really isn't more to it.

The more you progress in the game the grindier it gets, it eventually becomes ridiculous once it gets to late game as you'll be required to constantly reload guns and weapons by yourself, make a shit load of parts to then make other parts and harvest all of the materials for said part. Although you'll be promised drones to do the work it'll end up being extremely disappointing since you'll find out it consumes a lot of power and it only operates in a radius of maximum 25 meters which is next to nothing. 

Automatic machines created for mining materials, excavating oil or harvesting plants are locked behind a reload feature too, which renders them not so automatic considering that you'll constantly have to grind to get the required materials to craft the items you require to reload them. 

The story is absolutely horrendous with the voice acting being completely AI generated (and I'm pretty certain that it goes for the script too considering that this game's english is completely broken). The best thing about the story is that you can deactivate the dialogues in the settings, which will be a relief once you do trust me. The game's main story line is extremely underwhelming. It's a bunch of fetch quests with an eventual boss fight at the end.

The sound design is horrendous, you might as well mute your sound, it'll be the equivalent of the game. I had never played an open world game as quiet as this one. The only music you'll hear is during the night, for the rest of the game it'll be an awkward backtrack that you can barely hear with no music or anything. 

There is but one good part about the game and it's the base building. That shit is fun but you'll also come to realise that it involves a shit load of endless grind, rendering it more painful than it is worth.

I can't recommend the game, I know this is a small team of developers but I hate when I'm playing a game and I get the feeling that these poor designs choices could have been avoided or that I could have made that feature less buggy. In the end, the game tries to do so many things but doesn't manage to do any of them decently.

Every system needed in a survival game is there, but every single one of them feels like a mark on a checklist.

-There's shooting/melee but it's bland, without depth or that gun ""feeling"".
-There's mining/chopping trees but again, it's not really fun and it's constantly bugging out because you are not standing in a perfect spot to hit a stone.
-There's farming but you cant choose which vegetable you plant and it doesn't even have good uses because these small 10%  bonuses here and there are not worth the time investment.
-There's looting but it's boring, with the same containers and animations in every building.
-There's open world but 80% of it is empty, rest is filled with copy-paste buildings with the same interior.
I could go on but you get the picture, everything is there but nothing is ""really there"".

Very suprising, as it's really hard to make a game so clunky and ugly on Unreal Engine.

- everything is so HUGE. Why are the trucks so big, the lightswitches in the houses above my head and the houses empty af? It makes no sense to me..

The mechanics, combat, graphics, exploration, map size, and story is all freaking amazing. By far one of the top survival games ever made, imo. If you have not picked up the game and played it, your truly missing out on some of the best times you will ever have. The price point is way more than worth it, does go on sale slightly from time to time, but full price def worth it easily. Highly recommend to anyone who loves survival, and zombie style games. Must buy for real, and to the devs, keep up the amazing work. The new prologue, and story part 1 is excellent. The updates you guys put out are just phenomenal.

The voice acting for the beginning quest as well had me tearing up from laughing, one of those moments it's so ""good"" it becomes hilarious. For sure a certified Simpsons moment. :sunekosuri:

Harder zombies start appearing after each nightly wave so things continue to be challenging. Character levels up and you can assign a point on each level up to certain character attributes. There's also research-able skills. 

However, the bad outweighs the good. In the beginning, there are notes acting as a basic tutorial, but the notes are stuck either on something that can't build yet because of lack of tools/skills, or when you get past that, is stuck on something you have already built and don't want to waste resources to rebuild a second one, just to move the tutorial note on.
Zombies can be very glitchy and clip through walls and hit you. Some zombies are explosive which can damage you and your crafted buildings, however very frustratingly exploding a zombie doesn't do explosion damage to other zombies so you can't use them to your advantage.
Often I would get stuck not finding certain materials, or not know how to make something, and would have to often refer to a walk-through guide (not unusual in these type of games to be fair).

To progress you need to develop character skills, some skills require finding specific books to unlock. These book are spread across the map but they are located in illogical areas, and it was this + a glitch that made me uninstall a game.

How it played out - Need Aluminium for armoured car. Can't find aluminium>eventually refer to a guide>go to place, it's a mine. Walk into mine>toxic fumes>backtrack back to base> Get item that I thought removed toxic effect. Slog back to the mine, item doesn't remove effect>Refer to guide> Need Gas mask> craft-able at work bench> Go back to base. Can't make Gas Mask> don't have skill > Where skill book to unlock? Well, apparently the book to unlock the gas mask to protect from toxic is in the toxic mine.!!?? Back to mine with lots of health items >continuously replenish health>find storage in mine where books are normally found and..... When I try to open crates, the opening animation cancels halfway though, glitched...... Give up on book, manage to pickaxe enough alum. for car>  slog it back to base again where rest of materials are> have enough materials to make car >can't make car >don't have book >where book?> otherside of the map... The entire point of this exercise of trying to make the car was so that I could go to far regions of the map without having to return as frequently to my homebase to unload my inventory of loot.

However, the game just isn't properly optimized. My GPU is mid-grade at worst, and it literally can't run this game, period. My resources jack up to 95-100% just in the title screen.

When I actually get in-game, I tune down all the settings to their lowest possible sliders and the game STILL eats over 60% of my GPU's resources, heaven knows what it's gonna do to my PC once a horde of zombies is rendered in. And the game looks like cold garbage at the lowest possible settings, it's barely playable at those settings.

I've never had this problem with other games, ever. I'm running Starfield on this PC for god's sake, yet it can't run this game? Seriously? The devs need to focus solely on asset optimization until this game can be run in a decent state. I have no idea what all these YouTubers are rocking in their PC's to run this game at the settings that I've seen them in. It's absurd.

Not to even mention the fact that this game uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is known to contain spyware and keyloggers, and also doesn't work half the time and flags random shit on my PC as suspicious files. Also, why are we using anti-cheat software in a game that is going to be played predominantly in single-player? What the hell are the developers thinking?

It feels like a very promising 3rd-person version of 7 Days to Die, maybe with a bit more focus on a building and tower defense-esque style of gameplay loop. But the exploration and the looting are definitely there as well.

My only reservation at this point is the Early Access status. I hope it does not follow 7 Days to Die in the endless EA status, constantly changing the core game every once in a while, making it feel pointless to play or even learn the game on its current status. I would love to see Night of the Dead reach full release at some point in the near future, I would definitely be more encouraged to invest time and energy on it once I'm confident I won't need to constantly reset my files because the entire game was changed for the umpteenth time.",1693734489,1693734489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Key-mapping is kind of all over (why is it F to harvest from the trap and then R to rearm it? why can't I get to my character screen from the tab/inventory screen, and why isn't it explained all that well that it's C?)

Hitboxes are... just awful, both on the creatures and things in the world like rocks and trees.

Why isn't there any easy way to mark locations on the map (if you find coordinates you manually have to mark those spots on the map which means manually writing the number somewhere then going to the map, finding the spot, and marking it)

I still feel like a new game should start in the morning, not mid afternoon, especially for new players. The darkness of night comes long before the monsters do and you wind up just kind of sitting around once it gets dark waiting for things to kick off and it's pretty boring. (serious pacing issue)

Creatures still phase through walls, buildings are less barren now but still don't feel like they were lived in at some point. There's really no environmental story telling.

The most major difference is that 7 Days is based on building with a blocks system, and this game is not at all. There's plenty of building, it's just different. While 7 Days does have traps, this game has TRAPS. There is a zombie horde every night instead of every week, and the traps you get access to very early on like the pendulum trap will still be helpful into the end game. It's like zombie tower defense. It's pretty fun at first but I admit, it does get a little old having to run back to base every single night just to deal with it. 

I will also say, this game is janky. It's early access so that's just going to happen, but on several occasions I ran into floating fire.. as in, a wooden part of a base caught fire, it was either put out or burned down, but the fire just floated there and burned me ever after. There were also many, many times where I would strike a tree or rock while trying to gather resources, and it would just disappear without giving me any.  (I learned later, from a friend, that I could shoot the disappeared tree or rock with a pistol to make it appear again, and it works.. go figure.) This was the most common problem I ran into.  

All that being said? It's actually good. It needs fixes, it needs more points of interest. It needs more items. It needs a much, much better endgame. (It's not so fun looting a building when you already have massive stacks of everything that drops, and the equipment cabinets aren't special because you already have lightsabers..) The biggest grind is stuff like copper, oddly enough, and LEAVES. Finding a tier 6 weapon means basically nothing once you've already got it, but spending real time chopping hundreds of bushes, trees and rocks is an unavoidable reality. The farming system is also rough.. even when you get tier 3 farm plots, don't expect to really be able to make many beneficial things with it that you couldn't more easily buy or find elsewhere. Meat alone can get you through this game, and painkillers are cheap. Oh I could go on and on..

You'll likely build multiple bases, getting into the groove of building the perfect zombie slaying trap maze. 
The game is forgiving as far as demolishing built objects goes - so if you build a base and your trap placement sucks/you want to move, you get almost all your materials back by wrecking it ('packing it up') - same thing with vehicles. This is a game changer, no more sad abandoned bases  - just break them and rebuild.
I've played hundreds of hours of games in the 'loot/craft/build/fight' genre - NotD is a unique merge of mechanics seen in notable games like 7 Days To Die, Ark: Survival Evolved, Project Zomboid and Valheim.

There is a fundamental disconnect between the scavenging phase of game play and the base defense phase of game play.

The harvesting and combat feel a bit janky, because if you are standing in the wrong spot your weapon will miss the ore node, or smack into a wall instead of your target.  I understand some people might consider this a feature. 

Combat against the zombies is closer to 7 Days to Die or Volcanoids than Valheim.  I gave up on dodging when it caused me to die (I think I took damage because I was out of stamina).

Speaking of which, sprinting while out of stamina seems to injure you.  This is a new and unwelcome mechanic.

Also, sprinting requires you to hold down the shift key, which is a recipe for repetitive stress injury (RSI).  Many games make this mistake.

The buildings you loot for supplies are not very interesting.  They are mostly large boxes.  Houses are devoid of furniture, while larger industrial spaces do have things like rusted lathes and milling machines .  Everything feels oversized, probably to compensate for the janky weapon arc physics.

Travel (walking/sprinting) is tedious.  Maybe when I get enough resources to investigate vehicles this will change.

I have not yet played long enough to have my base defeated by a wave of zombies, but I wonder how you are supposed to recover from the demolition of your base.  You only have 23 hours to rebuild stronger than before.  (This is a fundamental design challenge of base defense games).
It also seems like you are expected to ""save scum"", because if you haven't read spoilers, then certain base-wrecking mechanics will be a surprise.  A more advanced game design would introduce these mechanics in a less traumatic fashion.

On linux, the game is basically broken. It starts out alright, but as you build more and alter the world around you, it just seems to run slower and slower until it is unplayable. This is especially a bummer if you put many hours into building your base, learning the crafting system, tracking down key items from all over a huge map, only to end up with the framerate of the game becoming so slow and buggy that you can't continue.

All technical issues aside, the game is still very rough around the edges. The devs are actively developing the game, and there are noticeable improvements with each update release, but it still appears to have a long way to go with several years already in the works.

I really would like to see this game finished with everything working properly and all of the assets and points of interest lookng polished and more fleshed out.

Unfortunately, I can't really recommend playing this on linux for technical reasons. If you are on Windows and we assume that it works well there, then I'd say its a great slow-burn zombie survival experience with very complex crafting systems, day night cycle, etc.

I'm super sad that my saved game no longer works properly, as I was very close to crafting my light saber and wrecking shop, but I just can't get it to run well enough to be playable.

I'll check back in on this one later and hope that its a bit more polished.",1633045709,1691457548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My mistake for thinking it was more than a grind to find items before the clock runs out and the hordes arrive. Please don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the base building. It had a Fallout 4 feel when it came to building the base, but I hated that the only way to correct a wrong was to demolish it, and then redo it. Come on- at least give us the chance to go back into build mode and move something so that it's actually level. Lining things up was the hardest part, and even when I switched from first to third, it was an exercise in futility at times. I played for many hours, and enjoyed most of them. I enjoy exploring as well. 

I liked the scenery, animals, and most of the sounds, although I found certain things to be inconsistent, like really, why am I hearing zombies roars, and growls way up on a building when nothing is around. Even if there are zombies in the building, I wouldn't hear them to that extent. 

The zombie graphics are poor. They resemble games from before 2000 or around 2000. In this day and age, we have amazing graphics to make them at least look somewhat real. The way the zombies move is also pretty lame as they tend to run back and forth, clump up like a tiny gang of weirdos, and then run again. I had one zombie jump- well, actually transport from the ground, all the way up to my base on top of the police station. It was there, skittered, disappeared only to float right up to me and was then gone. 

There is zero dialog. The character doesn't even talk to herself (or himself), and there are zero real quests. You run, build, get frustrated, deal with a horde, then do it all over again - oh and find journals. 

I do hope that as this game evolves there is an actual plan, or just the devs just need to call it what it is ""find stuff, build stuff, run from stuff, and do it all again"".

Dcing friends or not even allowing them to log into a personally hosted game what so ever. It's honestly just poor coding on behalf of the devs in this situation. . .probably because they're using eac, which is just garbage anyway and isn't even needed in personally hosted games. 

That aside, no idea what or if there is any story line, even after hours of playing. . .
The tutorial phase is very long and well thought out. So they did well there. The graphics are decent enough. The game play seems fine to be honest with single player. . .so my only real gripe is the fact that the multiplayer is utter nonworking crap.

*Edit 1:*

So, so far the only thing that refills hp/stamina gauge (since it goes down in a semi permanent manner) is an energy bar. . .I've tried multiple foods on the cooking deal, and so far as I can tell the only thing they do is recover health if hurt. So, I'm going to guess that the devs either don't know what they're doing or are idiots when it comes to the hunger/fatigue system they have in place.

Upgrading gear with augments doesn't seem to work at all, and crafted things seem to get some rng crap going on. Even if an item has multiple empty slots it won't allow you to add the wire spool augments either in a bench or inventory. So, I guess it's just for show and taking up inventory. . .if there is a way to get it to work it's convoluted, not explained correctly, or is simply just there in appearance to make you think you can make your gear better. . .in other words it's a system put in place that was poorly thought out, only half arsed works, and a grad student could have done better.",1690069315,1690393105,False,1,0,0.471698105335235596,0,True,False,True

Compared to 7 days to die (Which is the closest thing i've tried):

Stability: Much better, haven't had desyncs or lag when playing coop. The server was hosted on my PC while playing.

Loot: Muuuuch better, there are tons of different rolls on items. Comparable to Diablo4, with yellow rarity items rolling stats like headshot damage, loot drop%, base stats, stamina usage, movement speed etc.
There are also coils which is a whole system of its own. Different coil types give different stats, the more you have, the higher ranks. Items can have coils of their own and slots for inserting additional coils. So a lot of build possibilities.

Building: A lot of nice traps, and a good snap/un-snap system for building walls/foundations etc.

Map: The map is NOT voxel based, like 7 days to die, which is neither positive nor negative. It probably helps with the performance, and the map has a nice layout, since it was created by a human, and not random generated. There is also a system in place for finding stuff for skill-ups, which is placed further away from the starting-point, as progression moves on. The map is split in zones such as desert/toxic and ice, which works really nice with progression.

If you are thinking about it, just buy it now. Next big update (RSN) will include a much larger map, vehicles, more and nastiers Zs. No news on what is coming for lone survivors. With luck, no new mini-games.

Pros: Fun, overall.
If you don't like waves of Zs, access game difficulty at main menu, disable waves.
If you don't like giants (me) then use Custom and turn Giant respawn to maximum, this is for Giants in the mountain areas. To make them marginal, access their health option. Set it to Zero, which means you can drop them with half a clip from either AR. Just shoot them in the center of their chest. Elsewhere does minimal damage, as far as I know.

UPDATED: I am doing an update to this review at 6,240 hours.

This game turned out to become my favorite game for the past two years. It's so fun to play and so challenging. I initially bought it because it said early access and ""get involved with this game as it develops"". I've never done that before so it sounded awesome. It's been an awesome 2+ years play-testing this game. Jackto has been an awesome developer to work with! 

[hr][/hr]
In this game you can loot cars, houses, office buildings and chop down trees, crush boulders and haul all these materials back to a camp where you can build a base. Each night (you can change it in the settings) you are attacked by a wave of zombies that you CAN NOT hide from! They always know where you are and they will never go away! You're in luck though because you can build a lot of different traps to help kill the zombies.

The zombies. Well, these aren't some Walking Dead zombies that's for sure. Think more like Resident Evil. Some kind of dark, twisted creations crawling out of the underground lab. The zombies in this game are amazing. They are Jackto's pride and joy. These zombies will terrify you. Not at first, the early world zombies are harmless, but the deeper you dive into this world the scarier (and harder) it gets.

There is a large open world to explore. You can build anything, anywhere but the buildings that come with the map are indestructible. A lot of people use this to their advantage. There are vehicles in the game now that you can use to get around the large map faster. You can build stuff on one of the vehicles and I can't tell you how fun it is to build a ton of storage containers on one and take it out for a day long scavenge. I use the vehicle like a pack mule.

The game has a lot of customization settings now. You can change your difficulty mid-game so if you think it's too hard or too easy you can go alter the settings in the existing game without having to start a new game. Super convenient. Some of us like to disable the nightly wave and take our time to build then re-enable the wave when we're ready. There's so many ways you can play it and there is also a sandbox mode now too. You can build a base for free and throw zombies at it whenever you want using the sandbox to test it out.

Anyways I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tower defense games with a zombie element. Who enjoys open world games where you can build anywhere and who enjoys games that present with a real challenge. This game will keep throwing surprises at you as you play. It's very entertaining. :D

Jackto does read all our posts in the Steam forum so if you had a message to communicate with the developer you can post there. I can confirm for you that they do read there even if they don't always respond. If you experience a bug you can report it there and expect it to get fixed, although not very fast. Think zombie speed, and no, not World War Z zombie speed :p

This game is being created by 2 main developers using the Unreal 4 engine, 1 programmer (Jeonghyun Ha) and 1 artist (Lee Min-gyu). Crowd funding only made $2790 USD to begin working on the game. Jackto Studios is an indie game development team started in 2018 with two colleagues working on the same team at a game company.

""We were working at a game company and making games, but we were just office workers rather than creators making games. That's why we created this team and started this project to develop the games we want to play and create.""

Jackto still has a couple major developments planned before they call the game finished so we are still in development stage at the present time. The optimization work is coming along well but the game might still be eating resources. Make sure you have enough RAM. Be prepared to tolerate the occasional BUG before it gets fixed (zombie speed).

There are currently no NPC's in the game to interact with. It's just you and the zombies. There's no living soul in sight. If you want a team, play multiplayer. This game is actually super fun multiplayer.

The game still does not support controllers and I haven't seen any indication that it will ever be implemented. I play the lottery sometimes. If I ever win I'll pay to hire someone to just work for Jackto long enough to add controller support to this game for you guys and that's all. XD

So I have slightly over 100 hours into this game. That's about half solo, and half co-op. I wasn't sure how the game would play solo, but it's just as fun. We haven't run into any bugginess in either mode. We've played co-op both on WAN and LAN, both seem to work fine (with a little lag here and there).

Cons: 
Indy graphics. That's about it. Anything else I would attribute to it being early access. A lot of the bad reviews are things you can change in the server settings, so I don't understand why people complain about it. You can basically adjust the server to be as difficult or easy as you prefer. You can also change server settings in existing games. So if it's too easy or hard, you can adjust it mid-game.

Pros:
Exploring - very similar feel to Kenshi. Lots of loot. Chance of getting cool gear or weapons. Huge map, tons of locations to search. Really enjoy it.

Character Progression - again, similar to Kenshi, where you get common items to research new skills/perks. You must explore to find the more rare research books to expand your skills/perks tree.

Base building - For me this is one area where this game really shines. You will kind of have two bases. One normal base, and a tower defense base for zambie waves at night. I would compare base building to something like Grounded - it could use more options (early access). You can upgrade in-place. You can also change the server setting to give you all materials back upon destruction so you can experiment.  The tower defense traps are highly amusing to watch as the zambies make their way through your maze.

Crafting - You can add modules to weapons and gear and remove them to put into new items without loss. Workbench crafting is similar to Valheim where you have 5-6 benches, some can be upgraded to craft higher-end items.

Gathering/Loot - Things seem pretty balanced aside from the use of branches. I upped the loot amount to x2 to cut down on some of the common materials grind.

Fishing - yes. Get the damn fish.",1684757469,1686661733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I don't care if a game is in alpha/beta/full release state - the only question for me is: Is it enjoyable recommendable in its current state.

I know I do not have a lot of playtime, since I didn't get hooked at all I am probably going to refund it.

The game feels bland, with no trace of immersion, while featuring little to no polish.

The world feels sterile, with a zombie a trashcan and 2 cardboard boxes every 20 meters, the houses are devoid of furniture, zombies warping height levels due to the lack of climbing animations. Everything feels artificial.

The core loop basically is a tower defense every (you can set it in the options) hour, while you use the meantime to gather more resources to improve your defensive design or progressing the story to escape.

This is NOT a survival game, do not be baited by the tag, its a wave defense game with open world progression. Some people may find a niche here as I do not know how many games are combining this. If I want to do some building I probably would look for factorio/ark/satisfactory, for tower defenses, which definitely do not fall into my preferences I enjoyed Sanctum(2) a lot more.

It was not worth the 21€ Pricetag for me, I will most definitely refund it.

For an alpha build while I am typing this. The game still runs very smoothly and the crafting works as intended with a great deal of additions and quality of life improvements. The animations are coming along and the textures themselves are fairly good this early on. Particularly within the player model, along with the zombies. I can say after giving this game so more time and getting further within the; crafting, zombie wave, scavenging loop. I still fully recommend this game even more so. There is a good offering here overall. The updates have been coming and the content offerings have been good. The world map overall is substantially bigger. 

Pros (+) Keep in mind this is still Alpha during this review!

1. Good usage of game engine (pop up still occurs, but it's been smoothed out substantially compared to June 2022)
2. Crafting is a strong point with a great deal of variety in current build. There is progression via your research table and upgrades for virtually every aspect. (Think rust for structures., ie; wood -> stone -> steel)
3. Up-gradable weapons which can be taken to +10 to keep them relevant.
4. developmental updates still exist currently (As of 05/31/2023)
5. combat isn't broken and hit registry exists, melee is a tad slow until you get attack speed perks
6. perk system (another grind mechanic so this may be a con for some) The impact of perks has been tuned/more weighty in terms of choice since the big patches. This won't drastically alter your game, just pick and choose to cater to your own play style.
7. There is a large world out there with a lot to find and explore. Don't be mislead to think you are stuck with what you can craft, that is entirely far from the truth. 
8. One thing I had to go back on was enemy variety, as I have progressed it is definitely there. Since the large world updates and my own exploration/work towards getting through other biomes. There are a lot of enemies with different abilities and models. Initially it may not seem that way, but get vehicles going, and don't forget your ""Hot Drinks"" and ""Cold Drinks"" These items are crucial to mitigate adverse effects.
9. Straight forward; Use your journal to progress, plain and simple. If you ever are confused on how to obtain a specific material/item. Open your crafting and use your mouse to hover over the item. You will literally get generalized areas/ways these items drop. You may even have a specific location on the map that an item only spawns in. Little things like this get overlooked, but once you are aware. Your progression is no longer halted.
10. Vehicles are an absolute game changer, this was arguably the best addition thus far. Traversing isn't nearly as monotonous and time consuming. What you can do with ramps and vehicles makes for some creative base entering/exiting.

Cons (-)  Keep in mind this is still Alpha during this review!

1. Enemy AI is predictable and fairly easy to read at the moment, enemies track you for great distances. With this update, the variety in enemies has mitigated this a bit, but overall the AI is still fairly easy to read. It's progress though nonetheless.
2. The world is still experiencing texture pop in, but not nearly to its previous state.
3. Stealth is better functioning, but only applies to your characters movement. From testing you can sneak through a lot of places, vision will of course still get you detected, but you start breaking one box and you bring down enemies on your location from  a fairly long distance. Again it's still in the con, but it's leaps and bounds better with how the game currently feels.
4. The combat loop is somewhat of a slog still, but the inclusion of new firearms and weapon adjustments have eased this. 
5. In multiplayer you can experience some stutter (This is to be expected in alpha) This still persists particularly when saves occur.
6. A micro freeze occurs when the auto-save occurs.
7. It's a bit of a grind to access other biomes effectively. For those that may not stick with it long enough per patch. You have to grind and really work for some resources (i.e. carrots can only be found farming as far as I know) It quite a grind. Make sure to get traps small/medium going to start producing fertilizer.


The AI won't particularly wow you still, but that's to be expected. So far this is shaping up to be something special. In many ways I want to say it's something akin to The Forest mixed with Valheim. Which both of those games I do greatly enjoy so my bias resides there. I still hold this opinion as of 05/31/2023

With the update to this review I am still completely on board with this project, it may not be for everyone, but I am under the assumption most people playing this are aware of general crafting games and have a good idea of what to expect. The base building is still very solid and delving into the electrical systems there is plenty to do here. Again it's hard not to draw comparisons, but it takes some strong aspects of other games and meshes them together very well. 

I got this when it was on sale, but it's fully worth the asking price if you are inclined to support the devs. There are plans still in motion from what I understand and I'm going to continue to update as positives/negatives make themselves known from my perspective.",1666961533,1685507715,True,8,0,0.624981284141540527,0,True,False,True

Many of the designs in the game make sense. To learn skills you have to go to places where the skill may have been done by people in the world before the zombie rising. At those places you find books to read that teach you the skills! Much better than just randomly becoming stronger cause you killed enough rabbits. 
The world is really well laid out with some really cool looking buildings, inside and out. There is a mall that is the most mall like place I have ever been in for a video game. 
They also have a really well developed system of keeping all your resources growing. This makes the style of game super flexible. You could never leave your base and still get everything you need by harvesting resources or by looting buildings, or a mix if you like the variety. 
The coil system is refreshingly new for me, I have not seen a power system like it before and I love how you can become super strong! 
I have really enjoyed this game and my time in it. It is still early access so there is still need of some optimization in a number of areas, like performance and in material mix, I always had too much wood things and I never tried to loot it for example. In attempting to get enough branches there is a super huge surplus of either leaves or logs. 
For the future of this game I would love to see more done with paper after all skills have been learned. Like perhaps being able to gain xp for papers or something. I ended with 30k papers extra as there does come a point where the only useful thing to do is turn them into leaves to be used as something else but I never had a shortage of leaves either...soo...yeah. 
Either way, super recommend, it was an enjoyable pace! Over 150 hours in the first playthrough and some time spent with others by the time of this review.

Hordes are every night and the world you interact with is simple but many things can be broken down for parts. Every night there seems to be a new threat that could potentially break your base down. Fire zombies can burn everythings that is still wood by day 5, exploding zombies can take out anything that hasn't been upgraded to metal, and giant zombies can pretty much break anything they can get close to. The tech progression is nice and the electrical systems are actually pretty intuitive for the most part. Long range traps could use a feature to set detection range as they have a very high range and shoot at things far from your base which can waste ammo and leave you searching for loot bags scattered all over the place. All in all, its a great game and I hope the devs keep working on it and give it the polish it deserves!

Edit: Replayed through the game again with the new updates. Vehicles was a nice addition. The map is now much much larger which doesn't really seem necessary except to maybe give the vehicles more of a purpose. The new addition of ores in dedicated mines makes sense, but they did remove all ore nodes in the Subway and the old copper rocks by the river. You now search for coins in phone booths/ vending machines for early game copper.  

The hitbox for things like trees and ore when using an axe or pickaxe was never great and is still annoyingly unforgiving. I would've thought that would have gotten fixed by now. You must be the perfect distance from the object, not too close and not too far, or else you cannot hit it and have to reposition multiple times. 

 The worst of all the new additions to the game, the Fishing system is god-awful and really needs to be re-worked.  Frustrating rather than fun and complete RNG to catch specific fish. You would think the fish would be biome-based with the newer biomes but its all RNG and the UI for fishing is terrible.",1628529331,1685255037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h1]𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐎𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐨𝐧 & 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞[/h1]
𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐚𝐝 is a survival and distinct adventure where very few other games, of similar genre, have dared to venture into and pulled it of in a positive fashion. Though noticeable issues holds it back and can even be considered to be 𝐚𝐧 𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 to players.

 While the game has potential, being capable in delivering either a respectable survival or a great action experience, it is the absence of focus, specialty and fluidity which stands out and thus the gameplay, design and mechanics end up being clunky, rigid and predictable.    

[h1]𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 & 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐦[/h1]
Its simplistic survival design is [i]respectably[/i] enjoyable, though this dynamic contradicts with the late stages where the focus changes and action becomes more predominant. This layer is noticeable due to the [i]Daily Wave System[/i] as players during daytime survive a passive world, though coming nighttime the action takes hold as waves of Undead chase the player mercilessly. This abrupt change is unappealing, as long days can be depicted as being predictable, boring with small nights as stressfull and annoying to deal with, it is an unbalanced design.

By extension, the difficulty isn't adequate for a survival setting as progression is to fast and non-existing, it is appallingly easy to acquire resources and gives the possibility to get into mid/late game content early on without effort. As a survival game it doesn't convey a survival challenge in its fullest capacity.

As an action, story and an adventure game it holds an unique potential. The antagonistic force is strong, relentless and challenging to fight with, as even the easy targets give a false sense of confidence, which if unchecked will lead players into a Game Over when a tougher opponent appears, proper equipment and a strategic mind is required to build up the character through the levels. As the player explores and collects journals an appealing story will build up the world and thus there is a reasonable and a passive objective to venture out into the danger, other than for looting.   

[h1]𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞[/h1]
In order to survive in this world players will have to prove their wits and resilience, if successfull, it is rewarding to visualize the days go by, to know how far the player progressed and survived and eventually the main goal will be in sight ""Get the hell out of this Place"". For the survival types, the objective will remain unchanged and always counting ""One more day"".

It is an experience that will last for a fair ammount of hours and if the player gets accustomed to the gameplay, it will be an adventure for days.",1658759651,1685145249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you don't like crafting then you'll probably not like a game with a lot of crafting.  If you don't like building up your base and collecting resources then you probably won't like a game where you build up your base and collect a lot of resources.  It would like be like buying a game in the  Super Stealthy Killer Guy(tm)  series and saying ""I wanted to like this but there's too much stealth involved."". 

This is one of the top five games I have and the very first early access version had enough to make me happy with my purchase.  The game is a perfect blend of survival and, on top of that, there is an extensive set of customization options where you can do everything from turn off waves to controlling how powerful or plentiful npcs are.  I like turning down the HP on the zombies but cranking the world population way up.  Running through huge crowds of zombies with your knife cutting them down is quite fun.

The options for building are quit surprising.  I have built bases that were just obscenely large and everything run fine, with no delays.  I really can't complain about anything in this game (but I still will in a bit) and comments like - I've played for 230,000,000 hours, but I can't recommend this game are just silly.  It's like going to a buffet, eating 20 plates of food and then saying you can't recommend the restaurant.  

If you want to beat up a lot of zombies, travel around a large area, build up a cool base or bases, then this is a great game.  The waves make it like a tower defense , but that pushes your daily cycle and makes it a bit more interesting. What can you build that will torment the zombies in new ways tonight? Is there enough time? Do you have enough resources?

You can also turn of waves if you want. I played one game like that where I cranked up the world population, turned off zombie and resource spawning, and just went through and cleared out the world.  If feel that finding new and exciting ways to destroy zombies is NOT fun, then you might not like this game.  But if this is your kind of thing you will love it.

And finally, how can you not like a game that lets you run around as the bearded lady (who identifies as a zombie clown from Arkansas)? If I made a TV series from this game it would be:  Hot chick with a 70s mustache.  I think Amazon wants to buy the rights to that.

There are some nit-picky things and one big wish list item, but these come from playing hundreds of hours of the game. Spend hundreds of hours with a person and see if you can't find anything that drives you crazy about them.

It's no surprise that zombies scream ""arrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"", because R is one of the biggest annoyances in the game.  For example, when need to refuel your bike, you hit ""R"" unless you are holding your wrench in which case ""R"" is - disassemble. So, you mean to refuel your bike but forget you are holding your hammer or wrench - you'd better be quick or your vehicle is recycled. But if you want to repair it's ""T"" (???)  while getting to your vehicles inventory is ""T"".  So, if your bike is broken you have to fix it before you can get to your inventory. Not sure if that is intended or not. And, to make everything worse, ""T"" and ""R"" are next to each other on the keyboard. If you have fat sausage fingers then you'll frequently hit the ""R"" instead of ""T"" so you are trying to get to your inventory and you've just started taking apart your bike.    All of this can, and most likely will, be fixed later on.  It's hardly a show stopper, but it does get you once in a while and that always seems to be at the worst time. Running away from a hoard of zombies? Better refuel before taking off. Oooops. You just disassembled your bike instead of refueling it.  Maybe I can ask the zombies to wait a minute....

The next minor annoyance fits in with my one big request. The problem is that, for some reason, the # keys will not register when you are trying to switch to different items on your toolbar.  Usually when you have been chopping down a tree and, get surprise attacked, and are trying to run away and switch to a weapon the keys will stop working and you'll have to either run or fight off the zombies with whatever you have in your hands.  I don't know why, but this happens several times in a game session. I can just open my inventory and close it and this will go away, but if you are being chased, stopping to check your pockets isn't the best idea. As for my request - please Please PLEASE - make it so that you can switch items in your toolbar using the mouse wheel.  If I could swap items without having to use the keyboard that would be great. 

Another annoyance is that melee weapons will frequently hit walls in when you are in a closed in area. This makes using even a knife unpractical when clearing a building. You are standing there trying to swing at someone in front of your face and keep hitting the wall while they are chewing on your face.  I think the face chewers are window lickers that became zombies, but that os just a theory.

The crafting system/recipe system could use a bit of refining.  There's so many times when I'm building something and - oh! need more nails. Run back and get nails. Build two things and - oh need more rope. Then it's - out of planks.  All the different types of items are fine and I think the crafting is fun. It's just a pain in the butt when, in order to build more than two types of things at the same time, you have to keep running back to your supply stash to swap out items.  

The detail of the world is great. The area is big and there so many places to go. I always find myself thinking how cool it would be to have a base in different places. As I mentioned before, you can build incredibly large bases and have quite a lot of stuff going on. With the game customization options, you can tailor the game to the way you want to play. So, if you've only played 1 hour and 10 minutes and you say the game is no good then you probably haven't used the customization options.    

The story isn't in there yet. There's the original one, but that will be replaced by a better one in the future. Not sure what it is, but I'm finding chips in some of the big zombies.  Computer chips, not the in-game stale chips that give you energy but make you sick. 

Finally, there's the vehicle *update*.  I'm hoping this will be adjusted because even slightly touching a wall sends my bike into the sky and more than once my motorcycle has become stuck in the ceiling and the option to pick it up isn't available.  Just like IRL, I hate it when my motorcycle gets stuck in the ceiling.   The vehicles are really fun and I like having a loot-house on wheels.  Just going through a town and wiping everything out and looting things down to the bare bones can be quite fun, if you like that kind of thing.

Does it have co-op? Yes, you can sit on the toilet and fight zombies with your friends at the same time.  They have yet to add in a remote controlled arm so that someone can scratch your butt for you, but as far as gameplay, multi-player is fully supported. I haven't used it as I really don't find it enjoyable to have some fool spending more time telling me what I should and shouldn't be doing than playing the game. I guess if I like being around lots of people, I wouldn't enjoy a game where everyone is dead and the world (or island) is populated by zombies, but that's just me. Hello Kitty Island Adventure is always an alternative.

I find everything in this game to be quite fun and it's one of the 10 games I have ever played that I've actually come back and played again. It has a few kinks to be worked out but I'm guessing that's why this is in early access. Just remember to listen to the zombies. RRRRRRRRRRR. Don't forget to fix the RRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.",1684583337,1684618093,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Kudos to the Devs. Great crafting and building mechanics. Replay-ability is top of the charts. Updates started slow in beginning but have increased with QOL and mechanics. I personally like that there is no dialogue as this generally ruins experience and reduces imagination for most games. I watched many play this game on YouTube and they don't justify the vast map and creativity available yet. If I were a streamer/editor I could be of good information to those starting out. The AI mechanics surprise me even with the many hours into it for one reason the devs are improving it with each update. Just an AWESOME game. Never tired or bored and won't hear me say rinse and repeat. So many options for character building and base building. Love it.,1684594985,1684594985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But I have 1,200 in 7DtD. I wish I could give it a thumbs sideways.  But overall, most players will enjoy 7DtD instead. If you have a limited budget, choose that over this as it has so many more options and longer legs.

7DtD is WAY easier to find mods for (because 90% of players don't want to play exactly how the devs intend). And once you get sick of vanilla, it has like 10 amazing overhaul mods to change the entire game. 7DtD also has way more options to tweak the game experience. I realize it's been out a lot longer, however, if had more options back when released as well. Basically, options to tweak games for personal needs win every time.

NotD has wonky/clunky combat and tool use. I hate that the game won't just accept that you're cutting a tree if 1 step too close, making you bounce back. And the same goes for combat attacks. It's like with each swing you are stuck in water. I just prefer the faster/fluid approach in 7DtD

There are WAY too many crafting benches and upgrades. Crafting itself is a huge chore in this game. In 7DtD it's a small focus, not a huge one. And having so many items gated behind finding certain animals to kill is tedious at best. This is more like a ""convert this material to another material"" simulator. Branches need to become planks, planks need to be converted to...

The tutorial is good for learning crafting, except for one main issue...the starting player would likely build everything in the main road where they start to get through the quests, which is NOT good for survival. It should explain that you need to find a defensible position like at a building to start crafting all the benches and upgrades. Because...you would have no idea that every night you get attacked. 

Finally, it's weird that I can place a foundation, then hide on an item zombies can't get to, so they just attack the foundation instead of me. Like, really? LOL. They would all be trying to get to me. They should be able to climb/jump like 7DtD. I could stand there all day and pick them off with arrows while they attack a box.

So overall, this is a decent game. Better than some others in the genre. But at the end of the day, 7DtD is simply more fun, more accessible, can be tweaked to desire, has 100's of mods, and just feels smoother.",1627771392,1684584769,False,0,0,0.51044386625289917,0,True,False,True

I consider this the next contender for 7 days to die. While there's still voxel/rng maps which causes way more replayability in 7dtd, this map is big enough where 52 hours in, I still haven't seen half of it.  The game still needs some work to make it truly better, but this game offers enough variety to suck my group in pretty quick. You can be in both 3rd or first person, there's vehicles, a good amount of crafting, building, and farming. Multiplayer is smooth (have not tried pvp).

Pros:
* - Lots of goals. Tons of books(imagine schematics in 7dtd) and loot to grab for unlocks and upgrades.
* - While not a voxel map like 7dtd, the map is huge. In 52 hours, I've only discovered ~40% of the map.
* - Smooth gameplay, single and multiplayer. Even with over 100 zombies, I had no issues with me and my friend in a big city. Non-host friends had some stuttering usually when one would die and have to load in a new map chunk, but no major issues.
* - Unique trap system. I enjoy watching the pendulum smack the zombies into a spring board, which bounces them back into the pendulum, then over to a crusher to finish them off. Good amount of choices to spice up the maze you create.

Cons:
* - Some minor bugs. Vehicles can fall through the map at steep slopes on mountains, non-hosts can get stuck in sleeping bags, they have to reconnect to get out. Thankfully the game loads quick so its only slightly inconvenient.
* - Zombies can get stuck on permanent objects instead of pathing around to the player.
* - Some game crashes can happen. In 52 hours, my group of 3 crashed 3 times.
* - No daylight adjustment, only day length. The issue with this is, if you make the day 2-3 hours long, then the nights are also extended that, but the amount of zombies during the night stays the same, meaning theyre pretty spread out, causing the nights to be rather boring. If you make the day 30mins/1 hour long, then daylight goes too fast and nothing gets done.

Its been over  2.5 years now since the game released, and nothing has changed.
""Night of the Dead"" is still as rough as it was on day 1, and still feels like a young teen-kid programmed this as a school project, and then never invested in time in fixing the game after its release.  I can recommend about 50 other games that are better than this game in almost every way.
Yet another game that had lofty goals, but was over-sold, over-hyped, and where the dev(s) never had any intention of ever finishing the game.  Unless you receive this game for free, don't bother... and even if you get it for free, still, don't bother, unless the dev opens the game up for community development, improvements, & mods.
What a waste... and so common these days... SMH

--- Original Review ---

DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE !
What a ripoff of an unfinished, dumpster-fire, garbage-game!
Its grossly unbalanced, unrealistic, & stupidly difficult for no good reason.   NOT fun at all!

From the moment you spawn in, you have less then a day, to build a base with enough defenses to fend off a massive horde of hundreds of zombies (basically impossible without cheats).
You  don't have enough time to gather enough resources, and craft, and build all that is needed, in under a day.

Meanwhile, the zombies don't take any fall-damage, don't experience friendly-fire, can no-clip through bodies of water (while you drown in just 30 seconds), and all have a link to a drone feeding them your location, so no matter how far & fast you run (even to the edges of the map), they will always find you.

Go back to the drawing-board devs... either you're drunk, or just trolling your own customers, because you are miserable trolls with no appreciation for fun, balance, or reality.

I can deal with the beta issues that comes with the game being new, as well as small infuriating bugs with a little patience. What I cant stand is ignorant game mechanics such as extreme loss of mobility for being in snow/desert territories. And by slow I mean slug on the sidewalk slow, simply for just being in the region. Not because of what you're wearing or because of how much weight you're carrying, but breathing in the area. The only thing to avoid it is either coffee/soda which is the laziest thing I've seen in a long time to make an area tough to be in. And what makes it better is that every single thing around you still runs at usain bolt speeds while you're in slow motion. It would've made way more sense to have a slow health drain than it would to just completely eliminate movement speed. Outside of that extremely ignorant feature the crafting is very fun, in the fact that you can build structures and traps which adds a tower defense element to it, instead of digging deep/wide trenches filled with spike and just calling it a day. This game gets you to the max as far as technology goes that 7 days did and then threw in a future vibe to it. If you're a patient player then why not, give it a try.

Is that it?"". So, I left it alone. Then, last december, I saw a major update announcement where they added vehicles, a massive map update, etc and though, ""Dang! They are really working on this. I need to give it a look"". 

So, I gave it a look and I was hooked. Massive map to explore, most building you can raid for supplies, tons of varied zombies with unique abilities, a decent building system, farming, resource miners, fishing, and the largest, craziest horde nights starting on day 1.

I would recommend it but, in the end, there're more negatives than positives aspects (even considering the early access stage).
And I can and I will do compare this one with 7 Days to Die in my points of view hereafter.[/b]

[b](+)[/b] Weapons, tools, workbenches, machines, traps work surprisingly well (if we talk about early access survival-ish games);
[b](+)[/b] Despite a lot of assets, I can feel a labor of love job here, a promising work in progress for sure;
[b](+)[/b] I don't know for how long since its release, but there're a wide range of enemies (with different skins, behavior, attacks), weapons and mods, fauna and flora, and a good amount of crafting recipes;
[b](+)[/b] Like in Conan, we can set difficulty level by adjusting various options (like exp gained, respawn time, no horde waves during night, etc.);

[b](-)[/b] STOP INFECTED ALWAYS TARGETING OUR VEHICLES. THANK YOU, DEVS;
[b](-)[/b] Very basic player customization; we can't edit/modify a previously created avatar: if you load a saved game with another avatar will start a hole new game;
[b](-)[/b] Bad graphics: a strange forced fog ruin everything; it's too dark or too glare; no way you can get rid of the blurry effect (or defect);
[b](-)[/b] Very slow menus (weapon/tool changing)... oof, this is terribly annoying; plus confusing and not functional menus interface (inventory and machines); also a ""craft all"", ""move/take all"" from loot boxes are missing; stacking loot is a mess too: different sizes between inventory and boxes; there's no ""stack same loot"" option or hotkey;
[b](-)[/b] Moving camera while driving is a pain in the ass-et! especially when going down/up; driving physics (or physics in general) are a joke, a bad one;
[b](-)[/b] Player, enemies and even animals can get stuck easily on everything: walls, prefabs, rocks, trees (I saw an infected and an alligator climbing on a tree and a bear stuck on top of a fence more than once). Our avatar can go sky high and fall to its death dropping from the bike or colliding with it;
[b](-)[/b] Lack of information on how to use certain tools/equipment; no info about how much energy are being used/consumed, specially in upgraded machines;
[b](-)[/b] They make use of assets everywhere, every time on everything for sure. [i]Like what?[/i] you may ask, and I tell you: I'm sure I've heard the assault rifle reload sound in Counter Strike; I'm sure that ""Paradise Motel"" is the same place in Left for Dead's Dead Carnival map; same for certain infected's screams or growls; etc.

From the very first moment you step into the game, you are transported to a post-apocalyptic world that is filled with danger and adventure. The game got me hooked in every sense.

One of the things that make Night of the Dead so special is the attention to detail that the developers have put into every aspect of the game and the constant updates despite the small team. The environment is crafted to create a truly immersive experience. The game is also already good enough-optimized, so you can play it for hours on end without any lag or stuttering even in some bigger zombie waves.

There are a variety of survival mechanics that will keep you on your toes at all times. You'll need to gather resources, craft weapons and tools, and build shelter to survive the night. The game also features a day-night cycle, which adds an extra layer of challenge to the gameplay. During the day, you'll need to scavenge for resources and build up your defenses, while at night, you'll need to fight off hordes of undead creatures that are trying to kill you.

One of the things that sets Night of the Dead apart from other survival games is the level of customization that it offers. You can craft a wide variety of weapons and tools, and you can also build your own base from scratch. The game also features a skill tree system that allows you to unlock new abilities and perks as you progress through the game.

In terms of content, Night of the Dead has a lot to offer. I have over 200 hours of gameplay, and never run out of things to do. There are multiple biomes to explore, each with its own unique challenges and rewards. You'll also encounter a wide variety of enemies, from standard zombies to massive bosses that require careful planning and strategy to defeat.

Overall, Night of the Dead is an incredible game that is well worth your time and money. It offers a truly immersive experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of survival games or just looking for something new and exciting to play, Night of the Dead is definitely worth checking out. Also keep in mind you can customise your difficulty and start later new again much higher after you got a better strategy, this helps to prevent frustrations from the base been overrun at the first nights :) The community is small but there is a discord server were people are happy to help beginners",1680225726,1680225726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

During my playtime I had zero crashes and didn't witness any bugs.  The graphics are great and the game play is fun.  The tutorial could be a bit better for someone that hasn't played the genre before but I would imagine most people that pick up the game know what to expect.

I started my base building at my spawn location right away, I soon realized there were plenty of better spots  but oh well it is my first go at it.  My biggest problem (and this isn't the games problem) is that I setup my traps in such a manner that I did just about as much damage to me as the zombies, so I had to stay in certain spots and while the traps reloaded  it would give the mobs a chance to gang up on me.   It is great imagining how I want to set my traps up the next go around.  I just didn't design the flow control like I should.

I may be wrong as I haven't done any research yet on the game, but from my time playing it is more about letting traps do the majority of the work and you finishing off the few that get through.   The trick of course is to manage to reset the traps as they occasionally will need to manually be reset using one of the many resources in the game.

As far as the enemies in the game.  It's not just Zombies that will wreck your day, wolves, alligators and bears and all put a violent end to your journey if you are not careful.  But each of these critters amount many others are kill able, skin able and tasty. 

All in all my first session with this game is great.  I haven't had this much fun with a base building Zombie game since many years ago when 7 Days to Die first came out.   So far this came is much stabler than 7D2D and very enjoyable.  I can see myself keep coming back to it even before it leaves early access which often isn't something I regularly do with EA titles, because I like to wait for the full release but seeing how the game is as stable as it is and already has achievements it already seem so far, release ready in my book.

Vehicles in now and drones coming in a new patch and airdrops? That screams 7 days to die, even the old version has a model zombie from darkness falls mod in it.

Now the amount of buildings vs looting is really stupid. It's broken into tiers also from 1-5 for finding items so once you get that yellow rare item with +15 to strength or memory you wanted or 6 coil slots the only point in going into houses/businesses is ammo. It just turns into a grind with nothing to do or look forward to. So build your base at the beginning city, great now you get to huff it or bike to another city for higher tier gear that makes you rush just to make it back in time for horde night so most runs are just for books needed to up your skills.

The Bad:
-Performance gets tanked alot when you reach a Little Town because there are too many Zombies everywhere.
-Melee doesnt feel good at all and is litteraly best Descriped as ""Hit or Miss"", one would think that a Machete has more Range than your Basic Starter Knife but they Both feel the same.
-Buggy Sounds when you kill Zombies or Animals.
-Hit Response is very Lackluster
-There seems to be some Kind of Milky Filter over the Game and playing around with the Gamma and Contrast  Settings didnt to anything to fix it.
-Looting gets very Tedious fast
-Destroying crafted items and Workbenches gives less Materials in Return than you used to Build them.

The Game has Potential to be very Good if the bad stuff gets fixed and Performance gets Priority over everything, Looting needs to get less Tedious and Skills need to feel less Grindy, after all its still a Game and i dont want to Spend hours farming before i have Fun playing it.

I bought this like 2 years ago and they have definitely added more stuff but I wish there was more and I wish they would have polished a few things. 

Even tho no devs will probably see this here is some constructive feedback

Melee weapons are kind of trash inside buildings since you swing and it just hits the walls and is frustrating

I am not a fan of zombies spawning in and hunting me down every so often, I live on a mountain and I can see them already sprinting at me from like a mile out and is kind of lame

While I like that you can climb stuff I don't like how slow it is

Seeing the same box opening knife animation 20 thousand times in a single sesh gets super old especially since it takes like 5 seconds each time as well, like if you made it .05.-1sec I think I wouldn't have cared as much

I would love to see the actual hitpoints on structures instead of a percentage because all I know the metal walls are the same health as the wooden ones

The biggest complaint I have is the storage... It is so minuscule and takes to much work to make too little storage. For instance 7days all you need to do is hit one tree and you can make a box that can hold your entire inventory. While this game I need to go collect 10 different things craft said res into dif res and then place the box that can only hold like 1/15 of my storage and that is the main reason that I am going to give this game another couple years to mature because I cannot be bothered to loot if storing my loot is such a pain",1679071639,1679071639,True,4,1,0.563469886779785156,1,True,False,True

It's really fun to gradually scope out where you want to settle, build it up, and occasionally relocate or build secondary bases to survive more distant harvesting/loot expeditions. Several of the unique areas are also very memorable. As basically a farming/looting and tower defense game, it's easily my favorite in the genre. On lower difficulties, it's also pretty fun as an exploration stealth game with the bow and arrow.

The biggest downside is that the difficulty is very poorly balanced - traps are SO much more effective than direct combat that you basically have to pick between making base defense trivially easy, or making exploration a tedious slog through bullet-sponge enemies. The opening especially is extremely frustrating for new players, with tutorial-style objectives that actively mislead the player into focusing on the wrong things to survive the first night and a lot of opportunity to soft-lock yourself out of being able to continue without realizing it. (You do respawn, but it's essentially impossible to recover if there are any night horde left on the map and no traps or weapons you can get back to before they reach you again.) Vehicles are also pretty frustrating to use, melee is truly awful, and a lot of the crafting and progression mechanics are opaque and frustrating. As a roguelike or combat game it's frustrating, buggy and incomplete. Even though the map has a lot of cool unique areas to discover, it's also at least 75% heavily-repeated generic assets, so exploration is also not much fun on higher difficulties where every building requires careful preparation.

Overall I do think it's a lot of fun, and recommend it if you're most into the base-building, trap layout and exploration part, and willing to do a lot of adjusting on the difficulty to make it match your playstyle. If you're more into direct combat/survival shooter stuff, though, this is going to be a pretty frustrating (and very generic) game on those levels.",1678932562,1678932562,True,3,0,0.508684873580932617,0,True,False,True

1) Crafting is a pain in the ass, the movement of materials is annoying and you can't craft with what's in containers near you, so you have to have everything on you.
2) Melee combat is buggy as fuck, zombies glitch, teleport and clip through stuff.
3) Wild animals don't fight with zombies nor trigger traps (the latter beign THE WORST MECHANIC), so if you end up with a bear near you at the beginning you'll die a shitload of times because it will run into your base and fuck you up until you can kill him.
4) Optimization issues all around, frame drops everywhere every few seconds (or minutes if you're lucky enough).
5) Building has some issues too, you can choose to attach stuff or not, but because the map is not a grid you can end up attaching stuff in weird placement ending up with a deformed base that brings a lot of issues on its own.
6) Going back to crafting, you need to grind the fuck out of everything to get enough materials to get going. Two days in and we spent our time mostly chopping trees and mining stones and we only have like 5 traps.
7) For the god of everything let us move stuff instead of having to demolish and re build (losing a lot of materials in the middle). It's so annoying.

My thoughts:
The tutorial needs to be more in depth for new payers and/or re-ordered. Important things that you could use or need early on do not come until later in the tutorial.
The hit boxes could be improved, especially for mining.
POIs (prefabricated houses and buildings) are indestructible, which admittedly is super helpful but also makes things kind of easy.
When you finally have an off road bike, zombies CONSTANTLY go after it. Even if you aren't riding it. 
Once they are after your bike, they don't stop until it's dead or you kill them. 
If you get off your bike and end up wandering, there's no marker on the map to show you where your bike is. It can be easy to lose a bike in a city or town due to this. 
When riding your bike down steep hills, the camera will not look forward. It doesn't like steep hills downward.

Just a quick update for the 2.0 release. Some of the new stuff includes a greatly increased map size, new gameplay loops like a fishing mini-game and ""coil"" power-ups, and a character progression system. There are new vehicles, which is great because the map is so large now that it takes far to long to run anywhere. You'll find yourself travelling like 50 miles to find a single skillbook and rushing back to your base before midnight. There's so much empty land (I'd really like to see more POI's).

I was hoping for new traps, building pieces or electricity mechanics. However, we got new zombie skins and ridiculous out-of-place animals like lions, tigers, penguins, elephants, ostriches... it's like the devs bought a zoo package from the asset store and decided to use every animal. Come on guys, seeing a rhino run across the highway breaks any immersion.

While none of that is game-breaking, my main problem is that it's way too dark indoors. Even inside windowed buildings there's no daylight coming through, so everything looks washed out and grey-on-grey color. The brightness and contrast sliders in the settings don't help, so I think the issues is the shadows and light sources. This game would probably benefit from raytracing since there's so many dark areas.

Overall, I like the 2.0 update and look forward to more.


[Original review]:

It's actually pretty good. It's like 7 Days to Die meets tower defense. Like 7 Days, there are scheduled zombie hordes, base building, electricity and automated mounted weapons. Unlike 7 Days, the zombies don't just attack whatever is in their way to get to you. These zombies will follow any path you create, as long as the path eventually reaches you. That means you can build an elaborate maze of death for the zombies to run through while you observe from a safe location. That's the tower defense part.

There's lots of different traps, starting with wood and upgraded to metal/electric, like a conveyor belt and a spring loaded plate that yeets zombies off. I like to use the traps that knock the zombies off the maze so they have to run through the gauntlet all over again.

There is a plot, I guess. But you don't play these for a storyline. This is just good old zombie slaughter. You're gonna hole up in your base before that clock strikes midnight, double and triple checking your traps, closing doors, checking power, and making final repairs. Because when they start coming, all you can really do is watch and hope you planned your defenses well.",1630448448,1675533744,True,16,1,0.649010956287384033,1,True,False,True

All together my score would be 8 out of 10, especially as it is made by two devs only, this is a great result. I play it on normal mode, as hard mode let me die over and over without knowing the basics. Probably will play again on hard mode once again.

What I like:
Research System to learn new skills by finding books at coordinates, on special zombies and on bookshelves.
Character build like in an RPG with upgradable weapons and clothes and a point system. Perfect for me.
Loads of Traps to have a zombie extermination fest every night, when the wave comes.
Hunting and looting with upgradable tools.
Open world, good graphics.
Vehicles.

What I don't like after a while:
Vehicles: only used off road motorbike and APC so far. For the motorbike it is good already but the physics aren't right especially on slopes. For the APC why is it not possible to run over trees and lampposts? And the damage system should be fixed, it eats far to much damage from zombies. 
Looting: why is it not possible to put things in containers that I haven't built myself? Takes away reality feeling.
Building: No Ramps? Seriously? For now I use stairs with my vehicles but Ramps really would help.
Surprise attacks with vehicles: I guess a little more variation/ ramdomization of zombie types would go a long way here. Too repeticous otherwise. 

What I would add: a more catchy storyline and some npcs.

But it is a good game, I have fun, so recommend it!

Pros:
- The traps look cool and are fun to see in action.  What a great addition to the genre...
- Hordes and zombie types have a nice variety.
- Building mode fits nicely
- Crafting has decent depth 

Cons:
- No apparent copper nodes?  This sunk the ship for me.  The whole perk of this game was ""traps traps traps!"" But with copper nodes nonexistent or at least no apparent guide on getting them, this game is a dud. Yes, copper can be found from barrels, cars, and other things as well as mined from iron rocks, but it's all RNG and horrifically low chances at that.  Copper is REQUIRED for pretty much all traps and turrets.  It just doesn't make sense to make it so sketchy to get it.
- Community is tiny and I found no actually helpful wiki that was complete.
- Occasional awkward translations in the character and research menus.
- Map gets boring quick once you realize that it's not procedurally generated.

No point in trying to play sneak and build your base in some quiet area since every nights hundreds of zombies spawn right on you with wallhack on.
It's like 7days to die bloodmoon but every nights and right on day one when you try to discover the game and have a small wooden cabin.

If you ever die at night, you'll spawn again in the wild with nothing on you but still zombies spawning and running toward you so all you can do is run all night and try to avoid zombies.

The customisation and the crafting is very childish, you have the illusions of choices but in the end everything lack depth, it's like the game is playing by itself, you're just pressing NEXT buttons.

Night of the dead could be a good game for you if you're 12 yo and it's your first zombies games ever, other than that, flee this game.

The basic premise is simple - You have 2 hours real-time of sunlight to explore the world, level up, find gear and survival stuff, and craft a series of traps and your base to prepare for a short burst of horde siege at night. Every night that passes the zombies get stronger during the night wave.

While that sounds all fine and dandy, polish and a good user experience are not terms synonymous with this title. The game can be summarised as a haphazard cobble web of Unreal store assets and controllers slapped together to function average at best. The melee system is quite literally one of the worst amongst its genre, utilising what the developers have proudly proclaimed as an innovative animation based extremely hitbox precise method of hit detection. In order to deal damage and stagger a zombie, your melee weapon must physically connect its blade to the target. It sounds great until you realise that animations for using melees are inconsistent. You character might swing an axe left first, then try to do a centre smash, then swing it left. Its such an inconsistent system that the only way to properly melee is to get so close right up in the zombie's face that whichever way you swing you make sure it will touch the zombie.

Any time the server lags for a millisecond, the zombie hits you instead. The netcode is so bad that zombies often teleport and desyncs their positions and you will need around 6-10 hits to kill a basic zombie until you reach the lategame weapons.

Vehicles are jank coffins, and the game's APC, despite being a supposedly tanky military vehicle, blows up from colliding into a zombie slightly too fast. We accidentally drove the APC under a ceiling and because we had a flag pole above it flipped our APC and exploded us instantly causing us to lose everything. Fuel is burnt fast and each time you hit a zombie if you do not explode the APC loses around 10% of its health, requiring constant repairs.

There are some positives to this game, and firstly its the map. The map is done very well, despite using a lot of common UE store assets, they are placed well and from the exteriors it looks coherent, and the map has a lot of vistas and landmarks that let you identify your bearing by just looking at the mountains etc. The interiors are kinda bad though, and its not uncommon for the random gen to spawn furniture at an offset, so the fridge clips into the wall or blocks the door.

The base building is decent, and is moreso Sanctum style Tower Defence where you build mazes and towers to funnel them versus 7DaystoDie style where you bunker in for an all round siege. The issue is that the early game is too easy, and ballistas are so overpowered they will one-shot snipe almost any zombie from far away. Build 10 of this and you can survive at least your first 40 real life hours of this game even on Hard or higher settings.

Quick fire points:
-There is a story but its done in just journals that lead you on a goose chase around the map and the ending isn't ready.
-The skills build system while decent is literally unbalanced.
-Zombie variety is good and slightly better than other competitor titles.
-Don't screw around with bears.

Overall its extremely early access and it shows. There is potential for the devs to fix up the issues and itd be a good game, but well... How many early access games that are already 2 years old have ever really been fixed?

I've played thousands of hours worth of other survival games across console and pc, such as Ark, The Forest, 7 Days to Die, Grounded, etc... this game, in less than 35hrs at the time of writing this, has become my FAVORITE survival game. I am blown away by how much content and depth is in this game. It baffles me that it isn't much more popular than it is, but I think that's partly due to a large amount of the current quality in the game originating from their latest massive overhaul update (A.2.0.0), which just released right before I played the game for the first time.

[b]Pros:[/b]

[list]
[*] HUGE open world. Much, much bigger than most games out there. When I opened the map for the first time, I thought to myself ""wow, this map looks huge"" and I only understood probably about 10% the actual size of it, no joke.
[*] Persistent loot and resources. As far as I've seen, nothing despawns or respawns (I killed a deer in broad daylight and then came back to harvest it at night and it was exactly where I left it, nowhere near my house) except zombies and animals; They definitely respawn.
[*] High skill ceiling (or at the very least a knowledge curve) for learning the ins/outs of the game and putting lots of hours into it.
[*] Challenging combat that rewards strategic decisions and careful choices between fight/flight.
[*] Day/night cycle has a much more natural feel than most survival games, since it takes 2hrs (default) for a single day to pass (more on this in Cons as well)
[*] Zombie behavior, abilities, senses, etc are a lot more unique than I see in most zombie survival games. I found myself expecting them to be much different than they really were, leading to some pretty interesting discoveries and experiences along the way.
[*] Food system actually makes sense and doesn't make you feel like you're constantly tending to a crying baby like most survival games. I think this partly stems from the longer day/night cycle, and it's a welcome feature in my book.
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]

[list]
[*] Due to the slow day/night cycle of this game in combination with the choice of visuals, you end up spending probably at least 30% of your time in the dark, barely able to see anything outside of your small flashlight radius, and the only reason I even knew I could turn on the flashlight was because I went into the keybind settings and found it there. EDIT: less than 2 days after I wrote this review, they adjusted the brightness for sunrise and sunset, so the issue about being in the dark is nowhere near as bad as it used to be! It's also worth mentioning I would have known about the flashlight from the game's in-game tutorial but I happened to pick up this game during a brief window of time when there was a bug with the tutorial system, so I wasn't able to experience the tutorial.
[*] This game is VERY difficult, especially for newcomers. I tried playing on normal difficulty and couldn't survive the 1st night in my base. This isn't 100% bad, but I feel the game doesn't do a good job easing into things for players who are learning.
[*] Despite having a stealth system, there are certain conditions in which zombies will always know your exact location from any distance. For an experienced player this isn't a huge problem because you understand these conditions, but it's confusing and frustrating when you don't know what's going on.
[*] Lacking a sufficient base can cause you to lose HUGE amounts of progress with barely any warning. First time I tried to [spoiler] survive night 5, my entire wooden house burned to the ground along with everything inside it (including me lol). [/spoiler]
[*] Massive storage space hog (70gb).
[*] Possibility to lose progress when major updates drop.

Think ""Skyrim"" but as a zombie survival game. Think ""Breath of the wild"" with its open-world and systemic gameplay, but with zombies. This game has Silent Hill levels of dread. It is also a hardcore dungeon crawler, with its massive subway systems and labyrinthine buildings, parking structures, etc. It's also part Tower defense, with its nightly zombie attacks. This game features survival, crafting, melee, and a fully realized fishing mechanic. The character creation system is surprisingly robust. It wouldn't be out of place in any mid-tier MMO. I'd also call it an action adventure game with so many frequently introduced new mechanics and zombie types, that it puts AAA titles to shame. This game has 300 days worth of slowly ramping difficulty and you can tailor the difficulty down to single digit percentages. A single day can last 6 hours or more, if you really want to no-life this game. It's ""7 Days to die"" without the jank and a fully featured 3rd person camera system. (It also has 1st person FYI.) One major difference between this and ""7 Days to die,"" is that the zombie hordes come every night. I have full confidence in Jacktostudios to finish this game. The potential and what's already available is truly noteworthy. 

TLDR: To put it simply, this is the most addicting game I have ever played and i've been a gamer since 1995. I have given many, many sleepless nights to this game and I don't regret a second of it. 

My advice to the devs: Refine. Refine. Refine. You have an absolutely monumental zombie survival experience on your hands. Just tighten up the loose ends. Keep the leveling, combat and crafting all intact. I love the electrical system and the research book scavenging. This game has everything i've ever wanted from an open-world zombie game. Just please fix the load freezes! No matter what settings I run, the game freezes during auto saves and at random times throughout my sessions. The loading screens could definitely be more dynamic and the typos, even in the achievements can be pretty glaring. 

That and the missing sound effects for swimming, running up mountains, etc. Oh, and adding clothing to the first person models. None the less, those are all small details. The broad strokes are brilliant and inspired. I salute you Jacktostudios. 👏 👏 👏

I'm big into survival type games and normally before i buy them, i rely on reviews like this one.  7 days to die is one game I spent hours upon hours on PS4 playing.  A couple years ago, switched to PC and got the PC version, it's way better on PC.  This game gives me the 7 days vibe, the graphics and character models on Night of the dead are way more impressive.  I've only been to two towns and the number of different models is great.  I've heard the desert and snow biomes have even more, can't wait!  The depth of crafting is also very good as well and I'm hoping they add more textures and decorations to spruce up my apocalyptic man cave!  

The downside is that the game is in early access and with that, comes some instability in the game, but i will say this, after a few hiccups in the beginning it's becoming more and more stable and I'm hopeful that this game and the devs continue updating and patching it to correct the issues that arise as I can see myself putting in several hours in this game!",1671720047,1671720047,True,7,1,0.629339754581451416,0,True,False,True

The twist is that you have to gather resource for building by yourself with a time limit before the wave comes.

There is leveling, gearing system in place. There is a tech tree to go through. A collection of contraptions for your kill-box. There are different difficulty that can also be changed to your liking. You can even turn off the night wave, but that basically kill the game off.

The multiplayer is absolutely non-functional with zombies disappearing in the middle of a battle and appearing behind you, beside you or somewhere else. The hit boxes are so poorly optimized that melee combat is unusable. The ranged combat is unusable. The location of crafting changes every update so that you cannot find things from one play session to the next. The building system is broken to where it is nearly impossible to build.

Original:
This game is, without a doubt, one of my favorite games. Zombie hordes every night at midnight. Spend the day trying to refine your traps to keep them from destroying your base. Spend the night watching the traps and hoping for the best.
The developers are responsive and keep this game moving, but, the game is actually already really good. The graphics are decent, the bugs are not really that bad, the game play is really fun. There is a learning curve, and you will die a bit getting the hang of things.
The multi-player needs a little more work, but is fully functional. The game is outstanding with a friend, but it is also plenty playable single-player. If they would just allow you to choose character during multiplayer instead of it being randomly assigned, the multi-player would be nearly perfect.
It keeps improving. It is always worth the price if you like zombie horde games. It is already worth the normal price. On sale would be even more of a reason to grab it!",1623851735,1671305097,False,0,0,0.717890024185180664,0,True,False,True

The animations looked mostly good, if a little wonky and rubber bandy if they hit weird. The environment destruction was well done. Crafting seemed a bit of a mess, around 10 different crafting benches some with very similar purposes. The crafting bench turns metal into nails, but the material crafting bench logs into planks? Looked like it got pretty in depth though which seemed interesting. The ambiance was well done, at first. Zombies were creepy, night was terrifying especially as I just started and some rando zombie made his way to me when I was trying to craft. Zombies are about twice the size of a person which was a little strange but made it terrifying still. Combat could be decent if it gets fleshed out more. 

What I couldn't deal with though was that every zombie was just a sponge. 5+ headshots with the bow to drop one on the just above normal difficulty. Generally took me 10-12 arrows to drop a single zombie. Wouldn't have been as big of a deal if the first two groups I saw didn't have like 6-8 zombies on them. And then I made it through the first night and the first raid triggered. I ran in a house I had already cleared just as night was hitting and a zombie had already respawned in there. As I dealt with that one, the raid hit and the house was swarmed with zombies. I couldn't even tell you how many, my guess would be more than 20 though. They clipped through the walls and door. I stood at the door swinging hitting them until my weapon broke (a seemingly rare ""superior"" pipe that I found in the house) and then sat swinging my wood cutting axe until that broke as well. I think I only dropped 2 or 3 of them. My weapon repair kit wouldn't work or I couldn't figure out how to use it at least. (Some hotkeys didn't work as well so I assumed EA, it just didn't work). So as I sat there contemplating making more weapons to mindlessly swing at zombies clipping through the door, listening to the chorus of way too many fucking zombies beating on the door and walls of the building for a first night, I decided to get a refund instead.

Many other survival games fall into the trap of making things TOO realistic at the cost of fun gameplay, or make zombies behave different from what you would expect just because the developers got into some type of arms race with the players and try to counter their effective building strategies.

These guys on the other hand have made combat quite enjoyable and added a whole bunch of cool traps and things you can use to kill zombies. They've struck the right balance between realism and fun gameplay. 

The game runs well and I've had no issues playing it in multiplayer for hours in a row.

Content updates are not far apart and the developers frequently communicate their ideas and schedule.

I have more play time than what you are going to see on other reviews. I have actually been engaged with the Beta, seen how the Developers are doing things, had multiple emails back and forth with them etc. A lot of the reviews I had read for it have been shallow, they never even read the Roadmaps posted by the Developers about what is being developed for the game for the coming year. Even suggesting things already on it or that have at the time or their review is in the current Beta.

💗First off updates happen like crazy. We are talking 5GB to 8GB, sometimes twice a week. The game version sometimes goes up by 9. The day after thanksgiving an update 9 versions, 2 days later another update 3 versions. The studio worked during the holiday.💚 Jacktostudios has [u]only 2 Developers.[/u] When was the last time you were treated this well?!? Jacktostudios will help with bugs including you sending them your save files so they can figure them out. They respond to the Beta forum. When they have time, if it is actually meaningful to the beta, and if it is not something they are/have already fixed in the current patch they are doing.

I will assume you have read the games description provided and just summarize here.

✨Beta, soon to be 2.0✨
✅The map is bigger than Fallout 4.  There are several cities and towns. You can go inside every building even to the top floor which can be 8 floors up. Build almost anywhere(not in the mines), can change build settings to anywhere if you like. Build unlimited. As many bases as you like. Build automated traps(14), they can be upgraded and enhanced. Automated guns(7), even Multiple Rocket Launcher, and a Railgun. As well as everything you need for a base/home, furniture, plants etc. Electricity system, not needed, but soo makes life easier.

✅There are plenty of weapons. Bow, Crossbow, Knife, Glaive, Throwing Stars, Javelin, Kodachi, One handed-Axe, Spear, Machete, 2 Handed Sword, Crowbar, Chainsaw, one hand and two handed Lightsaber, Handgun, multiple Assault Rifles, multiple Shotguns, multiple Sniper Rifles, multiple SMG, Flamethrower, Grenade launcher, maybe a few others I am forgetting. These can be upgraded, and you can attach parts(various scopes, handles, weapon procs etc.) to further specialize them. They come with random stats on them making each one unique.

✅There is a 'Coil' system that allows you to get several abilities. Weapon procs that can freeze, poison, set on fire, or electrocute/stun your enemies, you can do all these at once. Give you resistance to such things or immunity. Self healing, better chance for high end gear to drop etc.

✅Single player, multiplayer, host your own dedicated server(even on the same comp you play on). Change a plethora of game settings before you load a save from the title screen if you want.

✅Every tree can be cut down, every rock mined. Bushes bushwhacked. Cars dismantled. Things to loot all over the place and inside buildings. Hunt animals, different animals in different climates. Craft or find weapons and armor. Fishing, I never like fishing in games, it is not hard(upgrade your fishing pole and research) or horrible in this game. Cooking.

✅Research plenty of things to improve your character and give you an edge. Jump height, great for when you get surrounded by zombies. Run speed. Damage. Food. Crafting. Backpack size and so much more. Research pages drop from zombies, you will get plenty from the nightly waves. Some advanced research you need certain books to unlock. The non random ones have map coordinates telling you where to go.

✅Vehicles: You can craft them for faster travel. Motorcycles(2), 6 seat Tank(can build on top of), Jet Ski, and a Tank Boat(again build on top of).

✅This game does have an end [b]IF[/b] you chose to pursue it.

❌The first night will be your hardest. After you manage that learning curve the game is not so hard as it seems. Do the quest as fast as possible to get your first 'Trap Machine' then save manually. Retry till you can get a decent location to set up the Pendulum, like the entrance to a gate, or between two buildings. Walling off other access routes. All else fails you can 'Change Difficulty' right before you load from the title screen to make it as easy as you want.

❌This is not a game for low end systems. The game needs 8GB of ram to its self. It can eat over 6GB of video memory. All trees, rocks and bushes(even plenty of other things) are destroyable. There is loot all over the place. Zombies and animals all over. Every building you can go into and there are entire cities. This is not Fallout 4, Rust or Elden Ring. The things in this game are not just static scenery with interactive objects spread out. 

This could be your next favorite game. This could be the game that ruins your marriage. This could be something that only holds your interests for a short time. I value my entertainment at a minimum of 1 hour per a dollar spent. I have gotten way more than that and it has been a blast. At full price I recommend this game. On sale it's a steal. If you do not like building games- this game is not for you.

The main gameplay loop goes this way : Ignore the main story for the most part, loot building for gear & basic/advanced ressources, find some research paper, harvest basic ressources as you go (tree, branch, boulder) and by the night go back to you home. Including some bird & animal hunting, and fishing later for gear upgrade.

You build stuff like in most unreal engine game. Place a foundation, place some wall/door/window and ignore the roof because there isn't any flying zombies or weather.
At midnight a bunch of zombie will spawn in predetermined spot around you and try to reach/kill you. They do not break building as long as there is a open path to you, so unlike some other game, a door is fine to walk in/out of your base, no need for jumping trick and the like.
So you build some trap, like in a small maze, and let the trap do the work.

There is very little maintenance required on normal difficulty if you do it right.

And then next day you do it again.

The map is fixed, and lot of research are locked behind a specific book find at a specific place (the game tell you exactly where), so you can just make a trip, grab one or two specific book, come back home and fill the time left with basic harvesting/gathering/building.

Each night the game is harder tho, On normal difficulty it's totally doable (minus first time first night), and worse case you can change the difficulty setting when you load your save.

As honorable mention, there is a good variety of zombies (with 4 themes ice fire electric poison).

Then, what's about the ""clunky/misleading/unfinished"" mention ?
Well harvesting is clunky. It's hard to hit the ressources. Melee hitbox can be super annoying at time, since youur attack is cancelled if you hit something too close (you do nothing), and interupted if you hit something  (you could still hit a zombie and get an interupted animation if you hit a wall after the zombie).
It's hard to use most weapon in building. Only the best end game melee weapon is immune to this.

As for the misleading part, the game doesn't tell you how much a zombie is hurt, how much health he could have, how much your trap damage them ... and there is no creative mode to test it out, you need a specific unreal engine dev tool for that. And talking about said tool is against the forum rules.
There is very very little information on the internet so you are pretty much on your own. Want to know if this trap is good or suck ? Well, joke on you, you won't. Want to know if it's better to add +10dmg or 25% dmg to your trap ? Welp. Who know. Wanna know what exactly does stats do ? It could work. Or not. You cannot tell.

There is also a whole shield techtree & parry system that is somewhat broken. It's annoying to use them in the first place anyway because you need to place the shield on your hotbar (8 slot btw), add a one hand weapon, then draw both one after the other to equip yourself if you don't go trough the inventory. And repeat every single time you want to use a tool to harvest something, or use a ranged weapon. Each type you equip something you lose your momentum and slow down, and need to wait for a second before you can attack.
And anyway you can just dodge instead bothering using a shield.

And lastly most (somme are cool tho !) building feel really empty. Some part of the map looks weird/unrealistic. I mean it can be some detail like why anybody would build two lampost in front of each other for a road that can barely fit one car; lot of road have weird sizes; some door rotate around the door handle somehow; some furniture clip into each other; etc.

This is a good game, don’t get me wrong. One of few I actually got excited about playing. However, the features in the beta release were what I was interested in. So I bought the game and set up to play that version. I’ve had lots of issues, though. Some have been (and at the time of posting this review, currently are) very frustrating.

The devs are quick to fix bugs, I’ll give them that. However, this creates the biggest issues for me. It seems every time I want to play this game, I have to wait hours for the latest patch of several GBs to download and install. (It seems when they fix one thing, they inadvertently break something else.)

I will revise my review when a decent stable version is released. With all the cool features that keep getting added, I’m sure it will be very good game.

My tips to the devs: concentrate on fixing the bugs! (Then improve and add new building features, add a few more traps, and finally release out of beta. Other changes and additions can wait.) I understand this is a beta release (of an early access game), and so expect some issues, but introducing bugs with every patch is just bad – especially when it is patching 78 GB of game files!",1669321933,1669321933,False,1,0,0.415094316005706787,0,True,False,True

So. I played this game. Obviously cuz otherwise i couldn't write a review. And it was great. It was amazing. As far as you would consider a slow and painful death great and amazing. 
The pace is way to slow. I mean don't get me wrong I love traffic jams cuz I can listen to Podcasts instead of working but in this scenario it is not possible since every 2 Minutes some female zombie knocks on my door cuz she want's to get SLAMMED DOWN BY MY HOLY LVL 3 AXE AGAIN. So. I have to pause the Podcast every 2 Minutes. And since my Brain is only used to TIKTOK I do not have the attention span to remember where I stopped which means I listened to the same 2 Minutes of Podcast for 5 hours of playtime.

The Game has some great ideas. And if you believe in this game you should buy it and hope that there will be some major updates soon. But rn imo it is just a slow version of 7Days to Die with some extra features from Project Zomboid and another game which name i forgot since more than 2 thoughts at the same time exceed my Braincapacity.

With these games it's hard to find the right balance - either surviving is too harsh and unforgiving or the game world becomes boring.
Have to say although this is still Early Access, Night of the Dead (PVE Co-op) is so far ticking all the balance boxes.

The game runs a day & night cycle. 
Daytime you will spend time resource gathering, building and repairing. (also dodging zombies, wolves, bears etc)
Night is when the horde of the undead come to lay waste to all that you cherish. 
The longer you stay alive in 'game days' the more intense the raid is on yourself...
There is also a thin but OK story line about escaping the island.

One of the best things about this game is the ability to use the pre-fab structures which you can basically meld your base build into - you can more or less build anywhere. 
In other games of this genre it's generally you can build in the wilderness a certain distance away from pre-fabs and that's it, always felt this made the game world a bit disjointed.

The game has character XP and levelling incorporating a generous skills tree and attribute system. Armour includes sockets which can be slotted with 'coils' - giving buffs and chance abilities. Both weapons and armour can be re-forged for increasingly better gear.

The UI is basic but does the job. POV - you can play 1st person or 3rd. The building mechanic is good - snap to or loosely fit, with the resouce requirement not being OTT

The game mode is quite flexible and incorporates auto and manual saves . I'm currently hosting a co-op game with one other. 
You can use the same save game file either single player or online with also the ability to adjust the difficulty between saves. 
Teams can be set in game for some organised PVP to throw into the zombie mix. :)
The game also provides a dedicated server feature (not looked into that as such) 

So..  8/10 i guess as not played any PVP aspects of the the game.

Trying think of some stupid Steam review cliche.. 
I dunno -  ""I  love to chop down trees, it gives me stiff wood every time, will defo chop more""

The inventory management in this game is extremely annoying, as the player can carry tons of stuff, but even fully upgraded chests don't even come close to a third of the player's capacity. Thankfully, the stack size in chests is higher than on the player's, but you still need tons and tons of chests in your base, and emptying your inventory feels like a chore every single time.

I like the coil upgrade system, where you unlock new perks such as elemental damage if you reach a certain amount of certain types of coils in your equipment. I do wish the system will get a bit deeper in the future.

Combat isn't too thrilling, though really, this is more of a game about base defense, so it's not too bad.

In its current state, I'm leaning against recommending it, but since it's still in Early Access, I believe the game will eventually get better and fix its annoyances. I'll update my review then.",1666104899,1666104899,False,20,0,0.627067029476165771,0,True,False,True

 This game does have the occasional glitch and the Unreal Engine has in my 30 odd hours of play dumped me to a restart maybe 4 times. However the dev's here have an auto save feature so I have never lost more than maybe 1 or 2 minutes of gameplay.
Now at 30 hours on a somewhat relaxed mode as I chose for easy and only switch on the horde after my first 12- maybe 14 hours of play.
I did start got stuck and exited to start a fresh game with what I had learnt after my first 90 minutes.
For a solo play the dev's have really covered all the bases in my humble opinion...excellent combat guns sound good and the options for leveling the character are simply outstanding. The game simply has so much versatility that at 30 hours in I am simply scratching the surface layer of what is actually possible.
All in All I would say just do it and dont think about it. Game is far superior and at a price point that many major companies should be ashamed of themselves for what they offer and the prices they expect a player to pay.
Are there any downsides you might ask but in all honesty not really. The odd glitch here and there is less than my first week of Cyberpunk 2077 for example. The building mechanics are fine but I would like to see a little more versatility but thats because I enjoy building bases but any lack of options does not detract from the overall game.
The hordes are nothing new but they are done exceptionally well and they scale with time so over a few days as they get tougher your base building and defenses should be improved and adjusted accordingly. This again is a very well thought out aspect of the game. 
Basically I am impressed and my only nit pick would be that in solo mode if one plays a calm and peaceful scenario the nights are very long and whilst you can rest on a bed you cannot jump forward in time to arise at dawn....if you can then I have overlooked the option.
All I can say is that I have to ask myself why it took me so long to pay attention to this gem of a game.
Jackto are a two man team if nothing has changed recently and what they have achieved so far is already above and beyond anything I expected.
I never use a point system but this is about as close to a 10 for the fun I am having.

1. Start time and location - Why does the game start at 14:00 for the first day. This gives you very minimal time to understand the concept of the game, before the first wave hits at midnight. Why are we no where near the city?

2. Base Building - The walls do not easily snap together, which takes up valuable time in the beginning of the game due to the 14:00 start time.

2. crafting - there is no direct indicator that workbenches have to be upgraded in order to craft materials. 

3. storage - the storage initially is really bad, just as the workbenches, upgrading the storage container is not a given.

4. Saved games - The way games are saved is very weird, especially if you have multiple profiles. For some reason, my second game would not load after saving and would load my old game.

5. Zombie AI- As others have addressed this issue. The Zombies AI is just stupid. You can be battling one zombie in a room with over 5 of them and more often than not, the other Zombies do not react to the combat.

This game has so much potential and with how small the studio is, don't expect the game to receive updates to address problems within the game. 

For $26.68 with tax, I would not recommend this game for that price point with the issues that still need to be addressed. 7 Days to Die is a far more complete game and cheaper if you use a 3rd party site to buy the game.",1665236132,1665236132,False,0,0,0.439560443162918091,0,True,False,True

The good things:
- The tower defense part of the game is pretty well made.
- It has an end.

The bad things:
 - really buggy controlls: want to switch weapon or tool or pick up something, better press the button 3-4 times till it does what you want.
 - world: half of the map is just filler forest/meadow, and half of the buildings cant be entered. Once you entered the ones you can, the interrior design is clunky, repeated from 5-6 assets, and they clipping through other objects/walls.
- crafting: just one example: processed leather can be made only from rabbit skin. Not fox/wolf/deer/bear, only from rabbit.
- other nonsenses: evidently chainsaw is ideal for mining (no other portable motorized tool is available, they covered it with one tool for cutting tree and smashing stone/iron. Also: the best melee weapon just for extra use). How far a zombie will detect you is seems totally random: once you can breath in their face and they do not care, once they sprinting toward you from a hundred meters.

One of us isn't very good at FPS so we've generally stuck to horror games like dead by daylight, phasmo (a handful of others as they seem to be great for groups of 4), but for us the replayability quickly ran out. We tried Raft, Rust, and sea of thieves but often felt there was a lack of objective and thus progressing for the sake of progress or it felt monotonous. 

We've now landed on Night of the Dead and so far there's no sign we'll be quitting anytime soon. The nightly, progressively more difficult zombie swarm sets a clear objective while also allowing for different approaches. We can all stay together and be gatherers contributing towards base building, or we can do our own things like exploring (solo or in groups) and still contribute. For us and how we operate it offers just the right amount of variety. Loving how we can make a private server with in-depth settings that can be changed every time you load the server (helpful when you're learning but don't want to start over if it's too easy/hard).

Our only gripes (thus far, we've only gotten to like night 12 or so) are generally QoL items:

 Interacting/picking up are across several different buttons, for example if you're being attacked and trying to quickly close a door behind you it can be exceedingly difficult or picking up items except suddenly there are multiple and that's a different button. 

Inventory is a constant mini-game in itself. I've tried to organize items into about 9 different fully upgraded boxes (please add higher capacity boxes!), but my team is less diligent about keeping the order. Would be nice to have any of the following: set boxes to only accept certain materials; add a button to take everything from your inventory that matches anything already in the box; as stated below with the pinning a blueprint would be great to have a button that pulls any needed items at the right qty from the currently selected box. 

Managing your current projects/blueprints: please add the ability to pin something (or somethings so add an ability to set the qty of that thing) you're working on. Trying to build something large and then going from box to box audibly repeating a list of 3-5 things and the qty you need to gather is tough.

So the netcode seems to not yet be up to standard of other similar titles. And our host is on a 100mb/s upload so there should be no lag whatsoever. Solo I've not experienced the rubberbanding at all. Otherwise, top notch, quality game to soak many hundreds of hours into. Something I'd like to see in Co-Op is a shared tech tree and ""objectives"" so you don't each have to create exactly the same crafting benches and craft the same items to advance with objectives. V-Rising does this brilliantly, anyone in the team can learn from the same bench and be up to speed with each other, which is great for newcomers joining the team later into the playthrough.

The mini game, is awful... Even after i maxed out fishing, it is just so beyond boring and frustrating at times... Aside from that, it seems that after you get the 3 fish to build the personal fish pond, now you have to go back out and RNG until you get Rare fish to then upgrade the personal fishing hole, in order to get even more rare fish, in order to upgrade things such a character carry amounts...NEVER has anyone needed FISH anything in order to carry more IRL... -Man i wish i brought more ammo to this fight.... To bad i'm not a fisherman.. Then i coulda carried more...-

And i normally love fishing in games, as a something chill to do aside from the GAME GAME, ya know. Just as something a little extra.

NO. I liked where this game was going but, this is just not fun anymore. ReUninstalled.

See ya in a few more years maybe. Oh, buildings are still Gross AF. Ground clipping into them all over, gross texture, ODD layout, MOSTLY EMPTY, out of place items feel like they don't belong.

Still never added that inside corner building piece??? Why not? The building is fine in this game, and could be a good bit better if that was added. Though the angled Railing for stairs doesn't seem to ever wanna go in for me. IDK if thats a issue or a me thing, lol.

Also NOT a fan of the fact that when you find a gun in the first 5 seconds of the game, well check that off the things to do. NEVER need another one...(only 2 in the game anyways, same gun really, different skin) Whats wrong with this picture? ALL your tools and weapons are one time finds. No better guns, No better weapons, No better tools. Just a sickening grind to upgrade the one version of each that you have.

I do like a lot about this game, don't get me wrong. Just don't wanna ramble about praise here or there when there is work needed on key aspect of this game. The CONS are out weighing PROS in such a way, that it doesn't really matter to mention the PROS, since you wont be enjoying them much at all...

 I do however have to review thumbs down at this point, do to old things that could be better by now are not, and FISHING weighed against your NOT SO MODEST PRICE. Much better out there around your asking price.

But I wish there was a way to get the zombie density and other things of normal mode outside of the health sponge of enemies (in normal it takes 2-3 headshots to kill, which is ridiculous). Overall, the balancing needs work and will turn off people, playing a game on ""normal"" shouldn't be a punishing experience, it should be for the average player, who's gonna be jumping in on ""normal.""

I found it difficult whether to positively or negatively review this. Whether you find this game worth it in its current state will be totally up to you, since there's a lot going on here. I will still probably play this a bit more before uninstalling and waiting to see what it becomes down the road with some updates. But as it stands it's pretty rough, a bit unforgiving and (at least for me) pretty unrewarding. But with a lot of substance already there that makes me hope the few but totally glaring issues will be fixed. This'll be a bit long-winded because I really do want to see this game improve, there's a ton of great things already in place, but just enough for me that makes it more frustrating than fun, and this is mainly some complaints of mine for someone considering buying it.

First, the tutorial isn't much help. I'd seen some reviews so I knew what I was getting into (that you absolutely have to have some defenses in place the first night, and even then maybe you've got to cheese it a bit until you have more figured out). My issue with the tutorial is it (like a quest) gives you rewards as you build the first items you might need; however, the tutorial building objectives are one at a time and cannot be skipped or rearranged. You can't even really see the order, so for new players you might already build a certain crafting station while playing with crafting on your own, then find out the next tutorial is to build that crafting station. So do you waste resources on a duplicate? If you debate on this you might waste time and miss out on two tutorial crafting objectives later being completed just in time to reward you with an item you need (but probably can't craft yet) that'll help you build a trap that'll help you survive your first night. The objectives also seem in an odd order. I was given the instructions on how to turn on my flashlight and dodge (which I already learned) right after surviving night one. A better way to do initial crafting tutorials would be to be able to construct them in your own order, or at least view all of them at once to get a better understanding of what you're being taught in context.

Second (and really a dumb thing, just a complaint of mine), some resource harvesting is grindy and my main problem on this is that some common resources are used more than others in ways that make resource harvesting/organizing difficult. Want to harvest sticks, which you need for crafting arrows/bolts, repairing and reloading traps, as well as a number of other things? You need to go after bushes, trees etc., even though you're going to be using their other resources much less (once your base is set up) and feel you have to find a place for your stockpile of them while meanwhile being still uncomfortable about your dwindling supply of sticks. Metal bits, another item is similar - it's not hard to find, it's just used in so many items that it feels you never have enough of it. The way this gets to me is that it kind of ruins the fun of foraging when you have to devote so much time to common materials (which often you receive from the same drop as other rarer materials that you don't immediately need but now feel you have to manage).

The first two points may come across a little vague unless you've played or seen someone play, but my third and probably main point is melee combat being awkward, broken, while being a totally necessary part of the game. At least for me, I've frequently had to deal with the broken melee due to the resource expense of ranged ammo and the amount of bullet/arrow-sponge zombies populating structures etc. on normal mode. The stick supply problem (used in crafting ammo) combined with spongy enemies as well as many arrows/bolts dissapearing and being unable to recover means you can't simply rely on a ranged bow, even if you get good with it. The cost (materials) of manufacturing rifle rounds doesn't feel to me to justify them being used often either. So melee becomes something you have to use. As for the melee, here's my issues:
-When you swing your weapon, your character swings from a seemingly random direction, and you may hit other objects in the environment, which seems to affect whether the swing will hit the enemy or not. I can't tell if this actually effects the hit but it definitely does weird stuff like stopping the animation, so I believe it does. This is a big deal when you're in a stairwell or an office and it seems every swing connects with something in the room first, with nothing seeming to prevent the zombie landing hits on you.
-There's no block ability by default, although there is a shield and you can dodge at any time. This is awkward because enemies' attack timing can be random and attacks not predictable, so either combat becomes ""hit+leap back+hit"" or ""hit+run away+hit"" and sometimes just being stunlocked by punches. This especially can happen with the variety in smaller zombies' attacks. It's good that there are many different enemy types, but a few base ones are hard to tell apart and have special attacks that they don't telegraph they're about to use. For example, I walked into a subway station, and one zombie turns toward me and shrieks. He then immediately does a charge (without any animation or predictable motion) which knocks me down and stunlocks me with hits until I get from full health to dead, me probably landing one blow in between deathslaps. Add more zombies into the mix and this becomes a nightmare.
-Health. Healing items, craftable or not are rare, and the number of hits you'll have landed on you will have you running through them fast. Plus the disparity in what damage you deal versus the zombies. For example (although every weapon is different), it may take 3-4 hits to kill a single zombie. Meanwhile, it may take 5-8 hits for zombies to kill you. Some people might appreciate the unforgiving damage here, that the player isn't much stronger than the undead, but when it comes to the other broken elements of melee, fighting more than two can easily be suicide and even fighting one you may randomly be stunlocked and killed without warning.


This game has a great deal of positives, but the second and third point are my main complaints on the negatives I think would have to be fixed before I'd recommend the game (at least for player who'll spend a lot of their time solo, coop would mitigate a lot of resource harvesting and combat issues). All this being said, I'm hopeful its potential is realized down the road and probably am going to keep playing it but lessen the difficulty to account for the ridiculous resource/health cost of combat, which make the ""normal"" difficulty almost unbearable.",1659828818,1660011400,False,4,0,0.529192924499511719,0,True,False,True

Pros:
+Interesting concept
+Enough content to keep most folks playing for the $1=1hr conversion.

Cons:
-Wide horizontal melee swings+EXTREMELY tight cooridors+Obstacles blocking said melee swings=Very unfun combat.
-Whatever building/animal assets they use are too big relative to player size(Don't ask me how this and the above manage to exist in one game).
-Repairing between nights is needlessly tedious.
-Zombie AI is the worst I've seen in these kinds of games.  Broken more often than not.
-Hit reg is pretty iffy.
-The gameplay loop gets very stale very quickly.  The game simply doesn't look good enough for it to skate by as the spectacle zombie death maze thing I think they were going for.

Another reviewer already addressed the rough edges like the repeated building layouts, and the zombie AI being....well just not really behaving like their zombie...type?  Like the screamers scream and run....but there is no reaction from the other zombies etc.  I have two big issues with the game in its current state.  
1: I'm a solo survivor.  In my mid 30's so what little friends i have, well, we just can't get the time to play at the same time cause kids, work, etc.  That being said, for a solo player nightly raids are completely insane.  The very first night i'm barely 7 steps through a tutorial (16 hours in and i'm still getting tasks from) and i have at least a dozen zombies coming to fuck up my one reinforced platform with a staircase as i stand on top with my stone knife and bow just getting fucking wrecked.  At least in 7 days to die you had a week to learn the ropes and get some kind of defense up before they just threw the whole horde at you.
2: 90% of what is shown was added in the last update (over a month ago) i haven't seen any of.  No vehicles, no new zombie types, i keep finding the same 5 weapons, and constant duplicates of them.  Haven't seen a single one of the new added weapons.  As for making the map bigger i wouldn't know if thats true because i've completely lost interest.  I had to turn of the nightly raids cause i can't get anything in place that they don't just rip down and kill me because they start on day one when you literally have nothing.  So then it just became about exploration which was fun...until i realized that after the first 5 buildings you've literally found every non craftable resource and duplicates of the hand of weapons that i've come across.  Maybe all that added shit is out there and i just haven't found it, but it's just incredibly dull without any variety.  Also the leveling system seems unbalanced.  I'll go out for a day and explore a school or a hospital and at the end i've somehow leveled like ten times and have mad perk points.  That would probably make more sense with the nightly raids but it's just too unbalanced and theres not enough entertainment value and variety to keep me interested.

Probably going to be an incredible game after a few MAJOR updates but right now it just isn't playable for a solo player.

Update: So i adjusted my strategy at the start and i've found a way to deal with the waves solo.  NOW i have a WHOLE NEW PROBLEM!  My save file from yesterday where i actually managed to survive and put literally the whole day into getting my base set up....isn't loading.  The save is there but when i load, it loads from a previous failed playthrough.  Same with the autosaves.

If you don't want to do the ""Tower Defense"" part (you build traps at your base to survive a horde of Zombies that gets more difficult each night) and you can turn it off OR you can tweak all the game mechanics to your heart's content.
The Story is really fun, I never played the Multiplayer or did any PVP but the game was engaging enough that I wanted to do the hardest achievements. I recommend this game especially since it crosses Genres. Also you can fish and I always like when a game has a Fishing option. Oh and you can craft a Lightsaber!

CONS: 
Hardest Achievements can be earned freely with Multiplayer (BOOOO) 
Some Achievements that have nothing to do with Multiplayer can ONLY be done in Multiplayer (No skinning animals for example)
Some of the traps and pathing is kind of glitchy during the Zombie Wave event
Fishing is REQUIRED to upgrade Armor and you can't focus on just High-Tier fish. Personally I think the easiest fix would be the fish tier is based on water depth, fish the Shallow Water for the early easy fish and have the High-Tier fish be in the deep water.

I hope the game production team can pay attention to them. First, as for the balance of some defense facilities, the damage of machine gun turrets is really low, and the cost of bullets is very high, resulting in this weapon being unused in the face of zombies. Second, it is strongly recommended that the game provide a novice tutorial or refer to the atlas, manual, etc., which can display the damage value of defense facilities, zombie atlas, etc. Third, circuit bugs need to be optimized, and there are often some problems.

No vehicles - everywhere you go you need to only run

No proper instructions on fishing

No buy station for weapons

There are also no proper guideline on how to clear the game

There is also no sleep mechanism even at safe areas, No fast travel, No map tagging, no mini map overlay
No Nvidia Support/Recognition

AI is pretty basic and not really good enough to make gameplay interesting. You can shoot a zombie from a distance with a gun and kill it before it recognizes where you are even if you missed the first shot. The only interesting they do is actually try to dodge if you're close range. In a group, you can pick them off from distance one at a time and the others are none the wiser. 

In terms of resources, it needs work there as well, a log can be used to make planks and lumber, which is essentially a support beam, both are a 1 to 1 exchange, meaning a 2x4 takes a whole log. 

The skill or talent set up doesn't seem to do much of anything currently, at 2 the skill for stealth does about as much as it does at 6. 

Enemies are okay, different types of zombies but again the AI isn't great. Animals are kind of a pain, they always seem to know you're there once you're within a certain distance, and bears are essentially giant furry tanks, shrugging off dozens of arrows to the face like nothing.

The settings require a game restart in a lot of cases and even something as simple as turning off the annoying survival notes (long winded tutorial) requires that you save and reload the game. 

It's a decent game that needs a lot of polish, I would recommend it but given how average it is in its current state I would say wait for a few more updates before you get it.",1657381128,1657481703,False,0,1,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,True

Edit: So I've found my only real pet peeve with this game, and its fishing, the mini game is atrocious, unbalanced, and absurd.. hardest fish i had to catch.. a betta..  tiny fish, huge struggle. gold fish and angelfish are easy, and fairly quick.. the added time and struggle for other fish make no sense. breaks immersion and the control system is unbalenced if not broken. i hope they fix it",1656275306,1657425376,True,10,1,0.619521498680114746,0,True,False,True

The concept is pretty simple, build a base and loot the surrounding area during the day and then defend from a horde of zombies during the night, pretty simple concept and the game does add a few cool mechanics to the mix such as fishing, making complex turrets and traps and complex levelling mechanics with a skill tree similar to an RPG game. 

However it's a jack of all trades and certainly a novice at them all. The fishing minigame is similar to that of Stardew Valley, move a bar so that it covers the fish, simple enough; the problem is that the fish icon moves too quickly to keep up with and sometimes teleports to the opposite side of the bar; typically meaning that you will fail the minigame. 

Looting is very boring and there doesn't seem to be any real variety in looting. You'll find the same amount of guns and ammo in a school, lab or random apartment building; and when I say ""guns"" I really mean gun. In my 17 hours of playtime I only found a few weapons types, An assualt rifle, crossbow, spike bat, crowbar and katana... and I found these things at least five times each plus enough rifle ammo to last the entire military for weeks. 

Zombie AI is... weird to say the least. There are some variants to the zombie horde such as spitters, butchers, screamers and exploders and credit to the dev team their are some new zombie types that are interesting but some of the variant zombies seem broken, for example the screamers will scream and run away from you... but nothing seems to happen after that, the zombies in the area don't seem any more alert of me or anything. Plus zombie detection is weird, sometimes the zombies won't see you when you're standing next to them but they'll see you from across the map (during the day; at night zombies from the invading horde will always know where you are at night)
Speaking of the zombie horde, the zombies will all conga line in a single direction towards you but because of how janky the terrain is the zombies will routinely clip into terrain and get stuck and they kind of just break random parts of your base as opposed to targetting the player...  Surely the zombies should focus more on the player than the structures that aren't near to them. 

Also the map design is sloppy. They use the same eight assets for buildings and most of the interesting looking buildings (such as rows of stores, large apartment buildings and so forth) can't even be entered, the doors are just fake and cannot be interacted with at all. 
And the buildings you can go in are all the same with furniture placements that you can't interact with and make no sense. I walked into a villa to find basically nothing in it and not even a bathroom. 

Overall I'd say this game has potential but its very boring and tedious to play as of right now, maybe come back in a few updates.

The Pros:
+ Its graphically pleasing
+ Easy to learn, follows the basics of its genre.
+ There are many research paths to upgrade and ways to customise your character build
+ Automated turrets.
+ Traps. Spike traps. Pendulum traps. ALL. THE. TRAPS.
+ Chainsaw goes brrrr.
+ Hordes occur nightly until 2am with varying ""boss"" enemies showing up.
+ Multiple zombie types, however so far is a bit familiar to other zomble games.
+ Story wise there is an end,  however your server settings allow customisation of this (as well as adjustments to difficulties and the like).

The Cons:
- Some frame drops here and there.
- One crash so far (~12 hours gameplay)
- Early game, the bears gave me flashbacks to Icarus - BAD BEARS. NO ONE LIKES YOU. :<
- I haven't tried PvP servers so no comments there
- The multiplayer servers list does seem pretty empty when joining my partners' so prolly best to buy if you're looking for single player or playing in a group.
-Inventory can get full a bit faster than i'd like.

My general rule of thumb is $1 = 1 hour of game time and then the games' ""generally"" worth it.

I would consider this one worth it but given the variety of other similar games, and The Forest 2 coming out in Oct, I personally would say to pick it up on sale.
One thing that does make it stand out more than other similar style games is the traps system and ability to design your own trap gauntlet *cough hell* to lure zombles into. Definitely a lot of  potential evil fun there.

The character customization is pretty bare bones but hey at least it's there.

Even in early development this is easily heading towards being everything I've ever wanted in an open world zombie game. The attention to detail is immaculate, I love that I can interact with almost every building, any creature, most land structures. I LOVE LOOTING and you bet your ass I did just that for way too many nights when I should have been doing literally anything else in the real world. The crafting is quite complex however there is a system to it and the things you can create are so elaborate and can be customized to suit your mood. You can explore almost everything on the map and experience all the pros/cons for establishing your base in that area (city/rural/building on pre-existing structures). There's a vast selection of weapons and armor to make this game absolutely gory if that's your thing, or if you'd rather stealth around with a cross bow and some silent killers. You can build your base for as long as you'd like since the few objectives that exist aren't time sensitive so you can mess around and explore the many areas to explore for however long you'd like. OR YOU CAN JUST KEEP LOOTING. Set up all the bases you want, or systematically make your way through the game as you'd like. I *love* the option for multiplayer with different 'teams' that can fight against each other and that will be the aspect that I explore next.

Some things I'd like to see: faster ways to travel (motorcycle, fast travel, etc.). There are very few actual objectives within the game, with a surprising lack of side quests given the complexity of the crafting and the immense size of the island. The ending feels very abrupt, I was actually surprised to find it was over. I'd love a continuation and some closure in the story which was left very open ended about what actually happened on the island, where you end up going next - I know there is an entire story past where it was left off. Video still glitches quite a bit and freezes directly before auto save. I'd also appreciate a more accessible way to read the journal entries (customizable text, zoom in feature, etc.).

Excellent, excellent, excellent game. I am truly so excited to play this again (right after I complete some others that I've put on hold for this). Play this game so I can play more of it.",1655454884,1655454884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Once you figure out, however, how the buildings work, THEN, you can IGNORE the training wheels and think 
about where you want to build what you want to do. 

You can actually end up roaming the hills and never find your objective. Not sure how to read the map's coordinates. Only after playing awhile, I now know about where things are.

Also, another note, Normal mode with mobs is actually very difficult if you do not know what you are doing.
I died. Repeatedly.  Even if you somehow evade them for the moment. They will, in short order, find you and eat you. Unless you find some way of killing the mob, there's no real escape.

There is plenty of room for creativity when designing your base and optimizing your defensive strategy. The game can be pretty brutal if you just started playing and there is a bit of a learning curve. Luckily, there are many different custom settings you can tweak to make it easier on you and several preset difficulty settings, so you should be able to take it easy until you learn how to play the game and can play it on Normal or Hard.

The downside to a lot of the games in this genre is that it can start to feel repetitive even as the waves get more difficult. Once you have established yourself with a well-built base and are starting to deal with horde nights relatively easily, you are able to gather up a lot of resources to further upgrade your base to be even more elaborate and formidable. Don't get me wrong, designing and building the most destructive and elaborate zombie shredding temple is part of what's fun about the game but you can overdo it. At that point, you just have to repair everything in your base and collect resources to deal with giant zombies for the next wave.

That said, there is still plenty of fun you can have playing this game. There is a lot of map to explore if you want, you can see how high you can get your wave counter on a single playthrough, there is multiplayer if you want to play with friends and compete with other players on the same server, and there are endless possibilities for different base designs and electrical setups to experiment with.

Be wary of the overly high praise for this game, I purchased the game based on the reviews and I have so far been disappointed.

Pros:
Character Customization: pretty good, you can change pretty much every facial feature but not the body.
Game Customization: pretty good, there are plenty of sliders so you can set the game up to match your play style.
Loot/Resources: you will never run out (depending on how you set up your game), in fact, you will have more resources than you have space to store them.
Armor/weapons: the models for the armor look good (Mad Max style), all armor and weapons are upgradeable.
Base Building: unlimited (as long as you have the resources), you can build as big of a base as you want.
Bugs/Glitches: very few, the game will stutter on occasion, which depending on the difficulty level you set up could be fatal.

Cons:

Story: minimal, there is one story line and no side quests, the story is simple and not at all interesting, basically you find your first journal which will give you map coordinates to the next one, there are 7 journals.
Landscape and Building:  there are a lot of areas that are not complete, basically just blank space, no texture or detail, some of the assets used to populate the areas don't match with other assets in the area, like street lights that are 3-4 stories tall and electrical posts that are only 1-2 stories tall, sometimes you will come across street lights in the middle of the street and guard rails in the middle of the street instead of on the sides, most of the buildings have no texture or definition, the only thing in them are zombies and loot boxes
Crafting: Personally I think this is the worst part of the game, I believe I counted around 11 different work benches you will need to make and you will use almost all of them just to make 1 complete item, you will need alot of resources and components, but unfortunately you will never have enough storage space for all the crap you need, basically build a base for all the storage boxes you will need, another for all the crafting benches.  Each storage box has 10 slots, some items will stack, other will not.  In order to progress in your skill tree you need skill books you find in various buildings, most of the important skill books are not very plentiful, you will need to find these skill books to make tier 2 and 3 level items.  The Crafting aspect of this game is what has ruined the game for me, the components needed are realistic but if I wanted realism I wouldn't play a Zombie game.
Replayability: personally I don't see this game lasting very long, it will be a game that gets boring really fast, because really all you do is build a base and get attacked by waves of zombies every night, like I mentioned earlier there is almost no story, there is no economy (you can't buy or sell anything), there are no other NPC's in the game other than zombies until the very end (if you actually follow the story), playing CO-OP is the only way your going to have any interaction with anyone other than Zombies (and zombies don't talk much).

This is my opinion of the the game in its current state, if they lower the amount of crafting tables and resources/components needed, increase the storage slots of storage containers and hire a writer than can actually make the story interesting and throw in a few non-zombie NPC's, then maybe this game would be worth the asking price, but if they don't, I just don't see this game having a very wide fan base.",1651518240,1651518240,False,12,1,0.641949236392974854,0,True,False,True

Sound design is awful, there are bugs everywhere and it feels like a game that belongs in 2010 with how it plays and how basic it is. Developers must not have had anybody proof-read their work as I came across more spelling and grammar errors than I could be bothered counting. The glass in this game is bullet-proof, collision is awful (i was able to walk through some walls in a town not far from the spawn, shooting near a wall would have your projectile get stuck in thin air and zombies were walking through closed doors). Zombie spawns are also atrocious as they were spawning right in front of me. The AI is also useless, if you just climb up something that zombies are unable to reach you can just stay up there for as long as you want and melee them until you bore yourself to death. You can't hip-fire for some reason and the melee combat is about as basic as it can be.

We want this to be a  Just Survive killer and I hope it succeeds in doing so. But, for now, lets just take in what we have and cross the fingers that it grows into contending game.
In the bible there is a saying, 'Build it and they will come', it does not refer to a gauntlet of traps and mayhem to stop waves of attacking undead, and I think it fits nicely here. Gather your resources, build your contraptions, defend your life...this is what everyone must do to see the light of tomorrow. 'Survive The Night' and be afraid when the clock runs out and the time comes to die or stay alive.
The game features varying levels of difficulty from carebear peaceful to hardcore legendary. Since this is early access, I have started at the tree-hugger level. This is my proving ground and believe me, it is far from easy. The map is sizable, making it very possible to setup camp nearly anywhere...this remains to be seem, since I am currently hunkered down on the outskirts of town.
Currently, the price is just right for the pent-up hype for a new zombie title. This title is for anyone who likes conquering fear, surviving apocalyptic themes, and crafting for survival. There are tons of features and growth to be coded into this title, and not because there is not plenty to do already. The minor imperfections will most likely be gone over time, and with the feedback that the tiny dev team is putting on the table, we have nothing to do but try and break things so they can continue to give deeper content and potentially anything that other titles have done well.
I wish them success. With that, I generously give my earnings in hope that evolution of this title becomes the top contender when it becomes ready for the world. As I shy away from Early Access, given the dev dump rate, this is something I must have. It is a new beginning for a dead and dying genre.
Let there be light on the Night of The Dead.

It's a simple version of 7 days to die. You defense against the upcoming waves of zombies.
Not the best base defense game but worth playing with friends. 

Storyline was extremely weak and I would say just do it for the first run then ignore it in your later run. After more than a year of wait the story is still incomplete and I have no hope in seeing it's completion. It's still a decent game without the story.

The worst thing about this game is the amount of bugs. I am still encountering the same bug that I had on my 1st day gameplay (like a year ago).

Easily one of the best Zombie Survival games I've played! Especially considering it's still in early access, this game is a no brainer if you are into this genre.

Very customizable... Don't like the tower defense part? Turn off the nightly wave when you start the game. Want all materials (synthetic and natural) to respawn around you? Turn the option on when you start. Not into bullet sponge zombies (Legendary)? Try the game on easy and focus on the Journal quests.

I do recomend following the ""tutorial"" when you first play the game. It will lead you thru the basics and give you simple rewards. If you build stuff out of order, the tutorial will make you build it again.

I have to say that I really like the general concept of it being a survival zombie game where you have to play tower defense against waves of zombies.

The reason why I put an additional ~50 hours into it was to test the game to its limits (with using some cheats. But its singleplayer so who gives a fuck).

Before going into the results I have to mention that the game in its current alpha form has the visual asthetic of an assest flip. It doesn't necessarily look bad but it really has no cohesion. The zombie enemies are quite likely bought from the shop.

The map itself also lacks an artistic touch. There are trees growing everywhere. Even through undisturbed concrete. There is no thought put into the scenery. Just assets plastered on a map.

All this could be entirely ignored. I mean, the Gameplay of exploring and building is fun! It is competent in its gameplay aspects.

But once you try to test the games limits you run into issues and performance problems.

I build a quite large fortress that protected itself with mazes around and walls from buildings from the map which are indestructable (your own buildings are not). Long Story short once I intentionally started the wave of Day 100 the tower defense elements quickly fell apart from the bad pathfinding of the enemies resulting in to many of them being alive at once which resulted in abismal performance (<=20FPS on a 2080Super).
The enemies just ran into the indesctructable walls instead of trying to find their way through my carefully planned maze with traps.

One could say at this point ""Cool now I am invincible, these Idiots can't reach me"". But with the lack of challenge the whole reason why you would build a base in the first place becomes nill.

The AI is just to stupid. Because there are normal buildings one could just simply build a ramp 2 meters away from the wall of a tall building, jump onto the building and be entirely invincible.

Tl;DR: Fun concept, asset flip like asthetics and not good enough AI make it currently not worth playing.",1643733341,1643733341,False,1,0,0.486631006002426147,0,True,False,True

Original Review:

tldr: The enemy pathing is broken and prevents this game from being a functional tower defense game.

I have created two medium sized bases (15x15) and in both cases when the base was approaching completion around 50% of the zombies will stop pathing to me.  Half will follow the maze and make their way to the end point where I'm at, but the other half will stop at random places and attack the floors and walls.  If you're similar to me and looking forward to building fun maze bases, you'd better pass on this game.  You'll end up spending a lot of time building a cool base and be disappointed when the pathing stops working.",1625151903,1643471976,True,0,0,0.521919488906860352,0,True,False,True

Difficulty settings are customizable and it show a graph of where its at on the scale. I recommend easy for your first time normal is more like hard in most other games. Still in beta so expect some issues from time to time I haven't had any yet though. 
So you grind for materials and build your tools and base. (I have a house for respawn and storage  and a horde base for fighting the horde.) Its a race against time to grind for mats and build a defense before nightfall. (The hordes are brutal even the first horde can wreck you if you don't have a defense set up.) get clues for story bits and books needed to increase your tech, but make sure your home before nightfall or the horde will wreck you.

As there is a horde every night with no options to decrease that frequency (other than to turn off altogether) then exploring the massive map is fairly pointless as travelling is only on foot and you need to get back each night.  This needs to be fixed or the game loses playability.

Lots to build both functional and just for decoration. Has a Fallout 4 feel, but with more reason to defend your base. I love how you can set the difficulty options to suit you skill and style. Even have the option to turn Waves off, so you can practice build. The map size which is fairly huge, feels good. Not too big or small. Like DayZ, where most signage is in Russian for immersion. The Korean landscape and architecture make you feel like you are somewhere other than the US of A, which is refreshing. I love Boston, LA etc... but we've seen them before. Anyone that played Fallout 4 will enjoy the electrical system, with ""Or"", ""And"" and ""Xor"" gates/switches etc... You won't finish the game anytime soon and why would you want to.

- Dev should pull up the load/save screen on death with the option to revive. Right now you can only revive, once loaded then you can get load/save screen. More often than not reviving just gets you killed again. Cut out the middle man.
- Snapping as with all these building games can be tricky. In Fallout 4 you could mouse wheel while in building mode to bring the item to be placed, closer or farther away. Would be a great addition here.
- Hope they add half stairways. Most items are 4x4 units, would be nice to have 2x2's and 1x1's. Like a 1x1 walls or floors would be nice.

If you are looking for story line, there isn't one. Which is fine by me it's a survival game, that's the story. Every day you didn't die is a new chapter. Cheers

Attacking is jank, seemingly ruled by RNG more than positioning and timing. Lock on combat will get you killed every single time. Thought you were going to shoot your bow? Nah. Thought you were going to jump back and swing your knife? Nah. Devs are obviously making frequent updates to the game, which is good, but their focus isn't on playability right now. Will come back in six months and hope they've sorted things out a bit.

ORIGINAL Review:

Ok, I get it. Enough with the zombie survival games already. I mean they've done EVERYTHING to death already. Right? Well maybe not. TOWER DEFENSE meets ROGUE-LITE OPEN WORLD SURVIVAL.

Nigh of the Dead is a dangerously addictive game that pits you not necessarily against a variety of different types of reanimated corpses out for brains but rather you are fighting against time itself! Those dead are coming for you each and every night so use your precious daylight hours wisely or you WILL pay the price. 

In Night of the Dead your every action has to be carefully thought out. Time and resources are in short supply, but evil undead creatures are not. Your decisions matter and you will be wrong, lots of times. The impending nightly hordes compel you to build, giving purpose and urgency to your exploration, scavenging, crafting, and research. Yeah, this game has a tech tree that you have to research. All your gear will need to be constantly upgraded to keep pace with the growing strength of your nightly visitors.

The game offers lots of different weapon types, but the star attractions are the traps. I won't spoil anything, but your funnel base instincts will take you far in the early game. Game runs very smoothly for an early access title with nice animations for your actions and the different zombies you'll encounter. Melee combat is a bit wonky yet, but serviceable. Hopefully the devs will improve that over time.

Yes, it's another zombie game, but with a twist that really takes a fresh look at the genre. Easy to jump in and start playing. It's rather a bit harder, however, to know when to stop. Recommended!

I've been playing Rust, Metal Gear Survive, The Forest and other survival games recently, this game is very unique to those. The survival side of the game is excellent, the game balances crafting, pvp, and pve very well and unlike any other game I've played. The setting and theme is very engaging and a breath of fresh air from other sandbox/survival games. The gameplay is very good which is suprising for a survival game with pvp, the shooting mechanics are somewhat like MGS:Survive but with a more realistic feel and a little more weight to the firearms. I really enjoyed the recent updates which added the ability to create a character and craft armor I started playing a couple days ago so jumping in was a lot to take in. A lot of items, weapons, buildings can be crafted but the amount of resources required to build is reasonable and not tedious. I liked that this game also has rpg elements you level up after fighting, looting and can allocate skill points to whichever traits you'd prefer. Rare items can also drop from enemies or can be found in buildings but you'll likely have to fight some zombies to get to them! 

A couple things I didn't like about the game or I think should be improved, the game seems to be missing a matchmaking system most games I've played like this tend to have this I feel it should be implemented alongside dedicated servers. I wish the game would be a little more forgiving when it comes to base defense. The standard difficulty should have more base/building hp and trap damage. A better balance of difficulty level could lead to better matches and less people quitting after the fifth day. 

This game does require a fair amount of processing power. I'd recommend at least a i7 9th gen intel cpu, nvidia gtx 1080 or rtx 2070, and 20 gb of ram.

For a while I wanted to love this sooo bad... had / have been looking for something with great graphics, good crafting, lots of zombies, where the survival mechanics are a little lighter, and weapons are relatively easy to find.   Oh and a little PvP.  Doesn't seem like a tall order but for some reason most of the zombie survival games I play usually have a couple of those elements... but not all.  As an older gamer I don't have a ton of time to play and so while I LOVE Scum and DayZ, the time it takes to get kitted up and go merc out Zeds is a little steep for me (just my current preference.  I'd been in and out of this game, but had always encountered this weird bug on Dedicated servers where the textures would ""shadow / checkerboard"" on some building exteriors and interiors.  It just really broke the immersion for me.    

Since this latest update (A.1.2.0) , that bug is seemingly gone for me.   Now that it's gone, I've been able to spend more time exploring the world and mechanics.   This game is a lot of fun.  There's definitely tense moments as you would hope, but the combat (especially mele) is way smoother than the majority of survival zombie games I've played.  Base building isn't too grindy and there is LOTS of customization.  I think the graphics are great, and the world feels well thought out and authentic (from the small amount that I've seen).  I would love to get in with some friends and survive together.  

Thanks for fixing that bug!  (oh and the doors too lol)

I would recommend to anyone who likes 7 Days To Die but preferred more realistic graphics.  And anyone looking for a zombie survival game that's easier to pick up and play.

Those covid's years it was hard to find a good game. Between conan exile, 7dtd , scum who are the best for me i finally end up in night of the dead and i do find it really cool ! 

I did read some peoples who saying that scum is better than night of the dead. Well .. off course as an open world survival scum is way better in all point. BUT night of the dead is not a survival it's a tower defense. 
You don't look for food or water ( basicaly food are more like healing potion or bandaid ) but you can really enjoy the full map to find a lot of ressources and get your base done till the night.  This game is very very pve  as each night you will be attacked .  I play with 1 or 2 friends and it's really fun ! 

It's important to note also, that EVEN official server are great to play ! this means you don't have to pay for a server to avoid cheater and annoying peoples.  
Another thing that i like, is that you can build where you want. This means , even in a full city build by the dev, you can add foundation and whatever you want to building.   Z will not be able to break walls of the existing city prefab  ( but can still hit just behind the wall aoe attack ) but they do break prefab doors ! 

Once you get confident enough to build your own base in a large empty spot its very fun . 
The leveling system is also quite nice and the game design "" armor "" is really cool ! 

I did bough this game with a sale at 15 euros. And i don't regreat it , totally worth it. i bough a lot of shit game much expensive recently ... black and white , mount and bannelord ( i dont know how it get so much love on steam review honestly ) mortal online 2  etc.... to give you an exemple i did buy ark and find it totally ugly after playing conan and scum  but night of the dead is really pleasing . 
i think its important to give you my opinion on game , as maybe you are like me :p

so if you are like me bored of shit alpha game , try this one, it's a nice stuff, mostly if you play with 1 or 2 friends !

You can't actually jump over things, but mantel over them and it is incredibly slow. Don't dare fall 5 feet down a hill, you will likely die. You can outrun a bear?!? but not a zombie. Good concepts. Friends enjoyed the building aspects, but the rest of the game at this point is really, really bad, just bad. I tried to like it, but.

Ranged combat was almost passable. Almost. The rifle has to be ""aimed"" and can not be hip fired?!?!? Melee combat is horrid. The mobs don't have collision, they run right through you and hit you in the back before you can turn around. The javelin actually plays quite nice, but only as ranged...you can't stab things with it. The animation for ""opening"" loot is using a knife....even when you have a better tool equipped...IN YOUR HANDS..like a crowbar.

So many bugs. Yeah, I get it, it's ""early access"". That should not mean virtually unplayable. Get the bugs worked out of the base game, get that out as early access and improve from there. Honestly makes me sad because I'm sure that if they are ever fleshed out this could be a decent game.

Likes:

-I like the zombie character designs, there are several different ones that have different fighting skills which is fun
-The cities and towns are FULL of cars and boxes and things that can be looted but it has a lot of the same content in each lootable item
-Animal traps are nice and are very unforgiving as to where they are placed.

Dislikes:

-I have recently started crashing a lot, even when joining other servers and my own, not sure why
-Pet peeve, skinning sound is awful, please change
-I wish all buildings were available to be looted but some buildings are just closed off prefabs
-Crafting does need some work, some recipes don't make sense (to me) but it is fast so that's a plus
-Movement and animations need work along with switching from weapons to tools in the belt

I saw review on here that said it blew 7 Days to Die out of the water which I don't agree with. 7 Days has always been my go to survival crafting horde game ever since it came out and it has a lot more flexibility as to where you can build and what you can demolish. Of course in it's infancy 7 Days had bugs and still does to this day but Night of the Dead has a lot of potential though and I do look forward to updates in the future!

This is a fun co-op zombie/survival game. The main downsides are that it's a set map (no random world generation, though it's a big map with many different starting points) and the actual ""game"" -- following the quests to escape the island -- is pretty lame and anti-climactic (""you win, game over, lol""). That said, you can just ignore the quests and play it as an endless survival game, which is my recommendation.

It's really more of a ""tower defense"" game than a true survival game, though. Whereas 7 Days to Die puts zombie killing mainly in your own hands, Night of the Dead is much more about building traps to kill the zombies with. 7d2d also has a high emphasis on looting and questing whereas NotD is more about quickly farming the resources you need to expand your traps with. The hordes are much larger (in every sense of the word) and far more frequent, so creating these traps is really how you make it through the nights.

Honestly 7d2d is a better game all around in terms of replayability and total content but I still give this a thumbs up. It is its own game with its own distinct playstyle so I think you'll enjoy it if you like the genre, and won't find it to be overly derivative.",1640299021,1640299021,True,50,3,0.798988223075866699,1,True,False,True

Having hundreds of hours into titles like 7 Days to Die, which is probably it's nearest competitor, this brings a different flavor with an emphasis on zombie mutilation by trap death and what we've coined as the zombie trapsticle course. The game caught us a bit off guard too, as for the first few nights, zombies generally come from the direction of the city center. As we fortified that position, next thing we know hordes came from both front and rear and we were not ready. We've had many mishaps with fire, because yes, wood burns and we've accidentally burned a number of structures with misplaced flamethrowers. The environment, e.g. city and surrounding areas are much more immersive than other genre titles I've come across. The buildings and freeways have a much greater attention to detail than I expected from an alpha, indie title.

Cons:
- Lack of first person (this can make building a chore and combat gets a little screwy at times with you and zombies running circles around each other to land a blow)
- Lack of common weapons such as pistols, bolt action hunting rifles and shotguns (there are machine guns)
- Lack of weapon mods like silencers and scopes, flaming arrows, etc.
- Resource balance still needs some tweaking but it's not far off

Pros:
- Exquisite zombie kills with sliced limbs and heads that fly off and ricochet off walls
- The shrieks of zombies as they die is pretty hysterical
- Immersion
- Traps
- Has a quest line
- Zombie kills by trap. When you're watching the horde come in and a trebuchet boulder comes flying by turning the zombies to bloody paste and debris flies everywhere. That's a great touch

Things I'd like to see beyond the list of cons:
- Fire traps, like flames coming out of a floor or wall
- Enhanced research tree, such as increasing the number of items found while scavenging or resource gathering like mining
- Medical supplies, while eating grants that, being able to apply bandages in lieu of food to just restore health when strength and stamina are already maxed or in order to heal a comrade. Instead of insta-death, maybe a 10-20 second window to heal a friend in multi-player
- Customizable variables for multi-player, e.g. monster difficulty, resource availability, number of animals, zombie damage, player damage, structural hitpoints, etc.
- Sign or labeling system to organize resources. Keeping track of all the resources right now is a bit nuts
- Separate weapon lockers
- Ability to disassemble un-needed weapons in order to reclaims parts for use in mods or other construction. After a while, you're just leaving stuff lying around
- Small population enclaves to trade with

First of all, zombies has infinite ammo -- a butcher can throw infinite cleavers and the siege zombie can throw infinite logs - not to mention, they have a gazzilion health making them hard hitting and hard to kill = broken. The research perks the player receive give lackluster stat boost that are negligible. The zombie health increase and the arrow damage increase, for example, are disproportionate which makes the research perks worthless. So with limited ammo, you can ran out just by trying to take down one big zombie -- and there's always more than one.

Second, resource nodes give bullshit amount of resources -- taking down a whole tree only gives 1 branch? WTF is that?. Iron is needed in many recipe but the node gives shitty amount and there's very few of them. The first issue (ammo) probably won't be a problem if I get more resources from nodes.

Last, this is not a tower defense game like what the video shows -- the zombies are attacking the foundation of your base instead of trying to go through the traps. Destroying the foundation destroys the trap on it, making all your setup useless. Not to mention, their bare claws can rip through steel beams (fully upgraded foundation) which makes no sense. It means the upgrade only gives health, not damage resistance. Sure the upgrade gives fire and explosion resistance, but why are they not resistant against tooth and nail?

I don't mind if the zombie gets infinite ammo as long as my bow and my traps gets infinite ammo and I get infinite molotov. As it stands, the game is not fun since the player is designed to fail since traps need ammo and some stops functioning until reloaded. Early turrets like the ballista is too weak. The projectile should go through multiple targets instead of just hitting one and it should more damage and should have infinite ammo.

Oh well, I'm glad I bought it when on sale because the video and the screenshots shown is not what's in the game.",1636135090,1636135090,False,7,3,0.474264711141586304,0,True,False,True

Hunting is great, the devs have done a great job with what they have chosen to use, asset wise, and the combat mechanics are excellent. No pistols though. Multiple assault rifles, but no one in this dead world ever owned a pistol?

This game needs configuration options. It's great to a point, and utterly miserable past it.

Let me explain. 

Once you've played it a few times, you work out where the items are that you need in order to get off the island (one static map, every game). You spend a few days (in game collecting said items. Then it's a matter of bolstering your base tower defences to ensure you can survive long enough to take aforementioned items to the exit point to get the fuck out of Dodge. 

Don't stick around too long or you'll find yourself in a horror loop of trying to mine materials to bolster your defences against an ever growing number of enemies of ramping difficulty, growing in wave after wave every night and that chase you through the day if you don't kill them. This is where the miserable kicks in.  

The four man team I play with collect all of the exit items in the first one to two days and then sit tight and see how long we last. Eleven days is the magic number, after that it becomes an incomprehensible grind, with exponential enemy numbers at ramping skill levels being thrown at you every night. The inevitable daily mining of resources to restock and build new traps (which takes the best part of everyone's day) makes it all a bit Amazon Fulfilment spec past this point. I have a job that feels like I'm breaking rocks all day. Not sure I feel like doing it in my off hours,

When we see our third big green zombie, it's time to leave - that's the cue that it's all downhill from there. We head out to the exit point and GTFO, effectively ending what could be a long term tower defence situation if the waves of zombies were more balanced and customisable. They're not, and you simply get overrrun, with more and more certainty every evening. 

Good game at its core, shame the Devs have resisted public calls to review the options, so still it stands with ramping waves and no customisation. Me and my buddies all agree we'd play more if it gave us the options to allow a more custom experience.

Unfortunately, I've run out of patience with the game as it stands. Last time I played in anger was in April 2021 and looking at the update log, I see no reason to reinstall, nor to recommend it at the price point.

TLDR: fun for a few hours. After you realise  the sad fact that it could have been a great game if you could just adjust some options around wave difficulty and timing, you'll go back to many of the truly great games available on Steam. Or other game providers that are available. 

I had some fun with this game, but it offers no replayability for the price asked. This is a sad buyers remorse entry in my Steam library.",1633527536,1635780366,False,2,0,0.524419546127319336,0,True,False,True

First thing allot of people might want answered right now, THIS IS NOTHING LIKE 7 days to die. this is like a minigame compared to 7 days to die.

Bugs:
1. The biggest one i have encountered is tree and rocks and anything that is farmable disappearing after 1 hit.
started a new game 3 times all with the same effect. cant play the game if i cant farm anything.
2. the amount of ""leaves"" you need in this game is just ridiculous, having over 200 logs but i cant do much with it because i need 20 leaves for every part of the building i have to place.
3. when you try to farm or run or aim or dodge it takes stamina, when your stamina runs out it starts draining your health.... if you dont pay attention because your running from a horde of zombies you will just kill yourself....
4. Tried dedicated server hoping i could setup some config the remove some of the frustrating things, turns out there are only 6 things you can adjust even on server side.
5. motion in the game isnt fluid or done right,
6. can place traps for animals but nothing is marked on map so you have to keep finding them yourself.

Try to do all of the above before the next wave spawns and its just repeat from there....
TIP: if you do play dont bother with the game starting quests or tips, they tell you to craft something because it actually tells you that you need a workbench to craft it.

It's not hard to learn to cheese the zombie ai and live through the night but that's not fun.  If the developers take the time to fix the bugs, polish the game, and fix the difficulty I will be back but as the game sits right now its not fun having to play for days to get built enough to play the game right and in the meantime choosing between cheesing the game (Boring) or dying over and over again (frustrating).  Also a note to all developers mechanics that punish you repeatedly for dying by making it easier to die next time will make people walk away from your game. I agree with punishment for getting killed but when you make it so after getting killed by 20 or 30 zombies a few times I now get killed in one hit its pointless to continue so the only option left is to run around all night until they stop spawning or sit dead not playing until the night is over. both of those options are not playing the game and not fun.",1635619607,1635619607,False,3,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,True

It isn't something people should spend money on yet.  We shouldn't pay people to beta test their super broken, totally unfinished stuff all the time.  This should still be alpha. 
 Beta testing shouldn't be about getting people to pay you so you can finish the game.  You should have the capitol before you start the endeavor.  
I saw one person recommended the game but it said that he had the PRODUCT REFUNDED???  LOL Why are people recommending this?  It's rude to recommend this game to people.  It's unethical.
People who are recommending this game DO NOT even play it as there's no multiplayer; no one is playing on any of the tens of official servers. So why are they recommending the game if they're not even freakin playing the game??  No one is playing the multiplayer anyway.  Maybe all of the fan boys recommending this super unfinished, janky UI, super unbalanced, survival game where you don't hunger or have thirst game in single player mode.  They like playing super broken games in single player apparently because there has got to be a reason that they're recommending the game but NO ONE, not even one person besides me for the 40 minutes that I played was on ANY of the official servers...  what are they recommending?

I wanted to like this game...  I would play the game if I wanted to play a single player survival game but I don't like doing that... I want to play pvpve survival.  If there were other people playing on the servers it'd be something I'd ""beta test"" but as it is life is short and I'm not wanting to spend my time being some strangers' beta test monkey.  There are a lot of finished games out there to play instead.
If you want to pay strangers to be their beta test monkey but never having a functional and fun experience this game is great for you.
Otherwise, with no multiplayer and inconsistent UI functionality (switching weapons/tools is inconsistent) with harvesting functionality and balance totally janky right now you're not going to have fun.  I saw one zombie stuck in a building for the 40 minutes that I played.  Otherwise I was just running around wondering why the UI was janky as I gathered a ton of mushrooms which had no real purpose because as far as I could tell I had no thirst or hunger requirement to meet in my survival game, got iron ingots from destroying 50 gallon barrels with my knife... yeah that's a thing and I could haul massive quantities of logs and stone... had to be at least a ton or more sometimes that I was holding and sprinting around with...

Having come from 7 Days to Die still playing at least 4 hours a week) I figured this game would not be too much different. And in a lot of ways, it isn't. Except  that fact that the Horde comes EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. We're talking 40+ zombies on screen at any given one moment between midnight and 4 A.M.

In my honest opinion, this game is not meant to be played solo. You are going to need a team of at least 3 to be ANY kind of efficient. A full day cycle is about 2 hours RT, so the wave of undead lasts about 20 minutes. Even dialing down the zombie health, damage and wave percentages, it is still extremely easy to get overwhelmed.

There are a few glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking. One zombie in particular(legless crawler), tends to drift across the floor. The zombies pathfinding seems to be a tad bit janky, as they ignored the stair i placed to lead them to my traps, they decided instead to start attacking the foundations instead of taking the ""easiest"" path to me.

I can't give it a middle review, so giving it a bad review. The game is fine on normal but if you try to customize anything the zombies are nearly invincible and destroy traps on first wave within the first 20 seconds. Had 4 traps in total they had to route through, they just took out one foundation after another completely ignoring steps destroying trap after trap without ever going on the platforms. Getting really frustrated.

Tried single player on normal. Day 7 gigantic seige guys show up and absolutely demolish base. Dumping bullets in them like I'm rambo and they just ignore me and keep destroying. Managed to take out one platform and without a path to the base they just hit any foundation under me and completely destroy the base in a matter of seconds. 

As a caveat, apparently placing a door and shutting it has the very same effect. 

There is no way to guide the mobs through traps, then the mobs will demolish your base. Once a single block between them and you is broken you might as well delete the save and probably the game at that point as you'll have to start over. Your other option is respawn and get killed over and over again trying to fight off the horde.

When you die, you lose learned skills, you also lose overall health/stamina. So it's not like you can respawn and eventually fight them off recovering what materials you can from the destroyed portions of your structure. 

Waves come every single night, so unlike 7 days to die there is no real time to prep for anything. You're literally hustling from the moment you spawn till the moment you die, probably about night 7 when guys who can chunk what can only be described as ""half a tree"" at your base. But, unlike you, for them to get their log back all they have to do is be alive, and they can throw a new log about once every second. Meanwhile you may have wandered upon a rifle inside of a building packed behind 40 zombies and you somehow managed to fight your way through the building with limited food, in which case, throw it in the trash, it's not REALLY going to help. Because you'll use up 3-5 entire mags of ammunition before you take one down, if you're lucky. 

Weapons: 
The only 1 handed weapon that I've found to be fast enough for combat is the dagger you start with, or the pipe. The one handed axe is extra slow. 

For two handed weapons the polearm is pretty nice early on if you've got some space and you're fighting 3+ zombies. Just know that it makes you REALLY slow. In fact, anything you're holding other than the knife or pipe slows you down so much that you can barely move. Baseball bat with spikes is meh. The spear is better for confined space or if you can line up a bunch of zombies you can slice straight ahead and through them, but it makes you just as slow as the polearm and does less dmg. 

I found the RU-Rifle, as mentioned it doesn't do much dmg. In addition to not doing much dmg, you can't hip fire. Yep, that's right it's impossible to fire without ADS. Zombie in your face? Make sure you aim even though it would be literally implausible to miss at the range. ADS makes you move slow. Zombies are not slow ergo you die.

Movement: 
Speaking of movement. The amount of effort that went into making you move like you're in your late 80's if you put anything in your hand is truly amazing to me. So you're trying to tell me that I can have 4 rifles, 80 ingots of metal, 60 ingots of copper, a spear, a polearm, a pipe, a knife, a riot shield, and a round shield, 150 logs, 180 branches, 200 vines, and 4 boxes of ammo in my pocket, but if I mess around and put my shield in my hand my legs stop working?

Enemies:
Well I already mentioned siege brutes. 

Normal Zombies: +1 knife takes 4-6 hits, don't have a lot of fancy moves generally. Some charge you and hit several times. Some just swing occasionally. Relatively easy opponent. 

Exploding Zombies: So there's zombies with a green spot on their chest, if they're about to die (and you don't hit them) they will explode. They can also shoot green stuff. Those are night 2-3 Crawlers with orange pustules. These explode when killed regardless. They will catch your base on fire. You'll want to be on stone structure before this happens. Night 3-4?

OP Melee Zombies: First you have alien looking dudes? Not really sure how to describe them. Slick skin, no clothes, appear to be a mutation of some sort. Then larger fellows with cleavers. They have crazy HPs for melee combat. Easily take you 30-40 hits to kill them. Then you have big brute looking guys that have a hand axe in one hand, and a spear with chain on the other? They of course have crazy HPs, and they can shoot a chain at you like scorpion from mortal combat and yank you to them. Again easily 30-40 hits to kill.

Noise maker: There's a zombie that's mounted on a cross like it got crucified. It doesn't attack, it just yells in your vicinity. The yelling appears to have no purpose as it doesn't attract other zombies (which is what I expected to happen). When you try to hit them they run away. You can miss them...a lot. 

Conclusion:
This game wants to be good, it just doesn't know how. The nightly waves are treated like a tower defense, but if you shut your front door or 1 block on your endless trail of foundations gets broken then it's just a horde of zombies destroying 2 days of work. 

Perhaps give an option to setup how often to produce waves. Every night is too often. I only see an option to turn off the waves or not, but not change how often you get a wave. 

Make the zombies recognize doors as an entry point. What the heck is the point of a door if you can't close it?

Siege guys are too much all at once. Make them...less? I'd like to know where they're getting all those trees. But hey I guess if I can carry 150-200 logs then so can they right? Perhaps give them less HPs or something. If this is ""normal"" then I might as well just delete the game because it's clearly not my thing.",1632007178,1632150878,False,2,1,0.495312511920928955,0,True,False,True

The biggest thing we missed was a client for the Dedicated server, loved the one Conan Exiles has. 

Just missed a few things; 
-Research Passive HP regen
-Sniper rifle, and the two gunners were similar in stats & handling
-Some melee weapons were to ""OP"" so that a few quicly became obsolete, and missed that they had crushing, bleed & pierce dmg
-Some towers was so much better than others that one did not bother to vary the traps
-Giants came a bit early, day 15 would be ok.
-Some traps and the engine consume ammo and fuel way to fast
-And an option to continue playing after one has won the game would be nice.

-The item description was close to non excitant, f.example the logic gates one had to figure out the hard way how they worked, and chain coupling batteries did not work.
-There was no info around weather or not if the mortar and the catapul did structural dmg to our base and traps...

-Knowing how much power was consumed and how much headrom one has would be nice to know, both standy and during ""full system load""

-The most used resources were copper and plastic (most commonly those we lacked)

-After a recent update, some zombies stops pathing to the player and starts trashing the maze (traps & base), had to reaggro those bastards.

-The building is a bit swing and a miss, not all the snaping are logic, and there is alot of indestructable objects and buildings that limit alot of intricate building options, one almost needs a big open space to be able to build a full fledged ""working"" maze. Would be nice if one could just overlap or build into existing objects!",1631894344,1631967943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Closest existing game is going to be 7 Days to Die; except this is more about resource scavenging only in the day, and then tower defense at night.

Many zambies. Oh dear so many. Swoosh. Squish. Slicey slicey whirl. Climb from bridge to bridge and reload, they go plonk below. Headshot. Reload. OH FUCK IT JUMPED ON MY ROOF. Frantic punchies! Oh shit trap stopped punching - RUN AND RELOAD IT!

Let's start by saying that is the basis of the game. There isn't currently  'proper' house/base building (I can't make a roof!), although that may change. The objective is strategic trap placing, as on normal settings there are nightly waves of hordes, and while exploring you'll encounter difficult mutant mobs.

Difficulty increases rather steadily, with more mutations of enemies appearing the longer you last. It's ʳᵉᵃˡ grindy at first, as resource demand for upgrades is quite high. Crafting is a bit convoluted, with several tables, stacked menus and parts that are needed for some of the more intricate recipes. Screw annoying weapon and armor upgrades.

Fire sucks. It really really sucks. Don't make any flamethrowers until you have a freaking bunker or it's a half mile away. On that note, within a week explosive fire zambies appear. You better have a non-wood exterior and foundation.

Travel sucks. But they've promised vehicles late 2021.

Why does a whole freaking tree drop 3 leaves and recipes call for 40-60?

But... the zombies go splonk.

Whatever, I like it. They're doing regular updates. It may be worth waiting if you're on the fence, however. Check out their dev roadmap. If you want to play with friends but aren't as heavy on base building, there's quite a lot of customization when it comes to difficulty, nightly waves, enemy health, damage, spawn rate, etc.",1607471295,1630067404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Zu beginn das Spiel ist ohne Vorkenntnisse etwas herausfordernd da die erste Nacht und die ersten 10 Tage einem Ablauf zufolgen hat. (Explodierende und brennende Zeds) Die einem das Leben schwer machen. Daher muss man seine Gebäudeteile schnellstens Aufwerten auf Beton und dann auch zu Stahl. Befolgt man dies hat man von beginn weg mehr Luft und kann es einen Gang ruhiger Spielen. 

Nun heißt es Farmen um seine Base zu Erweitern mit Fokus auf Fallen und nicht wie in vielen anderen Spielen zu erst eine Unterkunft zu Bauen denn dieses braucht Zeit und Ressourcen die viel besser in Fallen Investiert werden können. Es gibt verschiedene Strategien auf diese ich hier nun nicht genauer eingehen möchte da es viel bessere Quellen im Netz zu finden gibt als ich es Beschreiben könnte.

Die Grafik ist etwas Realistischer als zb. bei 7Days to Die und da hier angeblich nur 2 Entwickler Beteiligt sind muss, nein möchte ich sagen meinen Respekt an die Entwickler.
Der Ressourcen verbrauch meines PCs ist etwas hoch auf Standard Einstellungen ABER zum Vergleich wie flüssig die Wellen laufen und die vielen Zombies die kommen ist es Verständlich. Der Vergleich wieder mit 7Days To Die das dieselbe Engine hat relativiert den hohen Verbrauch zu Gunsten von Night of the Dead auf einem sehr hohen Level. Auch hier sieht man sehr gut das die Entwickler etwas mehr von ihrer Arbeit Verstehen als einfach (nur) zu Programmieren.

The traps are awesome and there is a good selection of basic weapons that can be upgraded.

*AI pathing is completely broken. All that time and resources you've spent on building your mega base? Yea, that was a waste of time because the idiots can't figure out how to even get into your base - so they just mill about outside of it and beat on random things. 

*Melee and ranged combat sucks. There's no hip fire with rifles or the crossbow. You have to ADS to use them. I can see the bow being like that, but not rifles and the crossbow. Melee combat feels clunky and unrewarding. Each weapon has its own set of attacks that you can't change unless you pause attacking and let the combo ""reset"". Many times your attacks simply pass right through the zombies and do nothing. Completely unrewarding. There's no block or dodge option also. 

*Clipping is broken. Zombies can attack you and your base through your walls. They can even clip through them sometimes and get into areas inside your base they shouldn't be able to.  Nothing like spending all that time and resources on your mega base to have the stupid crawlers that explode clip through your walls and run free inside it. Great job.

Furthermore, the game has no direction that I can tell. Is it a tower defense game, or is the objective to escape the island as quickly as you can? Right now it's both - and neither. 

Content is limited currently. Since this is an early access game I'm willing to give this a pass. That being said, since there's NO communication from the developers about the direction of the game and what content they are working on it makes me less willing to give them a pass on this since I have no idea what they are working on. As I understand it, there's only two people working on the game. I suspect that's why there's little to no communication - but it doesn't allow me to forgive it. Developers, if you want to cultivate a loyal playerbase you have to communicate with them. Right now this game feels like a project you would work on in college - not a product that people are paying money for.

I can't recommend this game in the state it is in. Definitely not at the current price it is asking for. I have had some fun playing it up to this point, but the current state the game is in makes me unable to give it a thumbs up. If the developers get their shit together and get this game on track I would certainly consider revising my opinion.

Edit 1 Jan 21: The developers have released a roadmap for 2021-2022. Nice to see this, but it still doesn't clear up the direction of the game. Will evaluate again later.

Edit 2 29 Jan 21: A major content release occurred last week.  An expanded skills tree was added which is cool - but once you upgrade the skills to the max it makes you feel like you were before the update. So was this an ""update"" or merely a research paper sink?  It feels like the latter. To be fair, there were some other skills added that are cool and much needed (reduced fall damage), but my character still can't jump over a fence with maxed jump??

The new weapons are neat, but they really don't add anything new with the exception of the shields. You can block with them and it works fairly well. The polearm is powerful, but it's too easy to have zombies inside the swing radius of the weapon. That's fair I suppose, but without any visual indicator of the weapon's range you're mostly swinging at air. The brass knuckles are about the same as the starting knife - so what's the point of the knuckles? They don't add anything new (and you still can't take the starting knife out of your inventory). 

Building is still a complete mess, zombies still clip through your buildings, zombie pathing and AI is still a mess. For me, these are the core features for this game - building and pathing. They don't work very well right now, and that makes the game unfun. There's also typos in the in-game descriptions of some items. Really guys? There's also no documentation for the game to explain mechanics and whatnot. I couldn't figure out how to make the Power Saw (one if the new items added). Seriously? Optimization is still very lacking. Framerates are very low, even with PC's that should be able to run this game. 

I would consider this a ""step in the right direction"", but until the ""core"" gameplay features are up to par (building and AI / pathing) I still cannot recommend the game. Let's see how things progress.

Edit 3 9 Aug 2021: Another major content release has dropped. I think the electrical system *could* have potential in the future, but right now it's pretty much a mess. 

Yes, there's user made content that explains the workings of it, but should I have to rely on another player to understand core mechanics of the game? In my opinion, no. This is something that the development team needs to work on - documentation for the game. Right now, there really isn't much aside from the ""tutorials"" at the beginning of the game - and those don't help much. 

Mobs still clip through solid objects (like your maze for example). AI pathing is still freaking terrible, which usually negates the effort you have put into building your base because it doesn't work like how you planned it. 

The build system snapping has improved. I noticed placement for many of the modules was much easier than before. Placement of foundations on the ground still needs work though. So does item orientation and build perspective based on a 3rd person perspective. 

The models for the new electrical system modules are for the most part well done. The mortar and the CIWS type guns in particular look mean. They sound pretty good too. 

There's even someone watching the Steam forums for JackTo now. You may be able to get an official response there in a somewhat timely manner now, so that's an improvement too. 

The dev team has put out a roadmap and thus far seem to be sticking to it. So, I owe them some credit there. 

Overall, this content release is definitely a step in the right direction. That said, there are still so many QOL issues with the game that makes it feel like a chore to play sometimes. Framerate optimization and AI are two huge items that need immediate help. Clear, concise documentation is another. 

The game is still in alpha, so these items being in the state they are is forgivable - for the moment. I'm still not going to recommend buying the game at full price in this state though. However, if you (yes you the person reading this review) are willing to accept these limitations then go ahead and buy it. The game can be fun to play! For me, it's hard to overlook the QOL issues even if the game is alpha. Perhaps I am being overly critical of the game given where it is in the development cycle. That's a fair point I suppose. Then again, this is my personal opinion so your mileage may vary. I'm not going to tell people to buy it, but I won't actively discourage them from it either. 

I will continue to reevaluate my opinion on the game as it develops over time. I'd love to give it a thumbs up - but that's up to the development team. Change my mind guys! I'm hoping you do.",1606697100,1628550683,False,113,30,0.60996854305267334,2,True,False,True

I mean, if it is possible to optimize or cut some unnecessary graphic out?

So I played this game when it first came out and I really liked it.  It had a good foundation to build upon.  Yes it was a bit buggy in spots.  I finished the story then set the game aside for a while.  

I have now returned to the game after the big Electric Update (Dev #5).  
I have to say I am blown away by what was added and changed in this game for the good.  

The use of electricity adds a whole new element to how you can build your defenses.  It also adds more of a game play loop to the game.  Some my call it it grindy as you are looking for resources to upgrade your electric stuff now.  However last time I played I got board because I found that there was not enough to do.  So for me this adds a lot more ""to do""

I do really like the ""Open World Survival Craft"" element for this game.  I think it works very well by day you go out and hunt salvage what you need to build up your ""Tower Defense"".   It becomes a neat balance of ""oh it is 18:00 and I still need to build XYZ but I still need ABC resource should I stay out and look for them or head back and build what I can and hope it will be good enough.""

As I said IF you where buying this as a ""Open World Survival Craft"" you might be upset as every night you will be attacked by a hoard of Zombies.  This is where the ""Tower Defense"" comes in.  (Me I like Tower Defense games) If you try to fight off the hoard without defenses it won't go so well.  You need to build them up.  

The other thing to note is when you first start out the zombies out there in the wild are tough and hard to kill on Normal and up.
This is because you are weak and not skilled yet.  later on you will be able to upgrade your weapons, your skills and zombies will become easier to dispatch.  So when you first pop in it is best to avoid them.   Find a nice spot to set up and start doing your ""Survivor Note"" stuff to get the rewards.  Build up a base and get ready Night comes fast on the 0day.  
[spoiler] When you get your Research Table built.  Take Engineering Graduate > Engineer.    That way you can build your Trap Machines they are needed for every trap you build.  [/spoiler]

Overall I really like Night of the Dead I think it has a really good blend of Tower Defense and Open World Survival Craft.  I can't wait to see what will be coming out next.

I would recommend this game to anybody who likes building up bases and testing their wits with setting up traps in the right places.

At its core this is a great tower defense game where you defend yourself with your base every night. What you absolutely need to know day one is that zombies need to hit as many traps as possible for your base to be effective. Building up walls with a door just isn't going to cut it. The learning curve is pretty high, but sufficiently challenging once you know the ropes.

The Pros:
-constant need to upgrade and expand keeps you always on your toes
-zombies are not pushovers and can actually kill you. several different zombie types with different zombie behaviors
-lot of traps to choose from, meaning a good variety of base ideas can be had
-pretty big variety of buildings

The cons:
-the ground in the environment cannot be altered which occasionally makes base building a pain
-zombies don't focus on breaking down walls unless there is a gate, so the pathing can be easilly exploited
-a lot of buildings have horrible indoor textures, not even finished
-zombies don't despawn on day z, so if you die and cant reach your stuff you are kinda screwed",1626627570,1627510807,True,2,0,0.543379008769989014,0,True,False,True

You can turn one enemy into a walking pin-cushion, lose all branch and iron resources you've spent the entire day collecting trying to kill one enemy while your traps get smashed to bits and barely do any damage. I would think a ball of spikes swinging full force would take out at least a couple at a time but no, the zombies just stand there taking it like champs. 
Game has potential. It's a bit more than a challenge though. Not really any rewards for surviving a slaughter. 
Just give it a couple of years to allow the creators to make it more balanced and more playable.

***Edit - 
I just saw yesterday that there was an update where the night horde was nerf'd. It helps. Started a new game and made sure resource regen was turned on. Don't know if it works for the Iron rocks, but testing to see how well it works with trees and bushes. Both these resources continue to be the biggest set back, but with not turning every single zombie that doesn't hit a trap or survives the trap 5x into a pincushion with arrows and javelins, you're actually able to conserve some of the harvesting/foresting/mining you've done.

But the building system is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The player characters ability move, jump and climb makes it a pleasure to move about.

its an ok game but needs allot of work.

Pros:
 Building is good. 
Can host your own games with friends which is good.

Cons: 
-Setting up the electrics is just a ball ache. not very well explained anywhere!
-Zombies-Yes you can customise settings but your spend more time changing percentages and trying to get a happy medium then actually playing the game.
-Skills are reallying poor basicly rank them up doe'snt explain what gain or what it is.
-Craft Tables are just crazy you make like 5 different ones and then you spend 5 minutes trying to find the right on you want.

I can go on and on with cons. wait for it to be on sale.

The game is now even better than before!  New zombies, new weapons, new traps, electricity, first person mode, the ability to climb.  It is very quickly becoming the best zombie survival game ever made!
Ignore the negative reviews from people who clearly don't know what they are talking about...  You can completely customise the game to your liking, including how hard horde night is, so you cant complain that there are too many zombies, or they have too much health or the horde nights are too hard etc.  I personally play with zombie health down to 1% and damage reduced by 40%, but there are 80% more zombies on the map.  It leads to some serious horde gameplay where you can kill them easy but also got swarmed and torn apart.
And as for the negative review mentioning that you have to hit a structure for 20 mins with an axe because you cant delete buildings, if you actually followed the TUTORIAL steps you will find that the claw hammer can instantly remove any structure you have created, and you can even change in the settings how many materials you get back from removing structures...  Tutorials exist for a reason...
And for the review saying that hitboxes are wonky, no they are not at all...  If you want to chop a tree down you need to hit the tree with the blade of the axe and not the handle.  Same goes for the pickaxe.  Thats called realism.  The weapons and tools are physical objects that react the the environment.  Try to clear a building with a 2 handed sword and you will very quickly realise what I mean.  This promotes using different weapons for different situations, like a knife or gun for room clearing whilst you save the big swing weapons for outside in the open.
As for the item stacks being small, you can craft equipment pouches that increase the stack size of items that you can carry.

Just spent almost 4 hours straight playing co-op with a friend and had zero issues!  Game is very polished, runs very smooth and has a very large amount of content for the first iteration of early access.  The graphics are very good, character animation is excellent and the building side of the game is spot on.

There's single player and multi-player modes.  Try them all to see which you like.  Here's some ideas of how to play:

1) If you like to build then choose Single Player, Peaceful, and without zombie waves at night.  You'll only encounter them at random.  Single Player will allow you to build huge structures and as long as you want. 
Keep in mind, if you don't like zombies then you can choose animals only.  Building has so many possibilities as the world is a giant sandbox.  Lots of options for building, cooking, upgrading buildings, furniture, crafting weapons, upgrading bags, research for better buildings, etc.

2) If you like fighting zombies then choose your difficulty with caution.  They get more hitpoints and are more numerous the higher you go.  You'll need a way to take them out so building traps or at least create a hoarding area where you can shoot them yourself.  Just remember to have enough ammo stored to last the waves at midnight.

3) If you like Tower Defense then this game gives you lots of options in that area as well.  You'll want the zombie waves at night turned on so you can bring the zombies to you.  You'll also get random single zombies here and there throughout the day.  They're a good way to test your defenses before the big wave at midnight.  Just remember to have enough repair resources and ammo in case things go sideways. =)

4) Like hunting?  There are a wide variety of animals and birds you can hunt to help you upgrade your bags equipment, and weapons.  

5) Like exploring?  There's a large city with a wide variety of buildings, houses, and factories to explore.  Plus, there's mountains, forests, roads, and lakes to explore around the towns and cities.  Finding the journals would then be like a scavenger hunt.  Helps you play the game differently every time!  Fun! =)

Lastly, if you get bored with the mode you're in then you can further the story by finding journals.  There's clues to help you find them.  Plus, there's currently 53 achievements you can unlock.  Otherwise, you can ignore the story and just do what you want in the 5 above categories or all of the above!

Let's face it, every game is in beta, even the fully released 5+ year bangers we enjoy.  We wade through the motion blur, control schemes (dodge as alt :P ), and the WTF moments because it provides a challenge and we can live with the fact that its still in development.  

novice NOD tips:
- it defaults to 3rd person view, but you can change that with ""V""
- spatial audio in headphones may jumpscare you with your own steps, these zeds are sneaky and don't always alert you with their characteristic ""shuffle""
- run through the tutorial in a friendlier game to start, just to get you through what you need to build a substandard base at first.
-you'll need a claw hammer to recall structures


Pros so far: 

- Similar to 7 days to die, but horde every night, and take those 10 t-posing and multiply them by 20x.  Its a bit of a rush, and i definitely had those, WTF this is normal?? moments, but after running through the onscreen tutorial a few steps in, you get what you need to survive and focus on that.  

- There are alot of character models of zombos, and animals, and items / defenses , etc. Its an active dev in process roadmap

Cons:

 - Unlike 7days and the like, the scavenging is pretty limited to car / box / bin, and some enterable buildings.  

 - graphic  settings are a bit wacky, but quality of life improvements could fix that, i experienced the same with satisfactory on deployment, it hates drivers, and sometimes it just hates life

 
Good to see another pve with optional pvp Z survival, will keep playing...

I love 7d2d and thought this was going to be the bees knees.

I even gave it a few days after purchase to see if maybe acheivs were new, but yeah... I don't know, something feels off. 

Overall the game plays nicely, no complaints. I wish there was a skill tree but my gut has an odd feeling about this game that is stopping me from playing.

Edit - updating review as I tried replaying it. I really want to like it but I'm not sure. The tutorial seems out of pace, asking to build defenses for your base before you actually have a base. It forces you to build certain defenses even if you don't want them (looking at you push trap) and you build all of your crafting utilities before building a foundation. It seems like a game I would love but something just feels empty, missing about it. 

Achievement update as well, most of these are in the 20% now. I have now officially been one of the 22% of players who got to midnight on the first day.

The most important thing is finding a good base spot that is defensible long-term. I can recommend rooftops (big industrial ones, not the smallish suburban family homes).

It is also good if the spot you have chosen already has a wall around it (a wall that is part of the map, not built by you) with only a single entrance. That way you can keep the giant 3-headed boss zombies at a safe distance, away from the traps you build. They otherwise can wreck quite a lot of your structures before they die.

Then build a trap obstacle course inside the preexisting wall for the zombies to kill themselves. It sounds a bit strange at first but is really fun :D

The game also has an actual ending. I like that.

It is a race against time between you exploring the map and finding a certain number of hints and hidden items that help you escape and the zombie hordes getting stronger each day. After a certain number of days they are really hard to defeat even with good defenses. However if you use the time of relative quiet in between waves you can easily explore the map far enough to make it out and win the game before the hordes become undefeatable.

The game is overall fun, lots to offer and the devs seem to be continually improving. That being said there
are a few issues that need to be addressed that have caused me to shelf the game again till later.

1. The games needs a scaling option on wave days, e.g. the option to have waves every other day or
even further apart. Many including myself would like the option of a challenge but with a more laid back
option. Making the end of every day a zombie wave night is just to intense.
2. Waves need to be revisited. By day eight the number of mobs and high level npc's are through
the roof. This is too much too early and again demands intense game play. Example, I upgraded to a
lvl 9 grenade launcher and pelted the crowds with grenades doing 280 damage a pop and many of
these mobs took five direct grenades before they would finally die. Math? Nearly 50% of the mobs on
day 8 take 1,400 damage to die.

Conclusion - right now even on normal it scales so rapidly that everything feels like hardcore mode.
This can easily be balanced to the player through options as 7Days to die does.",1626638537,1626638537,True,112,1,0.895868599414825439,0,True,False,True

Its so pointlessly difficult that its unplayable. Chop trees and gather a bunch of items during day just to build up a little base that gets destroyed by 1000 zombies on the first night. Zombies are ridiculously hard to kill, they tear down your base quickly and the game is just super janky in general.

- Building does not always allow you to connect structures so you will have staircases and foundations floating in the air possibly making the base difficult or impossible to navigate, and you can not even just get rid of a structure by deleting it. If you need to destroy a floating wall, you have to chop away at it for 20 minutes with an ax. It takes 10 second to chop a tree in this game, but when you need to make a minor adjustment to your base it is impossible. 

- caveman style weapons don't leave you well equipped at all for onslaught of 1000 zombies on the first night. Throw a javelin a few times, shoot some arrows.....you will kill one by one until you run out of ammo. Even if you didn't run out of ammo, the zombies would tear down your base anyways because you're over here fighting with a spear like a caveman meanwhile these Uber- Dark-souls- tier- difficulty -zombies destroy everything you worked on during the day in like 2 minutes. 

I thought this looked and sounded really fun. I like tower defense games and I liked the idea of controlling a character in third person with the tower defense aspects, but it just does not work.

Conceptually, the game is fun, and the graphics do look pretty - there are some great scenic views as well. I would however suggest to the devs that more of the in game assets on the map need to be interactable (like being able to sit on chairs, and climb ladders), or destructible (let me clean up the yard of the folding chairs, and misc clutter). Having more trap options and more building items to craft would also be nice. I will say that I do like the building placement system though, as it allows you to do more than average cookie cutting.

My biggest complaint however, which is a rather large one about this game is the frequent crashing. It has gotten to a point that I can't play the game longer than 5 min or so. Despite lowering the graphics settings, and setting max fps to 60, this game still manages to take up all 32 gigs of my ram, and max out both the memory and power on my GPU and processor. Rebooting, restarting the game, lowering all settings on this game, verifying the integrity of the files - it doesn't matter, because it will still crash frequently without warning (normal game play is pretty smooth when the game isn't crashing).

If you're playing for the first time, BUILD TRAPS.
God, I spent the whole first night running around with the axe and hitting, having no idea what to do being followed by 50+ zombies and mowed them down hit by hit (took like 30 minutes).
2nd night build a few blades and made a path in my base and it was a LOT easier.
I believe the first 2-3 nights should have lower difficulty, especially if it's the first time playing. I was expecting something closer to 7 days to die, 16 zombies first horde. I couldn't have been more wrong.

My experience is that it is primarily a tower defense game with some survival-lite elements, crafting, and exploration tacked on. The experience feels far to 'arcade-like' with waves of zombies attacking you nightly presented UI warnings that make me feel like I'm playing rounds in an arcade game, not immersing myself in a zombie infested world gone wrong.

The world is beautiful and the crafting and building look interesting. It could offer an experience similar to 7D2D, but it falls far short and instead stumbles over itself with the tower defense angle. Where 7D2D does have a tower defense element, Night of the Dead focuses on it too heavily. The other elements that make 7D2D work so well, seem to get in the way of the tower defense aspect.

The other way the focus on tower defense works against itself is that the protagonist is supposed to be fleeing the island, but Night of the Dead has the player focusing on maintaining an elaborate and unrealistic trap complex to deal with the nightly waves of zombies that spawn out of nowhere. Additionally, the balance is currently far out of whack and needs manual adjustment in settings be playable with any chance at success.

If you're looking for something like 7D2D, for a change of pace, look elsewhere for now. Night of the Dead has a lot of potential to compete in that space, but right now I can't recommend it. The experience needs a lot more work and polish, however it could evolve into an incredible experience so don't write it completely off yet.",1625417536,1625417536,False,6,0,0.555548489093780518,0,True,False,True

Given the nature of this beast, you have to make yourself an Island like base.  I prefer to the north higher up.  This gives me a good range for a treb later.

As long as you spawn relatively close to the north side of the map (or in the north) and do your quests quick you should have a pendulum in no time.  A pendulum, walls, spinner traps, and a way to run out of your base and loop them back into it.... you're set.

Traps will take damage and it will get INTENSE, but you can do it!   It helps to have a few friends though :)

-Huge world, full of buildings along with items for customization of your character!
-Relatively easy to play once you learn the controls
-Interesting concept, story line.  I didn't finish the game but what I gathered it seemed cool.
-Huge amount of craftables, lots of traps.

Cons
-Really hard to run on my laptop, kinda fidgety when going through the world, but after bringing the graphics down I was able to play
-The zombies, their A.I is the strangest I've ever seen.  First they see you from a mile off, then after charging you and attacking, they run off to issue another yell/attack?  It's the most bizarre thing I've seen.
-The hit box: I don't know how many times I sat there and wiggled my played around just because I couldn't hit a tree.
-Building feel empty: I'm sure this will be fixed in later development but first I felt I was alone in the world(cool) then I felt like there was never people to live there to begin with(not cool).  This was what disappointed me the most.  I was so excited to explore the huge buildings but there are only boxes and the occasional loot safe.

I love the concept - scavenge for resources; build a base; protect base from a nightly horde of zombies. There's a problem with how things are currently implemented though, and this was my experiences playing for just under two hours...

I started on normal difficulty because you expect this difficulty to have some challenge but not completely demolish your hopes and dreams. Normal difficulty was anything but that, and I can't even begin to imagine what it's like playing on the higher difficulties. To keep this somewhat brief, each time you die you lose something like 20% of your total HP and stamina, which I believe can be recovered back to full with meds or food. I never got that far. Venturing out to find specific resources, I came across a lone zombie WHICH HITS HARD. Like, one hit takes away a third of your health, and since your distance to a target matters, whether that's felling trees or mining rocks, this also works for your weapons, and zombies aren't going to stand back and let you hit them at range - they're going to eat your face.

So the terrible knife you start with doesn't do much damage, and I die, dropping almost everything I had on my person on the ground in a convenient suitcase. Not so bad right? Right? I respawn thinking I'll just run back and collect my stuff and try to avoid zombies for a bit until I can get some better weapons. HA! Within seconds of respawning that same zombie had sprinted aaaaaall the way to my spawn point, which seemed... very odd. I didn't have time to react before I died again. I respawn and guess what... the zombie is already there since I died at my base/spawn point. I sprint off into the distance trying to ""get out of its range"" or whatever tf I thought would happen and I end up dying like a half a mile away. Respawn... aaand here comes the zombie AGAIN sprinting towards me. WTF. I JUST WANT TO HAVE SOME TIME TO BUILD A F****** BASE!

By the time I did eventually just stand there and be a meat-sponge for this zombie until I stabbed it to death, I had dropped down to maybe 10-20% HP and stamina remaining, and no idea how to get it back. And then night happened. The FIRST NIGHT. Cue the zombie horde. About 50 zombies swarm the three platforms I had built as a base. I managed to jump my way up onto the top of the bunker you start at, thinking that I'm safe and can just wait for the horde to leave. HA! If only that was a reasonable thing to expect - that zombies WOULDN'T have a freaking magnet radar attached to your person. 

So my base gets obliterated, because that's what the horde does when you can't be reached, and eventually one zombie manages to glitch his way up to where I was, and I die with my meager 20ish percent health because of course I do. And I respawn right in the middle of the horde because of course I do, so I sprint off in the distance hoping beyond all hope that they won't have the same type of magnet attachment to me that the single long zombie does. I die way off in the distance, respawn back at the starting location... do I even need to say it? You already know what happened next. Within seconds, that horde of 50ish zombies is seen sprinting towards me through the treeline.

I'm all for a challenging game. This game is not playable in its current form is this is how normal difficulty works. How are you supposed to do ANYTHING in this game once a zombie aggro's you? You literally can't do any PVE stuff to prepare for the inevitable because of zombies having an unrealistic radar to you no matter where you are on the map once they've aggro'd you even once. They just keep coming until you kill them all. And if you can't build a base of traps, how tf are you going to kill off the horde that has the same mechanic and radar to seek you out anywhere?

It's like an ocean with the depth of a single drop of water. The amount of time it takes to kill zombies if you don't reduce their health drastically, is monumentally dull and illogical. I don't want to literally turn a zombies head into an arrow pin cushion. Traps are vastly stronger than you are, so early game you'll want to lure zombies to prebuilt traps and kill them that way.
There are so few weapons and most are only acquired by wandering and arbitrarily finding them in buildings. Type of building doesn't matter either, baseball bats in police stations and M16s in random shacks in the middle of nowhere.
Has alot of potential, the research (Essentially skill growth system) is interesting and fun enough. There is growth but it's probably a bit too lacking for how strong some of the zombies are.  The building is fun, the traps are fun, the mazes of zombie murder are fun. The repair/reload system is very forgiving with how cheap it is, but having to check every trap one by one to re-arm them using a tree branch is tedius and boring.

I really enjoy the building and traps aspect of the game but I would like more time between waves to experience the world and loot.  Loot runs with a friend or two are exciting as well but unless you make a base every half days journey you have zero chance of actually experiencing the map.  

Building 9/10
I enjoy the options and designs of the tools given for traps and buildings.  Some difficulty snapping pieces correctly but it is fairly refined.

Fighting 7/10
The movement of your character feels fairly real and fluid but the zombies act weird sometimes and spaz around.  There doesn't seem to be a big enough advantage for well placed shots.  Head shots should kill most lesser zombies.  I understand juicing bosses and feral zombies but allow me to be a badass with the hordes of regular moron zombies.  Or make it headshots only and add helmets to bosses but 4-8 arrows a zombie is a bit much.  Still fun fights with a sword and shield one v one.  Just add more realism or the fights with hordes become pointless for an individual.

Map 8/10 
Decent size map with lots of different environments which seems pointless when you are stuck in one location holding down the fort.  It takes the better part of the day to travel and take a large building.  For what the game is, fairly unique cities and small community areas.  Things flow well with trees and rocks

Sound 5/10
This is the part I really dont like.  Characters overly grunt when sprinting acting winded the second they do anything, not just when low on stamina.  Birds and animals make too much background noise you can kind of lose your mind.  I currently play Movie music as background noise and turn down the game a bit.  Wave hits and im wielding a lightsaber listening to Dual of the Fates.  The sounds just need a big touch up.  A bird screams non stop for the duration of the game and im grunting like im dying meanwhile a snarling zombie can cross a field and run through as forest and hit me in the back like a ninja without a peep.  

All in all im more critical than i need to be because I hope the Developer reads this and adjusts the game a bit because the game is truly fantastic for where it is at.  I have put in a good amount of hours with two different buddies and I really have fun.  Has A mix of 7 days to die and Day Z.",1624785132,1624867805,True,29,0,0.775799691677093506,0,True,False,True

You start out dropped into ruins not knowing what you're doing and are provided minimal guidance as you feel out how to build what's needed.

Combat is DELIBERATELY imprecise but not crude.  For example: if you get stuck in a small room the walls will stop you swinging your axe properly, but knives or knuckles will work well.

Quick tip: if you're going to play with the night waves on, seek refuge on top of existent buildings (that don't have door access to the roof) as you initially build &/or explore. Then you'll only have to deal with the jumpers. Don't expect a quickly constructed basic wood building to last against a horde. 

Shame they took away the ability for people working together to be able to share crafting stations, etc. but hopefully they'll bring that back with a team mechanic or something.

This game does have some rough edges but at least the shape is reasonably well defined to be not only playable but greatly enjoyable. Just wish eagles and owls would  spawn more often.

I've heard vehicles may be added but I really do not understand why, or even how it could be that beneficial. The game map can be traversed in reasonable time but it is also littered with debris, structures, rocks and trees. Maybe dirt bikes or a push bike may be useful?! Just not seeing it here.

My only gripe is the melee system has some clunk. It still works great although I would like more actions, like:
* Pushing
* Kicking
* Jump attacks (With melee weapons or kick/punch). At the moment falling + melee works but jumping + melee does not. I like to jump and swing.

Coop just works as intended and is a lot of fun. 
I have the odd micro-stutter rubber-banding but for my internet it is better than most if not all games in that regard. It is largely ignored and not a game breaking issue for me to pursue, but others may feel differently.

Great game overall, I really look forward to more content 110%!

- No need to be a Jedi for you to use the Lightsaber.
- Killing bunch of Zombies for no obvious reason at all with a Lightsaber won't lead you to the dark side.... or is it !

I'm a big fan of this genre, and I really wanted to enjoy playing this game. The previews looked great, and I think it's a wonderful concept. The problems lie in the execution. The issues that frustrated me have been noted by other reviewers, and I should have heeded those reviews. The biggest problems that I noticed: Many of the features of this game are not intuitive at all. For instance, the player's UI - there is a health and HP bar, and of course I assume these correlate to HP, food, and water, but there's no explanation for which is which, or how to interpret them. The item icons are painfully small and difficult to decipher, resulting in the time-consuming process of hovering the mouse over each one to reveal details (in painfully small print). The harvesting mechanics are tedious, requiring precise positioning to be able use axe or pick, and the amount of resources gained is pitifully small for the time and effort expended. The combat mechanics are ridiculous. These zombies must all have been ninjas in their former lives judging by the way they dance and weave while attacking, forcing you to constantly move and rotate in order to engage them. As with trees and rocks, you must be positioned precisely in order to be able to use your weapon effectively. The so-called ""tutorial"" at the start of the game is nothing more than a series of tasks you are given, with no instruction on how to accomplish them. One of the tasks is to ""Place a Research Table."" In order to construct the Research Table I needed more of a certain item (rope). Rope needs to be crafted at a ""Crafting Table"", but nowhere in the Build menus could I find a way to build a Crafting Table. I wasted many minutes drilling through all of the various build menus and crafting benches searching for this, while enduring occasional sneak attacks from wandering zombies. If I'm wasting time trying to figure out how to play the game then I'm not having fun playing the game, and if I'm not having fun then I'm not going to waste my time. I applaud the Dev team for what they have done and what they are trying to achieve, but I think the entire effort would benefit greatly if they would bring someone else aboard to create documentation for the game. No doubt all of this is second nature to them because they created the game, but the rest of us need some help.

-You'll shoot 87 arrows (I counted) at a zombie that is clearly copied from Dying light game (the volatile) but all you get when killing it is a piece of cloth and 87 arrows.

- You'll waste so much effort getting defenses up for the midnight zombie wave but then its just pure boring as all you have to do is stand on the roof of a trap and wait (I went to shower and after 15 minutes the wave was still going because it was soooo slow and boring)

As for crafting, most of the items you need to craft are limited to stacks of 20, which just isn't enough to build out much; then for some reason there's like a half dozen different kinds of crafting tables with no clear rhyme or reason as to why you craft some things at one table and not another. It gets confusing. Add to that the icons for all your items are generic looking and you can't tell if you have the right items.

Very nice looking, some optimisation issues but still in EA. 
Tonnes of fun, great gameplay loop and the tower defence aspects are beyond addicting.
Gargantuan potential for how tiny the dev team is and there is a clearly defined roadmap for future updates.
Regularly hotfixed, although some bugs are more prevalent than others-- like ragdolls for example. 
Feels a little rough but honestly, even now in this stage of EA you can easily squeeze out hundreds of hours if you want to min-max everything, get all achievements, try the harder difficulties, do challenge runs and try out different bases and locations. That, and there's steam cloud support, so you'll never lose your progress meaning long-term play is viable.

In my first few hours with playing on survival mode, it seems to me that zombies are very difficult to kill - as in they require 3 or 4 javelin's to the head before dying. Most of the zombies are quick and can hit you while running which can stop your movement. Zombies can run over any piece of obstacle that requires an animation for the player except the zombie NPC. Building requirements for certain items cost a lot of material, most are obtainable by running around the environment and cutting down trees and destroying rocks, other materials are only obtainable by crafting through the workbenches. The animations are very clunky and animals need more work.

It is a good cross between tower defense and survival. While it doesn't have everything that a true survival game does, there are still a number of survival  aspects to satisfy most survival players. 

The tower defense aspect is great. Each night you get a wave of zombies that continually get larger and stronger. You will have to adjust your defense based on what happened the night before. You can never think that your base is enough as there are key waves that increase exponentially. 

On top of that you have the story to follow, the journals to escape the island, if you are so inclined to want to escape. This forces you to explore the island and find different areas to loot. 

Yes, the game is early access; however, the developers have a good roadmap and have been meeting it from the beginning with improvements and additions coming every couple months.

1. This game is actually quite pretty. Runs at a solid 1440p(60)
2. I didn't run into any game breaking bugs.
3. Crafting needs some work.
4. I really need to be able to pin blueprints, so I remember what I need to craft (take a note from Satisfactory)
5. The balance of the Mining Machines (refuelling) needs revisiting for sure.
6. Need an option for Open/Closed/Invite Only parties
7. Would like to see a larger variety of Weapons and Traps
8. Would like to see a ""Survival"" Mode (e.g. No nightly waves w/ Food Water Mechanic)

CONS:  
1.  Crafting is ridiculously complicated.  Too many crafting machines such that you have to look at menus to find out where to do things.  Keep it simple, stupid.   Sure,set yourself apart from the typical one-crafting table and a kiln, but not like this. 
2.  Game is obnoxiously hard.  I created my first game in Normal mode with no special options.  Well, night came before I knew it and I was dealing with a hoard of zombies with no chance of ever recovering.  The hoard doesn't go away at sunrise nor do the zombies calm down.  NOT FUN AT ALL.  Had to put the game in easy mode to find out what I could do.  But what's the point?   No you made me feel like I suck after paying for the game - and I don't suck.  Normal mode should be doable for most frequent gamers, especially someone like me that has played most of the single-person zombie survival games.   I don't care if it's a ""zombie defense"" game instead of a ""zombie survival"" game.  It has to be doable. 
3.  Non-intuitive settings.  Can't figure out how to assign slots for arming weapons.  No, I'm not going to read forums for this.  Keep it simple, stupid.  Spend my time switching between axe and knife.  Dead.   Why differentiate between F and T?  Why not hold F down longer?   Why not take all when there is only one? 
4.  Zombie models need a little more detail.  Seems like they're inspired by System Shock 2, including sound effects.  I don't mind the Jacob's Ladder shaking that others complained about.  They just look like the models came off the Unity3D clearance menu.
5.  Too many clicks to resume a game.  Should have continue option on first title menu.  Keep it simple, stupid.
6.  Can't change difficultly mid-game. 

PROS
1.  The main character animation is surprisingly good.   I love how well searching cars, chopping down trees, throwing knives, etc., looks.   Her boobs don't need to be so big, though.  This isn't 90s era Lara Croft and funtime-with-extrude anymore.  Do you hug your mother with those 3D modeling hands?
2.  Trap machines are cool, though too many crafting tables.
3.  Research data and skill tree is a unique and good idea.  It's a new spin on working for skills.  And research data can come from killing zombies and harvesting.  
4.  Terrain and animal models are OK.",1622553148,1622553148,False,7,2,0.507462918758392334,0,True,False,True

I can see the promise, but its not worth 20 (or 24) bucks to me as is. Props to a two man studio for getting it this far, but it needs to bake longer. If you are into Green Hell/7 days to Die/The Forest then this may tickle you. 

Key points:
- It needs a tutorial. I don't need hand holding, but dropping you into the game without even covering basic controls is not cool.  A couple slides that say ""Press I to open your inventory, press L to toggle your flashlight, these are skills and here is what they do etc"" would go a long way. I got all the important info I needed from a third party websites getting started guide. 
- The UI is overwhelming at first, and there is scant instruction provided. Some visual cues or highlights on what you need to click and where would help a lot. All of the items/resources icons are too small and difficult to tell apart at a glance. For example, I needed 5 rope and I spent 5 minutes googling how to make rope before I figured out I was in the wrong type of crafting bench. 
- Needs more polish. For example it has auto loot for some things which is great, but when you are swinging an axe/pickaxe/knife at a tree/rock/bush if you are too far you miss which can be hard to eye over the shoulder, and if you are too close you hit the handle on the resource and do not make progress toward collecting it which is annoying. I assume they tried to make this a mechanic to get you to feel the length of your tools to find the sweet spot, but to me it was just frustrating. 
- You are better off scoping out the controls and pulling up the wiki or a starter guide beforehand. 
- The map seems huge and actions like running and dodging cost stamina. If you lose all your stamina and keep doing stamina actions, you lose hp. I guess this is to discourage kiting zombies for too long but its overbearing. 
- Speaking of HP,  you are fragile and easily killed. A single zombie took me down to half hp and the food I could find only gave back +1 or +5. You can make a cooking table and probably stronger food but I did not get that far. 
- Zombies are janky and glitchy much like dayz zombies. They teleport around, clip through walls/doors/scenery and are frustrating to fight. I killed a zombie with a bow and arrow, and the corpse flew into the sky at a million miles per hour and took my arrows with her. 
- Team mechanics need to be refined. Theres no shared team stash and your early game objectives reward you with much needed materials but if you are on a team the game doesnt acknowledge that one of you put down a research bench so in order to claim those early rewards you need to build two of everything which is unnecessary. 
- If you die you lose everything unless you loot your body.
- Crafting is confusing and tedious. See rope above. 

Its not bad, its just not ready.",1622183855,1622183855,False,350,11,0.804346680641174316,0,True,False,True

The base building is strong and works well with the devs constantly improving it and adding new building pieces. 

Where this game really shines so far is the traps. There are a lot to choose from of various types (range, melee, other). I mean, trebuchets, who doesn't like those? Combine the base building, survival element (food is fun to make but not overly demanding), crafting, and tower defense elements and you have something fairly unique.

I wouldn't say it's earth shattering as it's clearly still pretty bare bones (it is early access afterall), but if you enjoy clearing houses of zombies and looting people's refrigerators (a specific itch I wanted scratched), there's a lot to like here.  The map seems pretty large, and there's a few key places to explore.  I've only really been to the first main city, but I got lost once and wandered to another city that I didn't expect to see.  There's a main quest centered around collecting what you need to build a radio from these various key areas. I haven't finished that yet but I plan to.

Some of the animations are a bit stiff, and there's a learning curve to how melee works (partly because there's no reticles and you have to turn your camera high up to hit taller enemies in the head, partly because it's a bit clunky).  It's overall just easier to use the crossbow for most things, due to the safety and consistent damage.  You're not supposed to be able to play the game like dynasty warriors despite some of the weapons kind of looking like it.  You ultimately should be trying to kill zombies 1 or 2 at a time, in which case melee's been fine for me after I got used to it, but it's definitely not as straight forward as you'd expect due to the wind up time and relatively unforgiving hit boxes.  I only really cared about the PvE aspect, so that's all I have to talk about.

Cooking's a bit annoying, but doing anything beyond the basic pig feed/good meat I don't particular care about because I cba to get all the stuff, so it's been fine for me.  It's another aspect that signals the game wants you and your friends to do different things day to day, but I played solo so I'm just doing what I need to.

The base building I think has been pretty fun for the kinda horde defense thing.  Some things maybe require too many materials and I think they should  consider giving you slightly more lumber/stone and what not.

To address some of the critiques I seen in other reviews: 

1)no, the game isn't ""unplayable"" after night one, you just do actually need to invest in base defenses instead of trying to kill the entire horde alone.  The tutorial's to blame for a lot of this, as it instructs you on how to make various parts of a base, but not actually make a relatively defendable base.  Early on you really just need the cutter and run around it until you get enough materials to start building funneling mechanisms, walls, and better traps.  If you start on a harder difficulty before you understand game systems, I don't know what to tell you.

2) No, farming the breakable objects for research isn't the best/only way to get research papers, having a well fortified base that can farm you zombies at night is.  I'm on day...8 I believe, and one night is getting me 100-130 research points.  The skill system is clearly designed with co-op in mind, because it would take me I imagine another 5-6 days to unlock everything.  You don't need to unlock everything, I've honestly got most of what I feel I ""need"", but I know that's how some people like to play.  Just don't waste the points you get early and invest them in things that will help you get more points easier, namely construction skills and such. Putting too many points in combat skills before you have a defendable base isn't a good call, because night time defense is the most difficult part of the game early on and you will have to do it EVERY night. A single trebuchet can solo carry a night defense for a long time depending on where you've built your base and if you've stocked ammo.

3) No, it's not as fleshed out as -insert your favorite indie survival thing-, and that's to be expected, as it came out in EA August last year, and many of your favorites have been around for years.  People do this with every game that's relatively new and compare it to something like Rust like said game released in the same feature-rich same state it's in currently. This is just a reality of early access. I think this game has the potential to be very cool, and for what I went in expecting, I'm happy with it.

If you're looking for a zombie romp/base defense game that has some neat aspects, enough content for a good many hours (but not infinite), and you're alright with something that's clearly not finished but has potential, I'd recommend this game.
 If you're going in expecting some finished/polished experience that's been iterated on over years that will hold you for hundreds of hours, this isn't for you at the moment, and I'd recommend just playing something else.",1617760728,1617760728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The achivements show that a ""wooping"" 4.8% have cut down 10 trees, 5.5% have killed 5 zombies, 5.5%!! WTF? This game is at ""very positive"" and ""mostly positive"", and yet only 5.5% has killed 5 zombies, in a zombie survival/tower defence game. Either Steam has some issues with the achievement tracker or someone is misusing the system to get better reviews. It stinks to high heavens! 

""EDIT"" Seems like the achievement tracker wasn't implemented until recently, so that might be the reason for the ""wonky"" numbers.

First of all, I know the game is in early access, that said... I cannot in my life understand why/how this game has gotten so many positive reviews, that is just so wrong. Now the first couple of hours you play will feel ok, you start in the forest which looks nice, you build a small base, kill some zombies and so on. First night you get the first wave of zombies and you start to realize that you have to build defences for the next night. Then you move closer to the city for easier access to resources, this is when this game really turns bad. The buildings (all of them) looks so crappy and are badly designed, and the loot, same freaking loot everywhere. It doesn't matter if you loot a crate, a closet, a freezer, medical bag, everything drops the same few type of ingridients. It just makes it so incredible boring to go exploring buildings because you already know that you are not going to find anything new. Also the difficulty level needs a lot of tuning, the zombies are either a cakewalk or freaking gods.

Melee mechanics are janky, making you guess hit box distances to farm or fight.  The real only option is to go ranged.  Absurd goose chase for research papers as it’s the only way to progress thru the skill tree.  Enjoy pressing ""F"" 10,000 times? Then this games for you!  Enjoy the meticulously crafted stabbing animation that is used to breakdown and search for materials.  Need to loot a car? STAB! Need to demolish those 1000 cardboard boxes in the streets? STAB!  Do you want to search that steel barrel?  You guessed it – STAB!

Many of the more interesting and larger buildings are not designed to be explored.  Crafting is all over the place with no rhyme or reason behind recipes that seem elementary for some items and far too complicated for others.  Crafting meals is a perfect example.  You’ll first need 10+ farm plots in order to meet the demands of the 30+ components needed for various recipes.  Then recipes that require 10 components have poor return providing lackluster benefits.

It was a chore to force myself to complete the “story”.  Game needs a complete overhaul in terms of balancing.  Far too much mindless grinding in order to progress skills.  Graphics were great – that’s about it.

crafting:
pro: great crafting and setups you can build alot of cool things that will keep you interested in that aspect of the game for hours and hours lots of replayability here 
con: finding a decent spot to build is dangerous and a pain and you dont have long to get something setup before the first wave which makes time limited but you can set something up then venture out to find you ideal location also it could use a better learning system in the future. all in all the pro outweighs the con

melee:
con: the melee is a little clunky and hit recognition isnt the greatest the risk highly outweighs the reward and could use some improvements but that doesnt mean the melee isnt fun just that its not the best atm i mean its an early access 
pro: when you do pull off a great melee fight its fun and suspensful just dont get swarmed 

ranged: ranged weapons are great you aren't a god that points at things and they just die but you can get into some pretty good fights a fair bit of zombies in an area aren't as scary when you have a rifle in your hands and the bow isn't that powerful but it is your bread and butter from my exp. hunting animals fighting zombies clearing areas the bow will be your choice until waves or big groups come along all in all ranged is fun and rewarding and feels somewhat smooth im eager to see how they go with it in the future

gathering:
pro: its simple enough to get all the basics and you are never really struggling to find things. with the research papers and ammo and all that good stuff it will keep you interacting with the bigger part of the game that being venturing out into area with zombies clearing buildings upgrading your character for more inventory space and just getting into trouble that you might not make it out of alive (which is great) 

con: the basics get abit repetative examples wood stone iron and for better stuff you can sometimes find yourself in trouble maybe you are in a closed location spotted by zombies and the only way out if to fight your way out (i see this as a good thing others may not) also the basics dont last that long you chew through wood and stone like mad and using alot of ammo on a wave is heartbreaking but its a survival game what do you expect 

zombies:
con: kind of stupid not so stupid that they aren't a threat but stupid enough that if you dont have to spend a great deal worrying about them they might get a hit or two off on you when you are gathering for example but then you just put some distance between you and take them out with the bow with a few zombies there is no sense of danger like oh no im screwed or wasn't prepared enough for this at least not yet hopefully they improve on them in a few ways in the future like aggro range and ai for example ive been right outside a building from a zombie if i stood up we would be looking at each other through the window then other times ive had a zombie that had just been rendered in so i could see them be locked onto me and running at me full sprint which makes me think it was like maybe a leftover that might have gotten stuck on wave night? 
pro: in large numbers wave nights and if you aggro enough of them they can be a pain if you aren't careful and if you are indoors and searching stuff when they come for you good luck because getting out of that building will be rough unless you want to blow some ammo on them also the wave night is fun doing your setup having all your traps and surviving the night brings a sense of accomplishment and pride in your base and the effort you put into it making you want to improve on it even more because the zombies rush you they are relentless some are fast some are tanky some can jump some crawl and if your base isnt setup good enough they will get through and they will kill you which makes up for the stupid zombies during the day

is the game worth your money? yeah its actually a pretty decent game hats off to the devs here you guys have done a good job with everything and im keen to see how this goes and what gets added i can see myself playing this for a fair while at least. it wont be my main focus but its a good game that is worth your time and money for early access there are no bugs that i have come across besides maybe the 2 or 3 zombies tht will hunt me to ends of the map abit after wave night and even if you put it done at some point its one of those games i can see people going back to later on

Doors that are more or less decals on buildings. For this type of game that puts it way behind similar games like 7 days to die, or any of the other zillion games. 

It plays out like a tower defense with some minor survival which is nice, sets it asside from other similar games, but the waves get crazy a bit to fast forceing you to rush rather then allowing you to enjoy it more.

Over all I really want to recomened it and in time I am sure it will be a great game, but as it stands now it is simply lacking the finer details. 

For those who argue that it is a early access game I am comparing it to many other early access games that I own, so I did take that into account. 

At the moment I would rate it about a 3 star game, with potential to be a 5 star with a bit more work and I fully suggest people to buy it if on a good sale or to watch it closely as it grows.

Equal parts exploration, hunting/crafting, base/trap building & character development. The traps are fantastic fun and there's a good variety to try out. The gun play is also solid and the melee weapons feel heavy, you really feel the crunch when you chop a zombies head off with a 2 handed broadsword. There's a huge amount of content considering this is early access, spanning a suprisingly large hand crafted map offering multiple potential starting areas, which you get randomly assigned. I'm 50+ hours in and still having a blast!

The survival mechanics are an interesting variation on the traditional thirst/hunger systems. Called condition, it inevitably deteriorates as time passes, causing your max health and stamina to reduce. Eating most any food will restore some health, but eating the right food will also restore your condition back to and in some cases, beyond 100%. It ensures that gathering, hunting and growing food remain essential, without the need for too much micro management.

It's reasonably well optimised already, although there is room for improvement which I fully expect will come in time. The developer seems active and to be engaging with the community having released several hot fixes of late based on feedback post launch. There are some serious stability issues with multiplayer currently, which the developer has acknowledged and is working on. *UPDATE* As of March 2021, I've played several hours of multiplayer with friends with no stability issues to speak of. Not being able to select your character is slightly annoying, you just get assigned one when you start (for some reason, everyone is the same character in my experience so far), but that's cosmetic and doesn't impact the game play overall.

No real story to speak of at this stage, but that's hardly unusual in an early access game and to be honest that's not what keep's survival junkies like me coming back for more anyway.

Overall I am really, really impressed and excited to see how this game develops. One of the strongest early access games I've ever played. If you enjoy the zombie/survival genre, then this is definitely one to add to your collection!

...did I mention you can craft a lightsaber!

It's pretty clear from the get go that the developers haven't ever played another survival/zombie/building/whatever before as the build menu and inventory menu is abysmally bad. It's awkward as hell to build anything as the menu is extremely unfriendly when selecting what to build. You press B to open a menu on the left side and there you click on what category you want, and then select the object you want to build and you get to the screen. If you want to select another object you have to repeat this process again.

Then you've got the multiplayer which is laggy as hell, my friend kept having freezes all the time. Bundle this with the fact that others who join you cannot select a character is just laughable. But it doesn't just end there, the game is filled with graphical glitches ranging from moving the camera creating ghost images of your character to having a noise filter applied to the entire screen.

It's pretty clear that there's a decent concept of a game hidden here and that the developers is lacking the technical skills to bear it to fruition.

 Let me start this off by saying this game has huge potential to be an amazing game, Between the rather large world to explore and the variations of zombies it is something every zombie fan would love to play. However I cannot recommend this game at the moment, With only 3 hours played I have already experienced the buggy mess that is building a base, the locking for the pieces is clunky and unreliable, It's nearly impossible to put a perfect floor down without it overlapping on one side or leaving gaps. The game focuses a lot on the ability to build and set traps to defend the night waves of zombies but sadly seems they have missed the mark on the building. Though the traps are cool and fun, and well thought out a lot of the time you will be unable to place them outside your base do to uneven terrain. 

Optimization: 
The game runs fine until you reach a city, then your frames begin to drop and it becomes choppy, Even sometimes freezing for a moment. This makes exploring the beautiful world a hassle, It pulls you from the game world back into reality rather quickly. For reference I have a 2060 super and I was experiencing these drops. 

Summary:
 Overall the game is alright, It has so much potential to become something great but at this moment I cannot recommend it for its price point. I believe in the team that has created this game to take it in the right direction but do yourself a favor and hold off until they fix some of these issues.",1613603597,1613603597,False,3,3,0.486059039831161499,2,True,False,True

They've spent an awful lot of time on a massive world, on enemies, on a tech tree, but sadly the foundations of this game are flawed.

The movement seems clunky
The combat is poor as has been noted by other reviews.
And the crafting while well thought out and with obvious depth is clunkily implemented.

And given it's only a small dev team involved IMO it's unlikely these issues will be resolved any time soon.

I was worried that is would be buggy and gimmicky but I have really enjoyed the game. The map is huge and you can go inside and explore most of the buildings and you can build almost anywhere. There is a skill tree in the game to enhance your abilities and unlock new things. The horde gets harder each night to give you motivation to grind resources and unlock skills and crafting items. It is early access and the game definitely needs improvements and polish but I have not had any crashes or game breaking bugs. The nightly horde makes it hard to explore the large map and get back to your base each night but the developers are planning to add vehicles so that should make a big difference. There is a minimal story at the moment but it is mostly about surviving the nights currently. If they can build in a story and give a purpose to explore beyond just surviving the nightly horde the game will be great.

Altough I do like this type of games, I am not an expert. And so I started on easy difficulty. Fun enough, the game does not care. Building a shelter is pointless, zombies see through walls and always know where you are. The thing you want to do is the build traps traps and more traps, which is going to be very difficult because the ressources necessary for this are far away. And even then, frist day, easy difficulty and game throws more then 10 zombies at me and I could barely stop them. The boss of night 1 wave was the first zombie of the zombie wave on night 2... yeah, fun, not. Any game needs some sort of a progression system... as the enemies get stronger, so the player, to match it. Not in this game, not at this stage of development. And while the game uses unreal engine and is not realy that demanding on your hardware, it is not very smooth... you want to shoot arrows? Well pray to Fortuna, because when you move your mouse, the ""crosshair"" moves 20pixels at a time, precise shooting impossible.
Add to that the weird crafting and you are set. I man, I need a half dozen different work stations to build, when I actualy need the ressources to build traps to survive, and then they do not help much. You need piece of cloth to craft cloth so you can craft rope, why cant you craft rope from piece of cloth. why does everything require ""advanced"" crafting components that are hard to come by? and why is there no waiting? playing at night is awful, yet you have to wait and wait and wait ingame time till the time passes. and there is no other way to restore condition but to eat, health the same. quite weird for a survival game. in the end, the game is just some tower defense to stop a wave of zombies that gets larger every night, while the day is used a half backed sandbox (crafting) mechanic.

***Read my first review before reading this*** I originally gave this game a thumbs up when I first purchased it, but now after coming back and trying it again after a couple of bigger updates I'm left puzzled. I don't understand what this game is trying to be or where it's going to end up. There really are some awesome concepts here, like I mentioned in my first review, but I'm not sure if awesome concepts are enough to make this game enjoyable after just a few hours of gameplay. After you've had your fun killing a couple night's worth of zombies with the traps and spend a little time exploring, you've done it all. If you've explored one house, one warehouse and and one convenience store everything is the same. In my opinion there just isn't enough to do, really there isn't much to loot and it's just boring after a few short hours. As it stands, Night of the Dead in it's current state isn't worth the price. Wait a year or so and revisit the game. Maybe by then, the developers will know what direction the game is going in.   

***First Review*** This game is a surprise and came out of no where. I recently purchased Night of the Dead on sale and it has yet to disappoint! This game is in early access so there are plenty of hiccups and issues, but for the most part I think once this game is finished it's gonna turn a lot of heads. Think of H1Z1, 7 Days to Die, Rust and Orcs Must Die! all smashed together and Night of the Dead is the game you get. Don't be worried, yes I have more cons listed than pros, but that's only because I think most of the cons will be fixed as they work on it.  

Pros
* Very creative game, not necessarily original as I stated it takes ideas from other games but I think this does a nice job taking the good parts from other games and using them correctly
* Setting up mazes with traps to kill zombies is pretty satisfying
* Large open world map 
* Visually appealing environment
* A nice variety of zombies with different builds and the zombies make pretty creepy and scary sounds, especially some female zombies
* A fun survival/tower defense experience each night
* Multiplayer is good but needs work 

Cons -right now most of my issues are with the crafting system and they really aren't cons so much as things I recommend retooling or fixing

* Multiplayer is laggy at times, whether I'm hosting or a friend is. We all have good internet, so that's not the issue. Things will happen on the player's game that aren't happening on the server/host side.
* After 20+ hours played and I know this is early access, but I want to state it anyway. It's gets pretty boring, you have almost zero reason to loot because you have plenty of guns, ammo and resources. Not only that, but there really isn't very many different items to find. Once you've seen cloth or a piece of iron 700 times, it get's rather boring to explore and search. 
* It needs a better tutorial - In my opinion it needs to walk you through everything (but make it skippable), I noticed some things it skipped which had me scratching my head on what was next. More so, it's just a bunch of tool tips to teach you how to play. I don't like that for a game like this, especially if you are a newcomer to these types of games. 
* The crafting system is more complicated then it needs to be, it really gets picky and specific on the types of materials you need to build and craft. For example you'll need to craft a *piece of cloth* into cloth, that's just annoying. If you want to make rope, you'll need to first make cloth from cloth LOL. I know, sounds stupid. That's my point. If you have what you need to craft, no matter what form its in allow us to just auto craft. I find myself spending WAY too much time in the damn crafting menus trying to figure out what I need.
* This is again about the crafting system, when you go to build a wall or anything you need to remember EXACTLY what materials it costs to build it, because after you have it selected the item you can no longer see how much mats you have left if you wanted to build another. This applies specifically to the crafting window because it can't be open while you are looking for your items in a container or inventory. Fixing this is something simple that would greatly cut down on time wasted.
* The crafting system isn't bad, don't get me wrong. I just feel it needs reworked and simplified a little bit. Right now, it's just frustrating that you have to waste so much time in the crafting menus not actually crafting especially when a HUGE part of this game requires to spend lots of time gathering resources
* Materials don't stack properly in your inventory, sometimes you'll have stacks with different amounts, you have to take time and combine stacks and this is a must because your carry capacity is based on slots not weight so this matters
* Zombies often get stuck behind doors, walls, guard rails, rocks or small hills etc. This is incredibly annoying during the attack waves. Zombies also run away, I'm not sure how that makes any sense but sometimes they just run from you. 
* Building walls and floors things like that really need to be worked on, things don't fit properly or sometimes it's SOOO tedious to get a floor or wall to connect even with the (alt) snap function
*I'm hoping the combat system is improved (specifically the melee), for now it works but it's clunky and unresponsive at times
* Needs more traps, weapons, guns and just more to build in general

All and all I love the direction this game is going. A very solid start and some seriously fun game play. I can't wait to see what Jacktostudios continues to do with NotD. This game is 100% worth it even at full price. I will reevaluate this review later if my opinions or notes change.",1606423757,1612501416,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

At its current state, I would give it a solid 6 out of 10 (AngryJoe scale, not the crappy IGN one that gives 7 or above to most games). 

At its core, this is a Tower Defense / Exploration Game with zombies. You spend your day exploring, gathering resources and building a base + traps in order to survive the wave of zombies that attack you at night. A simple concept that can be quite fun and rewarding, if that's your cup of tea. Despite being in early access, the game seems surprisingly free of bugs and has quite a lot of content to explore - i.e. a fleshed out map, decent techtree and a good variety of traps to test. 

The most lackluster aspect of the game are the zombies. They kinda made exploring the map a boring chore, being more annoying than scary. 
1. Their detection/aggro system is weird. You can sometimes walk into a room full of zombies, smack one in the head and retreat, waiting for it to follow you out while other zombies seem oblivious to your presence. Other times, fighting one zombie seems to attract others that are not even that close. There should be a way to attract zombies by making noises. 
2. Fighting zombies at the moment is kinda boring. Even hitting the head, each zombie takes at least a few shots to die (big ones need a lot more). They sometimes retreat during combat (which makes no sense) and most only chase you for a little bit before giving up. Clearing out buildings becomes a monotonous chore. To make things worse, zombies seem to respawn inside buildings even when doors are closed. So if you don’t finish exploring a building the first time, next time you come back you have to start all over again.

To make things short, the zombie AI is what needs the most improvement. Just by changing that, this could become a great game! At the moment, you can have fun trying to build elaborate mazes full of traps - just be prepared to grind a lot for it!

The controls, crafting, and combat is just not very good. F is a weird option for your action button which I changed to E, but it is still shows up as 'F' when hovered over an item. 

My BIGGEST peeve about the game is that running your stamina out HURTS you. Like... what. Why? So if you are fighting zombies with melee combat you lose stamina so you can't be consistently fighting them, run away, or jump otherwise you could potentially kill yourself. How is that a thing? I understand losing stamina for all of those actions but they should not hurt you. I shouldn't be just surviving and then a jump kills me. That's stupid and honestly is the biggest turn off for the game. 

Now I do like a few things like the name of other players showing up on the world BUT it doesn't give you a little icon on the compass on the top of the screen so hopefully they know what direction they ran off in if you are too far from them. The other thing I liked were the animal traps. Those were cool and 7D2D doesn't have that. The wildlife in general was cool. Seemed to be a lot of it around.

So overall,

Likes:
-Wildlife
-Animal traps
-Names showcase on world
-Graphics are decent in world
-You get all your arrows back
-Aiming is easy
-Crafting is instantaneously so that's cool

Dislikes:
-Stamina (every part of it)
-Graphics on inventory menu are very juvenile
-You need 6+ different benches to craft everything
-Looting in the houses is lackluster
-Storage boxes hold nothing so you have to keep upgrading it
-Fall damage at even the smallest heights

Hopefully I can get a refund even though I tried it for 3 hours.

- Fighting is still a bit awkward where you can be too close to a target and miss them, 
- Building and placement of objects is a bit clunky.  
- Moving things in and out of inventory like arrows isn't always intuitive - sometimes they drop on the ground.
- Bullets are not easy to find, so I'm really not sure which targets are ""bullet-worthy"". 

I have not tested PVP or group dynamics as I am trying to learn the basics.

So far this has still been a positive experience and if they stay committed to the development this should turn out to be a really good game.

Trying to fight the first enemy, a wolf, left me wildly flailing and hitting nothing, despite rubbing up against the savagely attacking wolf. 
The wolf would annoyingly sprint in sporadic circles (you know how these silly wolves do) and would only attack after I finally managed to corner it. 
I finally figured out that the only weapon that would effectively score hits against the wolf was my knife, with less than half of fist swings hitting, and none of my axe swings making contact.

You start by building a base (tutorial guides you somewhat pretty well) the more materials you gather the better your base becomes (obvious right?) BUT there comes a time when you have to adventure out (mark a waypoint on your map of your base so you don't get lost) but be careful when the clocks gets near the end of the current day as a zombie horde is coming for you and ideally you want to be near your base as you can set up zombie traps that makes your life 10 times easier. 

It's not all about building bases tho, just think of the series 'walking dead' but enjoyable.  

I will say near the beginning build all 3 versions of crafting tables and a campfire. Don't worry about the walls of your base for the first couple days, just get to know the game and get some food/bow & arrows with a zombie trap etc. When the times ready go explore (make sure you have enough supplies tho)

Something I really love is if shooting an arrow or bolt etc. If you miss you can pick them back up.  Also being able to retrieve them from zombies after you kill them is cool. The weapons and traps are very cool.  The days are long , like 2hrs of real time long. You need it through to prepare for the onslaught to come.

The traps are real fun and the nightly waves of zombies are awesome and scary at the same time. The different difficulty levels are accurate. Me and my friends already had a hard time on the 4th wave on survival. 

With that being said, ofcourse for a alpha game, it needs some fine tuning. Following are the most useful tips we gathered during our 20 hour + gameplay. 

-	Names above crafting tables
-	Mouse scroll wheel for using different hotkeys.
-	Add dodge roll to make the combat more interactively 
-	Add blueprints, to see what materials you need instead constantly having to memorize the materials.
-	Others players should see the blueprints/placement of my traps. 
-	Being able to build on slightly uneven round
-	No/less falling damage, this makes building and daytime gameplay extremely frustrating, let alone when fleeing from a horde of zombies.
-	Make it possible to upgrade/customize traps. (Orcs must die has awesome gameplay in this)
-	Small animal traps are bugged, can only see a small twig to refresh the trap which makes it extremely hard to find.
-AI movement bugges alot which makes it hard to taunt zombies.
-Add customization in time. (Like seven days to die)

Finally the shooting works perfectly fine, the material gathering is awesome and it's definitely worth buying. Will play this game a lot more with me and my friends. We're already hyped to play a LAN party.

The good things: Fun base building game where zombies attack you in the night. The combat isn't amazing but it holds together and there is an exploration aspect as you follow clues in a series of journals to gather what you need to win the game.

The bad things: It doesn't look amazing, getting enough materials to build stuff can be a chore and ultimately there isn't that much variety of stuff to collect. The collision detection can be a bit off when chopping down trees, mining rocks etc and the layout of the buildings you come across can be a bit cramped and daft.

Ultimately: It does play like an alpha release but we enjoyed ourselves and completed it. Took 27 hours between two players, works well as a co-op game.",1609624281,1609624281,True,5,0,0.563345968723297119,0,True,False,True

This being early access, it's fully functional with few glitches. That's not something every early access game can say. The mechanics are simple and it's easy to just start playing. No need to memorize a million things in the beginning. As you advance, the game becomes a bit repetitive in the sense that there are no goals really, no end game, no challenges besides rinse and repeat of nightly hordes and keeping your base up to date with it's defenses. Grinding in this game for resources isn't nearly as bad as many other games and is relatively quick, but the rinse and repeat is what after 173hours has pushed me to play less and less. 

Despite rinse and repeat, I would still recommend this game. I've played 99% on multiplayer and while it isn't optimized and fps are lower, this game is better enjoyed with company seeing as there seems to be a zombie multiplier.

Turn your music on in your music player before playing this game, will make you enjoy it so much more killing Zombies!

So far, It requires Patience, Little Slight Skill, and Basic Know Hows, It has many difficulty settings for All people, I play more in Multiplayer than anything else, My server will be known as New World Order All Welcome!

For those new people, Craft a Compass for your Crafted Base, before going out to explore, so you can find your way back to your base on the compass, I don't play like most, I Build on top of Buildings of their roofs, quickly as possible on Legendary Mode, or Custom Settings, the best thing to do in hardest settings, is to craft as quickly as possible, otherwise, you will NOT survive from the Hordes. 

With my strategy, after crafting my base safely on top of a roof, is I explore for weapons, my main priority is finding a Gun, and finding the ammo, until I can craft the ammo, once I can craft ammo, it becomes easier, using Flamethrowers and the Giant Crossbow Torrents makes the game easier no matter what setting you are on. 

For my priority is finding safety first, crafting basic food, and hunting for more Chocolate bars, building those up as much as possible, while main priority for me, is to find an AK and upgrade it little by little, I have found using the AK, as I like to call it, really fun to Headshot Zombies!, from a distance, drawing them out one by one and crafting as many dynamites as I can for taking out groups in buildings using them like flash bangs to explore areas, I prefer the game to be really hard for better enjoyment on my part, this game is set apart from others, to me, It's addictive if you love crafting and defending off your base, while looking for journals. 

It Is much easier to explore to my perspective using the flamethrower and AK combined with the baseball bat, But everyone has a different style of playing this game, Melee is a great option in the beginning, I just wish they didn't force the Basic Knife on you when you die, I wish you could setup your primary default weapon and store your knife, this gets in the way and wastes a perfectly good spot in your inventory.

Although, I haven't been actually looking for the journals quite yet, I found it so much more thrilling to just craft, craft, craft. I have created a Mansion so far, I started crafting on Day One Of 0 Days. I am having a much easier time surviving than most are, due to me using the Roofs in the Cities, which allows me to enjoy the game much more rather repairing structures all the time, which allows me to explore for weapons and collecting them for other online friends that join me. I am doing no different in this game than what I do in Fallout 76 and that's sitting in several spots crafting buildings.

And Yes, You do have some characters to choose from before you start a New Game, you start a new game And a Character Selection Screen Shows, I know some women that love the idea you can finally be a woman in a Zombie infested world!

And yes, to me, I didn't feel like I was ripped off from the price, to me, It's worth every cent payed for, and I thank the devs for their time creating this game. 

Please devs give us the ability to store the knife and allow us to choose a preferred weapon of choice for when we die. I hate the knife stuck in my inventory all the time, after I have new weapons to use.

The cool bits can be summed up into three parts: night waves, messing with randoms, and messing with buds.
night waves: swarms of zombies coming after you and your shiz at nightime which you can prepare for during the day and this is actually really fun and challenges you to protect your stuff from low waged undocumented polish migrants that want to smash Englands economy by buying Camel cigarettes in bulk then selling them at an extreme mark up price.  
messing with randoms: this is a last resort when dealing with the Chinese children that play this game, for example when you kill all the enemies in an area and [b]阴茎接触器[/b] runs infront of you and takes all the loot there and you get 20 bullets and bamboo leaves when he or she got converse sneakers or if they lock you out of the house during a wave and you have to defend yourself with a sharpened mastercard and lose your whole inventory when you die due to glitched terrain or the time all three of the Chinamen threatened violence upon me if I didnt accept the unpaid apprenticeship that basically put me in enslavement to chop down trees all day or mine rocks, only then will it be acceptable for you to take everything out of the chests you can and throw it in a secret spot so they cant find it or weaken the walls and destroy the traps so the zombies can get in much faster then cower behind your comrades and do nothing as they are ripped apart and the base gets in worse and worse shape until it is no longer viable to protect it as all the work that was done is now undone and they log off.
messing with friends: this is were the game shines as all games with friends do.

They are based on people who didn't read Dev's message on EA and ignore the fact that this game is under development.

Graphics are not great, content is low and optimization is poor.
But as the Dev's said, key features are working.
I've played through in ""easy-mode"" and it was fun.
I felt entertained and I'm not sorry about the money I spent on this.
Replayability could be MUCH higher if the key items you need were spawning on random locations.

I will definetly be back on this game in 2021 when the Dev's followed their roadmap.

If you're going to play with friends DO NOT OVERCLOCK ANYTHING and be prepared to dumb down your RAM. I have 64GB of 3200 speed RAM, which works perfectly with all other games, but for some reason, NotD crashes unless it is forced down to 2666. I've played Skyrim at Ultra with no issue at normal speed, Payday 2 on ultra with no issue and various other games on ultra, no prob. 7 Days on ultra is the only other game that requires this dumbing, and it can be 3000 speed with no issues, even with hordes set to max. So I can't understand why they would have such an issue (perhaps this is related to ""dumped"" items not disappearing ever bug, eating up too much memory when it really shouldn't need too?)
Now, we'll get to general game play. This game is more like an ""alien"" defense than zombies, because you get ""Olympic Athlete"" Zombies that can run as fast (or faster) than you, huge, strong zombies that are like a normal person standing next to The Undertaker, leaper zombies that would make any high or long jumper jealous of their ability and (we're only up to day 6) fire zombies that can burn wood at a whim (so make sure you upgrade the benches quickly to make stone structures or you'll be sorry!).
Then we have the wildlife... bears are too abundant and also can sneak up on you and nearly kill you (or kill you) before you know what happened. They also have much more stamina and will outrun you and have FAR too many HP to take on without completely cheesing them. Owls have so many HP that you'll have a tough time getting upgrades that require them. Wolves, however, are perfectly balanced, as are most of the rest of the wildlife I've come across. I also believe that having to collect different skins and bones is something best left to the MMO community. They all have skins, they all have bones, let's just break it down to basics and give them different numbers for the size of the critter, and then make the requirements for the upgrades take an increasing amount. That way, there's no need to fill up a player's inventory with useless stuff when he's trying to get a bite to eat by bagging an animal.
BTW, I still haven't figured out what the animal intestines are for... I thought they'd be for sausages, but that recipe doesn't require it.
Night gamma is also too dark (like all other zombie games) so it's really tough to see when the sun starts going down. The light you have looks like it is shining in fog, so night light is muddled at best and seldom ever aims where you need it to unless you're drawing the bow. That is unless you intend to spend all night hours at your base, you'll see fine there with all your crafting tables that emit light, but the distance will still be hazy at best. However, you can beat most of the early hordes before hour 3 with a modestly defended position (at least for the first several nights). This means you'll have major eye strain from approximately 21:00-06:00... so roughly six hours of game time if you defeat the horde early in 3 hours. At least the quasi trance ""wave started"" music will end when you've pretty much defeated the night so you know after you mop up you can get back to harvesting and hunting again. That's likely the only and best innovation this game has.
Anyway, it's fun enough, but still, I'd like the slow, strong zombies from yesteryear that don't take 7 head shots with a bow to defeat as they are sprinting at you while spitting fire and God knows what else. This is just 7 Days to Die in a different skin, and in my opinion it isn't better, it only looks better. It just has more wildlife, which is great as far as food goes in an apocalyptic setting. If you're looking for a 7 Days with better graphics, here you go. If you're looking for something that raises the bar, forget it, it's not here.
Before you ask, YES I have been into the city and down in the subway, so I have been a few miles.

While this latest zombie survival game is one of many takes on the 7-days formula, it does offer some unique blend of gameplay which might help it grow into a decent game. 

At first glance these devs show a promise of no-nonsense approach. After the neverending stream of elaborate zombie-survival clones of the past years, it feels somewhat like a fresh breeze. Judging from the steam charts , a lot of people think so, this game had an incredibly strong launch. and rightly so. There is already a deep crafting system in place, the gamebreaking bugs are at a a minimum, there is a clearly defined ingame goal, and a decent story in place, which creates good incentive to play aka the forest or green hell.

we've played some multiplayer, about 5 ingame days, and i admit we had a great time already, notwithstanding many little peeves, that might turn off some players who don't manage their expectations. 

so what made this play so enjoyable?
- compared to the holy 7days to die grail of the genre, the fast pace in notd is [i]fast[/i], nice!
- this is partly due to a very efficient and no nonsense approach towards crafting and inventories. We could spend all of our playtime to exploring, fighting, scavenging, building and defending, which is great for a game genre which tends to create situations where you need to manage your inventories half of the playtime, a wise design choice right off the bat
- the game has a realistic athmosphere, and the industrial and residential environments are very well done.
- zombies come in many shapes , forms and characters, some of them are quite challenging
- medieval siege equipment meets modern warfare: interesting! and bloody :D blood showering exploding zombies right in front of you as a result of heavy ballista impacts.. fire and mayhem through flamethrowers and trebuchet bombs.. whats not to like 
- aleady a convincing implementation of wildlife
- They now have a roadmap 


so why would one wait for this zombie game to become more 'fleshed out'?


- zombie pathfinding is ...well.. not very good, and their beautiful animations dont weigh up against the jaggyness overall.
- while the world looks postapocalyptic and the views are quite nice, overall the environment feels cloned and a bit stale. The nature-part of the map needs more love.
- performance is not good for unreal engine, it seemed to run better on my old potato than on my friends hi-performance rig which is a curious fact. The problem gets especially bad with many zombies around
- sounds can get annoying, f.e. the chest-opening sound squeak ... 
- collision model and character movement is very rigid
-the building mechanics are not very flexible,f.e. you cant build a wall on a foundation if a stairs is already in place, or a floor under a siege weapon,... making the order in which yo place things a factor. So you need to spend some time reworking when you try to scale up your build
- crafting materials need balancing in terms of usefulness.. make sure to have some chests around for unusable objects like all the various bone types...
- rabbits seem too much of a necessity. We had a good stock of perfectly fine deer skin and such.. but for some reason rabbit skin is demanded for a dozen of things.. 
- character development (through research) is hard to keep track of, there needs to be some character info 

it will take a while before a true assesment can be made about whether this title will fulfill al its implicit promises. some of the more obvious issues are the typical ones: gfx performance, multiplayer performance, and the devs seem on top, with almost daily updates, and a quick launch of dedicated server functionality. Other issues might or might not be tackled, depending on how community interaction will take place, the recent release of a roadmap is surely another step in the right direction. Good fun is to be had, so overall, i'm recommending.",1600175578,1607994970,True,30,1,0.739754080772399902,0,True,False,True

This game is not perfect. I did not get the amazing everything is explorable enviornment of 7 Days to Die or Ark. I didn't get the perfect build placements either. But what i got was a zombie tower defense game that relies on you scavenging resources and doing the best with what you can find. The days are VERY long but you need every second of it. I do really enjoy the exp system its both rewarding and punishing at the same time. Dieing is unfortunate but its also not the end of the world provided you don't die before you get to your body again. 

The enemies.... act like zombies. But where this game shines.. is the traps. And oh my god are the traps satisfying. We've barely touched the iceberg and my buddy and i just marathoned it for 4 hours. THe traps slaughtering zombies is absolutely what you should play this game for. Not the building, scavenging, or even the 1v1 combat. But for the tower defense. Build up, post up, lay traps, and watch them do work. That's what you should expect from this game.

Of course, being in Alpha  it's not all there but the potential is for sure. I won't go into a lengthy review but I'll share some initial thoughts on the game. 

POSITIVES
GRAPHICS: Visually on par with SCUM and definitely better that 7DTD (which I still enjoy). There are occasions with frame get funky especially when there are a large number of zombies around but its expected at this stage. 

ZOMBIES
The variety of zombies if good. There are some that have special attacks, AOE attacks and and even ranged attacks.

NEGATIVES
LOOTING: Our biggest frustration has been looting which is limited to on streets (barrels, vehicles and cardboard boxes) and in buildings (wooden crates, refrigerators and loot cases). The fact that you can't loot real world containers (i.e. garbage cans, cabinets, dumpsters, fuel containers, etc.) which survivalists would gravitate to can be unrewarding and frustrating at first.

KEEPING RESOURCES
When you demolish a wall, stairs or even a weapon all materials use to create it return to you. This is a nice feature when it come to remodeling or expanding knowing you don't have to grind fresh resources every time you demolish something. 

THE HAMMER TOOL
The hammer is used to demolish created items but use it with care. If you forget you have it in your hand and proceed to lets say open a crate or use a crafting table it will go into a demolish mode and it's not easy to break away from it. The good news is anything you destroy you get the materials back in your inventory. Being able to click the use button again to stop this action would be an easy fix.

Overall, this game has great potential and I look forward to seeing all the new features they will be adding in 2021.

You have a lot of crafting, building, fighting, looting, and every night brings a wave of zombies so that keeps it interesting.

If you ask me, there are no cons, but some suggestions for developing the game:
- crafting recipes should be attachable to your HUD, it is kind of annoying to keep all ingredients in mind or looking them up each time.
- The production plants are really expensive, once to build but especially to maintain - I think they should produce more goods (e.g. too little oil output).
- research papars are kind of rare and especially the later upgrades are really expensive, but of course that could be part of the game plan, if this is intended it's totally fine for me.

Well, after placing one-hundred hours into this masterpiece, despite some of the buggy mechanics and minor lag, it's a well-designed concept. This isn't a story-driven game, just so you know, it's mainly just about surviving for as long as you can. Then, at any time, you may start over again, and again, and again. I'm not entirely sure, but I'm certain enough to suggest that the weapons are not generated randomly, however, I might be wrong, and this could potentially change in the future, I'm sure. 

The graphics are amazing, great company, known as ""Unreal Engine"". The realism is exactly what you can expect them to be, especially for a widespread world, just like this one. You may play this offline by yourself, or online with friends. You may also play as the same character as other friends, or players. I, myself, prefer to play as the exceedingly-attractive female with the big chest in a grey shirt and black jacket and thick rear in light-blue skinny jeans, alongside boots that are worn out. 

The artwork themes for this game are great. The female you play as, has a beautiful, facial structure and hair with blue eyes. However, she seems to have a sassy appearance that will add to her personality. Her looks, just in general, would be a ten-out-of-ten, easily. Amazing vector-related artwork, strong detail and everything about it, is just stunningly-underrated. 

Each day grows more challenging, more zombies, bigger hoards, sometimes becomes unpredictable and can be overwhelming at times. Do not foolishly waste resources if you're a player that takes games more seriously. The weapons in this game are decent, but the verity is large. The scoping of certain firearms isn't the best, honestly, but if the developers are willing to add more colours to makers when you're aiming at a vital target, I'm sure this could be a step-up for players. 

The ambient music in this, is loud, but good. Even sounds a little spooky at first. The zombies that jump, are buggy, sometimes, they launch themselves higher than they should, potentially over later-designed walls that are meant to keep them out. They also punch through permanent walls, which isn't good either. That needs to be fixed. But honestly, regardless of the problems this game has, it's very enjoyable. 

Let's recap some things and mention additional information, single-player, play as a hot woman with a big chest, thick booty. Multiplayer, play as more characters, including males, or even the same character for each player. Large verity of weapons, upgrades and styles. Gather resources from natural or manufactured objects, like trees, bushes, barrels, cars, you know, the usual. 

This is all I can really think of right now, or bother to mention at least. I can't complain that much, because, realistically, there isn't much wrong with it. Only the little things that can be eventually found, could be improved. And everyone will have their opinion on what's worth improving and what's not. 

I'd feel comfortable giving this game, as of right now, even though it's in earlier development still, an 8.5 on the low end, and a 10.0 on the high end.

The graphics are stunning,the lighting is spot on one of the best volumetrics i have seen yet.
However a small downside is the performance is not optimized properly yet,as in the city area FPS drops to sub 30,and that`s on my GTX 1080,even at all low...however besides that and some cluster areas,the game runs fine,so i`m taking this will be leveled out in the future.

I can recommend this game,but if absolute performance is your must have,wait abit until devs level out the affected areas,otherwise go get it.

*EDIT:

After some more time with the game and cranking the difficulty up to 650% i can say that this game needs some serious balance changes/fixes.For example,how can a rotting 1/5 of a tree give 2 logs but a full grown a** eden tree give 3? really +1? Copper,the one important thing you`ll need for traps,you know one of the points of the game,is way too rare and grindy,looking at the applications it`s used in.

Also the fact that zeds hold their waves if your base isn`t set up on a million mile square flatland and will launch a full army on you way after waves have ended and you want to you know go out farm resources,just cause their spawn/pathfinding is garbage (oh yeah and good luck with that on legendary btw)...which also brings to the difficulty balance,i get that legendary shouldn`t be a cakewalk for sure,but when it takes 20 arrows to down just 1 zed,they can kill you in 3-4 hits and everywhere`s crawling with them that`s a bit bs in my opinion.

Many oddities like trees breaking halved,treetop spawning in the sky?Zeds sinking into rocks,invisible barriers obviously extending over obsticles(convinience store shelves are good example of this).

Random out the behind spawning zombie just to keep you on edge,even when in open field where there are none.

Looting is unrewarding and lacking,way too many big houses and what like 2 boxes,3 if you`re lucky?And that`s made even worse if you have high difficulty and had to clear 50 zeds for 2 boxes of logs and nails...

Superman charging zombie which,when charging,can NASA itself in the air like it has a freakin jetpack,voiding your traps and likely dishing a free hit/damage to your building that shouldn`t be reachable.Also the zeds cluster where you stand sometimes,so that fancy maze you made to your door,well let`s hope your foundations can withstand an army of mindless rotten corpses banging the spot you are above or you can stand outside at the edge of the trap and risk being NASA-ed.

Huge number of Z's from the 20-th day simply will froze some of the PC's. Cos of huge amount of Z's , specially the exploding crawlers youre base will be destroyed in Legend , not cos they attack the base , just cos they die and ...explode . The buildings have same HP like in normal difficulty, traps have same dmg  , same in anyway, just the Z's hit harder , have greater HP,  move faster and take less dmg. On the other hand , they added the possibility to craft Stone /Metal/ Oil extracting machine...which they are kinda useless . First of all they cost A LOT (250 / 500 / 1000), after that you need maintenance Kit + fuel to make them run , Oil machine cost 3 maintenance Kit and you'll get ...1 oil :D
So..issue here are multiple , first its that you cant research this when YOU NEED them ,cos of cost (first you need to research worker , backpack , tree /stone/iron dmg , Z's dmg , Animal dmg , skill speed and till you'll research this , you wont need none of the machine , you're base will be full metal
Also its an issue with Z's pathing when you use bait.

It is not butter smooth like a AAA console or PC game, but it's got less bugs than 3 of the last $50+ games I bought on Steam, and two of those were NOT early access games. 

TLDR: Base building. Surviving hordes. Hostile animals, Exploring cities, houses, buildings for supplies and cool clothing. Upgrading weapons and abilities. Saving up enough ammo to shoot your way out if you choose to ""end"" it. It's worth the money.

The game itself has an ending already. A story, vague though it is, with an ending. It also can be played as a never ending battle against increasingly difficult hordes. 

The devs update this game regularly, and respond to bug reports. I know because I posted one. They had a solution for me within a week. There are two devs total as far as I know. Games with entire teams of devs don't have that kind of response time and attention to the player base.

It's way more than I expected, I really liked the game because of many things.. (normal difficulty) 
1- Zombies' attacking range is realistic, also when the zombie is about to hit you, you can actually dodge their attacks.
2- Zombies' speed is perfect, we can run much faster than them and if you keep running away they let you go not too aggressive to keep following you. 
3- So many places to explore and the cities designs are wow, I was so impressed not all buildings look the same noo they're different.
4- You don't need to worry about weapons and tools durability, it's one of the best things about this game, unlimited durability <3. 
5- Stamina is amazing unlike ""Scum"". 
6- Crafting system is very simple. 
7- Zombie's damage is not like getting punched by Mike Tyson. No, it won't deal much damage so it's kinda realistic.
8- So many different kinds of zombies.
9- Normal size map and most importantly it's not empty, there are so many things on it so you won't feel bored exploring it. 
10- There are about 10 different animals + birds and hunting is very important to upgrade your weapons and tools. 
11- Many skills to unlock and upgrade. 

Now let's talk about bad things. 
1- FPS drops when I get into the hospital because it's a very large building with a lot of things inside it. 
2- I had a glitch where I can get unlimited resources from a chest. 
3- Fall damage is too much
4- You can't jump over low things like foundations and fences. Making us able to climb over things would make the game much better. 

That's it. So for a new game it's almost perfect and worth the price. So if you're reading this just shut up and give them your money xD",1605186893,1605289557,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game runs poorly (and I mean, POORLY) and looks worse than other better looking survival, open world games. The combat is clunky; you're simply backpedaling and fishing for the zombie to swing and miss. You then throw out a single attack because the game is ""early access"" so they haven't implemented a melee system that allows you to fluidly attack the enemy. There's no defense or dodging mechanism, you're just holding down to move backwards. I'd be embarrassed to charge people money for a game where it would take less than a day to implement a simple blocking mechanic or even think this combat system is good enough to pass the planning phase. AI pathing is also horrible and looks rigid.

Game has a huge lack of direction and any motivation to do anything. There are no fun mechanics.

The game shows a lot of promise, especially for an early access title. The level of detail in certain areas of this game is astounding, especially in places like the convenience marts and the laundromat. And while almost all survival zombie games have a tendency to copy/paste when it comes to structure designs and floor plans, this title minimizes that tendency enough that locations still feel refreshing and new. Houses in this game often feel like they have similar floor plans because they are part of a townhouse/neighborhood unit, not because the developer designed 1-2 floor plans and then just copied those all over the map. My partner and I just went exploring in an area we had never been in, and we found two new house designs that we had not seen before. In addition, the crafting/research system shows a great deal of promise, and in general, feels rewarding. There are certainly improvements to the game that I would like to see over time (character creation for multiplayer maps, etc.), but these are not aspects that I expect in the early access stage.",1605156977,1605156977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'll forgive them for things I'd never accept from a AAA design studio, and with good reason.  It takes so much guts to be an indie designer, to go out there with nothing but passion and a dream and make something that other people are happy to spend hours of their life playing.  

Night of the Dead is very much a work in progress, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. But, every masterpiece has to start off with a rough draft to begin with before you can polish it up. And that's what we're lucky enough to have the opportunity to play here: A diamond in the rough.

I have been looking for a game like this for a long time, and I'm thrilled to know that someone is building one. Oh, it'll probably be years before it's completed, but that's okay. It's fun now, and it's going to be amazing when they're done with it.  

The part I find most interesting is that while it's designed as a multi-player tower defense game, they've also included a single-player version that somehow manages to be one of the most entertaining crafting-based survival games I've ever had the privilege of playing.  If the multi-player is half as fun as the single-player, then they've got a really solid core for a good game.  

I'm not even going to go into the bad parts. There are parts that need work, but they already know that. So, let me just focus on the positive parts.  

The crafting system is amazing, it's so complicated that when I first looked at it I was so confused and overwhelmed I didn't know where to start. But, the game walks you through it, and in no time at all you're building huge mazes of zombie-crushing traps and giggling like a lunatic as you watch an entire horde reduced to foul-smelling spagetti paste. And let me say... I hate traps in most games. I'm very much a hands-on zombie slayer. I never use bombs, traps, grenades, anything like that. I like to snipe things from afar, or zerg rush 'em. But, this game makes traps fun. 

The map is HUGE.  When I went into this, I was expecting the map to be tiny based off a couple of other reviews, but I have to assume those were based on an earlier version.  I've barely found one of the edges so far, and there's a whole FREAKING CITY down there that I haven't even touched yet. 

There are options for different play styles. I hear the multi-player is great, but there's also a solid amount of content for loners like me who prefer single-player.  Want something action-packed? Pick a higher difficulty level and leave the zombie waves switched on - the game will get gradually harder and harder until you get overwhelmed.  Prefer a more peaceful stroll to explore the map?  No problem!  In the last patch, they added the ability to turn off the zombie waves so you can explore and build without being randomly annoyed by grumpy zombies.  

Now, a couple of small warnings if you are the squeamish sort, like me. There is a fairly realistic hunting system, in which you have to shoot or trap birds and wild animals to improve your weapons and supplies, and also for food. It's integral to the gameplay, so there's no avoiding it. There are noises that are pretty upsetting, and you have to craft using the skins, bone, and guts of the animals. I mean, it's all pretty cartoonish so it's not super disturbing, but it did freak me out a bit to start with.  Also, some of the female zombies SCREAM SUPER LOUD when they die, which gave me an unpleasant fright on a few occasions. So, consider yourself warned!

Overall, though?  Stellar game, and it's only going to get better. Well worth the price.  Don't believe me?  I've got a pre-ordered copy of Cyberpunk 2077 coming any day now, and there's a good chance I might leave it a while longer to play this. And I'm super excited about Cyberpunk 2077, so that's high praise!  

Oh, and on the off chance the devs read this... guys, you are doing an amazing job.  You should be proud of yourselves.  Well done!",1605076979,1605076979,True,97,2,0.871497750282287598,0,True,False,True

I love the tower defense feel to it and the danger feeling that the zombies can come at you anytime from anywhere while being busy building your base. It reminded me of a old game back in 2009 called ''Fort Zombie''. I personally think the best part of this game is how creative it allows us to be. We can go build our base at a mansion, at a police station, out of in the woods, on some hill and even out on some suburb of the houses you can pick from. A lot of cool traps, foods, weapons and a lot more. The exploration is fun too, places to clear out zombies to get cool weapons and supplies.

As days goes by, every 2 in-game hour long of horde defeated, it does get harder by more bosses and zombies count and more traps that needs to be built to defeat each progressing horde. My suggestion is to turn your base into a endless loop horde trap by using the trap doors and it's a lot of fun to watch the zombies fall into the trap door to go back from square one and using the zombie bait helps this a lot.

My request to the developer is if it's possible by adding a military base, a mall and a gun store in the town to find more weapons like an Uzi, shotguns and as a new trap to build a stationary or turret 50.cal machine gun to use against the zombies to defend our base during the horde hours.

Pro's
Bugs - we all like to make the most of those bugs!
Great maps, good detail
Great selection of items to collect and craft
Good/Interesting to explore building (schools, warehouses, mansions, factories) and build on existing buildings
Some good detail in the odd house, hope to see more
Really good to play with friends
Time ""speed"" good
Story basic, but really its about survival
Good selection of animals, they are not as realistic as zombies
No annoying humans, so feels isolated/lonely as it should.
Does have a sense the once an area has been explored resources have gone like real life, I leave doors open so show I have been there.

Cons
Bugs - early release so expected, can loose built items or shoot invisible walls
Need some Zombie children in the school.
Zombie behaviour/path could do with optimising
High GPU usage, resulting in good spec graphics card needed (which should be the case really)
Inside of most buildings quite generic
Normal/Easy is too hard to start with, I started on peaceful, then when I got he hang of it had to quit and restart loosing all my progress.",1604485029,1604485029,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Surprisingly polished for an early access title. Wish it becomes as popular as 7DTD or even better. One of the best tower defence mechanics and survival aspects.
Current level of content is satisfactory by alpha standards but definitely needs much more additions to the game & game-play in general at full release (maybe even RPG elements? But that's just my interest, can be anything good).

Definitely recommended! Please support the devs by purchasing the early access version of the game. It's even fairly priced at the time of writing this. Really hope it makes it out of early access ASAP.

PS: Probably not the most popular feature for most but I must say the main character design is brilliant, gorgeous, Lara Croft level good! I'm glad it's a third person game (surprising lack of it in this genre). Need more costumes in loot for her!

1377380,78568872,76561198090814161,0,6,1191,0,445,1630630056,"Anyone ever heard of Fortnite's SAVE THE WORLD PvE mode that has become the unwanted stepchild of Epic Games? This game is pretty much that; with a more ""realistic"" look and feel, and slightly worse base-building mechanics.

Given that this is still a playable Alpha build, I should be somewhat understanding, but considering the buy-in fee to play doesn't grant the player any minor little bonuses for effectively being a Founder and Alpha/Beta Tester, it's only fair to be a bit harsh.

Pros:
+ The premise of literally surviving and building your refuge in a post-apocalyptic setting is a fresh one.
+ Effectively start with nothing, then have to begin gathering and building.
+ Limited item storage; one will have to build out storage caches along their journey to either drop off excess materials or stock up on stored resources, such as ammo or building materials.
+ Night of the Dead has three neat base-building features that are better than Fortnite's StW base-building. One can easily adjust placement heights, turn on/off part snapping which allows for staggered base building if so desired, and more granular control of building angles.
+ Traps and base defenses don't wear themselves out like StW's and require replacement; but they do require that they be kept topped up on ammo.
+ One gigantic map to build multiple strongholds around.

Cons:
- Weapons feel kind of useless, even when fully upgraded and further augmented by your own skill upgrades. You're better off just building a ballista and lugging a bunch of ballista bolts to keep the weapon fed and just drawing zombies to it.
- Base building needs more refinement. Building stairs and multistory buildings is needlessly tedious, and could take a page from Fortnite Save the World's in allowing for quarter, half, and 3-quarter floors and simplifying stair construction in any direction.
- In addition to the above, wall building could also take a page from Save the World and allow for more flexibility in door placement, window placement, and the option for quarter and half-walls.
- It's an Alpha, but it still has to be said; there is a distinct lack of weapons and defensive emplacement options.
- Flamethrower towers are kind of useless; they can and WILL set your wood base on fire if you didn't upgrade them one piece at a time, and zombies in flame don't really die any faster; the burning DoT is pretty weak.
- It's an Alpha, but again, has to be said; plot is near non-existent, and what little there is to work with is kind of tough to focus on discovering when you're being harassed by zombies while you just tickle them to death with your weapons.
- Inventory management needs to be improved. Sorting should not only organize your inventory, but shrink the stacks as much as possible instead of just setting the same item next to each other taking up 3 slots when 2 of them could be combined to free up 1 slot.
- Vehicles should be completely harvestable; first ""Break Down"" to salvage basic mats, then taking the hammer to it to completely dismantle the car for rarer/more exotic mats like battery, gears, circuit boards, etc. It would also help a lot in cleaning up potential base building sites and setting up a better defense.
- There is no real sprint ability. Considering there is a stamina bar, it should have more of a role other than just reducing your attack if not recovered with food. Let sprinting slowly reduce the stamina bar.
- In addition to the above, it would be helpful if players could later salvage and make a simple bike, skateboard, or even a little moped to scoot around the map faster.

All in all, I really cannot recommend this game to anyone in its current state. It needs more time to be polished.",1604288875,1604288875,False,0,0,0.486111104488372803,0,True,False,True

1st life - Spawn in, army of zombies attacking me at spawn.  Manage to run away and lead them on the other side of a mountain before they massacre me.  ( I thought I would be safe on a cliff wall but they got me there )

These were all kinds of zombies, big ones, small ones, green and yellow ones, spider ones with yellow bump on them, as far as I could see when looking back to check if they followed me.

2nd life - Spawn at the same location.  Good, zombies are gone.  I walk for a minute and the army is back with a vengeance.  I run far longer than the first time, see a river and think ""Yay, zombies cant swim right?"".  Well it seems George Romero was right...they walk at the bottom while you swim and kill you when you try to surface on the other side.

3rd life - No zombies at spawn ( always the same spawn location ).  Can't fool me thrice.   I start running, find another river, larger than the first one and manage to jump and cross halfway before I see the army on the cliffs near the beach.  None seem to follow me in.  I yell ""Victory!"" very silently so as to not aggro any zombies.  A nagging feeling at the back of my head (call it a spidy-sense if you will) thinks ""They didn't jump in, but I saw them running along the cliffs in the general cardinal direction I was heading..what if.."" and BAM, same army of the dead, spider zombies and tall freaky green and yellow ones and whatnot appears in front of me.  This time I took my knife out and figured I might as well figure out how well you can kill Zs with a knife.  It turns out, not that great really..

10/10 devs for finding the mythical cure to all the pathing problems in every games I have ever played for the past 30 some years!

*I red other discussions where they could build in multiplayer and I can see in the screenshots a player next to a treb.  Figures there must be a way to safely ditch the army or not spawn it altogether.  Will try another server.

So in short, YES. This is a fun game - so the rest of this review will explore how it could be better.

1. Character creation & customization - this is a pretty obvious one.
2. Weapon customization: upgrades are cool - but different attack types based on upgrades, graphical changes, or even composite weapon would add to the flavor.
3. Trap upgrades: would be nice to upgrade traps, and give different looks.
4. Repairing: I find it annoying to run around guessing what items need to be repaired. It would be better to have a repair item that you equip, and when it's equipped, you can see what needs to be repaired.
5. Armor: Clothes are cool, but what's the point without a description if it provides more armor, and that you can't upgrade the items?
6. Armor & weapons: can't break them down, so you wind up with boxes of useless weapons.
7. AI: Ok, so this is the big one. I find the zombies WAY too easy to kill. I can walk straight up to almost any zombie, and they don't even attack me. Additionally, I am on night 15, and they can't get past the first 3 traps I've build (Flame/floor spike & compressor) until the 2am wave. And even then, they still don't even reach me. This makes the challenge level meh at best. I also find that zombies will run to/from me constantly during my night waves, just getting bashed over and over by the traps. So in short, the AI is really lacking.
8. Zombie diversity: so we got a fire zombie...but that's it? Different attacks would be great to make the waves more challenging.
9. Other humans: While the world is exciting, after a dozen nights, it gets a little boring being completely alone.
10: Zombie hordes: see below :)

In short, NotD should take some pointers from Days Gone on the PS4. In that game you ACTUALLY feel like zombies are AFTER you. Individually AND in hordes. It's bananas; like you have a homing beacon on you -  and a ton of fun. Days Gone was missing the building aspect, but it also had a story.

If you are looking for a complete zombie survival experience, don't look here. It isn't ready yet. Although, what we do have is a great start. 

Idk about the rest of you, but I bought this looking to shake things up a little from 7DTD. This game felt like it was trying to do the things that 7DTD did wrong or didn't do at all. And in that I suppose it succeeds. Its much more focused on tower defence and automation. On day one, within like 20 minutes you can easily attain automated turrets and traps. Where 7DTD might say, ""do your best to stay alive out there,"" Night of the Dead says, ""Come on boy, lets annihilate this fuckin zombie horde!"" While these aspects are great and much more action packed, there are some things that are so bad that it is hard not to mention.

Now while I am about to state (in my opinion) the worst parts of this game, it is difficult to criticize a game this immature. I am certain almost nothing in this game is complete enough to not be updated and changed in the future. So please consider my complaints only for the game's current version. 

The combat in this game is ATROCIOUS. It plays like a third person hack and slash, but there is no blocking or dodging. Its literally just swinging and hoping that your hit lands first and can stun the zombie out of their swing. For this reason, most of the time its just best to fight with the pocket knife that I started out with. I can at least swing that thing fast enough to stun lock my target and avoid being hit. This brings me to another major issue. There is no experience or leveling of any kind. Because of this, there is no reason to kill zombies. If I see a group of them wandering around, it makes more sense just to go around them and save the time and health that it would cost to fight them. And that feels wrong in a zombie survival tower defence game. The last complaint that I will give for this game is about the behavior of the zombies. They do not behave like zombies. Yes they look great, and the sound effects are awesome, and I love that there are different kinds, such as: the butcher zombie that throws cleavers at me, the bigger guy that stomps and throws me to the ground, the behemoth blood-covered white naked bald zombie that charges at me after I've already shot him in the face like 15 times, and the horrific giant zombie spider thing that I saw from a distance and immediately turned and ran away like a coward. Where was i going with this? Oh right, the issue is in the behavior of the zombies. Before they notice you, you will see them decide to jog in one direction, then stop for a minute, turn and jog in a different direction. Then when the notice you, they'll do a terrifying shriek and run at you, after they get hit they'll jog away, turn back toward you, let out another shriek, than run back to you and attack. It just seems very...odd for a zombie. 

I am giving this game a positive review for what they are doing right. It is on its way to becoming an awesome action packed open world 3rd person zombie apocalypse tower defence game. The concept is awesome, but the game itself is very very infantile. Purchase if you want to support its development and believe in its future, but NOT if you are looking for a complete game.",1603193099,1603193099,True,2,0,0.500278949737548828,0,True,False,True

3. We can build our base everywhere, all about our creativity to defend our base
4. Graphics is good enough for played

My suggestion :
1. Fix Build placement soon, little bit annoying
2. If possible, add some vehicels to craft, like bicycle or motorcycle or even a skateboard to cut time when we must walk far from base to gather resouces..

One thing I have noticed over the past hour of gameplay is the increased demands it is making on my system. GPU is maxed out at 99% utilization. Even at medium settings. I have a moderately nice build (AMD 5600 & Radeon 5600xt) and can play PUBG on high settings and only reach 65% (give or take a few). Game could use some optimization for running. 

***EDIT*** 
Game seems unplayable at the moment. Game stutters every 5 to 10 degrees of camera rotation. Ill come back after a few weeks worth of bug fixes. 

***edit #2*** 
Enjoying the game. Really had to tweak my router settings to cut down the bufferbloat. The game still stutters for me at times, but is manageable now. Still think it could use some refinement for online connections. Looking forward to seeing the dedicated servers.

It has some issues, but it is still in early acces. I am recommeding this game even in this stage. 
It's a steal at this price (21 € or equivalent in your currency).

Stats:
22.8 hours in the moment of my review. 8 or 9 nights in the game.
Around 20 hours playing in co-op mode with my brother.

GPU: Radeon RX580 sapphire Nitro+, 8GB
CPU: is I7-4770 @ 3.40GHz.
RAM: 16 GB

Good things:  
So much fun! You can always do something, explore more, build more, approach defense from the different angles, gather resources via looting or chopping woods and so on.
Lately we have developed 'mobile strategy' in which we defend waves via open terrain and alot of static defenses upon which we lure zombies while we run from them. It works much better for us since the fire zombies arrived few nights ago. The main base is the one with the most traps, but we only use it once there are no more fire/bomb zombies. Because they burn the base easily.
Considering tactics while looting, if you play it coop I recommend that one is up front with some melee weapon and the other one is shooting from behind with the bow, crossbow or sth like that. Of course, we often switch it up, or just go with the new cool weapon we found and so on. 
I also recommend turning on the friendly fire. It adds up on fun.
Spoiler alert: [spoiler]you can end game via radio technology and save yourselve from the island. [/spoiler] That is a welcome difference in survival games. 

Game is also tense because you have a goal: to survive each more and more terryfing night, one after another. And all the actions are motivated and oriented towards those few intense moments during night. 

You can also have fun in the way the defense structures kill zombies. It's really funny to see how the head of a really tough zombie flies off in the air after he is stuck on your deviously planned trap(s). 
The danger comes both from zombies and wildlife. But as you are getting stronger wildlife will become more of a resource thing and random scarce rather then being the real danger.  

I think that the developers are getting the balance just right.
And I hope that the balance will stay more or less the same. For example: I like the fact that food is a reward and not punishment. If you eat good food you can get temporary bonues (and heal yourself, of course). But the food is not rare and you don't have to focus on it too much.

I like that you have a vast map to explore. Buildings, roads, woods, mountains, random houses and even the city!
I hope that in the future we will have more maps. 
I like looting and the danger vs reward system. Also terrain is really nice. It doesn't repeat it self and it looks realistic. 

Reasearch: OMG! So much reasearch! Remember to scroll down at the reasearch table not just scroll right like I did :D Yup, I failed to develop crucial stuff up until much later. 
And we have even more research: every crafting bench can be upgraded, also every weapon... The list goes on and on!

Things that can be done easily better:
Quality of life things. 
Please add the possibility that you can pin 'recipe' for the building that you are trying to build at the moment. 
In my opinion it is not fun to look again and again what exact parts I need in order to build it.  

Resources: oil, copper, ammo problems are easily adjusted in the balance. Right now it is hard to support flamethrowers and high tech stuff. But that is ok, since they are extremely effective. 
Maybe it is not a good thing, but consider adding some high tech thingies that can develop oil/fuel. Also maybe that you can develop some mining technology (cooper, iron). 

Bad things:
Constant crashing of the game. I am talking about coop mode. And I know, I know, this is early access game. And I know that the devs will fix it. But still, this is a fair warning to newcomers.
My GPU (Radeon RX580 sapphire Nitro+, 8GB) is almost always at 100%. With that GPU I've played Far Cry 5 on 2K resolution on high settings for example.
To be exact, most of the crashing happend while the trebuche explosion of fire zombie explosion was happening near me (host of the game). I was thinking that my GPU is dying on me. But other games work fine.

I've updated the drivers. 
In this game I even put everything on low settings. I had 2K resolution. After awhile I put it on 1080p. And after that even one notch lower than that. After that my GPU is still at 100% most of the time, but now the game is not crashing. 

If developers want more details about the issues feel free to contact me. I would be glad to help make this great game even better. 

SUMMARY
I don't usually play games like this, but this one is so good. Developers (only two guys!) knocked it out of the park! I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Especially in the co-op mode. 
If the only bad thing about the game is optimization, and that game is still in early acces, I think that is the highest praise you can get. 
jacktostudios is a name to remember and I am sure they will continue to develop this game at this level until it is finished.

- Glitchs only 1 made the game crash 
but tons of glitches none the less zombies in walls floors ect

- If i wasnt so bored i could have basically took the whole Skill tree and i pretty much took it all  except for cooking cus i looked at that stuff and it just had zero potential by day 10

- The building system isnt that great if you want a tip since Grounded is out and they are a game like this with bug and no horny zombies check out their building system. Having to keep going back and forth from chest to whatever building station is freaking annoying and tiring. If i had my way id say if its in my chest then its ready to be made presto u do the work not me.

- My first attempt i knew it wasnt gonna last hardly any first run on any game is above par however on the second run it was just cake 

- The M4 and the Spear are really the only weapon needed for this game since the Box frames for zombies and animals are so jacked i tried using a sword and it was so freaking stupid i had to kiss the fucking zombie just to hit it and thats a tad to close for me and well the reach of a katana nuff said.

- The Quest areas need special boss's Jail needs a Hero Zombie Jailer, Police Station a Huge as shit zombie Thug ect

- Hp bars on zombies option would be nice

- Mining was stupid cus you hit it a part breaks off and now ur wiffin on nothing and gotta move fix that 

- I think i ended up with like a million cloth but unless i felt like cutting down a million trees they are useless 

- Section off the map i dont care how you do it maybe 4 sections but i had it all on low and i could still feel and see chop. I play much more intense games and get none of that so should prolly wanna look into something to fix that instead of a huge map with lots of crap on it. Since a shit ton of it is just trees rocks water and animals.

- It gets boring really fast so If you need to put in like a build your own daily quest machine and or a leveling system or whatever do something if you want this to be more than a 1 minute man in the sac kinda game.

 the list goes on and on and im not going to go into it

Survival is about the closest it gets to a challenge without just getting over ran before you can build fast enough.  Normal mode is very close to realistic ideas of what it would take to bring a zombie down.

To add to the disappointment, gear progression is pretty absurd. When you max out your blacksmith rank you can make a freaking lightsaber. I'm all for a bit of fun but it completely breaks what little there is to keep the game in a somber tone.

Base design ideas are plentiful and resources require you to hunt longer distances to find what you need. You can hunt animals to survive or add traps around your base and just wait for them to get caught. The end game is to escape the island which is an additional quality you can strive for or just stay on the island to outwit and fight.

Obviously still early days and you can tell, building is a little janky and the birds fly pretty funky but on the whole the game is in great shape.

My only vice is some of the upgrading is pretty convoluted and needlessly time consuming but to be honest for a game this early in it's life there's not much more negative that can be said, textures and lighting are lovely, murdering undead hordes is satisfying and the exploration is rewarding.

We're really enjoying it so far and have a laundry list of edits, suggestions, and frustrations with the game. However, it is simply a fun game. Not only is it challenging enough to get the heart racing with the S**t hits the fan, but it also has a since of relaxation that isn't present in other zombie/survival base-builders. There is a fine line that the devs have drawn here and we're loving it. 

Note to devs* The fall damage that players receive seems unforgiving, can this be reduced or apply the same fall damage to non-special zombies?

Pros: detailed crafting, trapping, and development system, and I like the environment and game play.

Cons: The building system needs some work on the ability to snap and align base parts.  Have started a base with raised foundations and trying to get each section and the stairs aligned and even is not as easy as it should be and then to remove and try again takes a lot of hits, bringing me to my next beef with this game; please increase the size of the strike zone on trees, bushes, and z's.  You spend so much of the early game in the dark trying to avoid herds that come out of nowhere and then it you are swinging away trying to take down a tree and missing what seems right in front of you.

Lastly, I have no light source yet and basic storage is not necessarily an early build - more than half the 24 day is dark so I am just sitting there unable to do much of anything.   Either shorten the night, or speed up the time a bit when its dark.  I imagine once someone has some basic protection, the time can be spent crafting and researching etc but on Day 3 and I am just sitting in a protected spot doing nothing for a long time.

I'm a huge 7DTD fan and have played most of the  survival games out there - this has a lot of potential if they can make a few tweaks.",1601992146,1601992146,True,3,1,0.54162973165512085,0,True,False,True

Great audio work haunts the corpse riddled vomit retching rotting landscapes of NIGHT OF THE DEAD with heart pounding placement such as the  natural sounds of the environment playing during most of the day but once a wave appears menacing music starts up with purified all consuming evil. Zombie howls and growls are hair raising mind jarring electrifying in their guttural inhuman tones along with their very rewarding death screams as the player takes them down. 

The user interface is fantastic making it incredibly miraculously easy to know what to collect and how to craft it where am making traps, building walls, doors, light structures, crafting tables etc with no problems or frustration on what to do while still having a excellent intricate crafting system which is complimented by a great skill tree with tons of things one can research by using research papers one discovers on their travels in this death drenched corpse rotting world. Truly one of the best crafting/building ui systems i have ever seen.

Am building a house now which is something i hardly ever do in these games with the exception of FALLOUT 4 and THE FOREST thanks to the excellent intuitive user interface.

NIGHT OF THE DEAD flows with plenty of commonsense loot and item placement as am not expected to craft things which should already exist in the world like a assault rifle which i came across while exploring. I found it in a logical area without feeling like i was searching for the ark of the covenant.  In other survival games i would have been expected to build a assault rifle myself as if i had magically obtained a masters degree at engineering.

Gathering resources and hunting for food is a real joy. Its a great feeling to take down a raging bear with a bow or assault rifle after running into it in the past and getting butchered. 

I love the upgrade system where i can make improved versions of the various crafting tables which handle different aspects of building along with many upgrades for my home which become available the more i improve my crafting stations.

Dying in the game is also done in a very gamer quality of life friendly manner as my character will respawn at a revive location where i put my sleeping bag or bed at. All the loot i had gathered will not be lost as it will be waiting for me at the same spot i had just died. Definitely a protection against frustration and a relief when it comes to being a time saver. 

Flesh eating psychotic zombies are not the only dangers in NIGHT OF THE DEAD. One still has to deal with the perils which were around before this plague of the undead occurred such as ravenous wolves, crazed bears etc.

Graphics drip with rich deep gore oozing with nauseating putrid visages and corpse rotting vessels of stalking death. Lighting is very well done exuding a creepy malevolence as i step away from the light of the outside into a darkly grey gloomy house where i could run into some shambling flesh hungry abomination wishing to rip the skin and muscle apart like elastic red bubblegum with its maggot crawling cadaverous teeth.  

World design looks and feels very natural as i explore taking my cautious time while keeping an eye on the time of the day lest i stray for too long before retreating to the safety of my fortified sanctuary which one has the choice of building completely from the ground up or cleaning out a abandoned house to make it their new home adding in new improvements and defenses galore. I chose for my first play through a house already in the world as i learn to craft things like traps and basics such as furniture, farming etc.

Game play is very well paced with different difficulty levels such as ""Peaceful"" which is great for learning the game world while still feeling threatened by zombies yet not impossibly overwhelmed which happens so many times in survival games. 

There has also been added the option to turn off night time horde waves which is fantastic especially for us George Romero zombie fans who prefer a more slower paced ""realistic"" setting. Now i can play in Normal Mode without any worries of being totally annihilated from horde waves at night. 

This all came about from some well thought out and respectfully expressed input from the community to the very professional great Developers who listen to what their customer and fan base have to say. Cheers to the Devs for being so cool.

The timing of nights and days are very well balanced. The activities are numerous from hunting, farming, building, looting, the main quest and obviously zombie killing! The tower defense part is fun, but could be improved from a building/IA point of view. Don't expect yourself to build something exactly as you wish, you'll have to deal with the constraints of couple building bugs. The IA is quite dumb, and once figured out, the zombies waves become even more manageable. 
I would advise to start a game in normal to get used to the dynamic and optimization that you need to put in place early on. Once understood, start your gaming experience in hard or above to get a bit challenged! 
The end of the main quest is a bit disappointed, I would have loved some kind of big final animation or story ending. 

As a final note, you'll have fun in solo, it will be more than that with multiple players! Count roughly 20 hours in normal mode to finish the game. And the higher the level you set it up to, the more hours requested!

It's fun
It allows for creative base design
It's decently content complete for an open world game
Good immersion
Some fights get really intense

A moderate amount of bugs (Early Access, so no surprise here)
The sounds aren't great
Interiors need more variety
Zombie pathing needs a LOT of work
Needs to be an easier way of sorting/storing inventory

If you like base-building and/or Tower Defense games this is worth a buy. I'm having a really good time with it.

The Bow play is v-good, very smooth, practice getting those headshots!, there is no sway or holding your breath for a steadier shot, its just pure mouse aim,  i like the way your arrows or crossbow bolts stay in the environment, like in trees,wall etc, and can be recollected.You may see in the videos the top right corner a skull crossbones, this is a timer to when a horde will attack, the increase in days survived means the bigger the hordes are for the next nights attack.
Research Material is the upgrade currency here, you can find research material from killing zombies or scavenging. early game i reccomnend scavenging for research material, until you have enough for a a bow.
Hunting is good with a bow, there are many different types of animals, from Rabbits,Foxes,Deer,Stags,Pigs,Boars,Ravens,Sparrows,Owls,Pigeons,Ducks,Eagles, Bears..etc... it is important to hunt these as their bones and skin/feathers are required in the upgrading of weapons and tools..you not only can hunt them with your bow, you can also set traps for them.

I for one, can't get enough of zombie shooters, and for the price, this game does deliver, grinding for resources during the day, and building a brutal ninja warrior death course for the zombies at night, all the while avoiding or clearing out building of stumbling zombies, breaking down cars and other objects for resources, chopping down trees, bushes, mining rocks, hunting, but its not too tedious, like one similar zombie game has become, the game keeps it simple, not too rooted in realism but close enough to be fun, I mean there is a lightsaber . . . . For the current price, I say the game is well worth the price,

That all said, I feel like it wouldn't be a complete review if it focused only on the pros or only on the cons, the pros finished, the cons are . . . 

Well, my main gripe is resources, all though you can do a fair bit, build a good size base, big enough to survive in and finish the game, yes the game does seem to have a end goal, but what about those of us who'd like to see how long they can last, how many days, waves of zombies can they survive, what if we don't want to escape, what if we want to carve a life for our digital survivor, given how the resources work in this game, if you'd like to have at it, carving away a zombie defending life, your going to eat up resources near close and far from your base fast, to the point where you won't have enough time to build, sure you can cook up food to give you more stamina to run further longer for those resources, but that's still going to take a lot of time, for little gain, traps and weapons take up resources that you will run out of, forcing you to make far trips just to be able to reload this or that,
I really hope in future patches, the devs add things like mine shafts, even if its only a few pacific spots on the map, where ore re-spawns endlessly, or on a timer or simply adds a system where resources like wood, stone and metal nodes re-spawns outside of player built structures, as it stands every one will hit a point where the time it takes to gather resources will outweigh the effect of gathering it, that you'll simply be going out to gather enough to reload your base traps,

other issues, is game difficulty, at normal, if your any good at shooters and figuring out the AI, the game is fairly easy, just a little too easy, go up to hard mode and from what I can tell, zombie's health is doubled, or your damage is less, which I think is a bit too much, so there is some balancing issues there I feel,

Lastly, I come back to gameplay where you want to just last as long as you can, currently there is no reward for hanging on past what's needed to collect the end game goal, it would be really neat and rewarding if in later days zombie hordes, zombie bosses dropped unique resources and or items, pieces of weapons, pieces of traps that can only be obtained by killing these bosses, genetic sample to create some kind of zombie poison gun or trap, maybe the boss zombie has a broken rocket launcher, get enough pieces and you can build one, or even some bosses have pieces to build a new crafting bench or even next tier base upgrades,

Ideas for possible future features,
More farming, would be nice to capture animals, like cows to milk, sheep for fur, more plant grow types, like trees if re-spawning trees never happens, really just more ways to gather resources at base instead of having to go further and further away from your base to gain, at the cost of fewer resources and more time.

This game has the making of the next best zombie base building game, if only the dev has the will, time and of course money, some shy from early access games, for good reason, many are just cash grabs, enough to call a game but never adds content, taking their money and running, this dev does seem to update the game, and is actively working on it, hope to see them continue to do so, and much much more content, more things to craft, more things to shoot, more.

The good:
Base building is fairly easy (when you can get the blueprint to fit EXACTLY in the right spot)
Upgrade materials do not seem to be difficult to find once you know how to get them (except copper ore)
Traps are a lot of fun to build together (when you can get them to fit correctly)
Exploration is fun, and a little dangerous, until you have a good crossbow and baseball bat
The world itself is nicely laid out, a bit small, but that could change?
Nice variety of zombies, animals, and structures in the game. I don't feel like ""oh, I have seen this room before"" every time I go into a building. There are some repeated models, but that is to be expected.

The not so good:
Zombie pathing - if they do not have a crystal-clear shot directly to you, they will destroy anything you have built. This can make planning an elaborate set of traps frustrating because they will just tear through the walls rather than follow the path you laid out.

Lack of resources - once you get later into the game (post day 20), oil becomes increasingly hard to find (if you are using multiple flame throwers). Copper ore can be hard to find if you do not go out quite far from your base and hunt for it. It does add to the excitement, but getting jumped by a wolf, a bear, and 8 zombies out in the middle of the forest with no way to know where you died is not fun.

No death marker - when you die, you drop all your inventory, except for your equipped weapon.  If you were out exploring and did not look at the map before you died, you lost your inventory, Start over. 

No way to increase trap damage. Every night the horde gets bigger AND stronger, so you need more traps. Since you have no way of improving your traps, you just have to create more and link them together and hope the horde runs through them rather than tear them apart. I have started building on the roof of buildings and it seems to work fine. The zombies cannot destroy the walls or floors, so you have a better chance of forcing their pathing through your traps. It is not fool-proof, but it does tend to work for me. I have seen other people build mammoth bases in the middle of the forest, so it is not impossible, just can be problematic for people starting out.

Traps run out of ammunition - this would not be too big of a problem if some of them were not set so low. Compressor and guillotine have very few charges while others have 100. That means you have to physically run to that trap and add ammunition to it. In the middle of a day 20+ horde, depending on your layout, that may not be possible. So you tend to start using only the high ammunition traps and ignore the others because they are resource intensive.  This can limit your base style or location. 

Wishlist:
Other people/Interactions- you are alone in the world. I would like some type of interaction with others, whether it is random radio contacts, left behind messages, something to make you feel like part of the world and have purpose. 

Inventory stacks of more than 99 for all materials in storage - for the love of God, please make this happen for all items. Let us use research documents and unlock it, but I have an entire chest full of ""pieces of iron ore"" and ""piece of cloth"" and ""cloth"". I still need more than one chest just for all the items and craftables in the game (currently at 10 chests and they are almost all full).

Better snap placement for the blueprints. I have to fiddle with the up and down, left, right, back up, get the camera just right, in order for the piece to place. Also, the foundation pieces will sometimes ""auto-fit"" a half-space off and leave a gap. When you try to place a trap door or other item that is exactly one floor tile in width, it will not attach. I would be much easier to build if  we had at least two tiles of snap placement from one foundation/floor rather than having to build a brand new foundation/floor for every tile. Currently, I think only the bridge will snap on without an anchor piece. Maybe allow short fences on bridges?

Weather - would love rain/snow, and more ambient noise. It does make it easier to hear ducks, but it is very quiet overall.

Character creation/selection for single player game - currently only the woman is available in single-player mode, but you can go to multiplayer and host your own single player game to play as one of the male characters. You cannot [spoiler] find any new clothes in the multi-player game, or at least I haven't and I have ransacked the hospital, subway, and every house between the north and south. [/spoiler]

Final Impression:
It is important to remember that the goal of this game is to escape the island. I am not sure how many people are actually playing to escape, because: [spoiler]you can do that on day 4 or 5 if you really hustled and be done with the game in a few hours. I had all the research and items done on my second play through by day 10 and that was with building an elaborate, completely useless, wooden scaffolding system around a building. [/spoiler] . Almost everyone I know is playing the game like an endurance mode to see how many days they can survive which creates many of the ""issues"" within the game.

Overall, this game is awesome and well worth the $25.00 you can pay now to play it. It is fun, and you can build whatever and wherever you want. I just built a bridge into the top of the water cooler towers for a nuclear reactor. I have a nice trap door at the top of the scaffolding I have not tried out yet, but soon. 

I will probably log another 100 hours on this game, easily, and happily.

Pro's
1.) It's a game I think
2.) It works.
3.) Its not horrible.
4.) Interesting concept.

Con's 

1.) Stiff as cold steel, Seriously all the animations are stiff awkward, janky at its best. Feels like my character is a pretty store maniquine with lock jaw. Zombies are also janky sometimes T-posing towards but not in the good way G-mod old man style.
2.) textures dont load correctly or are that bad. My character and all the zombies cept a few, along with most animals look like deformed play dough. Seriously thought this game was a joke cause of the ps1 characters running around thats how bad the textures are. The only thing that seems to load right is the foliage, ore nodes, tree,s cars, houses, and anything not NPC, or player. I don't know why this is but even my character looks like plastic. To make matters worse when i crouch or jump her arms and legs even bum deform. Usually in skyrim thats just a skeleton issue reinstalling XPMSE, and HDT physics after usually solves this but here there is no caliente or groovetrama to fix this.
3.) combat is stiff. Attack animations lock you in animation forcing you to follow through with janky attacks. Like for instance the light sword I swing and once I do if I change direction to keep an enemy in sight dont matter i miss. Most of the time I have to wait until the enemy starts their attack before I dare swing or punch otherwise i miss. Attacks have no weight any melee weapon which I swing in most games has some degree of weight velocity, and pulls you slightly forward here its swinging a baseball bat and you cant stop once comitted. Also hit boxes or what evs are weird most times with spear or two handed weapons I can hit with the tip of the weapon or even as they move past me when they are withing arms length here I miss or hit 50% of the time and because of the lack of weight or physics when I attack expecting to keep moving forward slightly it stops me dead in my tracks missing my intened target. Bows/crossbow guns too are janky wankers. Aiming is horrible and the fact that most creatures have such stiff animation and weird hit boxes I miss at medium distances because they twitch slightly and my bow to the dome goes millimeters past them of all the weapons though guns are worthless, you would think your ak or m4 would do way more damage than your crafted bow or modern crossbow but nope 3 hits with either 3 hits with guns. The recoil is rediculous the gun bounces everywhere, so firing 3 round bursts yea good luck. I use the crossbow as it at least works most of the time. combat is garbage in this game and very frustrating. There is more I could harp on but I think I gave enough.
4.) building, sigh this mechanic works but its also wank, even with snap on most of the tiles dont align properly giving gaps and other issues. but it does work, traps work flawlessly although the animations for them are as stiff as boards.
5.) story hmm not sure if there is one or if I am looking in the right places.
6.) no dodge mechanics and jumping is near pointless to do. my grandmother could jump over a 2 1/2 foot white picket fence on sunday when dough nuts are on the line.
7.) bloom is real and its oppressive. flash light interior lights, fire is blinding even with full walls around a light source it glaringly gets through solid concrete as if it were transparent glass. 
8.) lack of traits, character development or progression. yes there is some stuff in research but might as well not be there has little or no impact.
9.) sounds and ambiance I like the nature ambiance but zombiw death/attack/harm is looped repeated and really strange
10.) idles player has one idle/facial animation DEAD STARE Blank lifeless stare even oblivions NPCs had more life and they were made of wood. Zombies have barely any and it deforms their arms and legs.
11.) Who designed and what architect build house so tight and compact only the skinniest super modles could fit through thos hall in almost every house. Even our liitle plastic vixen here who has a nice booty has to squeeze herself through cause man our heroine must battle a legendary fight to fit those skin tight jeans. these hall ways are even tighter than that.
12.) maybe add a better map that is a little easier to read.
13.) maybe a horse to ride or a bicycle please.
14.) shot gun turret would be nice.

Conclusion

I want to like this game there are fun moments but either more work needs to go into this or really look into better allocating resources in memory allocation so that textures and meshes load right. The game I rate 5.3/10 the heroine is pretty no doubt and I like there are clothes too find for her maybe add more that are not just sweat pants, and sneakers. Is this game worth your money? it depends I am gonna hold onto it see if more updates later on improve the game. I hope it does get improved and when It does I will re-review this. I am not gonna say bad game just right now its meh.",1600817841,1600817841,False,4,0,0.476015686988830566,0,True,False,True

 Pros: Crafting. Building. Looting and scavenging. Hunting/trapping etc. Gathering. Inventory has several options/actions, to expand it along with ammo, food etc. 

 Cons: Not many imho. Player light could use some adjusting. When in a tight spot, small room, up against a wall it`s dark, and you have to at least back up or space limited, turn around to light anything up. I`ll see. No real big issue though, Devs will probably fix that. (I know the helmet or headgear light has been done to death but that is imho, one of the greatest mechanics in a game). ATM only one more thing I hope gets adjusted. When it`s dark it`s dark, Before horde and quite a while after horde it stays dark. Soon as horde is over I`m out and about, still dark lol.

This is a great game; probably my favorite base building/survivor game iv'e played. I'm actually excited for the first time for a game to come out of early access. It kind of reminds me of the movie, ""I Am Legend""; It's okay to explore during the day but the hordes come out at night. There are a few things that I hope the Devs. add to the game. 

1) It would be nice if there was a way to mark explored areas on the map. It's difficult to remember explored areas running back and forth every night cycle.
2) It would be nice if I could edit the location of my structures. I always misplace them even with snap.
3) Maybe add a few underground locations that get more difficult each floor level you descend with better and rarer loot the deeper you go; pushing you even further into the risk of being out past night. Of course you would have to add rare loot in the game ( weapons and armor maybe)?
4 ) Maybe add mods that can attach to all weapons including stationary base weapons. 
5) Maybe give us the option to increase the density of zombies.
6) Maybe give us the option to extend the night cycle of zombies ( add option to add more waves of zombies with a break in between or something)
7) Maybe add a mega/boss zombie at certain points in the game. It could exist already though. I haven't reached late game night cycles yet. Or maybe military zombies with armor. Mutated animals or something,

That's all I can think of right now. I haven't really experienced any bugs or glitches yet besides falling off a platform and getting stuck between structures. That sucks because i have to destroy my structure to move past it because there isn't a way to edit structure location yet.

Keep up the great work devs. I can't wait for the full release.

CONS:Kind of repetitive after hours of gaming, I don't really know where is the story line so i just go around doing what i like, kinda like GTA just that you are alone in zombies and animals land. 

What I look forward in the game next time: perhaps can add like survivors (quest like) after like maybe rescuing them they are available to help you in you daily activities that would be fun, At least you are not so alone in the game.
Do add objectives and quest so that we gamers have a goal and target in mind.

Sure there are some bugs here and there, but for this game coming out of such a small studio and how attentive the developers are to the community and the feedback from them, It's mind blowing. In my 44 hours of game play, I haven't encountered a single game breaking bug which is unheard of for an early access game.

For me, this game has filled a niche that I didn't know I was looking for. The building system is pretty fleshed out with somethings left to be desired which I'll touch on a bit. The scavenging part of the game is great in the early phase of the game but once you reach end game, feels kind of like a chore SOMETIMES. Need more traps? Gotta run to a different part of the map and either hit nodes and/or scavenge a new area. Obviously the map only has a certain amount of resources, so what do you do when exhaust all available scavenged resources? 

Now the map is pretty big and the story line part of the game does a great job having you travel all over it and there is PLENTY of the stuff to scavenge. I'm on day 22 and I feel like I've only scavenged maybe a 1/4 of the entire map. The zombies early game are a problem to deal with. Make sure you don't go around a corner into a room, just to find yourself in the middle of a herd of them and get trapped. As you progress, your able to find a handful of new weapons to make your travels a little easier. I hope they add a bigger variety of weapons down the road though to keep things interesting. 

For progression, they have a pretty decent system that definitely has potential to be expanded on down the road. The skill tree adds some nice QOL as you progress and the way you upgrade weapons and gear makes a lot of resources stay relevant for a good duration of the game. Like almost everything else , towards end game you are focused on the horde defense aspect of the game that comes every 24 hours in game.

This brings me to building part. Overall , it has a great feel to it. I love the ability to be able to ""snap"" my pieces into position. It does take some of the frustration away when trying to line things up. They also let you toggle that mode off so you can place freely. The building can be very limited especially when you have gotten use to building in Rust. This game could definitely take some pointers from rust's building mechanic. Obviously keep their own design but maybe add things like a low wall, half wall and 3/4 wall to make up for different foundation leveling. You're not always going to be able to build on complete flat ground and this would make building line up so much better.

The best part of the this game IMO is the traps. They have included a good variety of traps and also a bunch of different ways to implement these traps. You'll always want to establish a kill box (like in any good tower defense game) but the way you can do this and the different areas to do this in can vary. This adds some uniqueness and replayability to the game. There isn't a correct way to set something up or the best spot to set a defense up. Spike traps are definitely OP and should probably be nerfed soon, at least HP wise. You'll see , because you're going to buy this game and love it! 

If you do end up supporting these developers and buying the game , there is some decent content on the YouTube to help you get past the learning curve. [u] Kage848 [/u] has some good content and helped me hit the ground running by knowing what exactly to do/not do  on the first night before the first horde comes to kill me.

TL;DR 
[h1] If you love building epic bases and defending them from ever increasing hordes of Zombies , grinding out top tier gear and designing kill boxes where the zombies don't even get past the entrance of your maze , THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! [/h1]

The premise is as described ""Build defenses against nightly waves of zombies. Survive and escape the island."" Build your base, place traps in a guantlet to take on the horde, hunt, craft, survive and escape. 

You can solo play this game, i completed it playing solo, just don't forget to upgrade your weapons. Combat was simple but fun, zombies have special attacks, you don't.

The days are long and you will need them so you can collect resources to build and defend your base. Large map, plenty of places to go and scavenge. So many resources to scavenge you don't need them to respawn. I personally hate games where you go into an area, kill all the zombies and 2 days later everything is back again (This instance is only good when they don't have enough resources placed in the world to begin with.).

The game does need polish, there are bugs - not game breaking, Zombies can attack through walls if your close enough, some cooking recipes are ridiculous with the ingredients (10 game days in and i have yet to find a pear), no copper nodes (can only find it in containers or by breaking iron nodes), blade and spike traps can be very difficult to place (a lot of places you can't put them). Would like to see more missions.

Balancing is one of them. Not having enough time to build defenses (on normal) before the first night came and an endless stream of zombies that I had no way to defend against, is my first impression. 

Combat is also terrible.  You in no way feel you've made contact with an enemy when you hit them.  You're just wildly swinging and hope the enemy drops before you do.

Back to the zombie onslaught: Die/rinse/repeat in an endless dying loop with no way out.  Each time you revive, you're back at your camp with the same horde right on your heals.  

Great base building mechanics though.  That's what initially sold me on the game.

But after the first lone zombie or two came and I managed to beat them to death with my axe, I thought that would be an appropriate FIRST night to clue you in to what was coming in subsequent nights.  Nope, the onslaught was just beginning.
Perhaps this game is built around multi-player?  That's bad news for the solo player.

Anyway, returned the game for a refund.  Wasn't a bit enjoyable once night came on your first night.   If your first night feels like nightmare mode on normal, no thanks.  First impressions, right?

The Good:
-----------
*Game has a sense of urgency. (gather, craft, build before the zombie wave comes)
*fair amount of time to do the above before zombie wave, feels just right.
*building and crafting system is familiar , yet easy to navigate
*zombies are actually threatening 
*the correct blend of survival, gathering that adds to the main purpose which is building and tower defense gameplay.
*single player enjoyment, the ability to pause if need to.
*traps are fun to play with and customize building them into your ""base of death""
*condition and health in place of traditional water and food survival mechanic
*option to complete a story line
*forces you to think about your layout of your traps and base
*forces you to expand and travel out to find things you need , you will deplete resources 


The Bad:
----------
*tutorial is more like a hint system that you get rewarded for. May need to wiki or find guides if stuck
*a lot of ""you need this, to make that in order to make this , to get from this menu to that menu to make that and this""
*bears do not loose aggro on you (from what i see) but they can be killed .

Looks Good.

Runs well.

Only a slight bit of stutter, a couple of times near the built up area during my game play. 
         
You don`t have to pick up resources after, chopping down trees or breaking rocks. :)

Cons:

Clunky, unbalanced, Tedious.

Characters jumping is a joke, You can`t even climb, ""This has to change""

Zeds can find you no matter what.

Even if they never see you, they just home in on you. ""This has to change""

Where the hell are the health packs or food? you find none!

This game is just not fun, where is the tactics & stealth element.

Inventory keeps changing/moving about, it needs to stay as you left it.

Likes 
- The zombies are like every zombie game. but there is a range of different zombies, and the difficulties they present. The game is rather challenging on the higher difficulties.
Boss Zombie (Tall whitey, Orange Crawley, The Butcher), Mid zombies (Big Bob, White Cracked Head, Military Joe) These are all names that we randomly came up with. (They may have names already) 
- The wave event, Every Night there is a Wave of Zombies. Which adds a Tower Defense aspect to the game. which is fun. 
- the upgrading is very easy to get used to. trying to figure out what needs to be done first. 
- The objective, finding the missing items using journals. gives you that exploration feel.

Dislikes (All small things)
- Map Marking, you can only use one marker for the map. (Kindof sticks when you want to mark multiple things)
- Map Coordinates, Trying to pinpoint the exact location when you have to scroll out to see if you are in the right tile is kind of a bummer.
- Game end. (If you escape the Island, Besides the credits it should give you an option to continue that server). While i understand you can save it. and just reload. maybe completing it and staying should earn a special item or something of that nature.
- Nerd Points (Achievements) Where are the Achievement points? Lol

Extras - My other concerns seem to be stuff they are working on. Dedicated Servers, the Team building, private messaging.  I see many challenges with all of this but with the way they are handling it. i feel they will do a great job.

And the use of Unreal Engine is a plus because most survival crafting building games created using it, have good game mechanics for interaction with objects/resources, the game world also gives good atmosphere.

The game is a sandbox, no cutscene, no scripted event, just me myself and I against zombies and 1001 ways to grind their meat. It has character progression with perks that can be learned when have enough points, it has very good building mechanics as expected with Unreal engine, and a very fun and rewarding hunting game for refining tools and gears, it has quite clunky combat but in a good way like I know what my character can do, I know what the zombies can do, I just have to make whatever my char can do to win against what the zombies can do, can be very satisfying hitting the zombies especially when headshot.

In a nutshell, we have to scavenge/harvest materials during the day, hour 2-24, to build defense/base for the zombie horde that will attack at hour 0-2 am, survive the night, rinse and repeat, while looking for journals to escape the island, that is to follow the story, or rinse and repeat for sandbox till how many days can survive in the game world. Zombie horde gets stronger everyday.

Some things in the game can be weird like refining gears using bones and skin of animals, or reloading zombie traps using tree branch, but we have to remember, no matter how realistic a game tries to be, it IS still a game ! So to keep the immersion in a game when I find something weird, I categorize things in game mechanics and common sense, sure those don't make sense but for game mechanics, it works, and it keeps the item economy going, like those items you gathered have to be used, not too tasking but its there. Or sometimes I improvise and make my own scenario, like for example refining weapon from 1 to 10 using animal parts and other mats, the weapon gets stronger as the animal spirit will help boost its property in the physical world using their remains as vessel. Something like that. I ever quit a game because it doesn't need water to grow plants lol, and I think that's maybe silly so now I employ those to keep my immersion going without sacrificing the game. But still everyone has their limit, like I refunded Subsistence because the trees just stay there after being harvested, and only show red (X), I can't tolerate that.",1600146691,1600147319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

After finishing Night of the Dead last night, I find myself enjoying the experience I had during my playthrough. Everything seems balanced well enough, though the gathering materials and waiting for night time might be a little tedious than most survival games, I think Night of the Dead already have a solid ground for an early access game.  The AI is very relentless in trying to kill you or at least damage you at some point, sometimes it's kind of frustrating to deal, but once dealt, it was quite worth it.

The only issues I had are that some of the tree entities are causing me a crash to desktop, specifically the ones that can be broken in less than 5 hits, and in the lower end of the PC specification spectrum, the game's having framerate drops. It's not nice, but it is not something trivial to bug me.

The world itself feels so vast and limitless, it seems that in every corner of the world of Night of the Dead, there is something that I haven't encountered in my previous playthroughs and there are a lot of potentials to be taken and implemented using those empty spaces as something to add small contents or addition into the game (a small camp, animal den, etc). For an early access title, the equipment feels lackluster and consists of similar items that are found in different places. I think to add certain clothing theme or better armaments in crucial places is something I'd welcome in this game.

As for game mechanics, I would love to have backward engineering not just for materials found in the world, but as well as weapons and clothing items and also the ability to store items in any containers scattered throughout the game. The ability to scrap guns and clothes for raw materials is truly essential.

Lastly, possibilities for Steam Workshop items, whether its equipment, traps, or something else is huge for this game because user-made items will diversify the game into something that almost resembles to many of Bethesda games. The potential is limitless and so does player's creativity.

Conclusion:
Night of the Dead is an empty, fertile land that the developers have yet to realize. I'd suggest that you best to plow it with care as it is offering quite a lot within its realm of possibilities.

Thank you for the experience and the great game, JacktoStudios.

Excellent game, it has a lot of potential, it's better than 7 days to die in several aspects.

Pros:
- Faster and more dynamic combat system compared to 7 days to die.
- Easy to understand building system.
- Nice landscapes and graphics (I like the character design, would be awesome to see a good character editor in this one).

Cons:
- Important: Terrible optimization (Understandable for an alpha), get ready to set your graphic card on fire if you are going to turn up the graphics quality. (for now this game is not recommended for low-low/mid spec machines)
- Minor but would be a nice touch: Some animations and deformations of the character could be enhanced (for example the legs of the character looks weird when she crouches down).

- Más dinámico y rápido en combate que el 7 days to die (da gusto disparar con el arco).
- Sistema de construcción fácil de manejar y entender.
- Gráficos y paisajes bonitos (Me gusta el diseño de los personajes, aunque estaría bien que tuviera un editor de personajes).

Cons:
- Importante: Optimización terrible (comprensible para un alfa), prepárate para encender tu gráfica con fuego si pretendes jugarlo en gráficos altos sin refrigeración líquida. (Por ahora no recomiendo este juego para PC de gama baja o media baja).

That guy is a giant tool, and only exists to bash things.  If he doesn't have drama going on around him, I don't think he could survive.
 
Anyway, I think this game is great.  Others have said pretty much everything there needs to be said about, so I am not going to beat a dead horse.  Just read the popular reviews on this game and you will see plenty of people that really enjoy it, but also call out the obvious issues as well.  Everyone has their own opinion, but if you don't like something that doesn't mean you get to just call it @#$# and walk away with no real explanation why.  Games like this from small Dev. groups live and die on reviews.  And I think these guys have done one hell of a job.

I cannot wait to see this game grow even bigger.  I have nearly 40 hours now and I still find new stuff on the sizable map all the time.  It can really get intense at night, especially when you get around night 8 and further.

I won't go too much in what I like cause there are a lot of good stuff. But there are some things I wished it had to make it even better.

- Be able to place buildings down and bring the materials in later
- Character development is limited for now, I hope they can add more to it later because I was maxed out by day 9.
- NPCs like traders or side mission characters
- Main mission is cool but I am sure there will be some cut scenes added in later to add drama to the story
- Research points to upgrade skills doesn't make sense. Research points to open new technology or unlock new tools or buildings makes more sense. Skill progression from doing is more satisfying, like the more trees you chop the better you get a it.
- Rewards for killing zombies. Like exp, or achievements, or skill upgrade, or weapon upgrade if you kill X number of zombies with a particular weapon etc.

Overall I love the idea, but the problem with most zombie survival game is what's the end game. Here if you breeze through it on normal mode you can actually finish the main story in 30+ hours. Maybe you had some timed progression, for example clue 7 can only be accessed after day 14 when the airdrop comes by, clue 8 is only accessible during the low tide of the red moon, so to extend the longevity of the experience.",1599836991,1599836991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The graphics are amazing (though objects spawn in strange ways - ex. a lamp post in the middle of a street or resources clipping through objects and terrain), the crafting and building (though a bit finicky) is fun, and the ""tower defense"" is intense at times...unless you know how to cheese them while standing still...on the ground...next to 100 spike barriers leading to a bait trap surrounded by 2 cutters and a shredder - that's if they survive me and my explody bomb trebuchet (up to night 10 anyway).  

The devs are listening to the players. Resources were bumped up from nodes. Ranged traps hold more ammo.  New patches and fixes on the regular. I'm excited to see what comes out next. I haven't been able to say that for a long while (aside from Hardspace: Shipbreaker). 

Some faults: Enemies spawn inside, above, or below floors and ceilings/roofs. Some places of interest are well object populated while others are barren. Some don't make sense - like a one room house with no kitchen or bath. Enemies can attack through static walls (non-player erected) and destroy your objects/storage boxes if they are too close to the wall. The story is very much lacking and is based inside one city and 2 outside POI. The clothing is cosmetic only - which I suppose make sense in a way. Some of the weapons intentionally swing wide and strike the floor/ground or otherwise are used by the PC in odd ways - the lightsaber slapping the ground with every swing is irritating. Some weapons could use with alternate attacks like lunges, stabs, even blocking would be nice. I could go on but I've been on long enough already.

The world is huge. I kind of want to explore it. There's so much more out there than the city. I never needed to go to a water source. Perhaps that could be added in - though the PC doesn't need sleep so it'd be strange to suddenly need water as food refills heath and ""condition""...which I suppose is a form of fatigue. 

Bottom line: This game is fun. The different Z's are interesting. The crafting and building is fun. The combat is...meh. The traps are fun. Getting mauled by a bear when you least expect it is fun. Accidentally running into your barbed fence and stabbing yourself and scaring the crap out of me is fun. This game is fun, it's fun to look at, and it's fun to explore.

I have been enjoying this game very much! If the makers of this game need any sounds or music for this game hit me up! I love zombie titles and this one is so fun! I will be honest i have not discovered everything yet but about 80% of it. Bears are real let me tell you. I restarted my game twice just trying to farm what i thought was a good start a couple of times because of the bears! All the different zombies are awesome and unique with different ability's! Crafting is engaging and takes a min to figure out. I like that secretive style of discovery! Weapons and items are a delight to find and use as well as craft!

Farming for mats to craft and build is not to bad but swinging 5, 7 or 10 times is a lot to mine or chop a tree down. As you learn new ability's you swing a bit faster and farming speed increases but not to noticeable. I would love to see more characters to choose from. Currently only one in story mode. Storage space is tight at first and chests are big they take up to much space. some of the other storage pieces are limited inventory space as well and not upgradable more for looks. i would like to see more weapons and and options to craft and build put into the game, like gates new traps like spike pits. moats. hard hitting traps knocking zombies into the air launching them across the map, C4 remote detonater's. Trains that are moving with zombies riding them very difficult to board and take over for loot and using it to kill waves of zombies. Bosses that come in the waves maybe every 5 to 10 waves. With more characters to choose from maybe include classes ninjas monks you know all the cool exciting ones that appear to be in there i haven't tried yet!

I HATE BUILDING GAMES!!!!!
Minecraft, Ark and even 7 days to die I would never play it.

Found this game in my queue and though oh and thought oh what the hell lets give it a try.

All i can say is I am blown away with the quality of this game. Especially for early access.
Yes there are going to be some bugs in it but serious the game play is fantastic 

Normally when I finish a game I never go back to it but once I finished this I restarted a new game and want to build a much better death trap along with making sure to explore the whole map.

This game excites me to know that this is only the beginning and there will be more to come.

It's also not an onslaught game like Left 4 Dead. I wouldn't even say it's a tower defense game either. I know a lot of people are calling it that, it's not (IMO). 

So what is it? Well, it tries to be the best part of all of those games and for the most part get's a lot of things right. 

The Good: 

The game is the perfect level of challenging from a learning curve perspective. There are easy to kill zombies, mixed in fairly well with some more difficult ones. It does a good job of supplying you with the equipment needed to survive. The game itself is very pretty, from an art prospective it looks like a (very nearly) completed AAA game. The night hordes are fun, some people have had problems past day 6 - but I guess I got lucky and found a trap configuration that just works really well. The map is large without being cumbersome. You can enter almost all structures and every room in said structure. It's just very well balanced. The world looks like it's a real place and they did a good job of making it look like nature is taking it over. This game is a lot of fun, weather you're a solo or a co-op player. 

The Bad: 

Once you master the mechanics of the game, the challenge is reduced a fair bit. Combat is predictive and there's very little to surprise you as longs you stay somewhat alert to what's going on around you. Zombies can be easily manipulated and can't jump over basic small fences, so it's pretty easy to simply run away if you get in to trouble. A downer about the Co-op is that the damage you do to your friends if you accidentally hit them is massive. So you really need to watch your shots. I know I said the learning curve is good, but the in game tutorial misses on some major points, so you may need to look up some walk throughs of day 1 on youtube. 

The Ugly: 

Once you understand the mechanics of the game, and what you're supposed to do, it can be beaten to easily and with almost no desire for replayability. Honestly the fun of the game is playing the game, but the longer you play the harder it gets, so you're motivated to complete the game quickly - but when you do, that's it, you're done. And there isn't really a point to continue or to play again.  I've put about 30 hours in to the game and I'm probably done for a long time until they put in some major content. 

Conclusion: 

I full recommend this game. Does it have faults? Sure. But none of the faults in my opinion should stop anyone from picking this up. It's worth the $25 I paid for it for sure. Basically I paid just under $1 per hour of game time, and once updates come I'll probably get another 20 out it every time. So that being said, go for it!",1599714228,1599714228,True,3,0,0.537462234497070313,0,True,False,True

TL:DR - Not worth $25 in current state, although it has promise and will get better with time. Grab on sale.

**NOTICE** THIS GAME IS IN EARLY ACCESS AND HAS TONS OF POTENTIAL TO BE AMAZING **NOTICE**

So here is the thing: The game has little to no depth or sense of progress besides building defenses. This, in and of itself would be fine if there were some changes made for QOL.

1. Make a setting that can change / customize the day/night cycle's length. It takes forever for the in game time to roll over.
2. Make resources respawn or make a setting for it. It shouldn't respawn every day by any means, but maybe after a week or so. If all else fails make a setting / slider that lets the player choose how often loot respawns.
3. Depth of weapons is very flat. After 9 hours I have all the weapons in the game and all that is left is to ride out the waves  / complete the story. Within a day you can have a gun and ammo (Which are actually underpowered compared to a crossbow)
4. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO BREAK DOWN IRON STUFF INTO IRON PIECES - I hate having to run out looking for a barrel or car when I have 20 iron plates or ingots that I can't break down.
5. Possibly add a slider / multiplier setting for loot gain for the filthy casuals?

Alright, the complaining / feedback is over. So here comes the good stuff / pros:

1. The base building is very fleshed out and great! I enjoyed building gauntlets of traps and mazes for zombies, and it has the best selection of traps that I have seen in a zombie style game.

2. The map and environment are well made and have great graphics for a early access game.

3. The outfits add a nice amount of customization to your character, letting everyone have their own sense of style.",1599632682,1599632682,False,95,12,0.626320898532867432,0,True,False,True

The Pros to the game are many, with a great balance to the game for day length. Just enough time to focus on building/upgrading base and gear with leaving time enough to explore and move the story along. (unlike other games where you would have to choose)
The experience system has been replaced with research papers which you either find or can craft which adds a great take to the ""level"" up system. 
Farming is actually useful if not vital to the game. It increased your health and stamina pool for 24 hours.
The AI pathing is more developed than many finished and released games I've played, not that its perfect, but it is noteworthy.

The cons to the game are few and forgivable when taken into context.
There are assets in the game that are unfinished, either you cant enter certain places or some places feel empty and unfinished. (with this being said its forgivable because there are plenty of places that are finished and plenty of resources to gather from all over the map)
The faster weapons seem to swing faster than the engine allows for hits to land. I leveled up a fast hitting weapon and there were times that only one hit would land despite the weapon passing through the enemy multiple times.
And Arrows, oh my does arrow gathering suck after you kill an enemy, especially if you kill them with a head shot. 

But over all this game is fantastic and I can't recommend this high enough. With continued development this game could turn into a legendary franchise.
Amazing work jacktostudios!

Later on you notice the many frame drops constantly on top of many many crashes. I'm above recommended requirements to play this game and everything is on max settings. Just check my profile out I play any game without issue but this one has many.

On top of it crashing a lot, the movement is chunky, the PvE is even more chunky. The zombies are easily beatable and everything has a very easy strategy. You're gonna grind constantly and you'll notice that once u have a little base set up you can just stay inside and the traps will do all the work.

The ranged traps are horrific, the ballista one in particular misses literally every shot and on simple 3 hit zombies it won't even one shot it. 

Lots of things are decent in terms of a setup to make it become good but as of now I wouldn't recommend buying it as it's really not stable enough to play. Just check my steam games and you'll see I played/play many early access games and these never have been as broken and unstable as this one is with the one exception of early Conan Exiles.

Get a few friends together, and it will be amazing. I'd love to see this progress, I feel like if it continues the exposure will come. There's big potential here, it's what 7D2D should have been.

--Things I'd like to see--
-Bigger & dedicated servers for a PvP experience would be nice.
-Loot spawn need a re-spawn timer set. Where it generates different items, so it's not the exact same things obviously. That would be huge. Once you loot an area, it's done. That for sure needs adjusted, or you'll eventually just clean up the map.
-Random spawn locations, mix it up a bit so you don't start in the same spot every time.
-Fixes with placements, there's just a few issues I've ran into placing foundations and traps on non perfect terrain.

I don't really have any complaints for the price, as long as the progression continues to come. I've noticed issues left in the negative responses In early September have already been fixed. Which is promising, It show's they're watching. 

It's obviously got some bugs, hit boxes, things like that. Which you could expect. Optimization needs to happen, I personally don't have issues. But I have friends who play Arma, and struggle.

Another solid entry to the zombie survival genre. The beginning is a bit grindy as far as gathering the needed resources goes, and if you build a base near the spawn you end up running back and forth a lot as it seems the road is the major source of resources such as plastic and rubber from cars etc which does not respawn so you keep having to go a bit further and then back. There is a city nearby but not exactly beginner friendly. I ended up started a new base further into the map after a couple in game days and will be transferring my stuff over a long run. 

The melee combat feels a bit sluggish but not too bad, the bow feels awesome and allows you to pull of some great speed shots. I like that animal skins are used to upgrade tools, weapons and bags kind of like far cry games where you need a certain skin to be able to carry more of certain things, a nice addition to a zombie survival game. 

The building is easy to figure out and snap things in place, it DOES NOT use a blueprint system such as The Forest or Grounded, you must have everything on you to be able to place and build something. The traps in it though are AWESOME! Gruesome medieval style swinging mace style pendulums. Guillotines, spinning blades like 7 days to die and a whole lot more. 

Over all it reminds me a lot of a Rust and 7 Days to Die mashup. One of those games that will easily suck up a lot of time.",1599531012,1599531012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
1377380,75626273,76561198016383424,0,8,1721,0,255,1701949979,"[GEN] [Played more like 12 hours, been playing in offline mode] I actually like this time, while yes compared to the numerous other types of zombie survival games out there, this game is lacking in the sense of stuff to do beyond exploration. However, the map itself is still pretty large so it'll take some time to complete that aspect. As for the ramp in difficulty over time, it's still okay. 
[PROS] Pretty straightforward, not too hard or too easy. It's right between the soft spot of manageable. There is  a little of everything from RPG, to base-building, zombiesssss, and combat. The melee combat is [6/10], specifically since there are huge drawbacks to it. 1) enemies rush your character but since there's no collision, if you're using a weapon with long animation, you'll need to account for that making it much harder to hit them. 2) realism does exist so its a good point in this game it means heavier weapons reduce your walking speed and attack speed, but you can upgrade them to reduce the weight, while increasing damage and attack speed. Range combat [9]. Range combat is satisfying, in the sense that it is game-y but still has function such as bow's reload speed makes it a cheap weapon but the downside is you need ton of arrows due to low damage. Pretty much range comes down to how much ammo you can carry. Base-building [8/10]. It is satisfying to build and get your building working as intended but there are minuses such as if you build a stair, then you cant build the wall to box the stairs in, but you can if you do the walls first. These are some hassles in the process. RPG [5]. Most of the rpg skill tree are generic stuff like increase your base damage, get more recipes to build stuff, and having some passives like running speed and inventory space. It's good it's there, but I want there to be more like if you have X achievement unlocked, then you can have Y skill research available. This makes the whole grinding aspect to have some perk at the end. Kill humans with bow and get new research of composite bow and such.
[CONS] My number 1 negative is there is one thing WAY TOO REALISTIC, and that is building of your base. It sucks to spend an entire day building your base to have it burned down in the end. It isn't that I didn't survive the night. No, it's because there's a zombie that explodes in fire and spreads sparks everywhere, and YES i did ""fireproof"" my entrance. I just didn't expect the particle effects to go through walls and doors, so the particles spread to my foyer and from there, (there seems to be no time limit on fire so it keeps burning) it spread through my ENTIRE base.. and only my entrance area that was SUPPOSE to protect me but didn't. Beyond that, this is a simplistic survival zombie game that isn't the top dog in graphics, gameplay, action, etc etc etc. That being said, it is still fun, because most games of the latter are online ONLY, and so you always have to live to griefers. I like it this way.

[OVERALL] I'd give it a 7/10, maybe a 8/10. Mainly because I like solo gameplay and having random zombies sprint up behind me and randomly jump scaring me for not paying attention in post end of the world. So I'm really interested in how this game develops.",1599530678,1599530678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all the game is brilliant. It's challenging enough to keep you interested and it requires a lot of trial and error on the best methods of killings zombies when you're out scavenging and on base defence (figuring out the best layouts for a base and defences and on what defences are most suitable against different zombies. 
It's new enough that there aren't a million videos on youtube telling you how and where to find certain items and animals to hunt which is great as it requires you think for yourself and figure things out. 
I am disappointed in a new patch though which has put me off continuing my game. I saw that barbed fences were pretty effective against zombies from my first day's wave (in no way overpowered in my opinion, which is why I'm guessing their effectiveness was changed) . So I built a base with a lot of barbed fences as one of my main strategies of fighting off the zombie hordes. After this recent patch they are completely useless and a waste of resources. I only just about survived wave 19 with a barely intact base and now after 40 hours am questioning whether it's worth playing any more. 
Even if I was to start again, I don't want to play a new game for 40 hours only to find that my new choice of defence has been patched to be completely ineffective as well. 
I do want to say again though how brilliant the game is overall. I'm just not sure I will continue until the creators have worked out the kinks and have worked through all of their hotfixes.",1599512135,1599512135,True,1,0,0.509433984756469727,0,True,False,True

the game is way to power hungry.
 so much so that it doesn't run on 2 of my laptops even though they meet the minimum requirements and my 3 laptop meets the avarage specs and crash's a couple of seconds in.
 what game play i have played has been on the lowiest possible setting and is avaraging around 4-7 frames a second.
from what ive seen on you tube this looks like a fun game with regular bug fixes.

Pros:
-Large map
-Decent variety of weapons for now
-Somewhat of a story in development(Escape)
-Different types of zombies
-A lot of difficulties to choose from
-Research tree for upgrading stuff and things
-Quick response from devs(already addressed multiple negative review issues)
-Open world survival craft zombie looter shooter 
-Building large trap bases and seeing the zombies get ripped apart
-Good price for a game like this

Cons:
-Base building needs some tweaks(snap/alignment issues)
-Some resources/animals are lacking and other resources you get too much of
-Zombies basically drop the same stuff no variety
-No character selection/customization(Apparently there are different characters in multiplayer though)
-Close combat has some issues
-Traps have limited use before they turn off
-Upgrades to your bags/weapons barely increase them
-Stack sizes are low, some items max stack at 40 and others to 100(with fully upgraded bag)
-Interior of most buildings don't have much detail and look bad(A lot of buildings you can't go into)
-Organize button doesn't stack your items

I love the challenge of needing to work for what you need, and there`s an option to turn off the crafting tasks that hand rewards to you to help you along, this helps with making it more challenging.
My small issue is id love there to be a fix that makes it so items stay in the inventory slot you put them into in the first place, the tools and weapons move around in the inventory when you use them...Yes i am one of these sort out the inventory neatly players lol though it is a small annoyance that I can live with.

The dead are well made, however, the are very docile in there attack mode, even when it comes to the hording at night. My biggest issue at the moment is the base building, all be it there are plenty of resources to be had and easy to come by, the issue is with actually building what you want and where you want, i.e. put up basic walls to cover holes in existing walls and fence lines and so. Even though you can start of building your patch up, suddenly walls don't want to attach or even snap together and that goes for most of trying to build an kind of base, unless it me and/or these things have not been quite ironed out yet. Hopefully more variation of building parts will be come available in future builds.  That all said, this looks to be a good game and definitely one to play or at least give it a look at, and hopefully as more is added to the game, it will become a definite contender.

For a Pre-alpha its pretty polished, I have read that a few multiplayer bugs have been an issue.  With My friends and myself there has been relatively few bugs, the biggest being a bug dealing with unstable foundations.  Not sure if a zombie got under there and when I upgraded it trapped him but nothing game breaking.  I'm not sure if the game play is going to change going forward, but for now and compared to most survival games, there isn't any crafting time when making items here.  No timers for food(no counting calories like green hell :)).  There is overall fatigue you gotta keep up with food as the day wears on or if your hurt.  Combat is third person and pretty basic, but smooth with a decent array of melee weapons while limited few range.  Only being 20 hrs in there maybe more as the game progresses.  The zombie base defense is where it shines.  A lovely selections of traps and siege weapons that allow your imagination of base design create some sinister mazes of mass carnage!!  I get pumped when the 24th hr approaches and you see if your base is up to the test as the end of day wave gets harder as days go on.  Group up with fiends and its a blast(up to 16 players currently).  If there is any cons i would say being only 16 players on a server, not sure if pvp is any good yet.  I haven't really tried to do it so i can't offer insight on this part of the game.  Another con would be lack of story on the pve side.  Being in alpha i understand that's the way it is for now and i look forward to updates.  Lastly a bit grinding until you start getting some love in the gathering tree.  No levels here but acquiring research papers to access said abilities tree; is how you do level and kinda scarce in the beginning. It is craftable later so no worries tho!!

It offers a mix of resource gathering, building and direct combat of the survival genre with trap building and maze planning of the tower defense genre and finally you have a light sprinkle of a narrative and end game to encourage exploration.

So how does it feel to play? Well ultimately time is your currency. At midnight, every night, you will be attacked by an ever increasing number and types of zombies. You need to upgrade and expand your base with traps to deal with these hordes. To do so you gather resources, however unlike other games, upgrading your tools and skills does not give you more resources, instead they take less time to gather. Ultimately as you reach the end game you'll be able to explore more, take down zombies quickly and gather resources no the way. It all seems to come together.

On the whole, this works quite well and proves to be an enjoyable and entertaining distraction which is open enough that, despite the ticking clock, you can play it the way you want. I would however caution that as the game stands right now, the tower defense aspect is the core gameplay loop and if that turns you off it might not be for you.

With that out of the way, it's also worth mentioning that the game is very stable. In 50 hours I've encountered minor bugs. The developer has been very active in listening to the community and issued 8 updates so far addressing balancing and bugs with bigger updates planned down the road. Bravo to Jackto for doing Early Access right.

For the future. I'd like to see some user configuration being implemented so people can tweak the game to their playstyle or perhaps workshop support for that and user made traps. As ever, more content and more polish on the existing content would be great. The narrative quest could also benefit from expansion as currently it's pretty much explore location X and get Y. Some mega bosses, maybe encouraging a temporary base to defend against a special quest horde attack etc would add something more to the game.

Finally, the tutorial does expose you to the trap mechanics which is very helpful. I do however think that it might be helpful to split off the tutorial into a separate mode where you have no resource cost and can experiment more freely. As it stands you can easily find your placement is off or ineffective and you're left demolishing a chunk of your base and rebuilding as a consequence.",1599396729,1599397287,True,34,1,0.770170211791992188,0,True,False,True

First off if you have any interest in survival horror games should you buy this game?
Lets get this out of the way first and just say yes. This game even in early access gets what a lot of survival games either never do or are only now just being able to. Allow me to explain. 
There is always a certain amount of realism that we all expect from our video games especially open worlds like this one. But at the same time you have to balance it by letting your audience come here to do the thing they came to do and that is ...play a game and have fun. 
This is what Night of the Dead I feel absolutely nails. The looks of the game are absolutely spot on. Environments are diverse enough to keep one intrigued about what may be lurking around the corner without becoming too ""samey"". That's not to say that there aren't some ""paper cut out"" models that get reused but its not something that feels overly done. Zombies are diverse with some models being fairly ""plain jane"" standard and others being more ""robust"" and hitting you like a freight train. Diversity is hard to nail in zombie games because again people tend to lean too hard on the ""realistic"" side and it feels repetitive. Here they decide to allow some freedom which is amazing and give you weird hound hybrids that explode upon dying causing massive fire damage. Is that ""normal"" or ""realistic""? no. Is it fun and challenging? yes.
And let me also take a minute to discuss the traps. I love the traps and it reminds me of a cross between an old PS2 game I played called Trapt and Orc Must Die. Building them is both entertaining (watching the zombies die on them every night) and challenging (figuring out the best way to set them up).
Weapons are also fun as hell and really show the creativity of what the developers allow you to do by allowing you to craft things from simple bows to lightsabers. One thing I can definitely say about it is I approve of the inability to craft guns and that you need to find them through exploring to me that is both challenging and honestly more realistic.
That is not to say that I don't have legit issues with the game itself (some of which may come down to me simply not knowing) for example organization. If it isn't a part of the game allowing people to have a button on the inventory that organizes what you are carrying to have all the same items grouped together. Or also having it to where if you organize your inventory in a specific way that it stays that way.
Also the zombies can use some work. I was both terrified and excited to find literal hordes of zombies inside of buildings, but when I felt I was ready became disappointed on how they reacted to me. I could easily walk up to them individually and attack one with having ones standing right next to them not even react. My expectation was that simply shinning my light on them would cause a mass exodus and have me running for my life with zombies running after me alla Day Z style. And for the loot you can get in buildings it makes sense that that should actually happen.
As for the traps the only thing I can say is that for how much I love them I wish there was even more that we could have or more ways that we would be allowed to use them. For example if we have walls in our horde base allow us to actually put things there instead of just floors and ceilings. And allowing for traps to be placed on top of each other would be great for ""combo damage"". And even with how great the ones they have are I would love to have even more and even more crazier traps. I mean you already have lightsabers as weapons at this point ""going nuts"" shouldn't even be a question as to whether you should or not. Give me something like an exploding barrel launcher or ceiling mounted miniature ballista and you won't hear me complain. 
Resource gathering is present but maybe a little more emphasis on it with some further skill focus you could get would be appreciated.
And one thing that I love is that there is an option when you start a map to put it in ""one life"" mode as well as if you die you lose all the research materials you had on you. Having a consequence to death actually raises the tension level and makes being able to say you survived to a certain point really mean something.
All and all is this game worth the $25.00 price tag for an early access game? Absolutely.
Will you have fun playing it despite some issues here or there? 100% yes
If you are looking at this and debating about getting into something thats ""early access"". I'd say go for it
Is the game perfect? No, but I hope what I see here is only the tip of the iceberg and the developers are ready and willing to continue adding more and fine tuning it till its the best game that I believe it can be.",1599376474,1599376474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I completed the game and it feels so accomplishing and it compelled me to write this review. I want to thank the developers for making such a fun and beautiful game! I like the fact that if you think it you can build it (usually). 

ONE FAVOR

*** I think one thing that would improve the gamer's experience is the inventory (what the player carries on them). When attempting to organize your inventory sometimes it doesn't stack items and you have to manually do it. I propose maybe a command that players can press to ""Organize Inventory"". By pressing this your inventory is pushed up towards the top and stacked as far as it could just. It'll be cool if it even organized it by food, materials, clothes, weapons etc so its easier to find the stuff once you open your inventory.",1599372025,1599372025,True,1,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,True
1377380,75523722,76561198134338184,0,26,982,0,355,1686087770,"Pretty decent game overall, but naturally with an Early Access game there are going to be some problems and things that need to be tweaked. Here are some pros and cons:

Edit: Have to list cons only due to character limit.

Cons: 
1. Combat
  1a. Melee Animations. Whenever you attack with a melee weapon, the animation plays out, then must reset to the default standing animation which takes too long. If I continue to hold the left mouse button to attack or spam the left click for attacking, the character shouldn't have to reset into the default standing animation just to begin to attack again. It should be a smooth animation transition that allows me to attack constantly if I hold or spam the attack button that naturally uses up stamina with each attack.
  1b. Also when attacking, the game locks you into place. You should be able to continue moving forward, back, left, right while attacking. Locking the player into place to attack doesn't make any sense and makes the melee combat in this game feel like a chore, especially when you have to fight a group of zombies or the special zombies in this game. This could possibly be negated if there was some sort of dodge mechanic but there isn't one so every fight boils down to: Hit zombie with weapon, wait for animation to end so you can move again, walk backwards (which is very slow while zombies move quickly and catch up to you very easily and quickly) and hope you don't get hit by their fast attack animation, then hit them with your weapon again. 
  1c. Arrows to the head and head shots from weapons should be instant kills no matter what. It is pretty ridiculous that it usually takes 4 arrows to the head and 4 head shots from a gun to kill a zombie. I'm only playing on normal difficulty but yet it feels i'm playing on legend difficulty. Zombies should not be this resilient, especially on just normal difficulty.
  1d. Zombies are straight up unfair in this game. Zombies can stun you like crazy but you can barely do it to them. Zombies can stun lock you consistently but you'd be lucky to do it once in a fight even against the weakest zombies. They also have these attacks that are INSTANT. Their arm moves so fast on one attack that it is 100% is impossible to dodge since the movement is bad in this game. Since there's no dodge mechanic, and you can only run forward, all you can do is strafe at 2 miles per hour so you'll always get hit no matter what with every attack the zombies have. Also, zombies somehow have a better range of attack in this game. When using a baseball bat, I had to practically hug the zombie just for the hit to register but for this game the zombies range of attack makes contact with your hit box an absurd amount to the point that it's just plain unfair. Also just know, the way this game is set up, because it is 3rd person you have to aim to the left of a zombie to hit them. Just a forewarning.
  1e. So naturally with the combat being pretty bad it'd be nice to be able to heal properly in this game but you can't. Maybe I haven't came across a better way to heal so maybe this isn't a problem but for me, the only way I could heal was by eating which is by eating but all the food in this game barely heals you. Killing a Deer and eating it's meat only yields around 20-30 health and that's it. If I am eating a whole deer, I need way more that just 20hp or 30hp. Heck, I even killed a whole bear and yet it's meat only gives 50 health back. The healing values in this game are pretty bad and need to be upped big time.

2.Resource/Material Gathering
  2a. Resource gathering is a little too grindy for certain materials in my opinion. Yes I get it, in these types of open world survivor games grinding is going to be a thing. That's fine, just don't make it an absolute chore which is what this game does with certain resources/materials unfortunately. You'll chop down a skinny tree and will get 2 logs from it, but yet if I chop down a HUGE tree I'll only get 3 logs. That doesn't make any sense. The bigger the tree, bush, iron mine deposit, etc it is, you should get a lot more resources versus a smaller one. Also, getting stuff like vines from bushes is a pain. If I go to a bush (the main resource for vines) and break it down, I should get vines no matter what. It's a bit silly that I'll destroy a good amount of bushes and won't receive any or will receive just 1 vine. You should always get a vine (or the resource that a specific resource gathering point gives the player) every time a player breaks a bush (or any resource point).
  2b. Regarding trees, it's weird how the really skinny trees can survive up to 6 hits from an axe before coming down. This is related to bigger resource points barely giving more resources than smaller ones. Naturally a big tree will take more time to chop down versus a smaller one. A big tree should give many more resources to the player versus a smaller one but take longer to chop down. As of now small trees can take up to 6 hits from an axe to come down but the huge trees take up to 9 while just offering just one extra log. It should be changed to where smaller trees (and smaller resource points in general) take around 3-5 hits and give around 2-3 logs and bigger one's go from 6-9 hits and offer 5-7 logs.
  2c. Bushes are smaller than trees. They are made up of twigs and branches so it should't take 3 swings from an axe to break them down. They should be 1 with an axe, 2 with any other tool/weapon, and 3 if using fists.
3. Crafting 
  3a. As an example, in this game logs can be made into lumber and planks. 1 log shouldn't equal just one of these items, it should be more. It should be at least 1 log equals 2 or more lumber and wooden planks. Since resources don't spawn back in this game (which means every time you go to gather resources you have to travel further and further each time) and crafting ratio's are 1:1, you run through your materials very quickly and it's quite annoying.
4. Building. 
  4a. I know in my pros list I said building was a pro but it could still use some work. I would like if this game did what The Forest did which is if you don't have the materials or even if you do, you put the outline of what you want to build where you wan't it so you know exactly where it's going then add said materials to the outline. Many times I have to tear down whatever I build because the outline that shows whatever you're trying to build makes it hard to see. For example, when building walls on the floor I had to keep tearing down and putting back up a lot of the same walls because the outline made it hard to see where exactly the wall was going so whenever I placed down the wall, the walls wouldn't be lined up. Some walls were lined up on the outside of floor which is where I wanted them but a lot of the time they would be put about a foot or two from the edge so the walls weren't lined up. 

Edit: After playing the game more and building more, not being able to place things in open areas is much more common than I thought.

5. The Zombies 
  5a. There is no reason to fight zombies. Right now, the only reason to fight zombies is so they don't kill you (duh), and that's about it. When fighting zombies, it is very rare for them to drop some loot. These drop rates need to be increased. I found myself running out of cloth to make rope and my first instinct was to go find some zombies to kill for their cloth. Makes sense right? Unfortunately you can't do that since the drop rates are rare and whenever they do drop something, it's only ever one thing. Give us players a reason to go out and kill them because right now all I do is avoid them if I can since there's no reason to fight them, also because the fact that the melee in this game isn't the best either.",1599369547,1599369547,False,5,1,0.486781597137451172,0,True,False,True

Like 7DTD, you have to prepare for a regular horde-in this game, nightly. It has a twist - you can build a wide array of traps, engineer pathways and obstacles and lead those hordes into killing zones - which makes it a blast. Its just really fun seeing how your latest arrangement of obstacles and traps deals with the enemy each night, make improvements during the day and see again how they work out. 

Its also full of thoughtful details, like allowing you to break down structures and crafted items back into their original components, without penalty and the Take All button which makes cleaning up all the dropped loot way more practical. 

You also fight zombies solo, though you can pack your trap ingredients and bring them with you. But fighting them with just weapons is pretty fun, especially once you've upgraded the weapons.

83 hours I put into the game. WELL worth the entry fee. Sure it has the signs of a game early in it's development, but overall a great experience.

The story is short but mildly interesting, the base building and zombie trap kill tunnels are a lot of fun, zombies line the streets and occupy the buildings with good density, weapon variety is decent (bow combat is particularly nice), and animal hunting has meaning and purpose beyond just food.

   The building is very polished although some elements are not fully explained. It mostly it all works as intended. The traps are very satisfy to watch, although to be safe you cant actually sit and watch them work in many cases.  The path you intend them to go to must be very simple however. If you try to make them do too much they just give up and smash your walls. The AI randomly deciding to smash my walls or stairs is my absolute biggest dislike.
   
   The combat is ok. Melee feels a bit clunky, ranged weapons are good though.

   Another big area for me was progression.  The researching was fine, but scouring the map for ducks made me angry and it takes entirely too many bricks to upgrade to stone buildings.

As the game is right now I give an 7/10, but this is very dependent on if you have the patience to farm trees, bushes and rocks. The traps and building creativity are most of the score for me.  If you wanna make a zombie destruction factory this game lets you do that. It's neat.

   A word to the developers,  

Shorten the days but increase farming speed. You don't want to leave too much time to loot the houses and hunt or the player would lose the sense of urgency and get strong too quickly.  The days are unnecessarily long to accommodate the long time it takes to gather the raw resources.  I personally would buff the amount dropped from rocks trees and bushes.  If the harvesting speed was faster, then the player ends up having to travel even farther to get resources and the world starts looking empty.  Everything else is pretty solid.  Thank you for a fun game! You guys did good.

The second try we could join the server. We walked around for a bit whilst having around 40 fps. The Zombies didn't even bother attacking us, they just stood there and didnt care about anything.

After we found the first little village, I found an AR-15 + a lot of ammo, wich IMO shouldn't be able to get that fast, considering there are a many weapons that are worse than that. So it makes the rest of the weapons kinda pointless.

- A bit of an RPG component with the order in which you research your upgrades and upgrade your items.
- I had zero crashes and the only major FPS drop I saw was when I tried to break the game. =)
- The only real downsides are rough edges like somewhat vague quest goals and 1 supposedly missing recipe.

Keep in mind that this game is not designed for infinite play. Harvested resources stay harvested and looted buildings stay looted. You are supposed to complete the story and win the game.
That said - it can be played far longer than the devs no doubt intended and you get some nice crazy hordes. =)",1599227082,1599227082,True,3,0,0.577634751796722412,0,True,False,True

* Simple survival mechanics that keep you on your toes, but doesn't intrude. 
* Tower defense is fun, but hard. You can't survive beyond night 1 without traps and gear. It doesn't feel unfair or conceited in any way. The game makes you work for it basically. 
* Gear and materials is readily available, even at the start area. 
* The map is bloody huge! Not only that, but it is diverse and has A LOT of indoor areas. I have yet to zone. 
* The enemies are fun to attack and are very diverse, considering how early in the early access period we are.
* Weapons feel good and you can upgrade them and other equipment you find.
* Lots of clothes to customize your character's appearance. 
* Multiplayer needs work. It's quite buggy. The game seems to be best as single player at the moment (September 2020). Considering how well this game is made I expect them to have it running smoothly soon.

On top of that the game has a story with an end goal, and the world feels BIG. Fight is not overwhelming but enemies are dangerous enough that you need to respect them.

The world isn't fully destructible -- very few survival/crafting games have that -- but mechanics, gameplay, tech tree, weapons, crafting are all solid. I've seen people asking when it is going to come out on console already!

I want to start off by saying what this game isn't. Despite what it might appear to be, it's not an open world zombie survival game. Are there zombies? Yup. Are you supposed to survive? You betcha. Is it open world? Technically. But what this game really is is a treasure hunt hidden in a tower defense game. There is almost no survival elements (apart from a fatigue system that is very easy to manage with basic scavenging), and the point of the game is to find a series of items in order so that you can escape, thus winning the game. If you enjoy trying to optimize your time management or finding the perfect combination in a tower defense, then this game is for you.

I picked this game up because I stumbled across Kage848's videos on youtube the day before it released, and it grabbed my attention as a base building zombie game. I was surprised I hadn't heard anything about it before then, and when I tried to look up information I couldn't find squat. However, for some reason this piqued my curiosity even more and I decided to buy the game and give it a shot. I'm glad I did.

However, this game is still rather shallow in it's current state, but what is there is addictive in a way that's hard to describe. The building process is complicated and running between different crafting tables gets annoying, but at the same time you start to remember what each piece needs and stocking up on the required materials. You start to beat the system just like you beat the zombies, and its rewarding to see a base grow after struggling with the initial setup. I couldn't make it beyond night 2 on my first play-through, but once I understood the concept I started over and escaped the island on day 6.

[b]If you do decide to give it a try, here's some hints to get you through the first few hours (since there's still virtually no information out there):[/b]
[spoiler]- Don't try to build a large sprawling base by yourself, you'll spend too much time and it's not needed. a 3x3 is plenty.
- a good gauntlet layout is key for large hordes in later nights, but when the zombies come in one at a time you should fight them with your weapon of choice outside your base. save your resources for later nights when the numbers become overwhelming!
- a good tip for your trap gauntlet (that worked for me anyway), is to build your traps on top of foundations in lanes, then place walls on the sides to box them in and limit wasted shots from your turrets. and don't use doors, ever. zombies get cranky when you start using doors.
- if you misplace something in your build, you can break it down for 100% of its cost with the hammer. 
- your first priority for research should be your carry capacity, and your first upgrades should be for your resource bag. you're going to fill up very fast and waste a lot of your first two days running back and forth to drop off loot.
- stop and mine EVERY iron node you come across, regardless of what you're doing. you need a lot of copper in the end-game and its incredibly rare. You're best bet is to try to collect it as you go, starting as early as possible.
- pick a goal for yourself: if you want to escape the island, you should prioritize at least 1/3 of your day to reaching the items you need to leave. if you just want to see how long you can make a base survive the horde nights, you should spend that time looting as much as possible to keep your stockpiles full.

[b]Ac33D:[/b] One of the worst game i played
[b]Me:[/b] sorry, you barely play survival Games, at least what your Profile shows and you just played 1,5 Hours of the EA Game Version here, that just released some days ago. #Facepalm

[b]Ac33D:[/b] I don't know if the very positive evaluations are fake or what but it does not deserve it, 7 days to day is way better than this, this game is overpriced, worth 5$ not 20$, why:
[b]Me:[/b] Sorry but the very positive evaluations are far away from beeing Fake! When you knew 7 Days to Die from the early beginnings, when it has his own EA Start, you would understand how well this Game runs and works already so early. 

[b]Ac33D:[/b] 1) This game has no ambiance, the game is sad, you can just stay and sleep while walking nothing will happen.
[b]Me:[/b] Ambiance and overall activity could be better yes, but also again here, its far from beeing that worse, as you call it. Seems you never got that far away from your spawn, never meet special Zombies and also seems you never meet a ""Bear"" XD

[b]Ac33D:[/b] 2 ) The locations, props are the same everywhere, interiors are emptys.
[b]Me:[/b] True, many houses and buildings are pretty empty, but that is normal in an EA Game, so im sure they will do changes here for a better Feeling, cause some shops are really well made and full of stuff inside.

[b]Ac33D:[/b]  3) The zombies/AI are not smart, you can easily bypass them by running and they are not even scary, they almost looks like humans.
[b]Me:[/b] Yes, especially in the beginning the Zombies arent that smart and overall the KI isnt that great, but after some days you get other Zombies, they charge, they Jump, they have Combos and some surprises for you! And if you played on easy, no wonder you are not fine with the missing action.

[b]Ac33D:[/b] 4)  The horde ? i had to run in the crowd to find it, nothing really happened, oh yes, there was a music for once.
[b]Me:[/b] The Horde starts really easy in the beginning, it takes time till they reach you and its really not much on Day 1 or 2. They just arive step by step trying to kill you. But you get more and more Zombies, then also a Final longer Wave with many Zombies, like a Horde. Then you understand, why the tutorial gives you so soon the first Traps. They are really helpful with the Hordes and often fun!

[b]Ac33D:[/b] 5) The optimisation is terrible, with an GTX1060 3GB+i5 8500 except a lot of freezes, with an GTX1070+i7 6700k its not glorious (~50 fps in ultra and sometimes little freezes)
[b]Me:[/b] Never had freezes so far and a friend that i play together with, also had no issues so far. And with my 2060 im totally okay. Some dropdowns with Frames isnt great, but i already know, that they will fix it and one day it will run much smoother on Multiplayer.

[b]Ac33D:[/b] 6) This game is very boring even with friends, except to do the same things, see the same things over and over.
[b]Me:[/b] Yeah, joining the Game with EA and expecting everything needs to be Awesome till Endgame, even in best Case, they should already have DLC´s ready to sell hmmm?  

[b]Ac33D:[/b] Do not listen to thoses streamers or good reviews.
[b]Me:[/b] Please People, just read or listen good reviews, or maybe streamers, cause they arent fake at all. Since last weekend when the Game started, they did 7 Hotfixes. For an EA Survival Game, im surprised how good many things are already working. And dont get me wrong, opinions are always allowed and needed, that ppl understand, what they maybe can expect from a Game, but its always a Matter of Taste.

These negative review people have no sense for potential and what they really want. Most of them have 20 minutes played and quit before seeing special zombie types or getting to finish the story or see the bigger hordes over the days on different difficulties which I have yet to see still.

My only gripes with the game is no inventory sort button and the optimization.
I run a R5 2600, RTX 2060, 32gb Ram(2133mhz) 1TB SSD and the game on mix of medium/high reaches 60 fps but it stutters alot and freezes. Which of course will be fixed in some time.

Listen to the positives and enjoy a future gem that could overthrow most of the zombie games on the steam lists. It's not a sandbox survival and it's not a fast pace zombie shooter, it's not a open world PvP apocalypse game. It's something very different but feels refreshing and fun.

1. The traps alone are worth the price of admission. Seldom has a game made me cackle like a wee schoolgirl, but these traps are glorious.
2. Combat is a little unrefined, but not too objectionable.
3. Building/scavenging can be a bit grindy, but the developers have been very responsive so far and have improved things considerably in the span of a few days.

Con: The biggest complaint is that objects (walls, work benches, traps, etc.) are not movable. This is a fairly big drawback due to the building system which can be a bit finicky (e.g. object placement.)

-Hints of Story are great
-Building things is easy once you get used to the system
-After difficultly patch a little while ago zombies seem quite balanced. 
-Graphics are good enough, better then you would expect honestly. 
-Zombie types are easy to notice, but still require a bit of skill to be dealt with
-Tons of traps, great for TD players. Traps have a number of uses before they have to be reset.
-Plenty of building options for dealing with base customization, and for base defense.
-Large research tree.

Cons
 -Tutorial could be better. It walks you though how to do things, but not really picking out a good spot. I recommend clearing a building and making a base out of it.
-Locked in gathering of things. Once you start you finish. No idea if being attacked stops you as I have yet to have it happen
-Zombie AI is OK, however there are a few times where it is noticeable that they have to stop for a moment to calculate where to path to you.

Overall it is 100% worth the current asking price of $25 USD. It seems the devs are listening to the community and fixing the issues that are happening when they come up. There have been some mentions of multiplayer issues with larger groups of players, however I have yet to test multiplayer. Out of the pros/cons listed above, The best pro would be the base defense, while the worst con is the lock in during gathering. Base defense really feels smooth and the amount of things you can craft, even while in EA, is amazing. The lock in during the gathering of things sort of sucks, however this never lasts longer then a few of seconds. I would also like to note that during the 1-2 weeks before Beta release and the week following, the devs have updated the game with hot fixes every couple of days to fix issues as they come in, even though the team size is smaller.

Night of the Dead is a promising open world zombie survival. The crafting is not hard to figure out and unlike most early access games, the UI is laid out  relatively well. The base building may take an hour or two to grasps at most and is similar to Rust and the Forest. You can rotate and snap pieces.

Warning ""Early access game you will encounter issues.""

would be nice to have more optimization on multiplayer. 

Been trying to play with a Buddy that lives in Oklahoma I'm in California and half the time his server won't pop up until we restart the game. Once the game is restarted and i try to connect to the server it does not connect until I spam enter and hit cancel a couple of times. 

I'm pretty decent with testing things out so I can manage to get into the server but all my other buddies cannot figure it out. has anyone else had this issue? 

Also there's an option of IP connect but how do we know the IP to the server we created? 

Would be nice to drop a certain amount of items rather than a whole bundle of the specific Item.

This is an early access game you will encounter issues. But these developers LISTEN and thank you to the developers you guys are amazing.

 I bought the game on Friday and there has been many updates already at least 5 from what I see.

Possibly cut down the amount of time it takes to ""search"" items like maybe by  15% would be nice. 

Honestly it may seem Like i'm pointing out the problems but its because the developers listen so worth a shot. 

Great game overall Solo progression takes way more time.

Also would be awesome if we could rent out servers and edit the settings might make it easier for people to find servers.

Literally after I posted this review I seen this update will test and see how Multiplayer operates.

Simply because any multiplayer lobby you join may it be PvP or PvE the main spawn point (where the host spawned) is blocked off trapping you in the spawn. 5/6 servers joined had them blocked so I would suggest you play on a private match with your buddy or by yourself.  When you swing any melee weapon the hit box seems a bit off.  The spear was the most enjoyable one I found had a nice range and seemed to work really well. The game is a bit buggy and after placing down my crafting table in the middle of the floor it seemed to place on the edge of the foundation :/ not exactly sure why is did that but that's just my experience. Great graphics quality and tutorial was helpful (not really) didn't really indicate where to get any of the resources from you just kind of had to walk around and hit stuff to find out what gave you what type of resources.  The GOOD part about the crafting is that the item you are trying to craft the  game tells you what bench to locate it in to craft it. The build system was a bit weird trying to get use to. Anytime you would try to place a foundation it would automatically raise the foundation to the max height and from there you would have to lower it and adjust it to the ground level. Snapping foundation required you to lower it to the correct height before snapping was allowed. This game has great potential just some minor fixes. The looting is pretty good (Items would typical make since being found in the object) for example: you loot a Car = you would get a bit of rubber, Iron and so on (Related to the car). I would like to see the Dev team block off the spawns from being built in as so you couldn't block a player from entering the game (that's why they have password protected option) if the game is set to PUBLIC. Overall I would say if you play single player or just offline co-op then yes try it, unless you are like me and wanted a online multiplayer experience to play with new people then give the game some more time to develop then buy it.",1598941565,1598941565,False,1,3,0.417092978954315186,0,True,False,True

Obviously, like most EA titles, there are bugs, but nothing game breaking, and they are barely noticeable, besides the weird hit detection / object collision. On one hand, NOTD is bare bones as far as building, crafting, and researching new items to craft are concerned. On the other hand, noticeable game design choices have problems; including low jump height, no option to vault over waist-high objects, walls, ect., as well as no line-of-sight indicator when one is crouched (i.e. an opening or closing eye, ect.). Also, when creating a character, there is no character creation option, at least currently. Furthermore, the female character in the game does not look like the one used in the games artwork, so hopefully that character model is an option in game or the female character model gets swapped with the artwork, she looks badass is why. Some have compared NOTD to 7DTD, and  NOTD reminds me a lot of 7DTD as well, in the best of ways, and I am very hopeful the developers do not follow the same route as the Fun Pimps did with 7DTD and change the game a thousand times over seven years before finally deciding on a vision. It would be fantastic to see a sandbox zombie survival game with a lot of choice on how to approach the zombie infested world get released, and with time NOTD could be the one. Overall, this game has amazing potential, looks and runs very well, and is very enjoyable, even with the lack of fleshed out / fully realized content.

It's only crashed once for me in almost 15 hours. I would also says there's a bit of mat rarity/balance issue going on currently, but the dev is currently active and adjusting/fixing the game. Overall, pleasantly surprised and happy with the purchase.

Tip - might want to trying on Peaceful mode until you get the hang of base/trap layout, then crank it up another couple notches. There are still Zs in peaceful mode, but they are crazy easy. Also, find the mansion in town with a giant pool in the backyard. There is 1 gate, so it's a perfect choke point to start your trap layout. I hear the prison is good as well. Maybe there's a bunch of places like this, i dunno. Hope you enjoy it like I am.",1598852701,1598889106,True,0,0,0.459923654794692993,0,True,False,True

Things it will do good at once updated
The engine will be every good, and the build will be solid and smooth. even in this early stage the resource gathering, building and combat isn't bad will be very satisfying by the time 1.0 comes out. Good start needs expanding.

Crafting will be good, lots of variety and the research point system is quite good, allows for progression at the rate of the player and the variety to obtain these points will be good.

Base building will also be good because of the Zombie AI mechanic to swarm, if the balance is right it will be a great open world sanbox tower defence kind of game.

Where this game could do well is following the ARK model of having a lot to explore and collect and being ruthless enough to take it all from the player.

Came across this gem while browsing the other day and took the plunge. Glad I did, because right out of the gate I'm liking what I see. I'm no game dev but for a 2 man team this is impressive. I'm gonna thumb it up. 

For those curious about the overall state/opinion of the game and what it offers...

Graphics - better than a lot of similar titles currently on offer, such as State of Decay series, Survive the Nights, 7DTD to name a few. I'd say it's a solid 7.5 to 8/10 depending on what settings you configure it up with.

Performance - extrapolate from here, but I used an I9 10900k paired with a RTX 2060 and got 1440p 60fps stable (with some minor dips when loading assets), this was with <Medium> settings but with <Very High> texture setting. Ram usage was around 10Gb, Vram usage around 5Gb and CPU usage was typically single digits to teens depending on what I was doing. It's worth noting on the medium preset the game looks great. Ultra looks a lot better but the performance decrease wasnt worth it. No crashes among my current play time. If they can shore up some of the optimization it would make my 8/10 score a 9 to 10 score, all in time I suppose right? Some asset popping in is currently noticable when traveling in the world, probably my biggest nitpick here tbh as I am using a Seagate Firecuda Nvme drive. Overall, a solid 8/10 for performance in its current state given the title is in early access. Quick edit: online, unfortunately performance is considerably worse but playable. It's all over the place fps wise when playing online, why is this?
Edit#2 - adjusting to low, except textures/AA at max matches performance in single player, as of 8.31.20...

Sound - I'm somewhere in between 6.5 to a 7 here. Gun sounds could use some work, the zombie sounds are nice and there is enough ambience to get immersed overall. 

Content - for day one, there's a lot to play with. There's pve, pvp, single and multiplayer. Go it alone, or get help from others, fairly big world to explore and lots of things to research and craft.

Value - I'm fine with the price, if things progress with the integrity it has launched with up through official launch I think we could have a solid game here for many to enjoy.

Final overall feeling on the score...

8/10, would recommend.",1598687325,1598871840,True,138,3,0.865518331527709961,1,True,False,True

https://youtu.be/hlsG8ZmsLOM

I must say, this game is shaping up very well. Base building is pretty solid but missing some components such as roofs (unless I have not learnt them yet in the skills tree), placement and snapping works as expected. Building zombie traps and seeing them in action is loads of fun.

There is a decent variety of zombie vampires, runners, jumpers, strong and slow, plus some very bizarre looking creatures. The idle state animations of some the zeds needs some polish at the time of this review, as they seem to basic or normal human like. I like how some zombies if not dispatched quickly enough give off loud grunts which seemingly attracts more of the dead nearby, this gives some urgency to dealing with them.

Wildlife are present in the game, rabbits, fox`s, deer and bears are present. I find the bears annoying though, while there are not many of them, they are relentless. Once they spot you, they do not give up chasing you down until you are dead, this needs some tweaking.

Melee combat is functional, maybe a little clunky.

Towns are nicely detailed, I have yet to get inside any of the buildings since the zombies have taken lodgings in those premises and I don`t have the tools or weapons yet to clear them out. But I can imagine that is going to be fun to do.

I like the looting, being able to strip components of vehicles in the world while not realistic, it gives more options to gain valuable resources. Balancing needs to be done when harvesting materials though, you get very little from chopping trees and bushes, but that will likely be sorted in time.

Every night hordes of zombies attack at your base with increased numbers and aggression each night, careful planning of base placement can make their undead lives difficult, and that is before you set any traps. The dev is actively balancing these events, these attacks can become intense and lots of fun to deal with.

if you like to kill zombies, if you like tower defense games, if you like Open world games, if you like Survival games ... this is a game for you. I went into this game knowing nothing about it but zombie, and killing them, so i bought it.

Down below I put a bit about how the game works



Your daily tasks include: 
      each wave (each day) is about 2 hours long real time, including wave time
      each wave starts at day #x Hour 0
1. Make sure you have food (its not really needed but good to have)
2. Make sure your Base is 100% from previous night.
3. Gather materials for the base defense.
4. Make sure you a decent weapon to survive the night.
4a. Food for melee based weapon, Ammo for a ranged
5. Upgrade you items and make them stronger helping you beat the night.
6. MOST IMPORTANT: SURVIVE THE WAVE OF ZOMBIES.

Having played through three game days I can see how I would restart as far as placement of base and approach, but there is a lot of possibilities. Anyway, I took a gamble and it paid off.

-Open world survival crafting game
-Zombies, good hitbox even at distance.
-Wide and complex crafting list.
-Perks/research list that actually support/aide in combat/crafting and overall life sustainability
-Large map with good looking POI and scenery
-Graphics is good if you can run it.

CONS:
-Not optimized yet, I have gtx 1070 and i get stable 80fps on low/medium and spikes down to 30~40 on high pop area like the city.
-Grinding in the early stage might push away newbies, but it gets easier as you progress with research.

Can't climb ladders.
Can't jump over waist high obsticles.
Can't destroy POI's like in 7D2D.
Can't build floors off of premade POI's.
Some POI's are shells and you can't enter them. (no real doors)
Zombies run till they are inches from you and swing through your body.
Lots of issues with hitbox issues on everything (zombies, rocks, trees)
Zombies and animals don't respect boundary boxes and walk/fly through structures/floors.
A little grindy but not too bad. (Not as bad as what some reviews have said.)
Sometimes, Zombies spawn real close to you (20 feet) from out of thin air for some reason, randomly.  
Love the traps/tower defense aspect. 
7 Days to Die is a much better game overall. (And with mods, it is great)

Only way I see this game becoming a success is if they shift focus to the traps/tower defense part of the game. A open world survival game with a ""Orcs Must Die"" aspect sounds cool to me.

The game has a rather big open world which I've had a really good time exploring. Base building is also quite fun, be it a bit clunky. There are tons of different traps and defences to build. 

Combat could use some work as there's no blocking or dodging and the AI is a bit off. The same assets are also used pretty much everywhere making it a bit repetetive.

So far so good for an early access title that's been out less than a week.  It's far more polished than some of its competitors at the same stage of release.  The game seems like it's going to be fun.  I'm almost to the first night and I don't quite feel prepared but I stocked up on arrows to fight off the horde that will soon be at my doorstep.  (Actually I don't have a door yet, so that might be a problem.)

The graphics are great and gameplay is smooth.  The zombie animation could use some work - more lurching and less walking like a regular person but I'm sure the current animations are placeholders.  I'd like to see harvesting tweaked a little.  Right now you only get one or two logs from chopping down a whole tree.

I watched a couple of Youtubers play before buying and I can already tell that the developers listen to feedback since several issues that were pointed out from the initial release already seem to be fixed.  The only ""bug"" I've encountered so far is when placing a foundations I could not make the last one level with the others in spite of snap being turned on.  I ended up having to go ahead and place it, then chop it down and then the new one was level with the others.

This is another zombie survival game, but this one focuses much more on building traps and fighting hordes every night. There are tons of different types of materials and items to collect, but fortunately the inventory is large.

Some complaints so far:

1. No way to move placed objects.
2. Bears aggro from way too far away, and they don't seem to ever give up chase (I tend to run them off a cliff if possible, otherwise it's a fight to the death.)
3. At the start of the game you get coordinates to the next story position. I'm fairly certain the coordinates are in (y, x) format instead of (x, y). This was misleading to me. I'd like it if my own coordinates were shown on the map alongside the indicator, as this could have been less confusing to me.
4. When placing objects, it would be nice if the UI wasn't covering up the center of the screen. It forces me into an awkward position to see my placement better.
5. Some items (namely the crafting stations) that you place down take up a lot of room, despite not visually taking up much room. For example, the materials station starts out with a small desk, and then after upgrading it, another area to the left, and finally an area to the right appear. This causes things to appear out of place when there are large gaps in my base layout, but once everything is upgraded it isn't so bad. In general, when placing objects, the area that they occupy seems to be larger than necessary.
6. Arrows roll far too much and make it difficult to re-gather.

Depending on the choice of difficulty, the game can be anything from a more casual and relaxed feeling to an all out nightmare. 
On the lowest difficulty, the game is very relaxed and not challenging at all. The hordes is slimmed down to just a handfull of zombies and the pose barely any threat.
On the highest difficulty however, the game is completely different. 
The hordes are much bigger, zombies and animals for that matter is serious threats, most things will oneshot you.
In other words, the game is for players in every skill level.

The base building and trap making takes elements from old defense games, such as dungeon keeper, during horde night (every night) you have options to funnel all zombies through the route you want them to take and plan your traps accordingly.
The base building itself, is like any other survival game.

The developers are working fast when there's issues and they engage actively with the community on the forums. Even though this game is still in early access, it doesn't feel as much so as most other early access games. It's way less buggy with more variety than most other games in this state.

All the way from Infestation: Survivor stories through H1Z1, DayZ and 7 Days to Die. I've played them all in early access and then come back later to check in. This is the most polished one I've seen at this stage. The graphics, sound and animations are all cool. Resource gathering is intuitive and sensible. I like the addition of animal traps and making various animal bones and skins necessary for equipment upgrades. The base building works really well too. My only criticism is that you can't move/reclaim stuff easily and, since it's all pretty expensive mats wise, this would be helpful. Storage could also do with a 'store all similar items' button (one of the best additions to 7 Days EVER!). There are various zombies with varying abilities and toughness. It's challenging but, also rewarding. The map seems pretty large so, if there aren't already, I hope for decent vehicles in the future and, perhaps other playable characters.

Mechanics- work very well
Building- actually a fair bit to do (although it does need more)
Traps- Various and a lot of fun to build and maintain (especially at night between midnight and 3am lol

1377380,75095283,76561198035356696,0,2,6510,0,499,1621358784,"Pros:
1) Huge map.  Hopefully devs will put in more unique loots as he progresses because so far the loots are pretty much the same stuff except for the occasional rifle. I see a lot of potential in this.

2) Great graphics. I don't think I need to explain this. Those who have watched the gameplay on YT probably know the graphics is top notch. And the loading is pretty smooth. Mist Survival's save/load gets bloated and clunky over time, but this game manages to avoid it despite the scale of it. 

3) Unique gameplay with some very creative ideas. Traps are kinda unique and fun, and this game goes all out on it. Expect a lot of crazy traps, and some times it can get really craaaazy and funny because how they work is kinda unpredictable. 

Cons:
1) Fight animations are glitchy AF. I killed the green zombie in the garden (the one with tons of HPs) by glitching him into the fountain so he gets stuck behind the railing, and stabbed him to death (over a long period of time lol) with a spear. His drops kinda sucks for the amount of work. 

During midnight horde run, I have high HP mob bounce between different spiked barricade and ended up from the other side into my base. :S

2) Horde spawns at 12 midnight makes it predictable and kind of a chore. I am not sure how many people actually enjoy this. I certainly don't quite enjoy it. I understand this is the time when your traps really shine, but it is kinda boring standing there hitting ""Repair"" and ""Reload"".  I prefer the spontaneous nature of the mist in Mist Survival. 

3) Zombies are weak AF, and I am speaking from before the dev patched it yesterday to make them weaker (Why????). You are not suppose to stand there and go full mortal kombat with the zombies lol. Make the spear, 2 jabs - run around them - make them whiff their attacks - 2 jabs - rinse and repeat. I have not met any zombies so far that are able to counter this. The only enemy who pwns me is the bear. 

4) There isn't really much depth to the game in terms of base building. You make the tables, you make some basic floorings and stuff, and it is pretty much all traps from then on. Because of the glitchy mob animations, traps work kinda in unexpected ways rofl. Try it and see for yourself. :D

Tips:
1) Make a spear as soon as possible. It is so OP it is hilarious. Avoid completing the combo into the 3rd hit. It leaves you very open. The hitbox of the tip of the spear seems to be slightly shorter than the actual 3D model, so attack with that in mind. 

2) Uneven foundation is OP. Remember, you can jump, the zombies can't (some can, very few of them and nothing you can't take care of). Place your real base on elevated platform, unaccessible by any stairs. To get there, you must make a jump. Then build a fake base accessible by stairs, perhaps on the side, and lay all your traps there. I built it in such a way that I can hop back to my real base from the fake base if I need to. 

When midnight horde run comes, position yourself at the fake base as bait, behind all your traps, and get ready for a mindnumbing in-game 3hrs. 

CONCLUSION:
This is an early access game, and considering that, it is a pretty top notch game. I believe a lot of the cons will be fixed with time. 

This game is definitely worth a play.",1598683215,1598683215,True,3,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Pros:
- The graphics are leaps and bounds better than most of the alpha survival games I've played, and I've played a few!
- Progression seems linear with better items coming along as you build one layer/crafting bench at a time. No skills/gear locked behind progress walls/skills/levels.
- Zombies move FAST! But they can be killed with 3-8 arrows. I've seen people insta-kill with headshots, I haven't experienced it yet.

Cons
- Hitboxes are messed up for both resources and zombies. When using your axe on a tree, you have to stand right in front of the tree with your character's nose to it before the first axe hit will land. Once the tree is highlighted, moving backward to increase range where the visual axe blade is striking the tree mostly works. Shrubs and saplings are even worse.
- The wall for crafting seems to be cloth. Cloth can come from most boxes/crates and sometimes from cars but the randomness of it, and the fact that you can't craft cloth will leave you in a lurch. Maybe up the drop rate on cloth or make it craftable? Or make rope (which is vital for beginning building) craftable via vines alone, or allow us to gather grass and use that to create rope.
- You're given a pen knife to start and when you equip it, there's a 70/30 chance you'll use it to kill zombies. Sometimes I hit the hotkey and I'll end up just punching zombies instead of using the knife to slash. 
- I consider this a pro (since I prefer not to engage in combat) but I know it's something that needs to be worked on: bows. The fire rate of the bow is ridiculous. I can spam-fire 5 arrows into a zombie before its rage/hulk smash animation is finished and kill it before it starts running toward me. Again, I love it, but I know that there should be some kind of knock & cock delay for loading, pulling, and firing a bow.

I'll play through a few in-game nights and update but for now, it's an okay game. The funky hit boxes for resources and zombies in a game all about hitting and gathering resources and killing zombies makes it tedious pretty quickly, though. I'd give it a thumbs down but since it warned us that it's an early access game... for early access, it's not bad.",1598681992,1598681992,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Your basically laying traps out that smash, bash, dice and squish zombies for the horde that comes every night. I've been through two and they definitely start picking up. First horde was like a single zombie at a time with a few at the end. Second one was like three or so at a time.

First impression was that it's probably made to be a mobile game.

Animations are 5/10. But the chick in the loading screen is super hot ngl.
When you attack the undead they either run away like a human or they fight back and go away the moment they get hit.
Interior design is non-existent it's like a kid or me designing something in the sims, some of the models look like they were made for the PS1 or PS2. What I like is the addition of a Katana and the dismemberment and that in fact it is a zombie game focused on you know.. zombies.

Extremely grindy game. Many items you craft need 20 of something, and one felled tree gives you 1 of this thing. (leaf for example)
The nightly horde sounds good at first, until you find out that its only a survive until you can't anymore scenario. the horde gets bigger each day, and you just grind, and grind enough stuff for your traps... Better play some asia-grinder mmo, much less grinding, more fun.
Very static environment. Only some boulders and trees can be removed, most of the things are just static, even small ones, like benches, Tables, etc cannot be destroyed or moved. Very boring. After 5 minutes you exactly know which of the 
 5-10 different non-static items yields which ressources. 
Game loop is as follows: Scavenge 30 removable items -> build trap; rinse and repeat until nighttime. Kill zombies and get killed. rinse and repeat; go to step1.

The good parts: Graphics is nice, female protagonist is available,

It's early access and already really good. There are going to be obvious frustrations as well since it's early access i.e. bigger chests having the same inventory slots as small chests.

The graphics are really nice even on a low end PC and i really like the character animations. 
Definitely for being in alpha, I am really impressed and enjoying the feel of the game and exploring the map.

I can't wait for more updates and content for this game!

This game lacks a lot of basic things... Not being able to turn off Motion Blur, kinda already is a very needed addition for me + some AZERTY support would be nice too. Also for the multiplayer a party would be nice so the tutorial items don't waste too much of your early resources.

I will gladly keep updated with the updates and might buy again once they end up updating this game more and more.

As for my recommendation is neither good or bad, the game is not bad and definitely doesn't deserve a bad rating for day 1. But it's not quite there yet for a yes either.",1598612905,1598612905,True,5,0,0.53987729549407959,0,True,False,True

Played single player only for an hour and it already felt addicting, definitely going to play a lot more.

Comparing this to 7dtd, it's missing digging and voxels, but there's everything else you want from the zombie apocalypse.

Those who love base building with survival elements will definitely like this game. The gameplay is similar to Conan exiles. For a two man team this is rather impressive, if the dev gets more support im sure the game can grow. 

The animations in this game however needs some rework imo, especially when gathering items. The weird knife animation must be changed.",1598601631,1598601631,True,4,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True
