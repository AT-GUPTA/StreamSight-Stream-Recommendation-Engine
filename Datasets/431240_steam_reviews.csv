.) Glitches where you are stuck in the wall (very rarely)
.) After you released your shot, in party mode you can e.g. double jump etc. For some reason, sometimes the game doesn't give you time to use these abiltites because it shows the next player even though the ball is still rolling. VERY UNFAIR AND ANNOYING!
.) Every user can use their inputs in other players turns using steam remote play (just be careful)

If they would fix these bugs this game would be very amazing, but the 2nd point always triggers us so much at some point that we don't want to play it anymore.

This is a fun game, it has developed to a point that it is hard to resist. It's a fun side game and a lot of fun with friends. There is a crap ton of courses to choose from and they all have lots of challenges. It's cool that you can modify your game to allow jumping and contact with other balls and adjust pretty much anything for your round of play. Highly recommend this game to play on your own or with friends. Suggest you stay away playing on pubs as there are many who know all the holes-in-one ways..and yes, there are griefers who will purposely hit your ball (if physical contact is on) just to screw you up or piss you off. Again can be avoided playing with friends or just finding another game or hosting yourself your own little game.

We just tried to play this on LOCAL multi-player, but it will not accept 2 or 4 controllers, whichever controller starts the game, it will only use that 1 controller, this must have been broken on the last update,. so pi55ed off with Team 17 for not sorting this game, why not just copy the system from Zen's infinite Mini Golf, the controllers and avatars in that are perfect, shame the game is screwed, we use to love that too! 


Just played this for the first time with Remote Play Together - we played the 1st course without any issues, great fun and lovely graphics.
We then played the Worms course, OMG it's full of bugs guys - the ball lands out of bounds, it stays there, making you lose that hole. 
The views on the ball are shocking, it was ok to hole 15 then it was shocking, like the camera was sat on the ball, impossible to see where you aiming/shooting and the clipping on the ball was terrible, like the camera going in the ball. 

During playback, all players can take control of the ball, this needs to be isolated to each player like Infinite Mini Golf, otherwise another player could sabotage your go, either on purpose or by accident.
I have been told by Team 17 this is down to Remote Play Together, I will try on I.M.G. later and see if the same issues arises as we know that does not happen in local multiplayer normally :) 

Even though the option to ALWAYS SHOW FLAG is ON, the flag was not always shown, on the larger courses on Worms Levels this made it total guess work to know where to aim :/ 

It did not always show where the other players ball was on the course.

It is V1 so hopefully this will be fixed very soon, but I bought this game in Alpha and got refunded due to the amount of bugs, so very surprised to see it hit retail and still be buggy - Luckily Team 17 are an awesome bunch and I have faith in them to fix this game :) 


I will say I recommend this game as it has massive potential, we play I.M.G. every Thursday but this could be our new go to Golf game if the bugs are fixed :)

--------------------------UPDATED -------------
After revisiting the game after several months, I've just posted this - read it before you buy it! 

Issues on Local OFFLINE Mode
This week my partner and I have had another go at this game, but still inundated by bugs that are infuriating.

Firstly, the players turn ends prematurely, so we cannot see where we are ending up on our go. We just played the level Space Station. and on Hole 17 I think it was, neither of us got the chance to steer in the water as it returned to the next player despite us not finishing our go, this meant we both got stuck and could not possibly get to the hole. On the same course my partner went out of bounds and her ball did not respawn, so she just had to waste her go.

The controllers still control the other players go, something I reported when I first got this game which was ages ago.

Player 1 always goes first, it should be whom ever won the hole goes first!

No RESTART HOLE option, much needed for when it glitches and leaves a player off the course :/

--------------- UPDATE ----------
Played quite a few courses now locally with family, the go ends prematurely on all levels - just now on Hole 18, I got the ball in the hole but my go and ended so and it came up that I had run out of shots - pretty crap considering I got in the hole! This needs fixing urgently!

Also, aside from the issue that all controllers work all of the time, the game remembers the last players camera angle, not each players, this could do with fixing too.

If you want to see how this should work then play Infinite Mini Golf, this game has the turn system perfect.

It would also be much better if players could have names and it remembered the settings for each Player instead of having to change the colours etc every single time we play.

This game has potential but it's faaaaar form being right!",1590095824,1703431967,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

""This game is one of my favorite games on Steam due to the current build and what I have already seen happen. This game outshines all similar golf games i've seen on Steam; for example, I have really enjoyed playing rounds of golf where we have been acorns, cones, even Christmas ornaments causing some insane and funny rounds. Now that's only if you specifically select to have random ball shapes, but the game is still very fun, and with the level editor I have made 2 levels the first was fun to listen to them but outside of the bugs being ironed out it is a very good experience and I am looking forward to the assets they make, and the other future content."" but with how the devs have been I can't really recommend this game anymore.

What changed between?
A couple maps got added so with the base game I do kinda recommend it as they haven't touched it and I still might play it with friends but that said I lost all respect for this game and the devs when I saw this get marked up 300% and 250% respectively to where with the 50% off for the 2023 christmas sale had 2 maps ALREADY RELEASED to where the 18 was ""let's add $1.50"" and the 9 hole one was ""let's take off just .50 cents"" This change might have happened a lot sooner than around christmas but after the main date but still why I stopped recommending this game is how the devs just seem very greedy and rather than trying to make it better just be effectively doing ""Let's just use inflation explain how we're trying to further line our pockets by raising the price on DLC that was barely worth the original price if that"".
Mark my words though devs if you are reading this and thinking ""Oh raising the price of the game is a good idea"" you better have a lot better reason for increasing the price of the base game more than ""Inflation"" and if you don't or give no reason at all I will never play this game or any other game from you again no matter what.

tl;dr good base game and great community but your fair warning is these devs have gotten a lot greedier over the years hence why I no longer recommend what was at one point one of my favorite games.",1491062753,1703293712,False,0,0,0.493258804082870483,0,True,False,True

The Armenian genocide was the systematic destruction of the Armenian people and identity in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Spearheaded by the ruling Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), it was implemented primarily through the mass murder of around one million Armenians during death marches to the Syrian Desert and the forced Islamization of others, primarily women and children.

Before World War I, Armenians occupied a somewhat protected, but subordinate, place in Ottoman society. Large-scale massacres of Armenians had occurred in the 1890s and 1909. The Ottoman Empire suffered a series of military defeats and territorial losses—especially during the 1912–1913 Balkan Wars—leading to fear among CUP leaders that the Armenians would seek independence. During their invasion of Russian and Persian territory in 1914, Ottoman paramilitaries massacred local Armenians. Ottoman leaders took isolated instances of Armenian resistance as evidence of a widespread rebellion, though no such rebellion existed. Mass deportation was intended to permanently forestall the possibility of Armenian autonomy or independence.

On 24 April 1915, the Ottoman authorities arrested and deported hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and leaders from Constantinople. At the orders of Talaat Pasha, an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million Armenians were sent on death marches to the Syrian Desert in 1915 and 1916. Driven forward by paramilitary escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to robbery, rape, and massacres. In the Syrian Desert, the survivors were dispersed into concentration camps. In 1916, another wave of massacres was ordered, leaving about 200,000 deportees alive by the end of the year. Around 100,000 to 200,000 Armenian women and children were forcibly converted to Islam and integrated into Muslim households. Massacres and ethnic cleansing of Armenian survivors continued through the Turkish War of Independence after World War I, carried out by Turkish nationalists.

This genocide put an end to more than two thousand years of Armenian civilization in eastern Anatolia. Together with the mass murder and expulsion of Assyrian/Syriac and Greek Orthodox Christians, it enabled the creation of an ethnonationalist Turkish state, the Republic of Turkey. The Turkish government maintains that the deportation of Armenians was a legitimate action that cannot be described as genocide. As of 2023, 34 countries have recognized the events as genocide, concurring with the academic consensus.",1702802106,1702802106,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Even so, this game has many frustrating parts.
Biggest issue i have is the par system, doing the course as intended you would have to do it near perfect to get par. which means you really have to ""cheat"" and really go wild to get better scores, and lets not mention pure luck
The real big issue is the jumping, many a time i would click jump and there would be a significant delay, i keenly noticed this while going fast, and its just frustrating because its hard to do fancy tricks when there is a delay.
As well as ""recently"" (I don't know when but it wasn't this way the last time i played) sometimes when you bounce out of bounds and then back in, you still get reset, even though you ended up back on the green. but not all times, and so that just adds to my frustration

Edit: November 27th 2023
I made the mistake of playing this game again, holy hell its still terrible. I played the Egypt(?) styled map, the hole with the mound literally had me hitting invisible barriers at the edge of the bowl on the top of the mound. so instead of going into the bowl and hole, I instead would roll back down to the bottom of the hole.

And STILL you can barely go off the edge, end up on the green and get reset, like the last hole I did I bounced in the water, landed on the green, was there for a second or 2 and then as I prepared to line up the next shot I was reset back to where I shot from.

I like the putting controls. It's basically an aiming arrow and you push your mouse forward or backward depending on how hard you want to hit the ball; you don't have to make a swing motion. Very nice.

What I don't like is that sometimes you literally can't see where the end of the course is. The flag/hole is either obscured or in some crazy direction you wouldn't think to look (even under you). You can free look around the course for a few seconds, but after that, you're blocked on you have to take your shot. You will unfortunately be able to see areas that you've already played, or will play, and this confuses you as to whether that area is part of the hole that you're on.

I was having a whole lot more fun streaming this game with friends and viewers than when I was sat alone trying to polish off the last couple of achievements. I think there could be more optimization for the workshop, but that's not the core game anyways. I think it's a good game for what it is, and I'd reccomend picking it up if you don't have it already. Just make sure you know someone that has the game or is willing to buy it to play with you, because that's what makes this game its most fun.

Side-note, that 10k put achievement is legitimately the longest grind ever. Even if you can rack up a 100 put game going quickly, you would need to play through 100 games before getting the achievement. In my experience, I could get through a map after about 10 minutes, which means that this achievement alone takes anywhere from 16 to 17 hours going quickly. A bit brutal, to say the least.

EDIT: They devs are now locking achievements behind playing courses that are paid DLC. You can technically get them by playing in public lobbies that have people who have bought them, but good luck getting below par on a one off game.

Haven't touched the Workshop but at least you can create a course and upload it for others to play too, which is quite nice.

Sadly its quite buggy, specially in the alternative gamemodes like dunk and hockey, and unless you REALLY want to aim for 100% completion, some of the DLCs are not worth the money, like the last one at writing time (Peaceful Pines) that's worth more than 3 times the bouncy castle DLC.

So I was in an abusive relationship throughout 2021-2022. I won't get into the details, but it was pretty extreme, and included controlling who I could speak to/the friendships I could have, for how long I could be with them, and so on. I was very trauma-bonded to this person - I could not see how bad it was. I knew I was miserable, I knew it was abusive, but I was making excuses and I couldn't bring myself to leave or even to stand up for myself.

I was finally 'allowed' to have a game night with my best friend for an hour, and on that game night we played Golf With Your Friends. It was the first time we'd played (though we'd both seen YouTubers play it before), and we started off with the Forest map - and it was the hardest I'd laughed since my relationship began. Tears in my eyes, hysterics, non-stop laughing. I later found out that my mother had been outside my bedroom door listening, because she hadn't heard me laugh in so long.

That was one of the first steps in realising I had to get out, and the best friend I played with that night is now my fiancee.
Less heavily, this has been the background game for so many good conversations with my friend groups. It's always so much fun - often people will be reluctant to try it because, well, 'Golf With Your Friends' doesn't sound like a very appealing and exciting game on the surface to most of them, but once we're in it everyone is yelling and laughing and asking me when we can play it again.

The official courses are pretty good and have a decent amount of variety, but once you're done with them the real fun is in the custom/Steam Workshop courses. Sort by popular/most liked, check the comments to make sure there are no glitches that might prevent you from finishing, and go wild. There are some genuinely creative gems in there.

I've played other golf games, and this one has my favourite controls and general graphics. They're pretty smooth and easy to get accustomed to in my experience, and I very rarely, if ever, got frustrated with the game for making me fuck up as a result of a glitch or bad gameplay - any errors I make are entirely my own.

The customisation is cool - loved the cosmetics you can unlock for finishing courses, and my ball is now rolling around with a halo and angel wings. I also enjoy my little swan-boat float.",1656169432,1698856993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I first played this game on the Xbox in 2020, and my frustration with it hasn't changed since then! Sure, some of the holes in this game are straight bullshit that give me the burning hatred to smash my keyboard into a million pieces, but I'd be damned if that wasn't the same reason for my enjoyment with this game! 

This game is best played with friends, so invite friends to play and get a party going as you'll cry, laugh, and argue with your friends as you all play through hours of courses trying to one-up each other for bragging rights. Add collision to the equation and witness aggression levels increase as you bump others away from their perfect shot. And even after you've played through all the base game courses, you can visit the workshop and browse hundreds of user created courses that'll ensure the fun never ends!

Whether it's becoming overjoyed from hitting a hole in one, the sigh of relief after conquering a hole after 12 frustrating strokes, or laughing at your friends terrible shot, this game will have you displaying every emotion know to man!

There's A Wide Selection Of Maps To Chose From To Play On Made By Team17, But There Are Maps Created By Other Players Which You Can Play Too.
On Golf You Can Play Either Solo, With Friends Or On Public Online Servers And You Can Add Mutators Which Add Little Fun Bonuses To The Game Like Low Gravity, Allow Jumping, No Collision With Other Players, Different Ball Shape etc.
There Are Different Game Modes Too Like Basketball Where You Have To Jump Into A Hoop As A Bouncy Basketball Or The Game mode Hockey Where You Have To Get a Hockey Puck Past A Goalkeeper And Into The Goal.
You Can Also Customise Your Ball Too With Hats, Different Colors, Trails And More.

For this review I am going to split it into two segments. One being for the casual player that does not care for achievements, and the other being for achievement hunters and for those who enjoy trying to 100% games. TLDR: I do recommend this game for casual players and for those that want a fun game to play with friends but I [b] DO NOT [/b] recommend for achievement hunters at all.


[h2] Breakdown For Casual Players [/h2]
Generally speaking, this game is a great game to play either alone or with friends. There is a large variety of maps to choose from without spending any money on downloadable content and each time you play you can expect a fun and interactive shared experience. Some of the maps are hard to master and some are a lot easier. Of course if you need a guide, there are plenty of guides available through steam. I will leave a link to my personal favourite guide below.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2167218162] Golf With Friends Hole In One / Par Guide [/url]

Breaking this down a little further, the game has a unique soundtrack for each course that you play and there are a range of unique aspects such as gravity changes, ghost walls and more. These all add for a unique and fun experience when compared to other more simplistic crazy golf games.

The only issue in this game I have found so far is how your ball can glitch or phase through walls and getting stuck when shot at a high power. This is EXTREMELY frustrating, especially when near the end of a course and you are in PAR, forcing you to forfeit a shot because you cannot physically move the ball resulting in a maximum of 14 points. On certain maps this can happen 8-9 times out of 10 and it gets very annoying very quickly. Probably the only downside to this game but I must say it is quite a big one at that.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game for anyone looking for something fun to do with friends and wants a good laugh. It is somewhat fun to play alone but it is a lot better with friends, but then I guess that is obvious as it is in the name of the game.


[h2] Breakdown For Achievement Hunters [/h2]
So, you like collecting achievements huh? Well this game is going to drive you up the wall if that is the case.
Most games that have achievements have all of the base achievements unlocked when you first buy the game and if they have downloadable content achievements then they will normally all be unlocked through a one-time paid DLC that receives regular updates. Is this the case for Golf With Your Friends? NO of course not.

Golf With Your Friends has an insane amount of DLC courses which normally would not be an issue. You choose the ones that you like the most, buy them and get on with your day. However, ALL of these DLC course packs come with multiple achievements. This means that when they release a new (and expensive) course pack, you are forced to buy it if you want to keep this title in your list of games that you have perfected. If the courses were maybe £1.99 each or something then maybe it would not be as bad, but their most recent course costs a whopping £7.99. Now this may not seem like a big deal but when you compare it to the game's cost of £10.99, this is an ABSURD price tag for a single course with only 18 holes. And if you were to buy all of the course DLC packs, you would be paying OVER the original cost of the game at a total of £12.00.


[h1] Review Conclusion [/h1]
To conclude, I want to say that I do indeed recommend this game but only for casual players. If you are an achievement hunter there are many thousands of other games that you could spend time on and not have to pay an absurd amount every couple of months to keep the game perfected. Of course, if spending money is not an issue for you, then I would recommend it to you anyway. But honestly, I would not support the developers of this game with buying the DLC. They are just greedy and only care about the money that they make from the game.",1695214559,1695214988,True,1,0,0.495226353406906128,0,True,False,False

The game works pretty fine from what we experienced, the odd lag/glitch here and there, sometimes our balls got stuck though we chalked that up to us getting it in unconventional areas. Then the new courses started to release as DLC where only one person needed to pay for others to play as well, and again we didn't mind *too* much because we were getting decent value for a half hour maybe of fun with each course pack of DLC. The problem is when the company announced price hikes for the previous DLC, and then priced their (at the time of this review) newest DLC for nearly $12CAD - WAY too much for a single DLC compared to the game's base price (about $17.50CAD). They've slowly started losing touch with their community and there isn't enough drive to want to support them if they're banking on those few folks who shell out for it/the achievements. It's a shame because it really was a lighthearted and upbeat game, but it isn't a *long* game you go back to very often and definitely not worth the inflated prices. Ultimately if you get this game on sale super cheap you'll find good value - or if they do a free weekend and you wanna dink around with friends.

When I got the game, it was being developed solely by the original developer, Blacklight Interactive. $14.99 for fun with friends, absolutely. I have certainly gotten my money's worth. Is it still buggy and issues that have been long known of gone unfixed, yes. So if you were to just pick up the base game, you're good, even with unfixed bugs. Between the base courses and workshop courses, you have plenty of gameplay to get your money's worth, especially with friends. 

Now, the topic of DLC. It wasn't worth the price when it came out and now with Team17 being even more involved, they recently announced a hike in the price of DLC content, new AND old. They are increasing the price of the mediocre OLD DLC by 300% as well as new DLC coming out 2-3 times the price they used to release courses and cosmetics at. 

Avoid the DLC at all costs and just download courses from the workshop. They are more fun than any of the DLC courses, and many are much more refined. 

It pains me to see Team17 making so many decisions that clearly are not going to be well received from the player base. I understand inflation, I understand increased costs, I understand wanting to profit. However, releasing mediocre at best with super inflated prices is not how you do that. If they ever do anything to monetize the workshop, I will change my review to a negative one.

Also, the night of the review writing, my friends and I were plagued with network disconnect errors, so hopefully this isn't going to become a regular issue.",1694768948,1694768948,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't know how people that aren't me or my friends play this game, but I feel that the strength of this game is easily its editor and the community levels. I play the community levels far, *far* more than the official levels, so seeing that a new DLC pack is effectively $9 for a course I will play for 30 minutes tops is discouraging. More than anything, I look forward to a DLC map release for new assets to use in the editor, but I can't in good conscience buy them just for the assets when it feels like an afterthought by the developers (they're often disorganized and clearly only the assets required for the official map, with no cohesion among the different asset packs).

I would love if the developers played more into to the clear strengths of this game (being the editor + community levels), maybe even making a DLC pack focused solely on purposeful and polished editor assets/features.

These two DLC courses already have a lot of negative reviews due to the price and now they want to increase both of them.

Gameplay:

Golf With Your Friends is a multiplayer golf game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. The gameplay is simple: you use your mouse or controller to aim and shoot the ball, and try to get it into the hole in as few strokes as possible. However, there are a lot of different factors to consider, such as the wind, the terrain, and the obstacles. This makes the game challenging and rewarding, and it's always satisfying to make a great shot.

Music:

The music in Golf With Your Friends is upbeat and fun, and it really sets the mood for the game. The soundtrack is composed by Michael Wyckoff, and it features a variety of different genres, including electronic, rock, and pop. The music is always changing to match the action on the course, and it really helps to keep the game feeling fresh.

Soundtrack:

The sound effects in Golf With Your Friends are also great. The sound of the ball hitting the ground, the club hitting the ball, and the crowd cheering are all very satisfying. The sound effects also help to create a sense of immersion, and they really make you feel like you're playing a real game of golf.

Courses:

Golf With Your Friends features a variety of different courses, each with its own unique challenges. There are courses set in forests, deserts, cities, and even on the moon. There are also courses that are themed after popular games, such as Mario Kart and Sonic the Hedgehog. The courses are all well-designed and challenging, and they provide a lot of variety to the game.

Unlockables:

Golf With Your Friends features a variety of unlockables, such as new courses, balls, and hats. You can unlock these by playing the game, completing challenges, or winning tournaments. The unlockables are a great way to keep the game feeling fresh, and they give you something to work towards.

Overall, Golf With Your Friends is an excellent multiplayer golf game that is sure to provide hours of fun. The gameplay is simple but challenging, the music is great, the sound effects are satisfying, the courses are varied and challenging, and there are a lot of unlockables to keep you coming back for more. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys golf or multiplayer games.

Here are some additional things I love about Golf With Your Friends:

* The couch co-op mode is a lot of fun, and it's a great way to bond with friends and family.
* The online multiplayer is also great, and it's a lot of fun to compete against other players from all over the world.
* The game is constantly being updated with new content, so there's always something new to play.
* The developers are very active and responsive to feedback, which is great to see.

The excuse is they need money to make more paid DLCs and a vague concept of game ""updates"". This isn't a contract, you're not an investor, they aren't beholden to any promise, they have made no promise, they just want your money.

The DLCs are already hardly worth the current price. Corrupted Forest just isn't fun. The level editor is still bad. The base game courses suffer bad and inconsistent physics.

2. if you hate someone you can just play this game with them and they will probably leave you forever

In conclusion it was worth those 10 euros i paid for it.

edit: So came back to it after around 4 years and played it with a couple of oldish friends, and wow I did not think i would ever have that much fun playing a golf game. It's really fun and entertaining watching people fail or sabotage free shots. It has a lot less bugs now that it had when i last played it which is a pleasant surprise. Replay-ability is massive, you can play this game for years and just keep finding new maps thanks to custom maps. We had most fun on ""getting over it"" maps they are so much fun. I love the game and urge you to buy it if you have a group to play it with.

(More on this later)

To start off though, focusing on the gameplay here, Golf With Your Friend aims to deliver a simple yet highly satisfying golf putter experience as the goal is to aim your ball and hit it in putter style (seeing how this isn't *quite* actual golf, which one could make the case of being a more skillful, albeit less relaxing sport to kick back and relax to) to achieve par on each of the eighteen holes, with the optimal objective being to gain as 'low' a score as possible by means of securing birdies, eagles and the occasional hole in one and albatross (essentially golf lingo for how much fewer shots it took for you to get the ball in the hole than was expected) for both bragging reasons as well as getting those 'cheevos' as it were!

Noting how this is quite the golfing game full of personality, one of the things I quite like about it is how customizable it is, first and foremost being able to personalize your own golf ball to a surprisingly high degree, starting off with just colouring your ball to your favourite colour but can later be given various accessories that can be unlocked by playing matches online (up to 3 per day on a 24 hour basis) that can be either fancy hats to add on top of your golf ball, neat trails to give a sweet effect after you hit your ball, a charismatic float to add some extra personality to your ball in case it finds itself floating on the water and even entirely new skins for your golf ball should you be lucky enough to get one! 

And the other main part of customization that truly makes Golf With Your Friends a standout experience  is how, alongside the 13 regular courses and 2 DLC ones made by the developers that you can play, one can make their very own courses by means of a pretty-decent level editor that gives them access to an entire world of their own to slowly craft and build their own 18 holes, albeit it is fairly flexible in that it can be as small as just the one in an incredibly highly-detailed or gargantuan-sized area for the one singular hole to take place in if that's what you desire, so much can be explored with just the level editor alone as it were!

Although to touch upon the gameplay itself directly, the physics is handled fairly well as what separates a good golfer from an amateur here is carefully angling your shots and powering them just right to ensure that you can not only skip corners that newer, more inexperienced players won't want to risk messing up but also potentially allowing you to take massive shortcuts if you take daring shots by bouncing it off not just the course itself but it's many background objects to ensure you stay ahead of the competition as it were, rewarding skilled gameplay without necessarily restricting it but also ensuring it's not too easy to pull off either!

All in all, Golf With Your Friends is quite the enjoyable golf putting game all things considered, however it does still share some faults that I would like to highlight here in this review.

First and most pressing is the questionable practice of the DLC here, seeing as it is one thing to put a paywall behind many fancy cosmetics (although this practice itself can be problematic depending on how it's done, such as lootboxes hiding being abnormally rare probabilities for the most desirable cosmetics and battle passes demanding insanely long grinds to reach those cosmetics coupled with convenient 'battle pass skips' as a way of bypassing the whole grind) so to restrict entire courses and their objects for use in the level editor is one thing, however it can be intrusive when achievements themselves are also locked behind the DLC itself, meaning one has to pay up for to access the full gameplay content as well as 100%'ing a game so to speak!

Note that, although I don't personally take issue with preferring to lock content in gameplay over locking cosmetics as there is plenty enough as is alongside almost all of the cosmetics being earnable, it is a strange and bizarre choice to lock achievements behind the DLC as most companies offering DLC make them either separate achievements or just don't bother with adding extra ones to begin with, however Team 17 made the active decision to link DLC achievements with the main game, so do with that as you will since the only counterargument is that the 2 DLC courses are only (as of writing of this review) £2.00 each roughly which, whilst fairly cheap and inconsequential, is a tad expensive when you compare it to the game's current price of £10.99 for 13 whole courses plus the level editor and most cosmetics not a part of the DLC packs.

Other issues with this game include the occasional weird physics issues where taking shots beyond a certain power level can lead to rare instances where your golf ball will seemingly either 'bounce' for no explainable reason and likely result in you going out of bounds (even when taking said shot on plain ground and not falling off down below!) or being reflected back and hit off at an angle alongside the general online activity not being nearly as active as it was back in Golf With Your Friend's earlier years going back to it's original release in 2020 as trying to find lobbies proved occasionally difficult and hosting a lobby for yourself can take some time before getting a lobby of more than two people here, which could prove frustrating in the long-term for those without the advantage of large circles of friends or for streamers with a decent following.

Still, despite the odd problem I had with the game here, I would still recommend Golf With Your Friends to those looking for a casual golfing experience filled with plenty of personality coupled with wacky courses set in various colourful settings oozing with their own unique charms as it is a pretty good game to either mess around in or take to a more competitive level for golfing professionals as it were!

TLDR Version:

• A wonderful golf putting game with 15 unique courses (two of which are DLC) each filled with 18 holes to challenge the player with increasing complexity (+)
• Golf With Your Friend has plenty of customization options where it allows you to add various accessories to your own golf ball alongside it's colour to make it stand out from the crowd (+)
• Impressive Level Editor that adds even more long-term gameplay for those who wish to express a creative vision of their own onto the game that can be shared with others (+)
• The gameplay is fair enough in difficulty that casuals won't feel ostracized trying to play well despite lack of experience whilst design of courses allows for more competitive players to enjoy more serious matches (+)
• Fairly satisfying physics as mastery of how to best angle each shot alongside matching the power level to the distance of each putt is what separates pros from amateurs (+)

• Questionable DLC practices by the development team that lock whole courses alongside some cosmetics behind paid DLC alongside achievements that aren't made separate from the main game (-)
• Some occasional physics problems occur where putting has a rare chance of resulting in bizarre bouncing or reflections of the golf ball which almost always results in it going out-of-bounds (-)
• Golf With Your Friends unfortunately is not as busy as it was back in 2020 which results in some difficulty in arranging lobbies for online matches depending on the time of day (-)",1690057089,1690057089,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

A bit tentative with this one, because it is a fun party game to not take very seriously (which is its intended purpose i think) so if you're looking to casually play with friends go for it. The most fun i got out of this game was when i wasn't taking it seriously.

TO THE ACHIEV HUNTERS: Actually meeting par on a lot of these maps takes major cheesing and out of map shenanigans. While i did enjoy slaving my way to par on every map with my friend, it really became less of a fun game and more of a chore with some of the RNG elements on the courses. Another thing of concern is new maps being added as DLC, I hope this doesn't continue and if it does i might change my review- having to pay for a DLC to get 1 or 2 achievements every so often can get pretty annoying.

GWYF is very glitchy and unreliable in incredibly frustrating ways. Here is an [u]incomplete[/u] list of some of the glitches that offend me the most:

-Your ball will inconsistently jump when you press jump. Very. Inconsistently. 

-Ball X is behind ball Y, ball Y goes off and gets in the hole. When ball X shoots, it mysteriously bounces off in a random direction, as if it bounced off ball Y, even though ball Y has been gone for three minutes. 

-On some courses, your ball can leave the course but jump back onto the green and everything's fine. Others, if you touch out of bounds for a moment, even if you get back to the green, you will be reset. There's no rhyme or reason for how a hole will act.

-There was a year when you were never awarded a hat for playing any multiplayer games. It took them nearly a [b]year[/b] to get it fixed.

-Sometimes, your ball lands somewhere that is clearly supposed to be out of bounds, but it's legal. Far worse, sometimes your ball lands somewhere that is clearly supposed to be legal, but you get reset as if you were out of bounds. Some of these spots are consistent, some are not.

-The newest glitch my friends and I have dubbed 'The Invisible Hand Of Gingy.' Sometimes your ball just... bounces away. You've shot a reasonable shot, it's flying through open air, no obstacles anywhere nearby, and then suddenly BOING you're going in a completely different direction for no reason at all. It's as if the invisible hand of gingy has struck you down and said 'NO.' We've been playing this game for years now and have only developed this term recently, meaning in the past few months, someone changed a line of code and it went poorly. 

-Plus many less infuriating glitches: your ball is suddenly under the green instead of on top of it; your ball stops on a moving platform and you're trapped because the game doesn't think you've come to a stop; the camera angle rubberbands if your ball is too close to a wall; etc. ad nauseum.

If you don't have friends, then there is no point in buying it unless you want to play by yourself. Steam charts says the player base ranges from 600 - 1500, but [b][i]no one[/i][/b] is on. Searching for matches will take you 5 min or more and the server browser will take you to a lobby where the host is AFK. 

Buy the game if you have friends to play with or don't mind Golf with No Friends.

The map design is dreadful, you bounce of off invisible obstacles because elements on the course don't line up properly (IN A MAP THAT IS IN THE GAME BY DEFAULT) which makes me pity the community map makers (if the devs can't get it right I imagine it must be tough for them). 
Out of the group I played with I started to get skeptical first, but it only took until the Worms themed course for everyone to realize that buying this game was a mistake.
I'm guessing there might be some good stuff lurking on the workshop, but searching by most popular just returned a bunch of the most bog standard stuff imaginable.

I'm genuinely annoyed at myself that I let myself go over the refund playtime limit with this one.",1686189902,1686189902,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Golf With Your Friends consists of numerous maps with special conditions and items that can be used. There's gravity wells, black holes, jet packs, and cannons, just to name a few. Fully customize the conditions of your game from the amount of holes to the shape of your ball. You even earn little fancy customizations the longer you play.

I've always been curious about this game from watching several YouTubers play it. Eventually it went on sale for $5 and I was able to convince about four of my friends to get it. We usually only play over the weekend but it is pretty fun. I don't even mind losing, which I do most of the time.

There are some frustrating bugs and other elements to the game. During the Worms course, I fell through the world multiple times. Expect to waste a stroke frequently because either the flagpole will bounce your ball away from the hole, or the hole will slide you over instead of right into it. There's also this frustrating lack of direction on some holes. The game has very elaborate shots and when it isn't clear where to go, you can run out of strokes fast.

I've been through all of the default game courses (excluding the DLC ones) and I definitely have my favorites. Steer clear of Worms and Twilight if you don't want to yeet your computer out the nearest window. A map editing mode makes for endless possibilities but so far, the workshop doesn't seem that full of too many options.

The game is three years old and still has some kinks that need to be worked out. I recommend getting it on sale, but either way, it can be a pretty fun time, especially if you have friends and voice chat.",1685337680,1685337680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game hates you and only wants to hurt you. Playing it alone will only cause pain. Playing with friends, as the game is intended to be, is the way to do it. Nothing brings out the guttural primal rage like hitting a golf ball and having it not go the way you wanted it. Microphones will be peaked, and personal property will be slammed.

Sometimes you get hit back by nothing at all, i clipped thorugh the ground multiple times and overall the angles you get bounced back with, just don't seem accurate. If i hit at 45 degress, i should be bounced back with the same angle.

Oh, yeah, sometimes you just don't get reset, when you leave the map and you can even get stuck in the wall.

You can get stuck on edges and are not able to shoot again afterwards as well.

The game's whimsical and colorful design, coupled with its simple controls, make it easy to pick up and play for players of all skill levels.

One of the best features of Golf with Friends is its multiplayer mode. Playing with friends is an absolute blast, and the game's various courses offer a lot of fun and challenging obstacles to overcome. It's great to see everyone's different play styles and strategies come into play, and the competitive nature of the game can lead to some truly hilarious moments.

However, there are some downsides to Golf with Friends. For one, the game's physics engine can be frustratingly unpredictable at times, making it difficult to gauge the power and trajectory of your shots.

Plenty of courses come built in, or you can build your own which also means you can play other maps that people have made and some people have made amazing maps.
Play on your own, open a private room to play with friends or make a public room for anyone to join.
Do note you may have to join the same region to see someones room. That is no voice chat, only text. So if you want to use voice, you'll need something like discord, teams etc.
Unlock hats, ball trails and floats (for when in water).

""Oh, what a fun mini golf game to play with friends. This looks like something fun to play and in no way will this put me in a bad mood""
You are dead fucking wrong.
At first glance you think it is a cute game. Which it is. At the first course. But then the last hole in the Forest course is just a preview of what is to come. 
You think you know what pain is, you son of a bitch? I'll show you pain. Just imagine just having your balls glitch and miss obvious shots. When your friends are racing to get that perfect par while fighting against the clock. Imagine your ball getting lost in the water and you have to keep bobbing your ball to hopefully get it on the green. I have seen grown hardened men break down emotionally, spiritually, physically, and mentally over this game.  I have seen lifelong friendships get decimated over the course of this game.

There's a lot of times where you'll clearly hit the ball in, but it loop-de-loops around the hole and spins you out, or you land in the hole and bounce back out and land right at the edge. Achievements are buggy too, I played a full round on Oasis on casual for the achievement, and didn't get it. Few other ones I didn't get either. I don't have many friends who like to play this game, and the groups that I have played it with we always moved onto something else because we kept getting screwed over.
Update: my friend and I have been achievement hunting and i spent the last hour trying to do the par achievements. I got screwed over cause I hit tab to open the stroke menu instead of the escape menu so it didn't pause the timer so I got a penalty and had to completely restart at hole 14. Turned off the timer and redid it and got 13 under par but no achievement so looks like the scummy devs strike again, they made it so you can't even adjust the timer at all or you don't get the achievement and don't warn you about it.

Now, I'm no Tiger Woods, but I do know a good game when I see one. Golf With Your Friends is a hilarious take on the classic game of mini-golf, with colorful and creative player-made courses that will have you laughing and crying at the same time.

But be warned, this game can be frustratingly fun. You'll find yourself bouncing around obstacles, flying off ramps, and trying to avoid those dreaded water hazards. It's like a game of real golf, but without the pretentious dress code or the green fees.

With the ability to play with up to 12 friends, Golf With Your Friends is perfect for those looking for a fun and casual multiplayer experience. Whether you're playing with your best buds or taking on strangers online, this game will have you putting for par in no time.

While the game does have its faults, such as occasional bugs and wonky physics, it's still a blast to play. Plus, with a constant stream of new player-made courses being added, the game has endless replayability.

Overall, Golf With Your Friends gets a score of 7.4 out of 10. It's not a perfect game, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a fun and silly multiplayer experience.

I am a single father to my son, who is now 16 and friend-less. My son recently started Golf With Your Friends but he has no friends and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son lacking friends, as he is always out with his non-existent friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him because he has no friends. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died because he has no friends. This game has ever since brought my son, who has no friends, and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

I mean, lookit, it's a miniputt golf game.  Standard golf stuff: put the ball in the target hole in the fewest shots to win.  Unlike regular, boring-ass golf, the areas you're playing in are whimsical and require some tricky shots to pull off.  I like miniputt golf a heap.

By default, the vast majority of the courses are tricky, challenging, and punish bad shots.  Those default settings make it very difficult to get a meaningful overview of the course, and on top of that, there's a time limit, so the first few playthroughs of any course are going to involve some degree of bumbling and frustration.  So how you play it depends on your friends:

* Are your friends chill, casual, and enjoy a laugh at their own expense?  Default settings are fine. But you can also dial a bunch of wacky settings into the game too--cubes for balls, hyper-bounciness, spontaneous jumping, etc.

* Are your friends a bunch of hyper-competitive blowhards?  Default settings, and practice, practice, and more practice.  With experience in the game and the courses, you'll get a better feel for how everything comes together and find various trick-shots to shortcut through the game.

* Somehwere in between?  There's bizarre other modes, such as ""dunk"" or ""hockey"" that do I-don't-know-precisely-what.  It may be worth investigating.  Especially if your buddies are given over to laughing rather than frustrated cussing.

Since the game also lets you dress up your golfballs with various wacky skins and gewgaws, the game does kind of lend itself more to a wackier set of people.  It's also awfully competitive!  I don't know!

Anyway, I had a few rousingly fun matches with friends, but I am going to dial in a few more casual and factors into the game next time we play.  If you have Friends you can Golf With that lean towards more absurd fun, you'll get your money's worth even at default pricing, in my arrogant opinion.",1680730532,1680730532,True,0,0,0.479704797267913818,0,True,False,False

Perhaps I've been spoilt by Walkabout, where the courses are imaginatively and beautifully designed, the mechanics are fun, and the graphics don't look a decade old.

But Golf with your Friends pales by comparison. Boring mechanics, poor graphics and the extra modes, particularly Dunk are just frustrating and not at all fun.

This is just about worth picking up in the sale for a few quid, but only just, if only to be reminded of how good a golf game can be (i.e. Walkabout).",1680431926,1680431926,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lies and deceipt.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1678796580,1678796580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With simple controls and a variety of fun and quirky maps to choose from, it's easy to jump right in and start having a blast.

What sets Golf With Your Friends apart from other golf games is the sheer variety of maps available, each with their own unique challenges and obstacles to overcome. From the giant candy land of Candyland to the perilous pirate cove of Buccaneer's Bay, each map is packed with creative and imaginative designs that will keep you entertained for hours.

But while Golf With Your Friends is certainly a fun and casual game, it can also be incredibly frustrating at times. Some of the maps are designed to be particularly challenging, with narrow gaps, tricky jumps, and other obstacles that require precise timing and skill to navigate. But it's precisely these challenges that make the game so enjoyable and rewarding to play with friends. Nothing beats the thrill of finally sinking that impossible shot after dozens of failed attempts.

Playing with friends is where Golf With Your Friends truly shines. The game supports up to 12 players at a time, making it perfect for hosting large multiplayer games with friends and family. The game also includes a range of fun customization options, allowing you to personalize your golf ball, trails, and other in-game elements to your liking.

Overall, Golf With Your Friends is a fun, engaging, and often frustrating casual game that's perfect for playing with friends.

First of all: Bugs. There's a ton of them. I find myself clipping into the map at least 1 out of every 6 games I play. This game has been in development and available to purchase for YEARS - and this isn't even a map specific issue. I've had it happen on every map, old and new. The game is simply programmed poorly.

On the topic of programming, the physics in the game are atrocious. Obviously, a game doesn't have to mimic reality precisely, but this is ridiculous. The amount of speed lost from bounces varies by an absurd amount, the height of bounces (on default gravity) varies way too much - even shooting with the exact same power and angle, and shots that bounce off the course will, again, vary in the time to takes to be reset. Sometimes it takes a second, sometimes it takes 5. Sometimes you bounce back onto the course, but are reset anyways. I reiterate: This game has been available for purchase for YEARS. No excuse for a gameplay experience this bad.

Let's say, however, all of these issues were patched out. No more bugs, and better programming. Would the game be good then?

No.

The design of the maps is egregiously bad. This is a more subjective thing - and I'm sure some would argue it's on purpose - but given the terrible programming at every other turn, I'm unconvinced. Too many examples of sliding off-course on an ""auto"" part, stopping in the middle of a slide (despite using high or full power), bouncing on targets leading to inconsistent landing points, sometimes sending a correctly fired shot off the course, and various other shortcomings.

All in all, I would bet that this game hasn't received ANY revisions to it's code since release. As stated, I've seen many a video on this game from 2016-2017, and the bugs were just as prevalent.

Golf with Friends has become one of our go-to games for game nights and weekend hangouts. It's easy to pick up, but difficult to master, and the levels are hilariously challenging.

This game has kept us laughing and competing against each other for game after game. From hole-in-one shots to impossible courses, Golf with Friends has caused both joy and frustration between us. But even when we're not doing so well, we're still having a great time.

The multiplayer mode is where this game really shines, allowing you to compete against your friends in real-time matches. The game also offers a wide range of customizations, allowing you to make your golf ball and the environment unique and interesting.

Overall, Golf with Friends is a must-play for anyone who wants to have a great time with their friends. It's easy to learn, difficult to master, and provides endless hours of laughter and entertainment.

Everytime I have played this game I have been brought to a state of depression worse than the most serious diagnosable form of depression. This game makes me want to claw my eyes out and boil my teeth. This game causes so much suffering inside. This game is the worst game to ever be made. This game should be removed from the face of the earth, its not even a game, its a test, a punishment for living. You do not play this game with your friends, as soon as you start to play they become your worst nightmare and you never ever want to see them again. I have lost all my friends because of this horrible title. The happy music in the background while I slowly load my 12 gauge shotgun and follow the footsteps of Kurt Cobain. This is a horrible suffering title. I am done with it, everytime I play it I say ill never reinstall it but as if I made a deal with the devil himself to keep playing it I always return. I'd rather take myself as a satan blood sacrifice while being p𝖎𝖘𝖘ed on by a rat and smothered in s𝖍𝖎𝖙 than play this nightmare again.

But as someone who's spent a considerable amount of time scrolling through golf games to potentially buy, it can be a bit tricky figuring out if the physics will feel right, maps will have interesting dynamics, and the game will have some type of overall longevity.  Here's some thoughts:

-This game is definitely tailored to a wacky and goofier time.  While I'm absolutely competitive every time I play, [b]I never never take this game seriously.[/b]   A serious attitude will get obliterated the first time you try to ricochet a shot only for it to clip through the geometry and fly out of bounds, or your ball rolls to an impossible-shot corner and you're forced to take a 14-point L on a hole.
-The game has, without relying on workshop mode, a wide variety of both conventional as well as wacky holes.  The last couple of maps they've released have been relatively tame given several of the holes released after it's first year or two were absolute bonkers.
-For anyone coming from Golf It!, this GWYF's roll physics are less sticky.  A small putt is going to go a long way, and you'll find plenty of times that your ball is going to orbit the hole only to make you scream as it escapes the hole's gravity.  That being said, a decent amount of holes have deliberately sunken bowl [i]around[/i] the hole to help curb some of the ball's enthusiasm, but you'll still have several times when it decides to hop back out to the amusement of everyone except you.  This game also has a control scheme that works for more calculated putts (drawing the mouse back to set the power, and clicking to hit the ball) instead of the mouse-swing from Golf It!, so the insane hole-shot attempts are much more doable.
-After a certain point, everybody is going to become extremely knowledgeable of each hole and how they play, and instead of feeling like 'who's going to play the best', it might start to feel like 'which sweaty try hard is going to putt a perfect game [i]this[/i] time'?  This is generally propagated by the previously mentioned control scheme allowing you to memorize power levels.  This feeling can be sedated with a good ol' round with ball collision on, ball shapes randomized to cones and dice, or even turning the entire thing into basketball.  I'd say the entire set of courses can become repeatable by turning on basketball mode to rejuvenate the game if you're tired of the same maps and don't want to resort to workshop maps.
-The game has gotten relatively steady updates over the last several years, and while they've never been super fast about it, the content built up at this point is worth the price tag.  [b]That being said[/b], they don't ever seem to update on holes that have already come out, and all of the first main holes still have all of the geometry glitches and bugs as they released with.  Their newer maps feel more polished, which is great, but for the foreseeable future don't expect any of the glitches you find to get fixed.

Blacklight Interactive is starting to get a little bit more into the monetized content recently, but with all the currently released maps and steady updates (in conjunction with the workshop maps), it absolutely makes this worth putting in your arsenal of 'weekend hangout games' to play online friends.  It currently has Ultrawide support (not that it really gains you much in terms of mechanical benefit), and runs well on the Steam Deck too if you want to hang with friends virtually from the comfort of your couch (or play the local multiplayer option, though I haven't really messed with that yet).

Your friends can sometimes make enemies with each other. 

In todays day and age, you would think that a multiplayer game would have a basic function of allowing the player to rejoin an already started game if they lose connection due to internet trouble. 
If you're in this situation, and you lose connection, you cannot rejoin your friends. You must wait until they a) finish the game or b) leave the game and reinvite you. 

I do recommend this game, as it is a lot of fun [b][i] when[/i] [/b] you play with your friends. 

Never-mind the fact that this game is selling itself on playing with friends. To be playing a lovely round of golf with your friends, and for your friend(s) to get disconnected due to whatever reason, and that there is absolutely no possibility of them rejoining, is frustrating and just makes zero sense. 

Incorporate this feature. 

There is also an issue where, in some scenarios, the golf ball can become suspended in infinite air, whilst not moving. It appears as if the ball is on the ground, but in fact, it is floating. You can't reset the ball. Your only option is to forfeit the round and to add 14+ shots to your score-sheet. 

Other than these two flaws. The game is a lot of fun. It has a couple of different game modes, such as hockey, and basketball. I don't think there are too many lads that are playing solo, however, you have your lobby on public and it will fill up over time.",1630491419,1675006091,True,52,3,0.830894768238067627,1,True,False,False

It brings me delight: golf with friends,
I'll play day or night, and on the weekends.

I have to go when the golf field calls,
To fulfill my joy when playing with balls.

I told my dad about the laughs to be had,
Playing with boys and balls, but he got mad.

The only negative I've found so far is many glitches.

When those problems don't occur then it's a total blast! Unfortunately the bugs are getting worse and worse. Having map problems where I just constantly clip through and am unable to play.

You're likely to get into a good match/room within a couple minutes, but be wary because you can be kicked by a host for no reason sometimes. 

What makes me rate it 4/5 is the glitches that appear every now and then. It's not fun having to reboot my game or not being able to finish a course because it keeps saying I hit out of bounds when I clearly didn't.

I have had and played Golf it for awhile now and only recently got Golf With Friends because some friends talked me into it. I have to say I do not regret my purchase but there are a few things about the game functionally that bother me. In Golf It when you go to swing your golf club so to speak you click and hold your mouse and drag back then swing forward and release your mouse button whereas in Golf with Friends you click and hold your mouse and drag the mouse forward and release. Judging the strength of your swing is not dependent on how hard you swing but how far you drag your mouse forward. If you go to turn on your jump ability and you've played any video games on the computer for say I don't know the last 20 years or more you probably expect it to be set to the space bar. That is not the case. The default jump button is your left mouse button the same as the button you use to swing. I understand the concept behind trying to further integrate the controls but this can be very confusing for people. Not to mention that I have not as of yet found a way to turn off the penalty for resetting the ball to the last spot it was at and I find this very annoying. However when I played this with others (as I previously stated some friends talked me into buying it) I had a lot of fun so having others to play with can make the... adjustment period easier on Golf It players. Not to mention it is a lot more easy to unlock cosmetics in Golf It than in Golf With Friends, and whenever I do unlock something it doesn't tell me in game unlike with Golf It. Should you buy it? Is it a well constructed game? Well I leave that up to you my dear golfers; for it is up to you whether the functions are enough to ruin the experience for you or not, whether you have fun with it or not, whether you have enough patience to deal with it or not.",1671538368,1671538512,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

VERDICT:
This is a good way to have endless fun with your friends, there's plenty of maps to choose from with what the devs have put in and what the community have created with the workshop. There's not much depth to this game but the community have done well to keep things fresh.

Things can get pretty frustrating depending on what mode you play but there's plenty of options for everyone to enjoy just be mindful that things can get pretty competitive.

The major the downfall is it's not intended to be played by yourself so make sure if you're buying this game, your friends have it also, the price is fair and there's plenty of things to do.
Total Score = 80/100.

The gameplay has a few very rare problems where you may get stuck or take an odd bonce off of a flat surface, but as a said 'very rare'. The game is great to get online with friends and try to beat them. Some of the modes like collision can be fun to try to knock your friends out of the map so that they get a higher score.

As for the maps forest is a great starter map with easy to understand holes and great hole in ones. But as for maps like haunted and pirates cove, there are many inconsistent things like canons, boost pads, and just a plain stupid doctors cart (plz change hole).

This game is based on a fair bit of skill and luck which makes it very enjoyable to people who are willing to learn the courses and the hole in ones. But those who put little effort into the game will be stuck not enjoying the game as they time out of stoke out (which game make some very funny moments while playing with friends).

But over all i would give this game a 8/10 because there are still many small things to fix.

**Updated again, 11/2020, as this game will always earn the Labor of Love award from me. The devs are consistent in their updates, the content is always worth checking out, and they listen to feedback from the fans. Rock on GWYF, may your holidays be filled with gingerbread men.

**Updated, 11/2021. It’s that time of year to award Labor of Love to this funky gem of a mini golf game. The underwater update was new this year, and as always I spent plenty of time playing rounds with strangers and friends. Get the game. It’s cheap, tons of fun, and the cheevos are a decent challenge.

***Hey, look, it's 11/2022! Listen, if you've read all this you can tell I enjoy this game a lot. I've enjoyed it for several years and I'll keep enjoying it. I don't play as many games as I used to, but when the Steam Awards email showed up I knew it was time to renominate my favorite little putt-putt game. Booted up a random round and found a friendly little group to play Bouncy Castle- one of two new official maps added since I last updated this review. The game apparently has cosmetic DLC's now which is A-okay with me as you can still unlock the free ones just fine, and I've been using the same hat and trail on my golf ball since 2019. Also, I don't mind these guys adding some purchase options- the server browser, course designs, and interface have all seen significant improvements over the past year.

The game is actually really fun playing, at least with friends. This game goes on sale regularly for $5 and I wouldn't recommend spending more than that on it. 

The highest-rated workshop maps are more interesting than a lot of the official courses. Really, you probably won't run out of workshop content to go through. Even the bad courses are often funny enough that it doesn't feel like a waste of time, since you'll be laughing at the BS physics or map design with friends.

[Early Access Review]
Posted: Apr 2, 2020 @ 2:53am


This game has been broken for the year and a half I've owned it, and every time I come back to it I'm disappointed. Invisible walls, clipping through the ground, and inconsistent bouncing of the golf ball are all exceedingly common. Seeing as it's still in early access after 4 years, I don't see it improving.",1585821195,1666239630,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That said, the reason im giving this a thumbs down is well deserved in its own right, let me tell you what bothers me.

Clipping, Yes, sometimes at some levels its possible to clip through walls, and lose.

Physics : Not always accurate as other play throughs (So I guess the game becomes more luck based).

Pars : This is my biggest annoyance, whoever set the par rate in a LOT of courses, set it straight out on ""If you're really lucky this should be right!""

The game is actually pretty fun, but the creators (Team17) should've made the par chart a bit more on par with the course itself, like the barrel level in Forest should be a 3 par instead of a 2 par so that it's not completely luck based of hitting the hole in the barrel but more so for people that don't get that (Super lucky shot), btw this comes from someone who finished THAT COURSE on its par limit already.

Beyond that, the physics are often wonkey, and in some levels (like space station and the haunted course) you can legitly get your ball in place where there's sadly no more saving it, since the level see's it as a ""legit part of the course"", while factually you shouldnt be able to get there.

Lastly the camera can go completely wonky on you (especially close to walls) making shots or even looking at your screen a headache, and in levels with minecarts, or other moving objects, they sometimes just decide to go invisible, making it a shitty playthrough.

Also, more often than not you get disconnected from the ""Rare already"" Multiplayer sessions because of a ""Network Error"" which is just sad.

Can't believe that we're now sold a singular DLC map for 3$ and it's a garbage map too.

Lastly, Snowflakes for instance sells in marketplace for 1100$, but as far as I know its unobtainable, it's an effect from what 2019? or so and has since been unlocked since the game doesn't do ""holiday events"" or something.

Still thumbs down for me.",1631401862,1664296974,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

[b][u]PROS[/u]:[/b] The game is nice & basic golfing fun.  The maps are creative & mostly enjoyable, the physics have been improved through the game's early access, & the menus have been streamlined down to look a lot nicer.  The soundtrack is upbeat & chipper, & the visuals add just as much to the courses.  The multiplayer worked without hiccups as well, leading to a fun, smooth experience.

[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] Some of the courses can still feel unfair when attempting to go for par, & the physics, though improved, still have some very odd reactions here & there.  Besides that, most of the problems have been ironed out through the game's early access period, with only the occasional random extra achievement popping for no reason.

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] These can either be incredibly simple or very painful depending on your patience.  Grind aside, the par stroke challenges provide the most difficulty.  Some par courses, like Forest & Escapists, are nice & simple.  Others, such as Pirate, are a massive task to take on.  My suggestion would be to look up guides to get as close as you can to a hole in one, because it isn't feasible on every map.

[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] This is without a doubt a fun game to play with friends.  Single player is what you would expect, but everything else is a very well done.  They did a good job listening to the criticism & fixing the issues before the official launch, leading to a much more polished title as a result.  Though small issues still exist, they are quite minor, & are insignificant enough to enjoy this game with a few friends.",1589926870,1663460254,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False
