WoT Blitz gives ya the easy mode first and let you win a lot of the time you played the game and then comes the long way to the top with lots of defeat involving bad teammates and sometimes, God forbid, lots of 0-7s.

For me, I found that the matchmaking can be in favor of you or the enemy all the time -- sometimes your team consists of a good Matilda player, a great scout, and a blood-lust incarnate of a tank destroyer but then at the same time you got the bottom-feeder scout, a medium that doesn't know how to angle, or lots of people having a situational awareness of a goldfish despite them having better tanks than you

Then, realizing this desperation... in goes your money to WG's pockets just to get that edge in battle to help you (and mostly) your teammates realize that this game isn't an FPS.

I'd strongly consider it if you wanted to play it long-term.

Maybe just a skill issue? Possibly. I'd recommend reading guides from either World of Tanks and WoT Blitz wikis and see how it says about your tank. Don't wanna get one hit by a lone KV-2, aiming for nowhere but hits you right in the engine and incinerates you... or bouncing a Matilda with the good 40mm too many times you realize you're already on 10 HP left.",1673007271,1673007305,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lower xp requirements for tank research in tech trees. Faster paces of in-game experience. I think that's what ""Blitz"" is all about. Since it's ""derived"" from mobile platform(you can still play with mobile players), graphics performance can't compete with WoT but it's acceptable and getting better with every update(placebo maybe?)

Yes you can say it's a pay to win game since I can earn much more credits by playing tanks that are purchased with golds. Credits earned from those tanks can drastically accelerate your progress in techtrees. But honestly speaking, WoT and War thunder belong to that category as well. Either you spend a lot of time grinding for some particular tanks at certain levels that you're fond of, or you purchase in-game currency and speed up the process. The golds are on discount from time to time. So I'm pretty satisfied with it. 

I do hope WG can provide an exclusive HD graphics pack for PC players. The cooling fans of my gaming laptop never speed up when playing WOTB(i7-9750h+RTX 2080 max q)There're so much headroom that WOTB can squeeze out of average gaming laptop specs.

Edit(4/29/2020): 
Developers have justed added Girls und Panzer tanks in ALL SERVERS. Yes, you can buy Pz IV Ausf H, Tiger I & Hetzer that're originated from GuP TV animation. I really appreciate this decision cuz these tanks have been exclusive in Asia server for more than 4 years due to copyright reasons. Now not only can you purchase the collection in EU server(Russian server as well I guess), but two more tanks(IS-2 and Firefly) from the anime have been added to WOTB.

The tier system ranks player rating so if your a good player you quickly find yourself not being able to find a match on tanks under tier V. At tier V the price and cost of research quickly kicks in and becomes super grindy. To keep moving along you find staying with the 1 nation you are the meta for certain tiers.

so annoying when your tier V tank is high in the ranking and your player rating goes up and then your fighting in games vs 1 or 2 tier higher tanks. which then creates super bad mis matches.

Imagine being a good enough player they bump you up a tier but you can't afford tier VI tanks so you find yourself in battles where you can't pen there armour from any angle.

this is where they start to press you with micro transactions to buy gold ammo that does less dam but lot higher armour pen. so now your lower tank can be compentative for a price. An that price is gold which you can only earn through real world cash.

same for premium tanks, gold only purchase which earns more in game cash and more exp.

So the game i rather smart getting you hook and then saying hey 250gold is just pocket money whats $5 a day to play now then?

WG expect me to grind for years and wait for timers to get the tanks back to how they were. Sorry WG you just lost a paying customer. 

I have played this game since beta on IOS. I have hundreds of hours logged. 

Pros
- 7v7 means fast frantic combat very quickly - there is little camping or waiting for action as it will quickly come to you.
- Mechanics of cover, sidescraping, penetration, camo, spotting etc work the same as Wot PC
- There are plenty of maps.
- The MM is +1/-1 meaning you are top tier 50% of the time, unlike PC 
- Way easier for a good player to carry and win, I have a 70% WR mostly solo. 
- Game still looks fine with graphics on Max, its not WOT PC but will run on older computers.
- Lots of tanks to grind and loads of premium tanks should you have some cash to burn.
- Active developers update every month, lots of competitions.
- your account will work on mobile so your Ipad/Phone will have the same tanks etc

Neg
- There is no balance in the MM so the teams are random. You will get lots of blow outs if one team gets the good players.
- Bad players, as in lack of skills, there is a limited tutorial and the game is a mobile game meaning many people don't know what they are doing.
- It is very hard to gain credits without a premium account (costs gold/money), especially at the higher tiers.
- Stock tanks and crew are painful, you can skip this pain using gold to get 100% crew and free XP. So its not pay to win but more pay to advance.
- Some players will rage at you in chat
- There are still problems with AFK players which really hurt your chances of winning as 6v7 is harder than 7v7

its one of those skill required games. these are always not so good for new players but you will learn over time. 

if you ever wanted to drive an old tank from the yee old times you can vurtually do it. 

super easy to run compared to actual world of tanks, also no artillery!

events for basically free tanks.

its free.... why would you not want a free game?

very fun when you get into it.
[h1]cons:[/h1]
mobile optimised but who really cares about that?

P2W basically but i do not suggest getting any premium tanks. just rush the tank you use the most to a higher tier and you will be more happy than a premium tank that is stuck at a certian tier.

lots of toxic use of the voice chat. mainly used for throwing shit at other people doing stupid things and camping tank destroyers when they should be used as campers.

no autolock (unless you right click) but hey, your not a console player... your a pc gamer.... you dont need it.

graphics are kinda meh, but dont let the graphics stop you from playing

[h1]conclusion:[/h1] 
if you like world of tanks but you have a potato for a pc and you cant run the other version of world of tanks, this is your game. its free. its fun. i cant recommend it enough

Теперь подведём итоги этой игры.
Геймплей 4/5
Графика 2/5
Коммюнити 4/5
Донат 1/5
Главным плюсом этой игры является отсутствие артелерии.
Бои очень динамичные и быстрые.
Игра очень интересная для FREE TO PLAY.
Эта игра достойна,чтобы в нее поиграть.
Донат-это главный минус этой игры.Без доната развиваться очень сложно,но можно.Но на каждый праздник или вроде такого разработчики дарят игрокам много разных плюшек.

As such, it had simplified controls, simplified models, simplified textures, simplified UI and simplified everything else. This was fine, and in time the game has gotten a small community of it's own. But porting the mobile, severely dumbed down version back to PC, has not made it a true alternative to the original.

I'll make it simple for you.
If you play Blitz on mobile devices a lot, and only occasionally want to play a game on the PC, do go ahead and try this. It will let you play the same game, so you keep your progression and everything else between your mobile devices and the PC.
If on the other hand you don't play mobile games much if at all, and just want a game to play exclusively on the PC, please forget about this. Then you should go download the full, original World of Tanks for PC from their webpage. It's just as free, much better, more content, bigger community and more fun.

Oh, and if anyone thinks they can use this game to sit on a PC with keyboard and mouse, and stomp on players running it from mobile devices. Sorry, but there are separate matchmaking queues.

On a serious note, I actually enjoy playing this much more over the original World of Tanks mostly because of the smaller size teams, maps, and no Artillery. Matches are very short, anywhere from 5-10minutes at most usually and the grind isn't too terribly bad. The balance is something that still seems to favor russian tanks and their crazy DPS to Armor ratio. 

The real beauty is that all my progression between when I play on the PC or when I play on my tablet from the app is tracked as one. If you're a fan of these types of Arena style games you will likely enjoy this more casual version of WoT.

Pro's:
[list]
[*]Fast Matches
[*]No Artillery
[*]Progression shared between Mobile App and PC
[*]Easy to jump in and play
[*]Great time killer

[list]
[*]Game balance favors russians with massive DPS.

The game becomes more rewarding the more experience you gain (not the in-game experience but actual gaming experience), being able to turn around battles the otherwise seem impossible to win, although there are still many instances where that is not the case. I personally don't think this is as casual of a game as it seems to be considering that if you don't really have a plan or be versatile with the situation, you can die very quickly missing put on a lot of the action. I must include that it does not mean that you're supposed run away from everything just to survive until the end but to understand your role in the battle and act accordingly. Acting accordingly can mean many things differing with which tank you're driving hence gaining experience the hard way so you know what to do in certain situations.
One thing to mention is that this game is not a pay-to-win game and is more skill based, although I think that WarGaming is heading towards a grey area with recent updates but ultimately, those functions are boosters and there is still skill required to be able to effectively draw the full potential of each tank.

I ranted on too much and for those who felt that it seems too complicated I'll just say that its not that hard of a game if you learn and think, everything else should naturally follow with it.
