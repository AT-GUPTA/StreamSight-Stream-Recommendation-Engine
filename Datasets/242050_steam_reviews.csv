First of all, to even get it to start without crashing I had to set the compatibility to Windows 95. Secondly, the first thing I notice is my FPS capping at 5 - It's unplayable. I look into it and realize that it's because only one CPU core is used to run the game. I have to manually change this in the task manager everytime I run the game.
Thirdly, I still suffer from consistent FPS drops (The FPS seems to be capped at 60) to about 20-40. At first I thought I'd get used to it, but 5 minutes pass by and I've had enough. The solution for this was a third party program called D3DOverrider. I still suffer from FPS drops occasionally, but it is at least playable now.
The fourth issue I encountered was that the Kenway Fleet wouldn't open. I had to replace the .exe file with one downloaded from Nexusmods.com to get that to work. I start up the game and everything works perfectly, until the next time I try to play the game. The game wouldn't start so I had to validate the files and replace the modified .exe file with the original one; And I can no longer open the Kenway Fleet. 

My experience with this game has been a disaster since I bought it on Steam. However, bugs aside, the game is - as previously stated - a masterpiece. It's up there with the Ezio-triology and I definitely recommend everyone to play it, just not on Steam.",1708810374,1708817048,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

when is on sale this game cost around 7 to 8 bucks

the DLCs are not needed because they dont expand the story, much, you would be paying for a sword or the looks of a ship, 

well the season pass says that it has an extra story but I dont think is worth the money 
how long to beat.com says that Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag - Aveline DLC takes 1h to complete, the website says that the story inside the season pass would last for 3+ hrs

HOLLY SHT, I just realized that Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag is only available WITH the DLCs AND the season pass included, you cannot buy they game without them, figures, is a good game they dont care if you waste your money

this game should cost around 4 bucks without dlc or season pass
SO, I had this game pirated and then after looting for hrs and finally getting the most expensive sword in my possession the saving file of this game gets deleted, I think that that happened in the pirated version and when I finally got the game on steam I didnt had the will to finish it because it was depressing besides I was like at 35-50% into the story, OR it happened in the paid version Idk

point is either way you'll get yourself screwed either by a video game that doesnt fix those problems, or by paying for an overpriced video game

is it worth the 7 bucks? to buy this Assassin's Creed Black Flag - Gold Edition
YEAH SURE, AS LONG AS YOU GET A VIDEO GAME WITHOUT BUGS OR YOUR SAVING FILE GETTING DELETED, maybe just pirate this game, although you could be at risk of getting a malware if is not a trustworthy website

FROM NOW ON I'LL HAVE A BACKUP IN CASE IF THAT SAVING FILE GETS MAGICALLY DELETED
was it because of ubisoft in the paid version or because it was pirated? Idk

The game is easily one of the best in the series, with a good core gameplay loop, a world begging to be explored, and pretty refined mechanics. I'll hold off on commenting about the story till after I finish the game.

Black Flag is mostly remembered for its naval combat and gorgeous world. And that's because it kinda doesn't do the rest so well. The combat is mediocre, and the free-running is imprecise and stripped back. The story is also fairly forgettable, but then that's never been the greatest strength of the franchise. 

Still, you'll forget about pretty much all of it when you're at the helm trying to line up a broadside during a storm. Sailing and exploring is excellent as ever, and the side activities like whaling and diving on shipwrecks are a fun change of pace. Still a recommend if you want a pirate game and Skull and Bones didn't scratch that itch.

Also, unlike a lot of older ubi titles, this one did survive the transition from Uplay to Ubi Connect with all its features still intact, although logging in is slow and multiplayer is apparently awkward to get working.

I have never been a die-hard fan of their games, let alone the Assassin's Creed installments. I cannot speak on behalf of the companies behavior, and I also cannot elaborate on how some fans have been disenchanted as of late.

And although I cannot draw draw strong comparisons to other Assassin's Creed games in the series either, I affirm that Black Flag is to me, a standalone masterpiece. No doubt the best pirate game I've ever got involved with.

The best part about Black Flag might just be the naval combat system, which I contribute to my praise for the game. It is exciting and challenging, and really made me feel like I was in the Golden Age of Piracy. Ship shanties and natural disasters enhance said sailing more-so, and boarding ships is also a feature in the game, and probably my favorite thing to do while playing (and I bet others can agree!). Apart from ship sailing, the game offers an abundance of other activities such as exploring its awe-inspiring visuals, hoarding collectibles across the map, pursuing assassination contracts, and crafting/upgrading the player and ships load-out.

I did not care for the segments of the game that the player in a real-time office expanding on the Assassin's Creed lore as a whole, but I did fall in love with the primarily plot, which was simply a thrilling pirate adventure with a lovable cast of characters.

Well, I guess it's time for the two of us to brawl
Time to settle who's the baddest pirate once and for freakin' all

I wake up (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Don't give a fuck (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Love to drink (Cuz I'm a pirate)
I stink (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Don't shower (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Make bitches cower (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Gettin' booty (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Takin' doodies (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Eat rotten beef (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Lost all my teeth (Cuz I'm a pirate)
Far from home (Cuz I'm a pirate)
All alone

Edward is def my fav assassin, him just being a guy on his grindset surrounded by ancient orders and powers beyond his understanding is so funny to me and plays out in such a way that he absolutely pays the price for his greed in the end.

The game was playing fine for about 3 hours ([i]after I spent 30 minutes looking for, and testing, solutions[/i]), and then, a few moments ago, the game crashed and now it simply will not play. I get to loading into the game and *boop* it just starts freezing, and then crashes.

Never a fan of Assassin Creed franchise, but after watching comparison between Black Flag and Skull and Bones, I am a little intrigue with Black Flag's Open World Pirate Simulator. 

After downloading and installing the game, I was caught by surprised with a CD-Key, I was bewildered because almost every old games I bought from Steam recently never asked me for a CD key. I did not notice any instruction from the game or from the store page where to get the CDKey, so I used search engine to do some research, it turns out you have to get the CD Key from Game's property, it is silly, but that the way it is. 

The game is nearly 10 years old, runs very well at 2160p at max settings with Ryzen 5900 and RTX 3080, I did not noticed any ""windows compatibility"" issues plaguing older games so far. I was greeted with a postage stamp screen size, so I went to graphics settings and crank up the resolution matches my windows resolution and voila a full screen!

The graphics is a little dated mainly on shaders and lighting reminding me of Fallout 3 or GTAIV, but with higher quality models and textures, but it can improved with some ENB reshade mod. You started with a tutorial with basic ship combat and player character movements.

Though, made under a corporate publisher, but you can see the passion put into the game by the talented developers, the corporate culture was much different 10 years ago. Overall the game is fairly impressive that was made to make it run on PS3/Xbox 360. Black Flag definitely aged like a fine wine.",1708359539,1708361120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" is an action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and released in 2013. Set in the early 18th century during the Golden Age of Piracy, the game follows Edward Kenway, a charismatic and ambitious pirate who becomes embroiled in the conflict between Assassins and Templars. Here's a review highlighting the positives and negatives of ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"":

Positives:

1. **Open-World Exploration**: ""Black Flag"" offers a vast and immersive open world set across the Caribbean Sea and its numerous islands. Players can explore bustling ports, hidden coves, and expansive wilderness areas, encountering a variety of wildlife, landscapes, and historical landmarks along the way.

2. **Naval Gameplay**: A standout feature of ""Black Flag"" is its highly acclaimed naval gameplay mechanics. Players command their own ship, the Jackdaw, engaging in thrilling naval battles, exploring uncharted islands, and plundering enemy vessels. The naval combat is intuitive and exhilarating, with dynamic weather conditions and realistic ship physics adding depth to the experience.

3. **Engaging Story and Characters**: The narrative of ""Black Flag"" is rich and compelling, weaving together themes of adventure, betrayal, and redemption against the backdrop of the Golden Age of Piracy. Edward Kenway is a charismatic and complex protagonist, surrounded by a diverse cast of memorable characters, including famous pirates like Blackbeard and Anne Bonny.

4. **Freedom and Exploration**: ""Black Flag"" emphasizes player freedom and exploration, allowing players to chart their own course through the Caribbean and pursue a variety of activities and side quests. From hunting elusive animals to uncovering buried treasure, the game offers countless opportunities for discovery and adventure.

Negatives:

1. **Repetitive Mission Structure**: Despite its open-world freedom, ""Black Flag"" suffers from a somewhat repetitive mission structure, particularly in its land-based missions and side quests. Many missions follow a formulaic pattern of eavesdropping, tailing targets, or engaging in combat, leading to a sense of monotony over time.

2. **Lackluster Modern-Day Storyline**: While the historical narrative of ""Black Flag"" is engaging, the modern-day storyline set in the present day is often criticized for its lackluster execution and disconnect from the main plot. The modern-day segments feel tacked on and fail to resonate with players as strongly as the historical storyline.

3. **Technical Issues and Performance**: Like many open-world games, ""Black Flag"" is not without its technical issues, including occasional framerate drops, graphical glitches, and AI inconsistencies. While these issues are relatively minor, they can detract from the overall immersion and polish of the game.

4. **Limited Stealth Mechanics**: While ""Black Flag"" offers a variety of gameplay options, including stealth, the stealth mechanics are relatively simplistic compared to other entries in the series. Stealth encounters often lack depth and complexity, limiting the strategic options available to players during infiltration missions.

In conclusion, ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" offers a captivating and immersive pirate experience set against the backdrop of the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. With its expansive open world, engaging naval gameplay, and compelling narrative, ""Black Flag"" stands as one of the most beloved entries in the ""Assassin's Creed"" series, despite its occasional technical issues and repetitive mission structure.",1708243321,1708243321,True,2,1,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

You can find the key after install the game. From the Steam Library- Right Click the game- then click Manage- then CD Keys. I had to manually type in the key- copy paste did not work. After you put in the key it might ask you to enter your Ubisoft Password. The game starts as it should after that.

I refunded the game, then later in a moment of weakness, I re-bought it. For some reason it worked this time. It's pretty good. I would certainly wait on a deal though. This game is good, but it's not at all new, and the bugs are still present.

ORIGINAL COMMENT--
Literally doesn't start up. The farthest I got was the disclaimer about the multicultural team. I did a bit of research to find a fix, and apparently this port is filled to the brim with game breaking bugs. The worst part, all of them have been there since since at least 2016, 6 years ago. If you want to replay the best AC game, maybe try a different system. The devs don't care about the PC port, but the producers are certainly willing to make it cost $40.

My suggestion, spend that money on something equally as usable, like a box of 120 white crayons. At least with that, you'll get what's advertised.",1654046688,1707958070,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set in the Caribbean during the early 18th century, the game immerses players in a richly detailed world filled with colorful characters, treacherous pirates, and sprawling landscapes. Developed by Ubisoft, Black Flag stands out as one of the most ambitious entries in the Assassin's Creed series, offering both the familiar elements of the franchise along with refreshing new gameplay mechanics. Here's a detailed look at the pros and cons of this pirate-themed adventure:

Pros:

Captivating Setting: The Caribbean setting of Black Flag is beautifully realized, with lush tropical islands, bustling ports, and vast stretches of open sea to explore. From the vibrant streets of Havana to the remote coves of Nassau, the game offers a diverse range of environments to discover, each filled with its own secrets and challenges.

Dynamic Naval Combat: One of the standout features of Black Flag is its thrilling naval combat system. Players take command of their own pirate ship, engaging in epic battles against enemy vessels, hunting for treasure, and embarking on daring raids. The naval mechanics are well-executed, offering a satisfying blend of strategy and action as players navigate the high seas.

Freedom of Exploration: Black Flag encourages players to explore its open-world environment at their own pace, with plenty of side activities and hidden treasures to discover. Whether hunting for buried treasure, hunting elusive sea creatures, or engaging in naval skirmishes, there's always something new to see and do in the game's vast world.

Engaging Storyline: The narrative of Black Flag follows the journey of Edward Kenway, a charismatic pirate captain caught in the conflict between the Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar Order. The story is filled with twists and turns, as Edward navigates the murky waters of piracy while uncovering secrets that could change the course of history.

Cons:

Repetitive Mission Structure: While Black Flag offers a wealth of content, some players may find the mission structure to be somewhat repetitive. Many of the side missions and activities follow a similar formula, which can lead to a sense of monotony over time.

Technical Issues: Like many open-world games, Black Flag is not without its technical issues. Some players have reported encountering bugs, glitches, and performance issues, particularly on older hardware or less powerful gaming systems.

Steep Learning Curve: The game's naval combat mechanics and open-world gameplay can be daunting for newcomers to the series. While the game does offer tutorials and guidance, some players may find it difficult to master the intricacies of sailing, combat, and exploration.

Overall, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a swashbuckling adventure that offers a compelling mix of action, exploration, and storytelling. Despite its occasional flaws, the game remains a standout entry in the Assassin's Creed series, offering hours of entertainment for fans of historical fiction and open-world gaming alike. Whether sailing the high seas, engaging in epic naval battles, or unraveling the mysteries of the Caribbean, Black Flag delivers an unforgettable gaming experience that will leave players craving more.

It is both my absolute favorite of the Assassin Creed games, and the reason I lost interest in the Assassin Creed games.

This game make me realize I no longer enjoyed the Assassin Creed game staples.  Since future titles wouldn't have pirates to compensate, there was no reason to bother with them.

The bad:  you need to deal with Ubisoft connect launcher which is problematic at best, also may mean if Ubi drops support the game may break forever. Some of the cut scene graphics are showing some age. The gameplay isn't too bad but modern cut scenes are certainly better than these. 

The YMMV: The game is autosave based so if you wanted to rerun a section, there is a way to do it via ""cheats menu"" once unlocked but it doesnt feel the same as having a quicksave/reload option. the Ubi launcher usually crashes on me but once I get the game itself launched everything is fine. annoying to deal with the extra sign-ins",1706996583,1706996583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is the sixth main installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Set during the golden age of piracy, you play as Edward Kenway, father of Haytham Kenway and grandfather of Connor Kenway, a Welsh privateer-turned-pirate in search of gold, glory and fame.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*]Great graphics, although they're starting to show their age.
[*]Great story where you interact with the most notorious pirates in history, including Mary Read, Benjamin Hornigold and Blackbeard.
[*]Awesome naval combat that is expanded from AC III.
[*]Legendary ship battles.
[*]Good customization.
[*]Large, beautiful map to explore.
[*]Underwater sections.
[*]Great sea shanties.
[*]Fantastic soundtrack.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*]Poor optimization.
[*]Present day story is meaningless.
[*]Too many tailing missions.
[*]Enemy shooting markers don't work properly. I got shot regularly even though the marker wasn't bright red yet. It also doesn't show up at certain angles.
[*]Optional objectives.
[*]Too many collectibles, as is the case with most Ubisfot games.
[*]The ship will slowly drift away from the smaller islands, making picking up collectibles even more annoying.
[*]Ubisoft Connect keeps asking for my password every time, yet again...

For its time pretty good. Cant complain because it was released in 2013

---{ Gameplay }---
Gameplay has only improved since its previous game! 

---{ Audio }---
My Headset: Steel Series Arctic Wireless Pro
Very captivating with a very good soundtrack

---{ PC Requirements }---
Avg FPS: 90ish
Specs: I9-9900K, RTX 3080, NVME SSD

---{ Difficulty }---
Depends on what you set the game too. 
Personally if you want to play just for the story you definitely can. If you want hardcore it has it.

---{ Story }---
Following the character ""Edward Kenway"" and his story was extremely good! Why they didn't make a close sequel to this is a mystery to me

---{ Game Time }---
This game originally took me roughly 2 days to beat since i like to get the side mission along the way and upgrade everything.

---{ Price }---
Wait for Steam sale since this is not worth $40 it was released in 2013

---{ Bugs }---
The game has been well polished and barely has any bugs

---{ Overall }---
10/10 would recommend if you like pirates and assassins

After suffering through Assassin's Creed III, Black Flag brings enjoyment back to the franchise. Edward Kenway is a big upgrade on the dreadfully boring Connor, with plenty of good side characters scattered around the West Indies.

The parkour has been given a solid makeover and feels very smooth, with a limited number of movement bugs.

The map is a brilliant size with lots of encounters and missions to complete 100% sync. You'll keep playing this one even after finishing the story!

As for the story, it's excellently done. The character development of the protagonist is very well thought through and doesn't feel rushed at all. You'll begin to notice that this game doesn't center around Assassin's as much as previous instalments, but be patient as there is lots more to see with this one.

In my opinion, this is the best one of the series, although I am biased - this game was an incredible part of my childhood. I found the seafaring, cutscenes, sea shanties, underwater environments and towns absolutely charming. Using real-world history with embellishment was absolutely an amazing design choice for an open-world pirate game from the Golden Age of Piracy. The main character also has a satisfying arc of development.

Ubisoft isn't the best, and the launcher sucks, but the game itself is worth it.

I would not recommend buying this game - as timeless as it may be - for more than about $20. Wait for a good sale before you dive in.

Screw that. The Steam implementation is buggy AF and not worth it. If you want to play it, buy direct from Uplay since you're going to have to use it anyway and you'll save yourself from the bugs related to at least one of the overlays.

Better yet - just get it on console and save yourself the hassle. Or just don't get it at all.

The AC: Black Flag server is up and Kenway's Fleet works again.

This game still holds the best ship handling and battle mechanics of any age-of-sail game to date. And the never-ending sailing option, with or without combat after the main story ends, turns it into a fully animated 1st/3rd person Combat Sailing simulator. This makes Black Flag re-playable all these years later, and I can't say that about most games released since that time. 

So now we wait and see what the AC:4 'remake' is all about and if it makes, or breaks the original game and its unique play style.

As for the new direction they have chosen:

Sad this game could still be so relevant and amazing with mods. Also since UBI cannot optimize a game for PC for $hit. But as usual Ubisoft loves having you run around collecting and whatknot mainly, that's why the sea and open world to this game are sooooooooo refreshing.

An excellent chapter in the series for sure, with skill based combat with counter kills and building up a kill streak that can blaze through enemies left and right as long as you know how to attack the enemy the right way. With ship battles on top of that complete with shanty singing and general piracy with ship boarding and capturing on top of the usual assassin tasks and side missions you'll have plenty to do. The weakest point of it all? In my opinion, is stealth segments with the ship. Yeah, sneaking around other vessels in your own massive ship can be a pain as you fixate your eyes mostly on the minimap just to evade those detection cones. Multiplayer still kicking, surprisingly, sorta. Ok, it's pretty dead, but more serviceable than AC III which is completely shut down. AC IV's multiplayer still works, it just has zero playerbase more often than not.

Excellent story and alternatives of the game. You will have tons of places to explore and play. I had two main problems.

Loved the various things you can do as a pirate, though they can all become a bit repetitive after a while.
I also loved exploring the seas with my ship, with your crew singing shanties you've found in cities. 
I really like collecting stuff in games but I must say despite that and loving the sea exploration, I found the non stop stopping at random tiny empty islands to pick up one collectible very quickly annoying. Especially when it wasn't a chest (which at least feels like a reward and sticks with the pirate theme), most of the time you would only find an animus fragment which brings absolutely nothing to the game except to count as one of those things you have to 100%.

[u][b]Lifespan :[/b][/u] 40-50 hours to 100%, probably around 20 hours if you just care about the main story.

[u][b]Story :[/b][/u] Like it's usual with Assassin's Creed games, you have two stories going on. The one in the animus (a machine that allows to experience the life of someone's ancestor) and the one in the real world.
In the animus, you play as Edward Kenway, a pirate that discovers the whole assassin-templar conspiracy when he gets into a fight with an assassin, kills him and then pretends to be him. You follow him as he tries to get rich, help his pirate friends and discover the truth around the Observatory, something the assassins and templars are looking for that could allow someone to control the world. For this you become a pirate captain and grow your power with your crew.
In the real world, you're en employee working at Abstergo Entertainment, a company ran by templars that makes games with the animus data. Your job is to research the life of Edward Kenway through the animus. Eventually you discover the conspiracy when assassins ask you to hack the various computers.

I really liked both stories which are somewhat linked.  I was invested in both and never felt like one was preventing me from enjoying the other one. It can be a bit confusing though when you're coming from the previous games, because you're thrown in there without knowing what happened to the usual characters and who you are. Hacking the computers actually allow you to find out more about what happened between the games.

[u][b]Gameplay :[/b][/u] 
In the real world, you get to hack computers. For this you have to do a mini game and there are 3 different ones. One where you have to move a dot on lines on a sphere to try and reach a specific line. One where you have to cross several lines which have red bars that make you start from the beginning (basically the game where a frog crosses a river on logs). And one where you have to match a frequency by choosing different numbers.
Mostly they're fine, I was very rarely annoyed by one of them because they don't last long. Most of the information you find in the hacked files is interesting and a nice dive into the lore of the games.

In the animus, you can do the usual assassin stuff: stealth, kill, eavesdrop. The optional objectives give you a reason to not always just run around killing everyone like a brute, making the gameplay less repetitive and more interesting; but at the same time they're optional so if one is too annoying you can just ignore it (unless you want to 100% the game).
You can do pirate stuff: you can pilot a ship, attack other ships and board them so you can get their cargo, and rescue pirates to add them to your crew. Everytime you board a ship, you need to follow several objectives that change depending on the ship and you have to finish them before all your crew members die.
You can collect shanties for your crew to sing. Find chests to get richer and find treasure maps to find burried chests. You can improve your ship by using materials you find by boarding other ships, making it stronger and deadlier. With your improved ship you can then fight the legendary ships (basically naval boss fights). Destroying ships will give you a bad reputation which will make hunter ships regularly come after you. The worst your reputation, the stronger the hunter ships. When you board a ship you can choose an option to reduce that reputation or you can just pay someone to do it.
You have several side quests (assassination contracts, naval contracts and templar contracts) and mayan stones you need to collect, both unlock a special outfit. You have underwater explorations where you need to avoid sharks and eels. You have sea forts you can attack (first from the sea, then on land) to then capture them and control this part of the sea.
You have a fleet you can control (it's only online though) where you send ships on mission to bring back money, decoration items for your hideout and treasure maps. When you board ships you can choose to send them to your fleet to use them there. The missions happen in the background without your input and can take up to 24 real life hours.
You can hunt on land (deers, monkeys...) and at sea (whales, sharks...) and use that to craft upgrades for your character.
When exploring the sea on your ship, you can stop anywhere and just leave your ship to explore around. There are a lot of mostly empty small islands but the ones with stuff to do have a landmark icon. The big cities or story places will usually be instanced though.

So basically, you have a lot of things that you can do. If some of them are not your cup of tea and you're not after the 100%, you can absolutely ignore them.
I really liked most of them even though they can get repetitive after a while (for example after some time I would just sink ships because I didn't want to go through the boarding objectives).
It's too bad some things seem pointless or not finished. For example the animus fragments which are just collectibles for the sake of being collectibles. They don't represent anything in the game and don't reward you anything when you find them all. Another example is your hideout; you get a cove at some point and you can pay to improve it. That was nice and you can get some bonus with it (free dancers or mercenaries) but I would have liked more things to do in the house or to see your wealth represented in the decor. Right now there's really no point in going there more than once to visit.

[u][b]Achievements :[/b][/u] There are no achievements on steam but you can unlock achievements on ubisoft connect. 
Beware that some of them require playing a lot of multiplayer (which will probably be difficult seeing how old the game is) and playing to 100% the DLC ""Freedom Cry"".",1704396690,1704478146,True,2,0,0.549549520015716553,0,True,False,False

It's one of the handful of games that I periodically return to just to play through the story again. It has memorable characters, classic AC gameplay, great narrative and storytelling, crucial lore to the franchise, and so much more going for it. So why don't I recommend it?

I've always thought it's ridiculous when people leave negative reviews because of Ubisoft's launcher. Yes, Ubisoft has pushed so hard for people to use this barely functional launcher. Yes, it's terrible. No, nobody is going to buy Ubisoft games through their launcher as opposed to Steam (looking at you, Valhalla). No, their launcher probably wouldn't work even if they allocated the same resources to developing it as they do their main titles. But it isn't fair for people to leave bad reviews solely because of their launcher... or so I thought. Because I recently came back to this game - which I never had any problems playing in the past - and I'm now finding that the game either works or it doesn't. Logging into Ubisoft's servers is a gamble; sometimes it works right away, other times I've walked away for 10 minutes and come back to see that nothing changed. Loading a save either crashes or doesn't, and there's no clear pattern to it. Sometimes the game crashes before you even load into the main menu. Sometimes it doesn't.

I really love this game. It's been a cherished title of mine since release. I sincerely want to encourage people to play this game, but I can't do that if the game is half playable. And what the hell happened there, Ubisoft? I haven't had this problem in the 10 years this game's been around. What went wrong?



Update: It's been a few days since I wrote this. In the span of about an hour, I have tried launching this game nearly 30 times. Not once has it managed to connect to Ubisoft's servers. I rest my case.",1704167765,1704473917,False,2,0,0.505907177925109863,0,True,False,False

I can't imagine a game I would want remastered more than this one.
I've never played the multiplayer.  I'm not really that into being a pirate, nor can I say it has a realistic sailing physics model.    BUT.

This game was made with attention to every detail.  Even though bugs can make funny things happen, you can see the work of talented artists EVERYWHERE.  Even some of the combat animations can bug out in funny ways simply because of how much distance they can cover, and how long the sequences are.  Twitchy gamers might find this maddening.  Someone who loves counter based choreographed animation sequences will get dopamine releases constantly when it works right.  (It looks beautiful but you have a very high chance of glitching on all the world detail LOL.)

Something I noticed that speaks of what we should expect of AAA titles:  You can slowly push your joystick forward to go from barely moving to walking, and then squeeze your trigger to transition from walking to sprinting.  This ""Analog"" speed control is something missing in many games.  To be able to choose exactly what speed you want to move is very nice, and far superior to other WALK/RUN/SPRINT combos.  Honestly any button mashing monkey is going to miss (or dislike) details like this in their pursuit of the speed run score.  But if you play with an audience this game showcases art and beauty in not only it's environment detail, but also in the realism visible in player movement.

I will say I've tried the game using HDR enabled, and tried AutoHDR through Windows, but this is a title that looked so much better with it turned off on my system.  (it did make it brighter, but the color wasn't right.)

My system struggles with the older Physx engine so that gets turned off.
My OLED doesn't struggle with shimmer so I turn off AntiAliasing as well.  (This makes the water look amazing, but introduces shimmer around ship ropes on slower screens.)
I don't use the soft shadows, and instead go for highest sharp shadow setting I can get. (preference.)

I hope to revisit this game the rest of my life.  (I still have a NOHUD playthrough scheduled, as well as a pacifist playthrough.)",1704472018,1704472526,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

1. You play a savage, a primitive mercenary who goes over dead bodies, just to get rich. Edward Kennedy is a parasite, a scrupulous scoundrel. The fact that he ends up doing (debatable) ""good"" in the end, is an accident since the money led him that way. The often touted character development is very shallow. 

I much prefer the AC titles in which one liberates people against oppressors, revenges injustice, makes one an advocate for honest and innocent people. It is much more fun to eliminate evil people rather than killing random people that are in one's path to a financial fortune. 

2. While other AC titles create an experience, this remains a game. The difference is that one does not forget the controls and is awed by visuals and sound, but rather is constantly reminded which key to press for what and needs to figure out what the game wants one to do. It is not enough to understand in principle what needs to be done and have one's own game plan, rather one needs to figure out how the game requires one to do something.
 
3. The best part of the story is the modern day development; there is at least some suspense and some of the recordings are very well done. My favourite one is that from Desmond Miles where he talks about his memory of his father. The pirate story is pretty boring. Get this McGuffin to chase another McGuffin. There is no real intrigue or mystery (apart from the ""observatory"").

4. The story is told in ""sequences"", which are subdivided in ""missions"". The game is very busy to tell you what to do next, and particular how to do it, which I found to be very immersion breaking. Sometimes, however, it fails to disclose requirements and then presents you after the mission how you failed to completely master it in every which way. At other times, the game is also unnecessarily specific how you have to complete a challenge (e.g., you must not stray too far from an end boss once the fight is triggered, even when it would be advantages to gain some distance to first strategically eliminate other NPCs first). Why not let a player use their own strategies? 
Sometimes it is not clear what the next objective is, e.g., I cannot be the only one who was stumped about what to do when sailing to a target island. There is no harbour and one is supposed to figure out that the ship will not need to moored or anchored and one is just expected [spoiler]to stop the ship somewhere and swim to the island[/spoiler]. Furthermore, despite the frequent, immersion-breaking tutorials, the naval combat controls are not explained that well. There is a reason why there are respective YouTube tutorials for them. Most of them are clear, but the fire bombs were not explained at all, IIRC. 

5. While the graphics are overall surprisingly good for a game of this vintage, faces look really bad. It is tough relating to characters that looks so much like cartoon figures. I did not have this issue with AC Unity, perhaps the graphics were already better or the story drew me in. 

6.  Many cut scenes play repeatedly and cannot be skipped, even though one has seen them many times before. These cut scenes are not context-sensitive either, e.g., after defeating a ship, the same laid back attitude resumes, regardless of whether one is actually in a battle with other ships or a fortress. 

7. The controls are extremely clunky. They frequently leads to silly actions being performed that at best look stupid and at worst cost one one's life. The reason is that one does not actually move the character but rather triggers predefined action sequences (similar to an arcade game like ""Streetfighter""). If it works, it looks cool but a) is boring as one essentially retrieves canned moves, and b) very, very frequently, it does not work. The character then clings to a fence instead of jumping over it, jumps away from a wall in a completely unpredictable manner, etc. This can be very frustrating if these control fits occur in some difficult to reach location since one then has to go through the rigmarole of getting to the spot time and again until one figures out how to make the character behave properly in a challenging spot. FWIW, I had to get used to the controls in AC Unity but then rarely had issues with them. 

The frequent failures of the game to guess the right action is aggravated by the fact that a very low number of keys are highly overloaded. Shift is not only used to for sprinting but also to scale objects which leads one to frequently climb objects unintentionally. The function of ""E"", for instance, depends on the context. Sometimes you wan to whistle but you cannot because either you are hanging of a ledge (where ""E"" drops you) or you are hidden in a hideout with a killed enemy and would loot them by pressing ""E"". There a number of keys that are not used which could have been used to reduce this overloading issue which not only reduces one's actions in a specific situation but also requires one to watch the dynamic mapping in the top right of the screen that explains which key does what currently. This is not my idea of fun; neither is it my preference to always see either a grey or white WiFi symbol that tells me whether the game has a connection to the server on the screen. There is no option to hide this entirely superfluous indicator.

8, There is quite a bit of farming necessary to get one's ship into a useful state and develop the character. I have no idea why many complain about an ""RPG-style"" for AC Orgins/Odyssey when Black Flag essentially has an implicit level system as well and forces one to complete a number of side missions in order to stand a chance in the main missions. I normally don't have a problem with some farming and grinding being required but when the story is as lame as it is in Black Flag, these requirements become a frustrating chore.

While the game has some good bits and shows glimpses of what made AC Origins great, for instance, and I occasionally even had fun, any such streaks where abruptly ended by the character doing their thing instead of me having agency over their actions (due to the clunky controls). There are simply better AC games and it would be a shame if someone played this -- touted by some as the ""best ever"" -- and came to the conclusion AC games are not worth it.  I can see how Black Flag must have been impressive at the time it was released but since then controls have been become much more intuitive, AFAIC, and there are much better ways to get a taste of the AC franchise. 

For context: I hugely enjoyed AC Unity, and absolutely loved AC Origins and AC Odyssey. My preferred gaming style is using a stealth approach and my favourite weapon is bow and arrow (even when playing as Lara Croft, I almost never use guns, let alone machine guns). I also like open-world games where the character can scale pretty much every obstacle. Theoretically, therefore, I should like Black Flag but it simply is not fun to constantly lose agency over the character because it decides to trigger some unproductive move/action. I was often forced to go into battles even though I would have preferred a 100% stealth approach because of the clunky controls. Also, I could never relate to the base motives of the main character (Edward) and the story failed to grip me 95% o the time.  I finished the game because a) I thought maybe I'll start liking it more at some point, and b) I had the ambition to finish it, no matter what. It wasn't fun most of the time, though and a wiser person would have abandoned it about a third of the way in.  

If you are a huge pirate fan, don't care about questionable character traits, don't need a captivating story, and are very tolerant towards complete behavioural failures due to the clunky controls then Black Flag may be a good choice for you. For anyone trying to get a taste of the AC franchise, I recommend to avoid this game.",1703947154,1704320374,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

A different take but a phenomenal route, and a really fun, compelling story. Graphics still hold up pretty well (playing at 1440p max settings) and for this game, avoiding fast travel is a must. Gorgeous open-world, probably the best world in all of the franchise, and I definitely recommend picking up, but only on sale.

Overall, I would recommend this. One of the best naval games I've ever played, and the story kept me invested. The graphics hold up spectacular for an older game, and run smooth at high settings on my system, and my hardware is far from good. The worst aspects of this game I only discovered when I set my sights on 100%ing it. The optional objectives were rough and had me screaming at my monitor at times, frustrating for sure. The uncharted island quests were also tedious and took forever, very mundane. Movement was also rough, Edward always decided to jump the wrong way and kill himself, as much as i tried to talk him out of it. This strikes me as weird for a game so focused on this aspect, but have no reference for the rest of the series. In reality my save is stuck at 99%, as some quests are locked behind ubisoft connect, which is super bugged out for me right now. I may come back later to fix it, but for now I'm ready to play something else. I know this sounds super critical, but it is a very good game all said and done.

[i] You are a new employee for Abstergo Industries tasked with going through the animus and reliving the event's of the assassin Edward Kenway. [/i]

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] As a pirate game this is one of the best out there. As an Assassins Creed game it's alright. The assassin you play is an alright character but he's nothing special really. [spoiler] Guy acts like a douche first half of the game and only redeems himself when everybody he's friends with is dead around him.[/spoiler] The story is alright but it isn't what kept me going till the end it was really the ship combat and exploration that kept me going. I don't know I told myself I would 100% this game. I spent over 50+ hours getting every collectable in the game and let me tell you it was not worth it. I got some cool armor out of it sure but that's about it really. Really loved the ship shanties throughout my play through I was often singing along with my pirate crew as I was traveling on the open waters which I do fairly often in that game. The one thing I really hated was how I Kept crashing always around the 5 hour mark. Didn't matter where I was or what I was doing when it got around that time it would shut down on me with a fatal error which pissed me off unbelievably so because I often doing a mission and would have to restart because of it. [/i]

[b] The Value Of The Game [/b]
[i] If you really want a fun pirate experience this is the game for you when it goes on sale for dirt cheap. [/i]

So it felt really weird to me that when I played this game, it didn't sit well with me at all. In fact, I really don't like it.
I really hate to say that, because I hear people say such good things about this game, and even I myself used to get excited over possibly playing this one day. But it's the truth - I just couldn't bring myself to finish this game.
I think it was the ship parts, the gameplay involving sailing your pirate ship to different islands and then doing some mission on there (I could never make sense of the story on this first playthrough), that made me not like this game. It felt slow and tedious, and I found myself constantly just wanting to get to the next thing.
It was also a massive switch from Assassin's Creed Syndicate, which I played immediately before this (the mission with the ""Lowlands Away"" piano puzzle reignited my interest in the game). The rapid switch from a sprawling industrial city to many small scattered islands with not many buildings on them was a bit much for me.
I'm sure the game is still as amazing as everyone says, and maybe one day in the future I'll give it another go. But for now..... 4/10.",1700981162,1703033049,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

This game was advertised as having single player content. But it requires you to connect to their servers even if you are not playing online. 

What does this have to do with this game? Well it means that all of their games moving forward are potentially just long term rentals that are not advertised as such. This is a very anti-consumer practice. And I cannot in good conscience recommend any games from this publisher when that has the potential to happen to any buyer. Ubisoft could patch these games to remove the online requirement. But they're choosing not to. So that makes their products a very poor value proposition in my opinion.

""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" stands out as a gem within the Assassin's Creed series, offering a captivating blend of historical exploration, naval combat, and immersive storytelling. As a dedicated fan of the franchise, diving into the pirate-infested Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy was an exhilarating departure from the traditional Assassin's Creed settings.

Compared to its predecessors, ""Black Flag"" distinguishes itself by focusing more on the swashbuckling adventures of pirates rather than the traditional Assassin versus Templar conflict. However, it cleverly intertwines this pirate tale with the overarching Assassin's Creed narrative, exploring the origins of key elements like the First Civilization artifacts (Pieces of Eden) and the ongoing struggle between the Assassins and Templars.

The game brilliantly connects to the larger Assassin's Creed lore through its modern-day segments, where players assume the role of a research analyst exploring the memories of Edward Kenway, the protagonist. These segments serve as a bridge between Kenway's story and the modern-day conflict, tying the narrative threads together and maintaining the series' continuity.

What makes ""Black Flag"" particularly praiseworthy is its seamless integration of naval exploration and combat. The open-world sailing, plundering ships, and engaging in naval battles were a highlight, adding depth and variety to the gameplay. It's a testament to how the series evolved by embracing new gameplay mechanics while staying true to its core elements.

However, while the naval gameplay is exceptional, some fans of the series might feel that the focus on piracy overshadowed the traditional Assassin's Creed stealth and parkour mechanics. The balance between land-based exploration and naval gameplay might not resonate equally with all fans, especially those who prefer a stronger emphasis on the Assassin Brotherhood's activities.

Overall, ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" is a standout title that successfully expands the series' horizons while staying rooted in its lore. It expertly connects to the broader Assassin's Creed universe through its narrative ties and modern-day segments. I highly recommend this game, especially for fans of open-world exploration, naval combat, and those intrigued by a fresh take on the Assassin's Creed formula. Its thrilling gameplay, rich storytelling, and immersive world make it a must-play for both dedicated fans and newcomers to the series.",1702449444,1702449444,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Coming to the game, it is a great one. I mean you can do a lot of stuff and the map is big as well. Yes most of it is just water but even these waters  are living and you can hunt,pirate and do all those stuffs. Ship combat is great and the more you upgrade your ship the more effective it becomes so do that. Story was simple yet touching. hand to hand combat is brutal. Speaking of exploration there are tons. I mean I have finished the main story and I have also done some other side activities and the total completion is 53 percent so get an idea. I did not like the tailing missions though but beside that all is good with this game. Even the graphics works great in 2023.

The issue is that Ubisoft has removed cloud saves. Unfortunately I, like many others, only realized this after I reinstalled the game to find my progress reset.

I completed the story and almost had all the collectibles. Hours and hours... no, days upon days of hard, albeit fun, work for it all to be lost.

Gameplay also holds up extremely well compared to the other pre-RPG games. Ship sailing feels great and parkouring around settlements and islands is fun.

The first time i played it was years ago on an old i3 asus laptop with integrated graphics which ran better than my current setup. I should be able to run it maxed at 60fps but sadly i never reach that and regualrly drop in the 30s and framerate is inconsistent as can be.

Gameplay did not change much aside from the naval combat and controller support restricted to xbox controllers despite a release on both PS3 and PS4. No mods i found fixed that. As per Ubisoft traditions, it is padded with a ton of meaningless collectible hunt.

The storytelling is very weak, the overal story itself is bland and boring, the main character is not likeable at all (within the intro he lied twice, betrayed someone, kept acting like a jackass... it doesn't move on much from that).

Graphics aged rather poorly to the point were it's closer to the PS3 version than PS4.
It's not hideous but really dated and unimpressive.

It is also without a doubt THE BEST pirate video game ever made. The only thing that would make it better is if the assassin's creed part of the story was removed. When you are playing as Edward the world just feels so full of life and adventure. Everything you would want from a pirate game is in here. Treasure maps, bounties, sword and gun fighting, stealing, discovering ancient treasures, ship combat, etc. 

Speaking of ship combat, the ship combat in this game is highly addictive and has a great loop. You start with a pretty average Jackdaw, slowly upgrading it by sacking ships across the Caribbean. You can decide to simply sink ships and recover half of the cargo that floats up, or you can disable the ship and board so you and your crew can engage the enemy crew and take over the ship. This lets you take all the cargo and decide if you want to recruit the survivors, take the ship into your fleet, or sink it. I don't know how this has not been done effectively since this game came out, but the ship combat alone makes this a fun game to play.

Exploration is done extremely well in this game. You can travel all across the Caribbean stopping at pretty much every island there is. Granted, the landscapes aren't 1:1 with reality, but that should't really matter when making a fun pirate game. Every location has so much to find from treasure, relics, shanties, bar fights, gambling, contracts, treasure maps, plantations and their warehouses, and so on. There are also underwater sections that, while they aren't perfect, are pretty engaging and enjoyable. 

A final personal note I would like to add. My favorite part of the game definitely ends up being just sailing the Jackdaw through the waves while listening to my crew sing sea shanties. Can't get enough of that even after years of playing.

TLDR: This is the greatest pirate game ever made to date, that is hiding as an Assassin's Creed game. 10/10",1701920811,1701920811,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have never played a naval game like this one. The sailing and ocean battle mechanics are perfect. The sea shanties stay with you for life. The hunt for booty is addictive. The outfits and upgrades are awesome.

The rest of the game? When you're on land, I suppose the gameplay is about as good as any other AC game if not a little better. They finally introduced an option to crouch in this game. It is MIND BOGGLING that you cannot SNEAK in a STEALTH GAME but that's how the previous entries were. There seem to be more places to hide but you're screwed if you use a controller that has any amount of drift.

The insistence on tying the fun pirate gameplay to boring, nonsensical futuristic plot is unfortunate. I groaned every time I had to get out of the animus. I find the overarching plot of this series to be trite and nihilistic, but to each their own. All in all, great game, I still play after I finished when I get the itch for good sailing gameplay, because I don't know of any other game that does it quite as well.

👍 Pros: 👍
- i like the kredo
- fighting
- story
- missions
- graphic

👎 Cons: 👎
- Outside the animus it is relatively empty. While there is a lot to collect like taking notes and hacking the other computers as well as the server but otherwise the present is not very interesting that the character is dumb.


My extra opinion:

Best Game Ever. I like the Assassins. I like Edward Kenway. I like the story. I like the graphics/music. Its a very good game. I recommend it",1569272372,1701120167,True,19,2,0.728315174579620361,3,True,False,False

[h1] [b] [i] ★★★★★★★☆☆☆ [/i] [/b] [/h1]

Assassin’s Creed® IV Black Flag™ is often hailed is THE BEST Assassin's Creed game to date. That is a pretty daring claim, considering that as of writing this review, there are whopping TWELVE main series entries and SEVENTEEN spin-offs. That's a lot of competition, yet even in 2023, Black Flag supposedly still outclasses both the games that came before it and the ones that came after. I can't help but disagree.

[h1] [i] “Caution's nothing without charisma. If a man plays the fool, then it's only fools he'll persuade. But appear to be the devil... and all men will submit.” [/i] [/h1]

My main contention with the notion of Black Flag being the best AC game is that it is not that great at being one. Black Flag is a pirate game first, Assassin's Creed title second. Now, that is not necessarily a bad thing. The developers decided to work on a fresh take on a series that has, up until this point, felt very samey, often lacking in innovation, even if it was amazing at what it was trying to portray. After the legendary Ezio trilogy and AC 3 serving as a conclusion of Desmond's saga, the base formula had to have been re-worked. Cue Black Flag, where the titular ""assassinating"" plays second fiddle to being a pirate. Honestly though? It's incredible amount of fun and is one of the best takes of historical pirate characters I have ever seen in entertainment media.

Since the pirating is the main attraction of BF, I may as well start here. Even today, we don't have pirate-themed games focusing on naval combat that do it in as entertaining and intuitive of a way that Black Flag does. Everything from controlling your ship to skirmishes on sea to in-fighting between the British and the Spanish all the way to man-on-man combat when boarding creates immensely satisfying and addictive gameplay loop where you can easily spend dozens of hours just on defeating the opposing ships and seizing their cargo, then using that to improve your own vessel, which is surprisingly expensive and lengthy process, albeit no less satisfying. Everything happening on sea is handled perfectly, 'nuff said.

When you move onto land and land-based activities, you will understand why I mentioned that as a AC game, Black Flag is a little lacking. There is less of everything here than in the previous games - less parkour, less verticality, less gear purchasing and upgrading and less focus on narrative and character development. Now, I know this may be a bit controversial as the story here is often cited as fan favorite but those who played it all the way back, tell me honestly - how much can you really remember about it? It is not that the story is straight up forgettable, it is just not nearly as memorable as the previous entries. Additionally, characters themselves seem less developed. Although I liked Edward better than Connor in AC3, he's got nothing on Ezio or even Altair. Villains are also not as fleshed out as even those in AC3, lacking any outstanding ones like Haytham or Lee. It also has issues with pacing, stretching some parts unnecessarily while glossing over more critical events like Edward being stranded. Overall, though, it is a good story, just not nearly the best in the series.

I want to also point out the lack of attention that the present-timeline aspect got. Yeah, I know that the present was never really the primary focus but as much as I may be in the minority here, it was really important to me, and I really liked how it was handled in the Desmond saga. Unfortunately, in Black Flag, this aspect feels rushed and slightly uninspired. You play as an unnamed Abstergo game/program tester who is tasked with extracting specific data from Edward’s past while getting entangled with the modern Assassins and unwittingly helping them. While an intriguing concept, the execution is lacking and its clear that after Desmond, Ubisoft had no clear idea as to where the modern timeline should proceed.

If I were to sum up my thoughts on Black Flag it would be that it is, without a doubt, one of the best pirate games of all time and is definitely one of the better Assassin’s Creed games, even if it lacks some focus on the series core theme. I see no reason (apart from the current technical challenges) not to recommend giving this a shot no matter whether you are a long-time fan of the franchise as a whole or if this is your entry into it.

[tr]
	[th][b] [i] Positives [/i] [/b][/th]
	[th][b] [i] Negatives [/i] [/b][/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ The focus on a pirate theme during the Golden Age of Piracy was a great choice and lends itself well to a combination of traditional AC gameplay combined with much more focus on naval battles than it was in AC 3[/td]
	[td]- Character design is lacking[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ The story, although a bit generic and uninspired give its predecessors still feels enjoyable and interesting enough[/td]
	[td]- Parkour, while still great, hasn’t really seen much improvement from AC 3[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ Voice-acting is, once again, great[/td]
	[td]- Very small weapon variety with very few new swords or pistols to buy[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ Beautiful, albeit a bit forgettable OST (except for shanties, those are legendary)[/td]
	[td]- The fact that the game blue-balls you by giving you the control of much larger type of ship like (Man O’ War type of ship) for a little bit only to never let you purchase and upgrade that type of ship for yourself is incredibly disappointing as using their weapon arsenal feels a thousand times better than even fully upgraded Jackdaw[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ Graphics and level design are stellar – the sea and water in general is absolutely stunning while the land-based sceneries can be breathtaking at (especially the Great Inagua) along with beautiful towns like Havana, even after a decade of game being out[/td]
	[td]- Legendary ships designer can very much go walk the plank. I get that they are meant to be the ultimate challenge and are meant to be difficult even with fully upgraded ship but what I do not get is how a ship that’s three times the size of Jackdaw have MUCH better speed and maneuverability than its much smaller counterpart while also enjoying the benefits the ULTIMATE firepower, ram impact or mortar damage… F*ck them and double-f*ck whoever surmised they were well thought-out[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ Naval gameplay/battles are the star of AC IV, even if the whole damage ship/defeat crew loop can get slightly repetitive over time. However, all of the activities you can do from actual battles, to upgrading your ship to amazing underwater treasure-hunting make it feel incredibly rewarding[/td]
	[td]- Way too many tailing misssions[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ Amazing ship design – from the adorable little Schooners to absolutely massive and menacing Man O’ Wars, they are all designed masterfully[/td]
	[td]- Present timeline is uninspired and does not feel like an improvement to Desmond saga[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td]+ Combat and its improvements from 3 feel amazing[/td]
	[td]- For some reason, this is the first mainline Assassins Creed where it is impossible to circumvent the buil-in 60fps lock no matter how hard you try. You were able to unlock in all previous entries and the games worked fine (apart from few specific sections where you needed to re-lock it). It’s a shame[/td]

Once you get your pirate ship the fun really begins!

You'll be singing Drunken sailor and drinking rum while you sail the Caribean, plundering and adventuring. Controls get a bit of getting used to, but it's fairly easy to pick up and to recover from a mistake.

Sea battles take some getting used to skill wise, I prefer the 3rd person long range boat maneuvering of Sid Meiers Pirates because it's simplar and easier to see whats going on, but Black Flag makes you feel more that your in charge of your boat, and you can shout at your crew and make them sing songs.

On land it's fun trying to find treasure and many other things, he's a nimble fellow and running, jumping and climbing needs the minimum of practise, although you'll still keep trying to run up walls 2/3 times in a row before he stops.

Get your buckle and swash it!


*Only con, get rid of the future cut scene thing!*

The hell are the shit present day cut scene crap about in AC games?! They're bloody crap.
I want to pretend to be a pirate, not pretend to be a man at a computer pretending to be a pirate.

Just getting into the game and feeling all Sid Meiers Pirates Gold Amiga CD32 vibes then cuts to a long boring unskippable interactive cut scene with a stupid cow telling me stuff in a lobby, no woman I don't care about you blah blah me pirate you sod off!

I never completed the original AC because of the crap present day cut scene thing, just set the game in the era it starts in!

Every time I start these games the future cut scene Animus rubbish totally ruins the vibe! 
Imagine starting to watch a cool film, then someone runs in your house steals your controller, pauses the film then fucks off 10 minutes down the road to hide your controller so you can't enjoy the film till you find your controller to unpause the movie.

I couldn't give two figs about the future story line, I just watched tv or read while they were waffling their bullcrap about hacking, you can't even run in them, you just wander about slowly while some one talks, I'm litterally not listening! GET RID OF IT!

 I'm a pirate Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr I needs me plunder not ye yallygaggin ya future based land lubber!

Luckily I think ACBF has a minimal amount of future bull crappery (so far 4 interactive walk about slowly for no reason, while someone speaks) Scenes - Get past them the game is worth it!

As a game that seamlessly combines the series' signature action and stealth mechanics with an expansive naval experience, it offers a host of compelling reasons why it should be played.

Set in the golden age of piracy, ""Black Flag"" introduces players to Edward Kenway, a charismatic privateer-turned-pirate who finds himself entangled in the ancient conflict between Assassins and Templars. The narrative is rich, filled with historical intrigue, and features a colorful cast of real-life pirates like Blackbeard and Charles Vane, making it a treasure trove for history buffs.

The game's open-world exploration is one of its most captivating aspects. The Caribbean setting is a sprawling maritime playground with dozens of islands to discover. The sense of freedom as you captain the Jackdaw, Kenway's ship, is exhilarating. Each island and coastal city is meticulously designed, brimming with life and opportunities for adventure.

Naval combat is a core element of ""Black Flag"" and is executed with thrilling precision. Engaging in ship battles is deeply satisfying, with a need for strategic maneuvering and resource management that adds a layer of depth to the gameplay. Upgrading the Jackdaw is both necessary and rewarding, as it allows players to take on more formidable enemy ships and fortresses.

When it comes to traditional Assassin’s Creed gameplay, ""Black Flag"" does not disappoint. The stealth and parkour mechanics are refined, allowing for fluid movement through the game's various environments, whether it's a bustling port town or a dense jungle. The combat system is robust, offering a variety of weapons and tactics to approach each encounter.

Graphically, ""Black Flag"" is a visual feast. The game beautifully captures the Caribbean's crystal-clear waters, lush landscapes, and stormy weather, creating an immersive and dynamic world. The attention to detail extends to the bustling towns and the historically accurate ships that ply the game’s seas.

The sound design is equally impressive, with an atmospheric soundtrack that features sea shanties sung by Kenway's crew, which adds to the authenticity of the seafaring experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with performances that bring depth and personality to each character.

""Black Flag"" also delves into the lore of the Assassin’s Creed universe, expanding upon the series' mythos in interesting ways. The modern-day storyline continues, providing connections to the larger narrative of the franchise.

The game offers a vast array of activities beyond the main story, including hunting for treasure, harpooning, and taking on assassination contracts. This richness of content ensures that there is always something new to discover, making the game highly replayable.

In summary, ""Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag"" is an exceptional title that successfully marries the franchise's traditional elements with innovative naval mechanics. It's a game that captures the romance and brutality of piracy, offering an adventure that is as deep as the oceans it allows players to explore. For its compelling narrative, vibrant open world, and thrilling naval combat, ""Black Flag"" is a game that deserves to be experienced by any fan of the action-adventure genre.",1699462538,1699462538,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You roam the high seas, board and ransack ships that come across your way. You explore for hidden treasures, purchase upgrade and gather your crew. Pretty straightforward. A huge map filled with many icons and collectibles, as is custom with any AC game. Although belongs to the Assassin's Creed franchise, it works perfectly as a pirate-themed game in itself.

This game's main quest is quite brilliant. The writing is best in any Assassin's Creed game, and in comparison to other games still quite good. Characters are well memorable, dialogue is exceptionally witty, clever, and accurate to the style and vocabulary of the time period it tries to portray. Rarely have I seen so engaging lines, pure pleasure to listen and read. As a nice detail, some words are even randomly capitalised in subtitles, as was custom during the time. One detail I loved was the sea shanties, that your ship's crew sings and really brings atmosphere to the game.

Setting the modern day story, in a quite-literally evil multinational corporation is a nice ironic jab at the corporate office culture. I didn't think playing around in a virtual office building could be fun would be so fun but here I am proven wrong.

However, you must still remember this is an Ubisoft game, with all of its negatives in mind. As the game says at one point:

It requires a lot of patience to get used to the AC franchise particularly if it's your first time and you're expecting similar combat/gunfight features to other games. I initially found this frustrating, particularly the naval battles in which you are being overrun by well resourced Spanish Navy vessels.

It took me 3 weeks to overcome those issues and I eventually found the game to my liking. In fact the very aspect that frustrated me before has now turned into what excites me the most: the conquest of enemy ships! It gives you a rush of adrenaline every time when you locate a ship to attack, incapacitate it and board it to plunder.

Game can be a bit repetitive at times but the landscapes and colours are gorgeous, the locations so well designed (Havana in particular). As someone who grew up on a tropical island those locales appeal greatly to me, with their plantation crops and beaches. A number of missions are not straightforward at all and require quite a level of brain-racking, which makes completion more satisfactory.

I don't know if I'll be purchasing another game from the AC franchise but considering how little I paid for this game which is a decade old and how well it holds up, I can't complain much.",1695749374,1696701897,True,0,0,0.415647923946380615,0,True,False,False

Pros
+ Absolutely huge game. If you are into collectibles and exploration, this is your game. 
+ Memorable characters, especially Mary.
+ Diverse world environments compared to other AC games, taking you from jungles on the western coast of Africa to the tropical islands of the Caribbean to the swamps of early colonial US.
+ The feel of sailing, fighting other ships, boarding, harpooning, and all things water are exceptionally well done. 

Cons
- Lighthouses. Underwater movement is clunky.
- A high number of bugs experienced. Nothing a reset mission couldn't fix, with the exception of Conway's Fleet not loading which was a bummer. 
- Combat is very repetitive, as it always is in AC. Block + counter. Stagger + swing. That is about it, although at least this AC includes some diversity with different dart types. 
- The rope dart is way too cool to get 80% of the way through the story. I would have loved to have used it throughout the game.

I bought AC 3 and Black Flag because I really loved AC2 and Brotherhood and I wanted to give these games a chance. So after I pulled myself through the walking simulator that is AC3 I didn´t come with the highest expectations and yet I got dissapointed.


The gameplay is really boring. You basically just need 2 buttons to win every battle. The guns and swords that you can buy for your character are just for estatics. You could walk through the entire game with your starting weapon and it wouldn´t matter at all. Your character is unnecassarily overpowered and it is impossible to connect with him in any way, as the story is written so badly. You meet characters who are not even remotely interesting or charismatic and somehow you are supposed to feel some connection towards them. The death of one of them is supposed to be a game changer but i really couldn´t care less.
They could have made it in an interesting way, but they decided to roll with the ""you remember when you pulled of that cool crazy thing? good that we don´t have to show it"" move (example: Kennway reclaiming back his ship after being left for dead on an island).

So instead of writing an engaging story, Ubisoft decided to fill its map with islands with nothing but unnecessary collectables. Furthermore they make you buy unnecessary stuff in random locations like shops and other upgrades that don´t help you in any way, because you can basically Leeroy Jenkins every mission, except of the ""stealth"" missions, that make you just eavesdrop on random people.

- Ubisoft Connect Compatibility: If you already own ACIVBF on Ubisoft Connect, avoid buying it on Steam or activating it on the same Ubisoft Account. Doing so may lead to having two copies of the game on your Ubisoft Connect account, causing conflicts that prevent the original copy from connecting to online servers. Despite efforts to resolve this through customer support, the issue persisted for me.

- Save File Incompatibility: ACIVBF save files are not transferable between Ubisoft Connect and Steam versions. If you have progress on one platform and plan to buy the game on another, be cautious, as the save file might be considered corrupted on the new platform.

Ubisoft's customer support was unsatisfactory in resolving these problems, causing a frustrating experience lasting several months.

Now, let's focus on the game itself, which truly is a masterpiece, appreciated for its naval combat and pirate theme. The standout aspect is Edward Kenway's character and his well-crafted narrative. With an engaging story, compelling supporting characters, memorable antagonists, and a stellar ending, the game shines in storytelling. Additionally, the gameplay is brilliant, combining both assassin and pirate elements seamlessly.

Initially, I was disappointed with the abundance of ship gameplay, not aligning with the traditional Assassin's Creed style. However, it fits perfectly within the pirate theme and offers enjoyable naval combat even for those who aren't typically drawn to such gameplay. The assassin elements blend harmoniously with the pirate gameplay, especially in the way Edward becomes entangled in the conflict between the assassins and templars. Witnessing Edward's growth throughout the story is highly satisfying.

Regarding the present-day storyline, the absence of Desmond and the altered gameplay was a letdown, but it eventually became engaging and intriguing on its own terms, even though it didn't match the level of Assassin's Creed III.

One aspect that falls short in ACIVBF is the parkour, but I don't mean the system. The gameplay and animation is an upgrade from Assassin's Creed III, the animations being better in my opinion. The lack of expansive cities found in previous games diminishes the parkour experience. Despite my initial skepticism about ship-centric gameplay, I found it to be well-suited for this title and fun to play. But the lack fluid parkour most of the gameplay does take from the Assassin's Creed experience, but I don't think there was anything they could have done better. That's the era, that's the places where the story takes place.

Combat, on the other hand, feels slightly downgraded compared to Assassin's Creed III, though other aspects like running and climbing show significant improvement.

For achievement hunters: ACIVBF has an extensive list of 60 achievements, but unfortunately, Steam doesn't implement them. This can be disappointing for completionists and achievement hunters. To view your achievements, you can check Ubisoft Connect, but even there, you can't share your achievements progress, only you can see it. To add to it, there's the lack of any in-game notifications for earning achievements.
I am planning to complete this game in the future. I will then come back and share my thoughts on the achievements.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is an exceptional game that seamlessly combines the pirate theme with assassin gameplay. With captivating narrative, outstanding characters, and exciting gameplay, making it a memorable and unique experience.

Set sail for the Caribbean in the golden age of piracy and prepare to be captivated by one of the finest entries in the Assassin's Creed series.

The first thing that strikes you about Black Flag is its breathtaking open world. The Caribbean is your oyster, and it's teeming with life. The crystal-clear waters, lush tropical islands, bustling cities, and treacherous jungles are all beautifully rendered. The attention to detail is nothing short of astounding, making every corner of the map a pleasure to explore. Whether you're hunting for buried treasure, engaging in naval battles, or infiltrating enemy strongholds, the world feels alive and immersive.

The star of the show is undoubtedly your ship, the Jackdaw. Sailing the high seas, upgrading your vessel, and engaging in epic naval battles is an absolute joy. The sensation of wind in your sails, the thunder of cannons, and the thrill of boarding enemy ships make every naval encounter a memorable experience. It's rare to see a game where the ship itself is a beloved character, but Black Flag pulls it off flawlessly.

The story, centered around the charismatic rogue assassin Edward Kenway, is engaging and full of twists and turns. Edward's character arc is a rollercoaster ride of personal growth and moral complexity. The game's blend of historical and fictional characters, including appearances by Blackbeard and Charles Vane, adds depth to the narrative and creates a sense of authenticity within the pirate-infested Caribbean.

Gameplay-wise, Black Flag shines on multiple fronts. The series' trademark parkour and assassination mechanics are seamlessly integrated into the open world, allowing for fluid and exhilarating rooftop chases and stealthy takedowns. The combat is fast-paced and satisfying, and Edward's dual-wielding of swords and pistols adds a unique flair to the proceedings.

The sea shanties sung by your crew as you sail add a layer of charm that's hard to resist. These tunes not only provide a soundtrack to your journey but also serve as a reminder of the camaraderie among your motley crew.

""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" is a triumph in storytelling, world-building, and gameplay. It strikes a perfect balance between the series' signature elements and the thrill of pirate life. With a vast, open world to explore, a captivating storyline, and unforgettable naval battles, this game is a treasure trove of gaming excellence. Raise the black flag, set sail, and prepare to be hooked on this unforgettable adventure on the high seas. It's a swashbuckling masterpiece that will leave you yearning for more, long after the credits roll.",1696007427,1696007427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, this is a Ubisoft game and comes with the caveats of such, and I also blame this game for kickstarting the trend of Assassin's Creed games completely forgetting about the Templars vs Assassins conflict and just plopping their core gameplay into any random historical setting they can think of. Nonetheless, gameplay-wise, this is a classic Assassin's Creed game through and through and with it's excellent worldbuilding, this has also become one of the definitive pirate adventure games out there. If you love pirates and seafaring, if you love AC, or both, then Assassin's Creed IV is a must play.

The core of an AC game is here. The parkour feels great, just like the old games. The level design is very well made, feeling natural, while providing plenty of paths to go through. Stealth and combat is gimmicky, but it's what we know and love. Graphics have that distinct mid-2010s look, but still hold up surprisingly well to this day, especially the water. The music is damn excellent too. There's plenty to do in the open world, without devolving into a full blown Ubish!t collectathon chore list. The story itself, while odd to be set in the Caribbean, still centers around Assassins and Templars, the writing is excellent and it doesn't go on any longer than it needs to. Plenty of real life history was also intertwined with the original lore and it's awesome to meet all these historical figures. The characters themselves are charming and engaging, there is real conflict that draws you in and Edward Kenway is an exciting morally grey protagonist. 

The greatest strength of Black Flag of course is the setting. The Caribbean and the Golden Age of Piracy are represented in an amazing way and it's just a joy to immerse yourself in this world, even well after finishing the main story. Beautiful exotic locations, ships of all colonial nations sailing around for you to rob, forts to raid, treasure maps to follow, sea shanties to sing, fish to catch and so much more. This game truly makes you feel like a pirate and provides a superbly fun experience that can be enjoyed at any time. Sailing around is very fun and the controls for both the sailing itself and naval combat are as simple and intuitive as possible. The AC mechanics like the parkour actually integrate surprisingly well into this context and all the systems enhance each other greatly. 

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is one of the last, if not THE last, truly good entry into the franchise. A fresh take on the classic formula, while also retaining the heart and soul that made AC games special and unique in the first place. It introduced enough new mechanics without compromising the core gameplay loop and turning into some weird Zelda clone. And best of all, this game really makes you feel like a badass pirate and let's you immerse yourself in this legendary time period. I mean, Black Flag single handedly kickstarted the rise in popularity of sea shanties. There's a good reason why even a decade after it's release, this game is still revered and remembered so fondly and why to this day, unlike so much other Ubitrash, people keep coming back to it again and again. It's definitely worth a play, so come on and set sail together with us! Cabin boy, start us off and let's sing the Drunken Sailor together! We got plenty of rum below the deck and we still got ways to go till Nassau!",1695680387,1695683099,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

For a game that released in 2013, it honestly holds up well to this day, and probably one of the more solid contenders to the Assassins Creed lines. Certainly a core of the ""classic"" game play over the RPG grindy game play take of the modern titles. Believe it or not, there was a time where stealth and parkour mechanics are critical and icon to the Assassins Creed and Black flag gives you option to either be the pirate version of Rambo with swashbuckling boldness or play the game as a stealthy killer in the shadows.

First off.

Secondly. THERE'S NO CROUCH. Every time when I try to sneak up on enemies or try to sneak around them, I'm always spotted by them because i cant crouch and running make too much noise. This makes the game very annoying and difficult to play.

People think pirates are the worst person in the world, they were hunting the ships, and kill the businessmen, it is true that common pirates were people—people driven by varying motives of survival, financial insecurity, revenge, and a desire for wealth and notoriety. 
However, a part of pirates is quite different with normal pirates, they only attack the profiteer’s ship and the navy of the ruler, and this kind of pirates often obey their own rules, they only hug the treasure from the ruler and capitalists, they never or hurt mariners, besides, they fight the ineffective government in European overseas colonies. This type of pirates is called the fighter for freedom, they are the revolutionaries.

Loved every hour of my 70 hour playtrough of main campaign and both DLCs.
Tried maxing everything at 100%, but some bug with Kenway's fleet locked me out of finding last three buried chests.
Pity, but it is what it is.

Still the best AC game for me.
- gameplay is fabulous 
- setting is magical (colors of nature, sand, small islands, houses, settlements and major locations are really picturesque, and water... yeah, the color and shades of water here are something our of this world... -truely magnificent)
- ship battles are engaging and fun, underwater exploration with its half-horror wibes of being bitten and stung, works perfectly for me
- assassin stuff is beareable (tailing missions are just almost too much, but synchronizations, contracts, chases, assassins vs templars story in present - all evens out neatly)
- side quests and crafting are rewarding and fun, loved the mayan armor and pistol-swords (but all the abstergo fragments and chests God knows where... might be a little too much)
- main story... rarely that game makes me relate so much to characters and fills me with such deep sadness, when it is finished. It's a shame you can't save them all, but boy do I wish to...

It would be safe to say that for me Ubisoft ""captured lightning in a bottle"" with this one.

The issue I had here was that Steam is installed on my C drive and UbiSoft is installed on my D drive. How do I know this? I have Epic installed on the D drive, too. Some of us are hardcore gamers, and even 2TB isn't enough space for all of our games. I have 2 - 2TB SSDs. I use the exact same email address for Steam and UbiSoft. One of my Steam-UbiSoft games was registered while UbiSoft was still installed on the C drive.

The first Steam support rep was unaware that they have a CD key for you. That is unacceptable. I was told that they do not use the keys anymore. 

UbiSoft support is utterly incompetent. I had to provide proof-of-purchase 3 times, my Steam ID twice, then send logs, delete the cache file, re-install, and STILL it was asking me for a CD key. I was getting ready to uninstall the game on Steam and ask for a refund. I right-clicked the game, and saw ""CD Key"". The second Steam support rep had written at some point in-between to inform me of this, but I hadn't bothered reading the email, because the first one said I had to deal with UbiSoft.

So, customer support in Steam is hit-and-miss; customer support in UbiSoft is miss-miss-miss. Since Epic has sales on games in this franchise, and I do not have to deal with any stupidity, I've been buying the rest over there. I will keep an eye on them over here, BUT given that I just paid 17.99€ for Origins Gold in Epic Games, where Steam wants 89€, I don't know if I will be finding them on deep-sale over here.

I posted to try to make people aware of the insane price differences, 79PLN, $69, and 89€ (which is 16€, 62€, and 89€ when translated all into Euros), but Steam deleted my post and warned me not to bump posts just to get attention. It is not the first time that Steam has made some insane claim against me as an excuse to delete a comment or post that they do not like.

As to the game itself, I cannot yet say. I will update this later. However, Steam needs to make a deal so that other companies behave like Paradox. Paradox invites you to set-up an account and gives you benefits for using your Paradox account. You CAN launch your game from their platform, but you do not HAVE to, like you do with EA and UbiSoft.",1693844925,1694508319,False,3,2,0.473176658153533936,0,True,False,False

A common critique you'll hear is ""Black Flag is a great pirate game, but not a great Assassin's Creed game"" and I completely disagree. Everything you love (or maybe don't love) that makes an AC game is here: parkour, stealth, eagle vision, leaps of faith, hidden blades, collectibles, unlockable robes, and most importantly the Assassins vs Templar conflict being a central part to the story. Yes there are heavy pirate elements to it, but that is just due to the setting. This would be like saying ""Assassin's Creed II is a great Italian Renaissance game, not a great Assassin's Creed game.""

In my opinion, Edward's journey is the best of any of our main protagonist Assassins. To see him grow from a rotten scoundrel pirate fueled only by greed to a man far more reflective of his actions and finding more important things to fight for; it's one filled with many moments of heartbreak and triumph.

It's 2023 and this game still looks absolutely breathtaking. Bright, colorful, and immersive. The light blue-green of the water looks so inviting and makes me want to just dive in IRL for a swim. The forests, islands, and cities look great too. The character models, while unique and recognizable, are probably the one thing that may look a bit dated. But you'll be too busy being entranced by some of the best voice acting performances in gaming history to give a hoot.

Seriously, this game deserves more awards than it got for the acting alone. Blackbeard, [spoiler] Mary Read [/spoiler], Stede Bonnet, Calico Jack, and many other famous names from the golden age of piracy are brought to life in incredible fashion. Stacked on top of a S-tier performance of the star character Edward Kenway.

The land combat is similar to that of III with fewer weapons to select from. A trade-off for the expanded sea combat I'm sure. Both were tons of fun for me though. Every combo-kill or cannon-fire felt satisfying. Tools like the rope dart and smoke bomb are still a blast to use. Rocking four pistols felt elite. 

My biggest disappointment with this entry would have to be the modern day. Movement is slow. The mini games are more tedious than anything. The unlockable content ranges from witty videos to useless rants on notes. My favorite being the audio logs of the first Animus experiments, those I would say are worth seeking out. Ultimately, the stakes just don't feel like they're there like they did during the Desmond games. With how nuts and open to possibilities AC:III ended it's really unfortunate they couldn't find more to do.

This remains the only game (so far) that I have 100% completed. Often I get burned out on collectibles, or find certain optional objectives for missions to be not worth the headache. I loved playing Black Flag so much that I never felt like I wasted a second completing everything. That should speak to the fun of this entry.

Buy it. Play it. This should be on every person's gaming bucket list.

- Even after all this time, the game still has moments where it looks pretty good (particularly when you're firing off grapeshot in a hurricane). Outside of that, you can definitely see the age with the clunkiness of some character animations and dated textures. Still not too shabby for a decade old game
- The setting is refreshing. AC games are pretty good in choosing interesting points in (usually Western) history to explore, and this one is no different
- The music is pretty great. Everyone loves a good sea shanty
- Being a AAA game, the voice acting is what you'd expect. Good performances all around

[b]Story & Vibes[/b]
- I'll be frank, I stopped paying attention to the overarching AC story sometime midway through ACII: Revelations. It's mercifully shoved way in the background and mostly (outside of a few scenes) optional in this game
- Unfortunately, the in-Animus story is sort of a let down as well. You just kind of aimlessly sail around the Caribbean as Edward, being sent from waypoint to waypoint to sneak into a fort and kill a dude. Someone being conflicted about his relationship for a decade before deciding to raise his kid and become an assassin doesn't make for much of a story
- There a few worthwhile characters. Blackbeard is an interesting character study, Captain Kidd has the most motivating story arc in the game
- Despite the story being negligible in nearly every regard, sailing around can be relaxing if you're into that sort of thing

[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]
- Refusing to change, enhance, iterate on, or improve both the stealth or combat gameplay in any noticeable regard was a bold choice. Not a good choice, but bold
- At least the sailing and naval combat are nice. Sailing felt clunky in AC3, but it's much more polished this time around given that it's a core component of Black Flag
- Despite all the ship upgrades, I found myself just relying on the regular cannons and the heavy shot. The other stuff like mortars and mines were situationally useful when I remembered that I installed them, but I never felt like they were actually necessary. Just by armor, crew, and heavy ammo
- This is a replay (played it around release in 2013 on the 360), and I think this is my last go-around in this game. Hey, at least they managed to finally get me to care about collectibles (gotta hear all the shanties)

[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]
- A lot of people seem to remember this one fondly due to the sailing and naval combat, but neither of those really save it from feeling like just another AC game at heart
- Being a 10 year old game, it ran very well
- You will, of course, have to use Ubisoft's terrible, frivolous, and clunky launcher to play this game. Lécher le cul, Yves

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
- [b]7/10[/b]. Compared to the preceding AC games it's roughly on par with AC2: Brotherhood (story/characters are worse, but gameplay is better). Black Flag is a pretty good game, but I'll always feel like this series never reached its full potential",1694357366,1694357578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is linear and almost on rails as per usual and the characters are bland and very few people actually stand out as interesting. Even when writing a single linear experience they still manage to f*ck it up this badly. The story is so surreal and unpersonal, it's like they asked a computer to write it. I can't imagine a human writing something this out of touch with emotions and how normal humans function in situations.

some spoilers below

The main character is quite boring and his goals are left in some weird psydo state. He says he fights for money but even when he has a ship large enough to buy half an island he still refuses to do something for himself. The whole game is left in some wierd state where the main character despite being some bigshot is left pushed around by various people into all sorts of shitty ""adventures"" that has nothing with his own agenda. The whole game is like a fever dream were things happen without logic or sense. 

At the start of the game you get a showcase of the story and it's all downhill from there. 
Two people of opposing factions left injured on the beach, barely alive after a shipwreck, and then in the next second both start jumping like some ballerina dancers around the island chasing after one another. It's bizzare. What should have been a slow scene of two stranded injured people fighting instead turnes into a ballerina contest to showcase the game mechanics. That's how little thought was put into the story. 

Later the story shoehorns you into a assassin helper offcourse. The first thing the 
assassins leader does is to litterally complain about you defending yourself against them when you briefly helped deliver some info to the templars some time ago. It's such a stupid take that it mindboggling how dumb this questline is. They assume you somehow know that the masked assailants that attacked you randomly on the streets were assassins before you even met and learned about their organization and then what, you were supposed to drop dead and stop defending yourself? It so dumb I can't really know what to say.

The story is without any real choices and not player driven in any way. This along with the tedious assassin/termplar garbage makes it super unpersonal and uninteresting. 
I wish I could create my own character and perhaps make my own decisions about who I join and who I kill. But no, this is all written and decided for me by the wonderful team of people at Ubisoft.

The story in it's critical moments like the death of important characters plays out like fever dreams without any logic or sense. Blackbeard dying from fighting on an enemy ship, a ship you both for some reason decided to board to fight hand to hand outnumbered instead of from your own ship? It's like a soldier would jump out of his tank to fight and to hand with the enemy instead of using his arsenal? 
Mary and another woman saved from the cells by a fit assassin and you a mangled half corpse, just rescued from the cells yourself. The fit assassin helps the able woman and they walk out together and you are left alone with the the near unconcious one who's sickly and laying down? You are forced to drag her out while soldiers are after you, you drag and crawl back to the boat where they happily wait? 
What the f*ck is that cutscene? No one sees any problem with that? You can't convince me that a normal human wrote this and thought it made sense. 

Most of the story in the game is laughable without any logic or sense. It's like the writers were doing heavy drugs.",1664105133,1693756455,True,1,0,0.45128205418586731,0,True,False,False

Just for the sake of completionism I went through this absolute disaster all the way to the end, but couldn't bother with any side content or even Freedom Cry as the longer I played the worse the technical problems were. No amount of changes to the settings or files has fixed this issue. 
Considering that before this the game was not playable at all for about a month, I have very little hope that this game will technically get better/fixed past this point.

Recently, I decided to play it again, to decided weather It was as good as I remember, or If I just didn't have experiences of actual good games. Fortunately my second experience of the game went incredibly well, and to get over the minor negatives first I must say enjoyed mostly everything about it other than the fact that it was made by U-play, and the combat was simplistic/un-challenging. BUT other than that, the feeling of progression in Equipment, Outfits, Ship upgrades, island progression, to scenery, story-line. And the special enjoyment of just simply sailing around listing to sea shanties, taking over other ships and forts (literally almost everything was good) it was amazing even for an old game going up against the latest ""Triple-A Games"". Overall the game is incredibly well put together and is 100% worth playing if you have the time. Playing it again is fun if it's been a long time but not that re-playable if that's what you are aiming for in this game (which is weird because this kind of game has not really been known for that play-style anyway). Anyways, I do recommend this game to everyone up for a good gaming experience and story but not so much if you are looking for a combat focused, challenging, and repayable game...                      peepoGlad :rose:",1671699162,1693630636,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The setting really helped sell the improved atmosphere within the game giving it a brighter, more appealing look. The combat is essentially unchanged from AC3, only with different weapons. Brings the modern feeling of AC3 with a landscape that actually favors parkour. There is so so much to explore with one of the biggest AC open worlds and makes you really feel like you can choose what you want to do at any time. With virtually endless play time it is a fun way to kill time. After the slight bore of the Conner storyline, Edwards character progression over the course of this game is a delight as he slowly drifts away from his money mindset to accommodate the brotherhood's creed, while still showing his pirate side in all of his actions. I am also impressed with the way they managed to keep the modern plot alive, choosing to include the player in the game rather than abstract us into controlling Desmond. Also a nice touch of including all the Desmond related content for all the players that understand his story from the previous games.

Assassin's Creed Black Flag holds a unique place in my gaming journey. Back when I was younger, it was one of the titles that truly captured my imagination. Now, I've taken the opportunity to dive back into this game to relive those memories and experience the magic once again.

One of the standout features that I loved then and still do now is the sea shanties. Sailing on the open sea, with those tunes in the background, creates an atmosphere that's hard to match. It's like being transported to a different time, and it's something that I've missed in more recent games.

Returning to Assassin's Creed 4, I'm reminded of how it managed to create a compelling world of piracy and exploration. The attention to detail in the ships, the environment, and the overall setting is remarkable. Sailing through the waves, engaging in naval battles, and uncovering hidden treasures – it all adds up to an adventure that's both exciting and nostalgic.

Speaking of nostalgia, I can't help but compare the series' current direction to the days of Black Flag. After Assassin's Creed Syndicate, the franchise seemed to take a different path. While there have been good moments, the magic that made this game special appears to have faded a bit.

Revisiting Assassin's Creed 4 has been a journey of rediscovery for me. It's not just about playing a game; it's about connecting with a part of my gaming history and reliving the excitement that it brought me. If you're looking for a way to relive the past and experience a piece of gaming history, I'd definitely recommend setting sail with Edward Kenway once more.

Reliving memories, one virtual voyage at a time.

Seriously though, this game is so much fun.
The mechanics are varied, so you get the standard Assassin's Creed parkour, stealth, melee fighting, but you also get exploration, crafting, sailing, ship battles, and hunting (hunting & crafting is very similar to AC3).

Additionally, the plot in this game is quite good.

At the age of twelve, I lost them - a group of disloyal and unjust pirates changed my fate. I thought I would join the navy and pursue these pirates around the world, but I was wrong. I was born in Nassau, and even though my parents were ordinary people, I still shed the blood of pirates.

All of this is because I was born in Nassau.

I started stealing and used the stolen money to exchange for rum at Anne's tavern. This is pirate money, and it's not clean either. Let's use this money to help me, the poor man.

To this day, I still remember the first time I saw that man. His body was even bigger than a black beard, and the moment I reached into his waist bag, the tip of the knife was already on my neck.

But his double swords were clearly shining with a terrifying cold light on his waist.

Kid, this little money is making you crazy? ""He took off his hood,"" It's a pirate material. Would you like to be a buddy for my Jackdaw

I just saw his outfit clearly. He didn't wear a captain's hat, but covered the upper half of his face with a hood. Although his beard was shaky, his blonde hair was meticulously combed, and his clothes were not as easy to move as other pirates, but more like a long robe. Leather armor protected his chest, wrists, and shoulders, and his wrists looked particularly thick. His chest was like the legendary pirate's black beard, hanging four handguns.

My name is Edward, ""he continued."" It's not Edward Teach, it's Edward Kenway. From now on, I'll be your captain

This may be my chance to avenge myself. I will follow him to the sea and find that group of disloyal and unjust pirates.

Captain Kenway is completely different from the pirates I have seen. He seems very indifferent to money, and the money and goods from the robbery are distributed to us. He is always staring at a map. He is even more terrifying than ordinary pirates. I have never seen more than a dozen pirates that the British people cannot deal with. Sometimes, with just a gentle punch, the British sailor falls down in pain and blood. He is no different from ordinary pirates, and he will not let go of the ships in his sight, whether navy, merchants, or bounty hunters. He is very different from other pirates, never passing by and always looking east.

He often talks about ""the wealth that cannot be spent in a lifetime"", listening to Chief Officer Advall saying that it is a place called the ""Observatory"", where Captain Kenway has been longing for the treasure since he set sail.

On a very ordinary day, the Jackdaw stayed near Cape Guarico, and the Caribbean sun was still scorching, mixed with the salty taste of the sea, making me feel dull and suffocating. I was dozing off on the deck of the Jackdaw when the first mate suddenly shouted, ""Yang Fan, set sail

But I didn't see Captain Kenway.

So, the Jackdaw departed, and no one knew where Captain Kenway had gone except for Advall.

The Jackdaw set sail again, and in half a year, we sailed across the Caribbean Sea. I met legendary captains from all walks of life, snatched various gold and silver treasures, told women my adventure stories, used my fists to teach gangsters a lesson, and even found a group of disloyal and unjust pirates, personally cutting off their captains' heads.

But I still haven't seen Captain Kenway.

But he wouldn't just disappear on the sea like this. Even if Blackbeard died, he wouldn't die because it was real. So he appeared, and six months later, on another scorching day, I met him at Anne's tavern. I watched him and Anne walk from the tavern to the beach from a distance on the deck, and Chief Officer Advall walked towards them from the ship, hugging Captain Kenway, although I couldn't hear their conversation clearly, But there is a sentence that I am deeply impressed with and still cannot understand.

Everything is empty, all actions are allowed

From that day on, Advall left the Jackdaw and Anne became the new mate.

I still live the days of burning, killing, and looting, but the captain seems to have become less greedy. When he talks about the observation post, his eyes also change, no longer yearning for endless wealth. His eyes seem to see other things that have surpassed the understanding of pirates.

I have completed my revenge, but I want to know what he is longing for.

On this day, we arrived at Cape Guarico again, with the scorching sun shining on the deck of the Jackdaw. The salty taste of the sea became even stronger, as if it would reappear some day six months ago.

But this time, the captain came out, covered in blood and without treasure, but he revealed joy that I had never seen before.

Let's go home and invite everyone to drink

This is the coldest banquet we have ever had, and the big pirates are not here. Annie is singing, and Captain Kenway is toasting to the empty seats reserved for the captains, as if they are all there. He burst into tears, but he had never laughed so happily before.

This scene makes me feel very sad, but I don't understand whether the captain is crying or laughing.

A sailor rushed from the dock and whispered a few words in the captain's ear. The captain widened his eyes and looked at him. Even rum fell to the ground, the wind stopped, and Anne's singing stopped abruptly. The crew watched the captain as if the world had stopped moving forward.

After a while, the captain casually wiped his face and fumbled for something. He took off his pistol, took off his double knives, took off his never taken off wrist guard, pursed his golden hair, and quickly walked towards the dock. Annie also chased after him.

By the time we arrived at the dock, he had already squatted on the shore, holding a few fresh wild flowers in his hand, and a little girl stood in front of him.

I saw the captain so humble for the first time, and finally understood what the east he was looking at was.

Since that day, the Jackdaw has become a legend in the Caribbean, and no one has ever seen Edward Kenway and his beloved Jackdaw again.

I am very happy, I am a pirate under Edward Kenway.",1566926879,1692780952,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

My biggest pain points are with the dogshit PC version of the game.

=>They fixed this issue in a couple of weeks and I will continue playing. Changing review from Negative to Positive because they fixed it and the game overall looks fun and enjoyable.

I may come back and change my review again after I finish it or after having played more.

EDIT 2:

I ran into another awful issue. The ""Kenway's Fleet"" is not working. It just keeps trying to load the Kenway's Fleet forever. I have found out after looking up the issue that this was due to that recent patch that broke the fullscreen mode as well apparently.

Ubisoft hit the nail on the head with this one in what is commonly considered one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed franchise, and I'm inclined to agree. If you're a fan of AC, this game is a must play, and if you aren't, it's still worth a try.

I wanna talk about a few complaints first, but most are nitpicks. Probably the biggest issue I had with this game was bugs, in true Ubisoft fashion, and even then they weren't terrible. They've been updating the game recently, and as a result broke Kenway's Fleet, a sort of income generating minigame that is REQUIRED for some content in the game. However, someone on steam wrote a guide on how to fix it, so I was able to get it working. Even though the Fleet is pretty fun for what it is, the long times it takes to complete are frustrating, as I currently am at 99% completion and need to wait another day before I can wrap up the final few tasks remaining. Also, the carribean seems more mountainous than is natural, but that's to limit playable area, which was a good call. A few unimportant things are no longer available to players too, but overall these are really all the complaints I have.

Parkour and combat are the key staples of this franchise, and while not as good as some previous entries, they're both still good. Kenway has a nice sized kit, I always felt like I had the right tools to deal with the situation. Never too much or too little. Ship combat in this game is very fun but does get repetitive after some time. However, you're likely to beat the game before you get sick of it. The story in this game is actually very good for an AC game in my opinion, in both the past and real world sections, and collectibles give even more flavor to players willing to read a little. Where this game REALLY thrives though, is exploration. The open world is very large and gives you lots of interesting and vibrant places to explore. There are plenty of collectibles and activities to do, but not so much that I got exhausted doing them, it was a very nice amount. The mission design is generally good (though there are a lot of tailing missions), and the optional objectives were generally more fun and less annoying to complete than in previous entries. Overall, there's a lot to do and it's all very fun. It's not perfect, nothing is, but I found it very fun and my time was well spent in 100% completing the game.

It's also worth noting that this game comes with a few DLCs, one following Aveline from AC Liberation and another following Adewale, an important character from the main game. The Aveline DLC is short and mediocre, but I'd rather play it than play Liberation which was longer and still mediocre. Freedom Cry was a blast though, following Adewale as he fought against the slave trade in the Carribean. It's still not as good as the main game, but it was worth playing in my opinion.

TLDR; Get this game, it's worth it. Unlike most Ubisoft games, I would even suggest going for 100% completion. Freedom Cry is included and is also worth a quick playthrough.",1692385372,1692385372,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The pirate side of this game is what truly makes it shine. From swimming through ship wrecks, plundering and making enemy ships part of your fleet, to even facing off against the deadly legendary ships. Additionally, the dlcs are nothing to write home about. While the Freedom Cry dlc is a little fun as you play the hospitable Adewale the dlc story doesn't really go anywhere. And the Aveline dlc story feels like a random chunk of liberation they decided to squeeze in here for whatever reason. However, this games pirate essence is plentiful and here to stay.

I should also state that this game is more of a pirate game than an Assassin's creed game. The game focuses more on being a Pirate, Ship to Ship combat and hunting whales or sharks. Playing Rogue after this and hoping it will be as fun or maybe even more!

DLC: The dlc is fun, but it really is just a dlc. Adewale's story is short, but fun! It also takes place after the main game. Aveline's story, is just not it. it's only 3 sequences and doesn't really add much to the AC4 game.

Rating: ★★★★★

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag sails players into uncharted waters, delivering an exhilarating and swashbuckling experience set in the Golden Age of Piracy. Released in 2013, the game reimagines the Assassin's Creed formula by introducing an open-world pirate setting, stunning naval battles, and an engrossing narrative that takes players on an unforgettable high-seas adventure.

Set in the early 18th century, players assume the role of Edward Kenway, a charismatic and opportunistic pirate with a heart full of ambition. The narrative blends historical events with fictional elements, immersing players in the captivating world of pirates, privateers, and the fierce struggle between the Assassins and Templars.

Black Flag's strength lies in its immersive open-world exploration. The game invites players to navigate the vast Caribbean archipelago, discovering hidden coves, uncharted islands, and bustling ports. The seamless transition from land to sea adds a sense of freedom and adventure, making every voyage an opportunity for discovery and plunder.

The naval gameplay is a standout feature of Black Flag, offering exhilarating and visually stunning ship battles. Players command the Jackdaw, Edward's ship, in fierce naval engagements against enemy vessels and fortifications. The strategic use of cannons, mortars, and swivel guns creates a sense of tactical depth, and the feeling of the wind in your sails and the salty spray on your face makes you truly feel like a seasoned pirate captain.

As an Assassin's Creed title, Black Flag maintains the signature parkour and stealth mechanics of the franchise. However, it introduces new and dynamic gameplay elements such as underwater exploration and harpooning, which add variety and depth to the overall experience.

The game's portrayal of the Caribbean is breathtaking, with stunning graphics that capture the vibrant colors of the tropical setting. From lush jungles to sandy beaches, the world feels alive and teeming with life, offering a visually captivating and immersive experience.

The characters in Black Flag are well-developed and memorable, including historical figures like Blackbeard and Charles Vane. Edward's personal journey from a self-serving pirate to a man of purpose and principles adds depth to the narrative, making him a compelling protagonist.

Additionally, the game boasts an outstanding soundtrack that sets the tone for the adventure, with epic sea shanties and atmospheric music that enhance the immersion and the feeling of being part of a pirate crew.

One minor drawback is that some players may find the modern-day sequences featuring the present-day protagonist, a recurring aspect of the Assassin's Creed franchise, less engaging compared to the pirate adventure in the historical setting.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag stands as a true gem in the franchise, offering an enthralling high-seas adventure that appeals to fans of both pirates and Assassins. With its seamless blend of history and fiction, thrilling naval battles, and a rich open-world environment, Black Flag sets the standard for the pirate-themed genre in gaming.

Whether you're a longtime fan of the Assassin's Creed series or a newcomer seeking an epic pirate odyssey, Black Flag promises an unforgettable journey of piracy, exploration, and daring escapades on the high seas.",1691351497,1691488998,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Recently an update BROKE this game (second time I'll add in the past 2 or 3 years). Then and again now I've wasted too many hours/days of my life to FIX what they BROKE. 
Yes, I too sent UBI support requests, and spent too many hours attempting to get ALL of my Ubi s**t to work. But I DID uninstall UPLAY, and then DID install UConnect. Many more hours tinkering, some patience, and awaiting UBI efforts, and I will tell you.. 2 weeks ago none of 11 my UBIS**T games worked; and now...THEY ALL WORK FLAWLESSLY!!!

I understand this game released in 2013, and I'm sure it was hot in it's time, but I'm not convinced it holds up to a new player. As someone who's spent ample time in Odyssey and Valhalla, going back to what people consider ""the best Assassin's Creed game"" has been nothing short of disappointment. I would not recommend this to anyone new to the series, enticed by big sales on older installments. I have no intention to pick up anything else 'in between', and will stick to waiting for new releases.

I'm often frustrated and irritated by the end of each session. I find the pacing of the gameplay to be so tiresome. Travelling by sea just seems to take unnecessarily long, and poses no significant gameplay experience if you aren't interested in battling at sea. Speaking of sea battles, annoying camera placement and lighting effects can make this unnecessarily difficult. Firing off cannons in fog and suddenly I can't see anything. The camera being so close to the ship also really inhibits my ability, personally, to effectively navigate in a fight. Boarding seems to take a calendar year that I end up swimming most of the time to the defeated ship.

In typical Assassin's Creed fashion, albeit not something I remember encountering heavily in Odyssey/Valhalla, the free-running is like navigating a minefield. They really needed to separate sprinting from free-running. There's no in-between currently; either you walk painfully slow or you initiate free-running. This is effectively your sprint - however Edward will launch himself up walls, or onto climbable objects, if you so much as graze them. This can easily result in enemies catching up, or losing sight of tailed enemies. The ability to sprint, without climbing, is sorely missing.

There's also mandatory story missions where you need to tail somebody. I'm sure to seasoned veterans of the franchise this is the bread and butter, but holy crap I found these needlessly time consuming and difficult. I think newer stealth games implement better systems for stealth sections, which I know is tough considering I'm criticizing a 10-year-old game, so take from that what you will. I can't ignore that these sections were frustrating, with minimal visual indicators for line-of-sight and proximity, and with abnormally frequent turn-arounds and height checks by the AI.

There's also annoying technical issues with the HUD. The resolution of the game can be increased but the HUD seems to mimic lower resolutions reminiscent of 2013 norms. Kind of minor, but also pretty ugly on screen. For such a popular game I wish they'd update this.",1691455842,1691456498,False,1,1,0.433355212211608887,0,True,False,False

Assassins Creed: Black Flag is an extremely nice and fun game to play. The world is beautifully made, albeit a bit repetitive. At some point, it gets hard to really distinguish one island from another and you kind of start to get bored of looking at the same houses, plants and prostitutes. It doesn't take away from it's beauty though and the repetitive nature is likely what makes new scenes even better. 

Personally, I was not a fan of all the boating. It was to be expected, seeing as Black Flag is, in it's essence, a pirate-game. But still, not too fond. The controls felt iffy and, for some reason, extremely slow making it a hassle to drive from A to B all the damn time. I was really [i] really [/i] happy once fast travel was available. No such issues with all the walking, climbing and running though. Here, the controls felt really intuitive and Edward was extremely quick on his feet, so no complains there. 

The story itself was nice, albeit a bit cringy whenever Edward was being his usual idiotic self, and there was no point where it felt stagnant or drawn out. Edward definitely deserves to be placed high in the ranking of most-popular characters, the man likely a treasure to all the tall-dark-dangerous enthusiasts out there. His cocky way of dealing with things carries a lot of the weight and he is, in the end, a very likable character - despite his short comings.",1691340925,1691340925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That being said, I need to mention this, and because of my experience, I cannot recommend you purchasing this in the current way Ubisoft, the dumbasses they are, expect you to.

I was robbed by Ubisoft because of this. 
As with pretty much all of Ubisoft's games you need an activation key to play this game, because of their absolute dog ass Uplay app. I do not know how, I do not know why, there is no searches on any search engine that I could do to find anyone with a similar situation, but the game, after I had already played it for over two hours, requested to see my activation key again. So I found the key and activated the game again, but I got the message ""This key was already used on another account.""
Note: I got the game for like 20 bucks on sale or something.
You can imagine my confusion. I had only ever used one Uplay account and one Steam account in my entire life. 
So, my solution was to go to refund the game. I HAD NOT realized the price was raised since I had gotten it. So, I go to refund the game, I think that's going to be that and after I rebuy the game and get a new key that all will be well. I go to the store page just to double check reviews and what do I find? The game is DOUBLE what I got it for. This didn't irk me much though, I have twenty dollars to spend, personally I don't have money problems, but it was frustrating. 

Steam denies my refund because ""You have surpassed the 48 hour refund time limit"" or some bullshit excuse like that. 
In order to play this game that I would put in my top 10 of all time again, I had to remove the game instance from my account, not getting my money back at all. MIND YOU, THIS GAME AND IT'S CONTENT IS ABOUT A DECADE OLD, AND UBI HAS THE AUDACITY TO SELL IT FOR 40 FUCKING DOLLARS.

But as you saw above, Ubi isn't the only company with bullshit practices here. The game was rendered unplayable on my account and they didn't show an ounce of proper support when I tried to get it (including the refund).

I was robbed. Steam and Ubisoft had robbed me of forty dollars and all the progress I had made in the game. It may not be directly, but when a company is this negligent to it's users that it actively STRIPS the product it promised from you while KEEPING the money you spent for it, yeah, it's a mother fucking problem. To be honest, I don't care too much about the money I lost. What I give a shit about, is the principle. The fact that this kind of thing is what companies get away with is outrageous and the fact that we ALL agree that the modern corporate model is absolutely fucking torturous for the common man, and yet nothing has really been done to change that is sickening. Especially when it comes to the gaming industry, because it is rampant here.

I am going to buy the game again. This game is fucking amazing and Edward is hot. But unless you are confident that you wont run into this problem I have, don't buy it. Wait for Ubisoft to change their moronic ways. I'd use a much harsher word if it wasn't so offensive, because Ubi's business practices are nothing short of HARMFUL to the users. 

I'd say I expected better, but Ubisoft's awful reputation precedes them, and Steam support has been at most pretty terrible to downright malicious in my experience at times. Simultaneously, I'd say I'm not surprised, but, well, this has never happened to me before in this level of catastrophic negligence that I can't help but remain appalled. 

Grossly over-summarized conclusion: Steam and Ubisoft robbed me of sixty dollars because the former can't get a proper support system and the latter hires toddlers to program their shitty apps.",1691146578,1691146578,False,5,0,0.586919069290161133,0,True,False,False

This is actually my first purchase of an ubisoft game. I was always worried if I would be able to play this game, would uplay cause issue, what if I can't connect my game to ubisoft account etc. So I am glad it worked out well in the end.

The reason why I wanted to play this game is cause of pirates. That was my point of interest. I love pirates of the caribbean movie and this game lived up to everything to what I imagined.
An amazing world, map, a likable main character, great music, detail. I loved this game from the beginning to the end. The details of the world is amazing. I didn't even imagine Marry Read & Anne were real. Made the end game sequences more emotional.

The naval combat is amazing. And the thing is you can add ships you capture to your fleet which you can then on sort of like send on trade mission to earn money. It's a simple mini game sort of thing to earn income which really worked well with this game. 
Even the normal mini games are really fun to play. Sailing the sea, hunting shark, whale, treasure maps, looting smuggler's den, going underwater, the rain, the weather, hunting, that's not even mentioning the regular assassin things.

I am already feeling nostalgic for a game I just finished. There are forts you can take over. On the higher difficulty forts, I am attacking the fort while there is huge thunderstorm on going with cyclone, you got huge tidal wave coming from different directions. It was like pirates of the caribbean at world's end movie scene.

The entire game I hardly ever considered myself as an assassin, always a pirate.
In one of the first movies, Will says,""In a fair fight, I'd kill you.""
And then Jack is like ""That's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it?"". And that's exactly how I played this game. Probably one of the best experience I had from a game.
The Aveline dlc was ok. Honestly not even a dlc. More like one side quest. The freedom cry was good. But compared to the base game, it is still lacking.

So now the problems. Funny thing is that the problems I faced was not in the game rather the launcher itself.
I have to type my password every time I want to play it. It is not that the launcher forgot it rather I need to ""log in"" to play the game. 
I also couldn't sync my achievements on uplay. Though honestly I could care less about this one.
And that's it. These two are the only problems I faced.

So all in all, I recommend this game 100%. There is no doubt about it in my mind.
Honestly I kinda feel like this being an assassin's creed game is what holding this game back from becoming a full fledged pirate series.",1691003945,1691003945,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, once hailed as a gem among games, now seems lackluster. While it might have had its appeal in the past, reflecting on it now brings disappointment. Maybe 10 years ago it was something but now is nothing but a turd. To be honest I never played it back in the day and having tried it now I do wonder how is this considered good?
The story is awful, if this game was made outside of AC universe it would have been so much better, the whole animus and the crap about some mysterious library is just holding it back - I don't care for how it all works, don't care for modern french offices, for old libraries. Only thing that is on my mind, when playing the pirate game is the pirating! Pirating that is not a stealth section or trailing section as those are the worst and also a majority of what you will do, especially annoying when you can't kill anyone or be detected. My goodness....... Gotta mention the extra crappy moments of when they pull you out of animus to do some bullshit like speak to Ceo or find your office or hack some orb to get data out... Ah yeah if game had James Kidd deleted it would be better for it - it's missions are the worst.
Okay story is trash, hows gameplay? The gameplay also falls short, particularly in combat, which feels repetitive and lacks depth.
No levels, no experience, no passive skills to unlock, just some crafting, but calling it basic would be an over statement. 
The sea combat is somewhat enjoyable, but it's far too easy, making encounters with ships and forts feel less challenging than they should be. 
I remember encounter with a 9 point fort and 5 enemy ships at the same time and I took them all out no problem. Can literally board a ship mid combat, repair your vessel and continue the engagement. 
Even the sea hurricanes fail to impress.
On a positive note, the shanties add a touch of charm, though they could have been more prominent. However, despite these few bright spots, the overall experience leaves much to be desired.
So what is this game then? Old turd is what it is -play AC Odyssey as it is all the same as this but better in every way. Can't recommend.",1690746924,1690746924,False,0,2,0.390024542808532715,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, I've had a lot of fun with this game, and it certainly has amazing qualities, there are just some things that really bring it down and in my opinion, this was the game that sparked the downfall of Assassin's Creed. 

To get the obvious pros out of the way, this game is the best pirate game - ever. Naval combat is excellent. And if all you're doing is just messing around and doing pirate shit, you will have a great time. Close quarters combat is a bit of a less bombastic version of AC III's, and as long as you don't try to stealth your way through places (you know, like an ASSASSIN, for crying out loud), you should be fine. The game is gorgeous, and just existing in a raging storm out at sea, your ship buckling in the wind and rain, hearing the shanties, is quite an experience. Furthermore, Edward is probably my favorite protagonist in the series and definitely deserved more than just one game, and if he got them, he would have been even more loved than Ezio. His story is by far the best one in the series, being way more character-driven and down-to-earth...

But that amazing story is completely bogged down by this game's disastrous mission design. Seriously, Black Flag actually taught me about the importance of mission design in a game by showcasing exactly how NOT to do it. Every other mission is a god damn tailing mission, then there's the ""walking missions"", where all you fucking do is walk from point A to point B and listen to a guy talk. And the rest are forced stealth missions, and I don't need to tell you how garbage the stealth is in the Kenway saga. And if that wasn't enough, there's also an abundance of ""ship stealth"" missions, which is just so moronic. And it's such a shame because they completely ruin such a beautiful and unique story with all the best characters in the series in one game. So in a way, I'm honestly at least a little intrigued to see what they do with the remake.

So yeah, the missions in this game are by far the worst they've ever been in the entire series, in fact they're so infuriatingly bad that in my entire first time playthrough-marathon of these games, THIS is the first (and only) time I've actually took a break because it was becoming really taxing. I wondered why exactly it was Black Flag, the game everyone loved, that did it to me, and after a month or two, coming back and missing the pirating, and messing around a bit in the open world, I had a decent time with it and wondered, again, why I even left the game in the first place. And then I did a story mission. And I instantly knew why. What a damn shame.

Apart from that, the parkour is still subpar, owing mostly to the fact that you really have to go out of your way to even find a place where parkour is even possible, since it's mostly just open seas and jungles, and tree parkour is even more rubbish than it was in AC III.

And then there's the modern day sections, which used to be fun breaks from the actions, where you could catch up with Desmond and his crew, and which actually had an engaging plotline and gameplay. Yeah well, all of that is thrown right out the window beginning with this game. The modern day sections are now an absolute chore to get through and extremely intrusive, and should have been left out entirely. Sure, there are some interesting secret files to discover at Abstergo, but those could have easily just been put into some menu page, and then you wouldn't have to fucking walk around Abstergo in first person at a snail's pace and do some shitty mini-games.

So yeah, I enjoyed myself at times with Black Flag, but there's just so much bringing this game down that I simply can't ignore it.

The reasons why I love ""Black Flag"":

- The magnificent storyline with well-written characters and their development, including some really touching and memorable moments. And it is much more than just a cheesy pirate action-movie
- Despite the graphic quality, the game still has amazing in-game world design and it's unique style that makes you enjoy the exploration all along
- The big and fullfilled open world with many interesting side activities
- Quite a detailed pirate life representation, with it's joys and sorrows...
- Hey, you can board and capture 5 ships in a row here and then get blind drunk in a nearby tavern, what else a true pirate could possibly wish for? :D

A great work of art never gets old.

_____________________________________________

Даже в 2021 году это всё ещё отличная игра.

Причины, по которым это так:

- Великолепная история с отлично прописанными героями и их развитием в сюжете, в том числе присутствие трогательных и запоминающихся моментов в нём. И да, эта история есть нечто большее, чем обычный пиратский боевик
- Несмотря на графику, у игры сохраняется отличный и по-своему уникальный дизайн игрового мира, который позволяет неоднократно получить удовольствие от его исследования
- Большой и наполненный открытый мир с множеством интересных активностей
- Детальное изображение пиратской жизни, со всеми её прелестями и горестями...
- Тут можно захватить 5 кораблей подряд а потом пойти и напиться в дрова в ближайшей таверне, что ещё от жизни нужно настоящему пирату? :D

today an update fixed this and fullscreen mode now works again. i have seen no other problems nor any patch notes released to explain what ubisoft were trying to do with the botched update (maybe something positive?) but at least they put people on it to fix the issue as fast as they could identify it. 

we could have hoped also for an apology and explanation, if there were patch notes then i have no idea where they post them - but at least the game is fixed. 

others report that they have lost save games - i know the different editions of this game stored the saves in differing locations, maybe people should try to find the older location and newer and see which place their saves were. the deluxe edition saves are incompatible with the old (now obsolete) standard edition saves anyway. my one save was fine so far as i can see.

some people also say that kenways fleet just gives them an infinite loading screen since the botched update and this one doesnt change it - but for me i dont think it stopped working, and it works now after the fullscreen fix patch.

I've search the Reddit and Google which I found several issues similar to mine. The game was quite old and just around $10 when I bought it so I didn't mind it after I lost hope when I can't find any solution. Today, when I logged in, it just magically notified that I unlocked the Season Pass (meaning I can access the Aveline and Freedom Cry DLCs now). Note that most of the solutions I can find said I should have two CD keys, which I don't since this is a Gold Edition one.

So what I thought I did yesterday is that after I logged out of the game, I checked Freedom Cry and Liberation pages in Steam, add them to cart, 'cause I was planning to buy them for the next sale. Then that's it, when I returned to the game just now, the game notified me I unlocked the Season Pass.",1689858631,1689858631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off , this is great Pirate game like Sid Meier . You get to plunder merchant ships sailing across the sea . There is whaling and harpooning of sharks to be done . There's also buried treasure that you can hunt down , and some deep sea diving once you get the diving bell .

Second , there's bar brawls you can do , there are animals to hunt , and a nice ship crew that you could interact with . 

Another thing you could do is , customize your ship as you go along . You could get different set of sails and wheels for your ship . Not only that , you can craft the look of your main character that you're playing as , and customize your own hideout and island to your liking .

After listing all the good experience in this game , and there's many good experiences I had , we now move on to the bad parts of the game .

First off , after I've put 62 hours into the game , and I was wanting to put in some more , the game doesn't want to start . This is disappointing since I wanted more pirate adventures , but I can't since the game doesn't want to start for me .

Second set of problems . The game has very clunky controls , and is sometimes not as responsive . An example of this , is when I'm trying to climb up the mast of the ship , and my character won't go up any further , or will not go where I want him to go .

Adding to the game's problems , is Kenway's Fleet . I was never able to access my fleet on the map . There are some items for your ship that could only be obtained through Kenway's Fleet . Sadly , there's no way of accessing that .

More problems to be listed . I have a set of throwing knives . Each time I throw my knives , the weapon slot automatically changes to throwing coins . This presents a problem , and I end up blowing my cover .

The stealth . The stealth in this game is terrible . You can't sneak up on enemies . You have to run and hide , run and hide . Whatever happened to creeping up on an NPC that you're targeting .

Missions are just no fun at all . I like my meetings with Edward Thatch , but I didn't get far into the game , because my game just won't start anymore .

Controls . During the mid of the battle , I would switch from my darts to pistols . Sometimes that game isn't as responsive , and the enemy would get a drop on me .

More complaints . So here I am trying to climb up a mast to cut off the flag of the ship . I'm aiming for one part of the mast to continue my climb . Unknown to me , is that my character is looking at a different direction . I press my controls to jump and climb my target , only to have my character do something else , and fall off the mast . This results in death or desynchronization .

One last complaint that I will list . I can't get to multiplayer . I can't even start the game after 62 hours of playtime . In fact , even my Ubisoft connect won't start up at times . With so many problems that this game has , I'll have to give it a two out of five stars .

The game was fun when it was working . It's not fun anymore when it doesn't even want to start up . Good thing I bought this game at eleven bucks . I suggest getting it on sale when it comes , and don't pay the full price of fifty dollars of this game .",1689793490,1689793490,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

COMBAT SYSTEM
Combat is easy but it allows you multiple options during combat. Like using tools, counter attacking, breaking defense. It's not just wait for a counter attack.

EXPLORATION
I'm not into exploration in the games, but this one has someting cool about it, with all the islands, chests etc. It does not stuff it in your face like something you NEED to do. 

ATMOSPHERE
I like how they made caribbean look so cool, it's a nice move away from cities, and all the famous pirates have their stories which makes this game like a great adventure.

This is the game for you. Yes, it's an Assassin's Creed game, but the ""Assassins"" part really only happens in the last 10% of the game. 
You can:
-sink, board and plunder ships
-sail anywhere and everywhere in a vast and beautiful open world set in the early 18th century Caribbean Sea.
-Dive and plunder the wrecks and caves lost in the ocean
-Play stealthily or agressively in dozens of sandbox areas with level design that allows for experimentation and different approaches
-outfit Edward with true drip
-look for buried treasure using treasure maps (yes, the X marks the spot)
-attack forts with your ship
-upgrade and develop your ship as well as your own fleet (the fleet thing is like a minigame)
-get drunk
-marvel at the amazing beauty
-cry at the end of the game
-and more.

Everything else... eh. The missions are overwhelmingly tailing missions where you stay hidden while following someone having a conversation. There's usually one good path to take, and most of the challenge is just executing the path correctly. Ubisoft's client remains a massive pain, and in a weird turn of events, this game doesn't have working cloud saves due to a bug they never bothered to fix. I had to log in to the client each time I launched the game, no matter how many times I asked it to remember me. There's also a bunch of weird (and mostly dead) live-service mechanics that remind me why live-service stuff sucks in single player games.

It's worth playing this game if you're really interested in some decent ship-to-ship pirate gameplay, but everything else just sort of falls really flat.

I had some persistent bug in my game where everything was washed out and over-saturated with fog. I could not figure out what was going on, and while it seems like other people out there had the same issue I had, the internet didn't seem to have a fix, nor could I figure out a solution.

From the moment ye set foot on the deck of the Jackdaw, ye be transported to a world of plunder and piracy. The Caribbean be yer playground, filled with sprawling islands, crystal-clear waters, and the promise of untold riches. The attention to detail be commendable, mateys! The ship creaks, the waves crash, and the wind whistles through the sails, immersing ye in the life of a true swashbuckler.

As ye take control of Edward Kenway, a rogue pirate turned assassin, ye be embarking on a journey that'll have ye crossing paths with notorious scallywags like Blackbeard and Calico Jack. The storyline be as captivating as a siren's song, weaving history and fiction together in a seamless dance. Ye'll be caught up in political intrigue, naval battles, and the eternal struggle between the assassins and Templars.

The naval combat, me hearties, be a highlight of this fine game. As ye steer yer mighty vessel through storms and cannonfire, ye'll feel the wind in yer hair and the thrill of the chase. Ye'll plunder enemy ships, upgrade yer own, and engage in epic battles that'll have ye shouting ""Arr!"" in triumph. The ship-to-ship combat be as fierce as a kraken's fury, and the naval exploration be a joyous voyage of discovery.

But it ain't just about sailing the open seas, me hearties. The land be just as bountiful with its hidden treasures and lively towns to explore. Ye'll find yerself sneaking through jungles, scaling fortresses, and engaging in swashbuckling combat. The world be teeming with activities, from harpooning whales to searching for buried treasure. There be no shortage of adventure on land or sea!

The graphics be as vibrant as a parrot's feathers, me mateys. The sunsets be breathtaking, and the details on the ships befitting a captain's pride. The voice acting be top-notch, with the characters bringing life to the game's rich tapestry. And let's not forget the shanties, those infectious sea shanties that'll have ye tapping yer peg leg and belting out a tune!

Now, I must admit there be a few barnacles on this ship. The land-based missions can sometimes feel repetitive, and the controls can be a tad clunky at times. But fear not, me hearties, for these minor flaws be but a drop in the vast ocean that is Assassin's Creed Black Flag.

So, me fellow scallywags, if ye be yearning for a pirate's life, filled with adventure, plunder, and a touch of assassin's creed, then set sail with Black Flag. It be a game that'll make ye feel like the captain of yer own destiny, and I guarantee ye won't be walking the plank with this one.

No issues playing this on PC. Every bit as good as I remember playing on PS4.

[b]Pros[/b]
     - Some of the best gameplay in the AC series to date
     - Overall solid story that ties itself well into the universe
     - Great open world and new ship combat to the series
     - Game feels like it's a great length, long enough to get immersed in the world, but not overstaying it's 
        welcome
     - Compelling characters and dialog, voice acting is great and so far these are my favorite historical 
        characters explored 
     - Good amount of side activities to keep you invested
     - Freedom Cry is a decent expansion on the game
     - Pirates

[b]Cons[/b]
     - Some bugs and technical issues
     - Avaline DLC feels tacked on
     - Graphics are definitely showing their age at this point
     - A lot seemingly unanswered in the ""current"" story timeline
     - The assassin story line is relatively complex and it feels like they don't dive deep enough into it

Overall the game is really solid, IMO it's the best AC to it's release date in the series. It seems to be the peak so far of all the gameplay, while also adding in naval combat which is honestly pretty great. The story is a fun advancement of what's already been and while it could have been a bit better in terms of the depth, it definitely get's the job done for what it's looking to do. It's also the most interesting setting for the series to it's release date as well. The pirate lines are just so interesting and all the characters are really cool to see in action.

If you're already this deep into the series you're likely going to get it anyway, but it's truly a worthy addition into the entire series and after this replay IMO it seems to be one of the strongest from Assassin's Creed on the whole. Absolutely worth a replay if it's been a while and 100% worth it if you're already into the universe and playing them all for the first time",1687479648,1687479648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So I purchased the game through Steam, and I go to launch, and it asks me for key in UBISOFT CONNECT. So I input the key that was given to me with the game. (Under manage, and then game keys when you right click a game)..... aaaaaaaand it doesn't work. So I tried inputting without dashes, with dashes, and one just long key no space or dashes.... and nothing worked. And now best of all, I'm locked out of my UBISOFT CONNECT for ""too many failed attempts with the key"". So effing great. Purchased the bundle deal a week ago, and some of them won't play. Rogue, Origins, Odyssey, and one other worked. So far the others have not. Best $100+ dollars I've ever spent... Thanks UBISOFT!

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself quickly immersed in an enjoyable and engaging experience. From the very start, the game's gripping narrative seized my attention as it followed the extraordinary life of Edward Kenway, a pirate who inadvertently finds himself entwined in the secret world of assassins and templars.

The strength of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag lies in its captivating story. From the opening moments, I felt a deep connection to Edward and his journey. The game masterfully explores themes of friendship and betrayal, showcasing the evolution of relationships from camaraderie among pirates to the inevitable conflicts that arise from personal ambitions. Even when faced with adversaries, the game delicately portrays the longing for those once considered friends, fostering a profound emotional resonance.

On a technical level, I encountered no issues while playing Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. The game is impeccably optimized, offering a smooth and seamless gameplay experience. However, it is worth noting that a slight disappointment stemmed from the frame rate being capped at 60FPS, which prevented the game from fully exploiting the potential of higher refresh rate displays.

As someone progressing through the Assassin's Creed series, I wholeheartedly recommend Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag to fellow players exploring the franchise. Despite initial reservations regarding the prominence of ship-based missions, the game ultimately delivers a thrilling and captivating adventure. It beautifully captures the essence of the pirate era, demonstrating Ubisoft's attention to historical detail and narrative craftsmanship.

In conclusion, Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is a remarkable addition to the series. Its engrossing storyline, impeccable optimization, and poignant portrayal of friendships and conflicts make it a must-play for fans and newcomers alike. Set sail with Edward Kenway and embark on an unforgettable journey through the treacherous seas, where the lines between loyalty and self-interest blur, leaving a lasting impact on the heart and mind.",1687124026,1687124026,True,2,0,0.53893667459487915,0,True,False,False

In this game, you assume the role of a pirate driven by the pursuit of wealth. Along the way, you unexpectedly become entangled in a web of intrigue. To accomplish a task, you disguise yourself as a member of a secretive order of assassins and rendezvous with a governor to deliver a package once owned by the assassin you're impersonating. As you delve deeper into this elaborate charade, you find yourself assuming the identity of a person you know nothing about—a member of a secret society of assassins, including a treacherous traitor. Ultimately, you become affiliated with the enigmatic Templar organization, and that's where the story truly takes off.

It ranks up there with Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War (played under an Intel Mac under bootcamp) as the best games out there for the Mac. Like those two games, you kill a lot of Spanish, British and probably French (I haven't encountered them yet, however) soldiers. I'm 16 hours in and I've only played 14% of the game. But I scour each island as I go, so that takes a lot of time.

Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag plays/sails smooth as silk. The sailing map is HUGE, but there is enough fast travel mechanics that you can get to where you want to go quickly, or you can sail there in not too much time. 

Each island/city has its own character. Some are large, some are relatively tiny. Lots of side missions on each island. This allows you to get more upgrades by earning money by looting chests or fulfilling assassination contracts. But the contracts seem like they are grafted on to the overall story, which is pretty compelling.

Although, it is hard to know what upgrades are the best to use. Also, this is my first Assassin's Creed game, so I am not sure how the assassination contracts (or lack thereof) might be seen by longtime players. The contracts themselves are not to difficult to fulfill. But many of them offer bonuses for staying out of combat, and that makes them more challenging.

The crafting system is easy to use. I generally HATE crafting, but this doesn't require you to set your quests aside or keep track of multiple items. You can hunt and fish to find a good portion of the items you need.
I bought it because it was recommended as a pirate game, and it was on sale for $12.00. BEST MONEY EVER SPENT!! Worth at least twice that, IMO.

One thing that I do find a bit frustrating: Edward the ASSASSIN, can't crouch at will. He has to move through foliage or dive into hay wagons. That's a bit absurd that he can't sneak up on his targets. But this is a very small thing.

Overall, this is a great game 9/10.",1686701560,1686701560,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is divided in 2 (Naval and Assassin stuff), the Assassin part is pretty well executed and is casual, but I feel like getting inside a bush and teleporting makes it a bit ez to escape certain situation. If you like Shadow of Mordor, then you will like the gameplay (its a bit less sophisticated). I wish the game had explained how to do certain combos. The Naval is also casual, but is built a bit like an rpg. You have to upgrade your ship to have a better chance of surviving in hard zones. 

I would rate it 7/10, mostly because there is a lot of filler (like useless collectibles), also this game feels like its a port, so you will have to deal with some annoying camera mouvements. Also, I wish some parts of the gameplay were more sophisticated. Enough content for 30-50 hours if you dont collect dumb chests, but even the collectibles that give you good stuff are also kinda a bit annoying sometimes. When the enemy ships are shooting, there is almost no sound. The smoke from you cannons is cool, but it blocks your view cause there is too much of it lol. Puzzles dont even require a braincell. The different factions are basically just reskins (UK,Portugal,Spain are the same just with different color). Basically the game shows its age with all of this, but it was still a fun experience. I wish some elements like the puzzles or the Kenway's fleet were more sophisticated than that (check out the gameplay on youtube and you will understand). 

The Aveline DLC has a terrible story writing, you just want to hate your annoying companion (good thing its short). 

Adewale DLC is a nice small addition, but buy the standalone version since Ubishit cant fix a simple sound bug. Basically ur machete and gun are silent when u use them. Standalone version doesnt have this bug.

I wish there was some strategic elements in this game like when you capture a fort you have to keep in mind the number of people in it as an example. I want some form of permanence like [spoiler] when the templars attacked the assassins' island, you could see the aftermath, but when you kill people during a fort raid they just respawn, same for the boarding [/spoiler].",1685956860,1686198188,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, a lot of technical problems really ruin what would otherwise be quite an enjoyable pirate experience[/code]

After naval combat was introduced in [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] (the best part of the entire game for many), Ubisoft made the right decision for once and doubled down on the entire thing in the sequel: [i]Black Flag[/i]. With the appropriate setting, pirates in the Caribbean of course, [i]Black Flag[/i] had a lot of potential to be a great game even for those who are not a fan of the typical [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] formula.

And even though I played through all mainline [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] up until that point, I actually found the first few hours of [i]Black Flag[/i] surprisingly refreshing. In the beginning, it’s really fun to sail the Caribbean Sea with your own pirate ship, discovering new locations and engaging with other enemy ships in combat to steal their cargo. You then turn your cargo into ship upgrades, which allow you to take on even bigger challenges (read: bigger ships) for bigger rewards.

During these times, [i]Black Flag[/i] feels less like an [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] games and more like an entertaining-albeit-simple pirate spectacle. Naval combat isn’t very complex, and your ship upgrades will play a bigger part in surviving a battle than your reaction skills at the end, but it’s simple fun the first few times and a great visual spectacle. This goes especially for ship battles fought during heavy tropical storms, with big waves, heavy rain and a lot of thunder & lightning making for incredible memorable battle experiences.

However, as the game goes on and especially during story missions, the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] elements become more prevalent. You’ll spend more time on land than on water, visiting locations that unfortunately all look pretty similar to each other - even those not part of the Caribbean Sea. Once you’re on land, you also got the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i]-mix of assassinating certain targets, tailing people, collecting various side stuff and climbing towers to unveil the map. Little has changed here, making it a typical case of “you’ll like it if you liked it before and you’ll dislike it if you disliked it before”.

In fact, even though naval combat plays such a big role in [i]Black Flag[/i], at the end, I was surprised just how many of the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] strengths & weaknesses make a return: There’s a huge amount of content – but much of it feels like busy work or copy-pasted. Gameplay systems are easy to understand & use – but they lack depth & variety and thus get tiresome in the long run. And while the main story does have its moments, many characters remain underdeveloped, and the pacing is off. I do have to admit that I liked the Abstergo-elements of the story this time around, even if the ending was unsatisfyingly abrupt.

In the end, what was a fun pirate game in the beginning turned more into a usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] game along the way. We even got ship tailing missions, which is just going too far. But while the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] mix might have its fair share of problems, it’s undeniable that it also has its charm and there’s nothing quite like it even to this day.

That said, I will have to spend the rest of the review detailing the numerous (!) technical problems I encountered while playing [i]Black Flag[/i]. These are also the main reason why I’m giving [i]Black Flag[/i] a negative review, as they’re heavily diminishing what would otherwise be an enjoyable pirate [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] experience. I have no idea if these problems are restricted to the Steam/PC version of the game, but if you want to play the game, you might be better off doing so on console.

The first issues I encountered concern the graphical settings of the game. For some reason, [i]Black Flag[/i] simply refused to offer a 1440p 60hz option for my main monitor. It did offer all other resolutions at 60hz, but not 1440p for some reason. If I changed this via the settings .ini file, the game simply ignored those changes. If I tried using other monitors, the 1440p 60hz option suddenly reappeared. It’s quite an odd problem I wasn’t able to solve (had to use a different resolution) and have never experienced with any other game before (even Cyberpunk 2077).

The next issue concerns game content. I originally bought the game back in 2019, first the standard edition and then the season pass afterwards. However, when I started [i]Black Flag[/i] for the first time just a few days ago and activated my key, I found out that I wasn’t able to access my season pass content. Everything I paid for didn’t show up, instead I just received ads for buying said content, adding insult to injury. I’ve spent the past few days contacting Ubisoft support about the issue, but so far, it has yet to be solved as well.

Then came what’s probably the biggest gripe I have concerning [i]Black Flag[/i] – after about 15h of playtime, I opened up the game only to find out that my save was suddenly corrupted. Even Ubisoft Connect with its cloud saves couldn’t help me out (it simply replaced my functioning save with the corrupt one). I have no idea what could’ve caused this, as the game never crashed on me or was forcefully exited, neither was the save data tempered with. I started the game normally only to discover I lost 15h (!) of playtime, with no way to get it back. Everything I did was gone. I highly recommend manually backing up your saves (Steam Cloud doesn’t work for this game), if you still fancy a playthrough of [i]Black Flag[/i] on Steam.

Lastly, there were some game breaking bugs I encountered while playing [i]Black Flag[/i]. I’m not talking about minor bugs like this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb77v45Soqc]classic[/url] (which I also experienced) but actual gamebreakers that require a reload if you want to finish a mission. For example, one time my player character spawned inside (!) my pirate ship, with no way to experience the wooden prison. This would be somewhat entertaining if the checkpoints in [i]Black Flag[/i] weren’t so bad sometimes – especially during tailing missions you might lose quite a lot of time. 

Maybe I just had bad luck with all of these technical problems happening at once (not counting the many minor bugs like glitching NPCs, etc.) but especially losing a 15h save really turned my playthrough of [i]Black Flag[/i] into an experience I can’t really recommend – even if the underlying game would be recommendation-worthy otherwise. Considering [i]Black Flag[/i] is also available on modern consoles, these might be safer picks if you want to avoid some of these technical problems.",1686170347,1686170347,False,8,1,0.58655780553817749,3,True,False,False

It's a good game, but it shows it's age.

The controls are clunky, it's locked to 60hz and the draw distance is abbysmal to the point where guards that are on the minimap doesn't show up in the world even though you're two feet away. Of course, as soon as you turn your back they pop in, exposing your otherwise perfect stealth mission.
Also; it's Ubisoft. The game made me log in to Ubisoft Connect every time I booted it up. Not once, but twice.
Running it as admin and starting UC before the game got this down to one login.
It also runs choppy as all h*ell. The workaround for this, I found, was CTRL-ALT-DELeting out of the game, pressing cancel and then going back in to the game again. This made it run at a mostly perfect 60hz. You have to do this every fresh bootup.

Other than that, and with a few mods (4K faces and some LOD fixes) it runs OK, but knowing Ubisoft they will [i] never [/i] fix any of these issues as they are all on you. 
Valhalla side rant follows in spoiler below:
[spoiler] In AC Valhalla I crashed after 15-60 min repeatedly unless I played in Offline Mode. 
I reported this on the forums along with hundreds of others on multiple threads and we all got the: [i] have you updated your drivers [/i] line. They refused to aknowledge that this was on them. We provided them with specs, crash reports and saves and they did [i] nothing [/i] for over 6 months. Even going so far as telling us that almost no one had this problem, even though we were several hundred just on the official forums. When we told them that going in to offline mode fixed it they went as far as saying: [i] We don't recommend doing that as it breaks a few of the features. [/i]
The features, ofcourse, being the ""pay for more useless sh*t"" options. The issue was even fixed with one update, that lasted about a week, before the next mandatory bug fix broke it again. [/spoiler]

Enough about Valhalla though; this game is pretty fun.
I thought I'd hate the ship battles, but I loved them.
I thought I'd love the sneaky stuff, but it was mostly bland with a few exceptions. There are also quite a few ""timed"" missions that can get really annoying and a lot of ""one off"" missions with mechanics that are never again usefull. These are parts of the game that you will have to go through to get to the good stuff. The peas with your steak if you will.

The story is very good.
You really want to know what happens with the MC.
If you skip the mostly useless stuff you have about a 30 hour game here while doing a reasonable amount of side stuff. 10-15 hours if you race through. My advice would be to skip the base building stuff though, as it mostly does nothing. Not even aesthetically. It's just there for the grind. Upgrade your gear and most importantly your ship as quick as possible.

The Abstergo stuff is tacked on and forgettable. Just skip through this as fast as you can. It makes some sense in the grand scheme of multiple games, but not really. It is an aside at best.

Learn to live with the janky controls. You will get stuck on a pebble and you will jump to your death for no good reason multiple times. It's what every legendary pirate does and I would bet a thousand pieces of eight that it's because of whatever the Animus equivalent to Denuvo is. 
Heck, thinking about it; maybe [b] I [/b] am an assassin and Denuvo are the templars.
[i] Bloody bullion, Ubisoft. [/i] You tried to tell us all along!

All in all I'd recommend this game if you like the pirate setting otherwise you can skip it.

The game, even after all this time, has held up very well over the years. AC Black flag stands among the best games that the AC franchise has to offer, and will for the foreseeable future.

Ship combat is some of the best I have ever seen in any game, and still holds true to this day. One of the few games where I will actually go out of my way to travel places myself instead of fast travelling. The game is open-world and enthralling with its story, which are always things to praise in any game. I see this becoming a staple of my Steam Library, a game that I will come back to replay time and time again.

Also, please fix the fog generation, it is very weird looking.

Edit: Update. DLC seems to be broken when buying the Gold Edition on Steam, doing so only gives a CD key to redeem the main game itself with no way to redeem the DLCs. I have a current support ticket open on Ubisoft Support, that they have been very slow with helping with.

The perfect balance of story, map exploration and side activities. Loved this game so much that I 100% the game (single player only, never cared for multiplayer). By the time I was done, the Jackdaw was able to take out the most powerful man-of-war ships in 2 hits. 1 golden mortar shot and 1 full elite cannon broadside. The Jackdaw after defeating the 4 legendary boss ships was the undisputed apex monster of the Caribbean. As for its Captain, he was in a league of his own. He was armed to the teeth with golden flintlock pistols, Officers Rapiers for blades, wore epic Mayan garments and was packed to the brim with bombs and darts. A one man army. He also had a fleet of ships conducting trade across the Atlantic. He knew the Caribbean like the back of his hand, having explored every nook and cranny of the seas.

If any of the above mentioned characteristics interest you, play this game and try to make your Edward the Master of the Caribbean. If you already played this game and did not achieve 100% completion, give it a try. The world the developers built has so many places of interest to explore. As basic advice, pace yourself if you try to 100% the game. Do a bit of story, do the side activities and repeat.

Unfortunately I was unable to achieve 100% completion on the Freedom Cry DLC. Adewale was a righteous liberator of slaves, but due to time limitations I was unable to make him into the apex assassin he deserved to become.

For starters the tailing missions are a pain (although an expected one) and the combat though visually appealing is pretty simple, you can easily pull of counters and tank gunshots making it possible to kill 10-15 enemies without even taking a single hit. It makes it easy to learn but as you keep playing it gets old FAST. The stealth in general does not work too well in this game leading you to depend on combat to get around. I'd say the only parts that lived up to my nostalgia is the killer soundtrack and naval combat, fighting off 2 frigates in the middle of a storm dodging waterspouts will always be fun.

I would recomend this one even to a non-AC fan. It is a great pirate game.

- This one tells a story about a pirate who only cares for himself. He steals, murders and does many other bad things. Then he meets a crossdressing woman who tells him that is not a way to live. She want's him to sacrifice his life for a ""a greater good"". He refuses at first but when all the people he cares for die he realizes that being selfish really isn't the way, so he stops being a priate and becomes an ninja terrorist, so that now he can steal and murder with an excuse. 

- Appart from the usual conspiracy cr*p, Black Flag is actually a good enough character driven game. Of course it has some weak moments but those are mostly caused by the illogical creeds and fanaticism of the conspiring factions and the antiestablishment nonsense (and really bad written death of a really good characters). No, Ubisoft, pirates did not fly black flag as a sign of freedom? There is however very little of it. For the most of the game you trully are a pirate. You meet templars and assassins but you don't care for them. You just rob them.

- The gameplay did not really change much from AC3 appart from the fact that sailing levels are now a major part of the game. A bit polished, improved with some new features and really fun. The parcour is the more stable and responsive and the world is filled with actually interesting things to do. Not just tons of collectibles. It is also the first AC since Brotherhood with actuall colour and pretty world. The story is nicely paced, not forcing any urgency on the player, so you can experience everything on the pace that most fits you.

Bonus:
- Why is it every time someone in the game says ""Jesus"" they spell it ""Jaysus"" in subtitles? For a ""multicultural team of various faiths and beliefs"" there should be no problem to use the name with clear conscience.",1560632141,1683577122,True,21,4,0.725517928600311279,0,True,False,False

Black Flag's adventure knows no downtime and literally leaves us breathless, catapulting us into the action from the very first moments of the game.
During the early stages of the game we learn about Edward Kenway, the new protagonist, initially unaware of the centuries-old rivalry between Templars and Assassins. It was precisely the neutrality of the protagonist that allowed the team to sketch a ""lighter"" personality: impetuous and impulsive, fascinated by the idea of easy riches rather than the pirates' ideals of freedom and equality, the one in Assassin's Creed 4 is one of the best characterized protagonists in the entire saga. Vaguely reminiscent of the bravado of the much-loved Ezio Auditore, Edward Kenway immediately strikes a chord in the player's heart, while the plot seamlessly alternates between moments of amusing lightheartedness and others that are decidedly more serious and profound. It is a multifaceted personality, enhanced by an assortment of secondary characters perfect for highlighting her, and embedded in a compelling coming-of-age story.
The struggle between the Templars and the Assassins, focused in this chapter on the quest for the Observatory (a place from which to control humanity), will reshape Edward's character to some extent, bringing him closer to the ideals of the modern hero in a gradual and convincing manner, without ever lapsing into triviality or easy moralizing. We will also observe the evolution of the plot itself, strengthened by a balanced screenplay that is always capable of teasing the right strings, which will engage the videographer while avoiding weighing him down emotionally.
Finally, the characterization of the ""pirate background"" is interesting. We will experience firsthand some of the most important events in what is called the Golden Age of Piracy, encountering famous buccaneers and privateers, discovering lesser-known events of that decade (which runs from 1715 to 1725), and generally encountering a setting exceptionally dense with references, details, and curiosities.",1683038071,1683038071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Unfold mates, let's move!""; the main words of this title of Assassin's Creed. What is more special about this game than its precedents? Well, this location is a dream to reach it: palm trees, white beaches, exotic fauna and a clean, crystalline blue sea; This is Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.

After all this time playing with Modern Assassins, it's time to see how Abstergo is doing. Recently opened, as a more concealed method of obtaining information about the Pieces of Eden and training soldiers, Abstergo Industries established Abstergo Enterntainment, a building where, from people's point of view, Modern Templars are creating games with help from test volunteers. The player is taking control of one of these testers in first person view. You have no name given, no reflection offered, but you are the protagonist, the one that many in the building are relying on, and you with the help from the Animus Omega, offered by Abstergo, you are living the memories of Edward Kenway, a sailor at first, father of the Templar Grandmaster Haytham Kenway and grandfather of the Colonial Assassin Connor Kenway, witnessing his maturing from a man who is only keen on gold and wealth to a responsible Assassin.

Set during the Golden Age of Piracy, 1715-1721, the story of the game is based on Edward's life in the Caribbean Islands and the conflict between Assassins and Templars, in which of course, he made his own invitation. His desire in becoming a pirate known in the Caribbean Sea and the duty to carry out his mission to the very end, which is to protect the great Temple of Eden from falling into the hands of the Templars, put Edward in certain choices that will define him for the rest of his life. Edward as a personality is a man who seems to know what he wants from his life, but the more the player approaches the end of the game, he starts asking questions about who he really must be.

The Caribbean Islands as surroundings are something entirely new to the old titles, because for the first time the location is not only a city or more cities but a whole sea full of islands, treasures and secrets waiting to be explored. With his own ship, the Jackdaw, the player through Edward can sail through the Caribbean Sea, accompanied by wind breezes and crew songs that offer a nice adrenaline to the exploration. Fauna and population give the life of this map through their presence in all the jungles, villages and great cities of the Caribbean: from Nassau Island full of pirates, to the city of Havana full of Spanish and South American civilisation.

Similar to his predecessor's engine, Assassin's Creed III, Black Flag has many additions in terms of stealth and combat. Additions of new tools, such as sleep arrows with which you put enemies asleep, or firecrackers that distract them to a desired point make stealth much easier and diversified for the player. Edward is equipped with 2 Hidden Blades, 2 swords and a maximum of 4 single-shot pistols that can use them in combat anytime, and the most special part of the 4 pistols is that Edward can use them all in a consecutive sequence, this movement being similar to a Peacemaker.
The combat moves remained the same, Connor's grandfather being able to parry, counter-attack, stun and disarm his enemies. A mini RPG system is introduced through the upgrades of Jackdaw and Edward. To become stronger, Jackdaw's weapons must be upgraded with materials that can be obtained by destroying or boarding Spanish and English ships. And Edward can dispose of an even greater arsenal by increasing efficiency and capacity of his stealth and combat gear.

At the end of the day, Black Flag delivers a world brimming with gorgeous places to go, amazing secrets to discover, nefarious pirates to stab and a world where you can make your own fun.

Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag Review:
Wow, what a game. Black Flag is what many consider the pinnacle of the Assassin's Creed franchise, and having played all previous games until this point, it is undeniable that it is superior to all previous in mechanics, story, and visual fidelity. The game itself has the most seamless movement of any Assassin's Creed game until this point in the franchise, fixing nearly all of the movement issues of the legacy titles, allowing you to really feel like there are no limits to the way you want to navigate. The ship combat is absolutely fantastic, taking a basic yet enjoyable system from Assassin's Creed 3, and refining it to a more complex but more enjoyable experience. While the game suffers from some issues regarding optimization performance wise, it still holds up as a beautiful game 10 years later.
Took me roughly 70 hours to 100%.

Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry Review:
A short tale about one of the main characters from Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, it is what I would call a return to form of the classic Assassin's Creed style. With smaller missions encompassing a larger more narrative driven story, and less focus on collecting everything on all corners of the map, it really shines as its own title, and is in my opinion superior to Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag.

The hand to hand combat is outright dirty, the ship combat is punishing if you don't upgrade your ship, and the parkour is spot on. The gap-tooth whistle Edward makes to aggro enemies towards your hiding spot is always amusing to me.

AC4 is a Chronological prequel to AC3 and AC Rogue, and should definitely be played after AC3 and before AC Rogue, otherwise the present day story and events will be out of order. 

The smelly dumpster fire of PC gaming, aka Ubisoft Connect, is the only downside to this game - requiring you to login every time you launch the game, including going through 2FA if you have it enabled. According to Ubisoft, this is working as intended because apparently older Ubisoft games have always-online security flaws baked into the code that can't be patched out. Not only do you have to log in every time you launch AC4, but if you play with a controller for extended sessions, Ubisoft Connect will log you out for being idle (doesn't detect xbox series controllers apparently) and when you exit AC4 your saves won't sync until you launch the game and log in to Ubisoft Connect again. 

Aside from Ubisoft Connect being a sadistic troll of a clown show from Ubisoft, AC4 Black Flag is well worth playing. I give it a 13/10 score",1681846010,1681846010,True,2,0,0.503968238830566406,0,True,False,False

Interesting cut-scenes and well-represented characters, as well as voice-acting are great. Also I would like to praise the sea battles, which looked spectacular. I don't remember having experienced such sea battles in any other game (yet).
The downside, perhaps, is that the game progressed very slowly. The whole first half (about 10 hours) passed in the same rhythm and quite slowly. The second half, on the other hand, was very interesting, especially the story. Unfortunately the tasks you have to complete are very similar from start to finish and lose their charm after a few hours of play.
Another negative thing that often became frustrating was how difficult it actually was to control your character. I mean, this game is designed to be very flexible so you can do all these jumps and tricks, but the problem that comes with it is that the character is extremely sensitive to any button press, and so often happens that you want to run up the wall, but instead your character starts fighting with some soldiers on the way. And vice versa: if your current task tells you to kill someone, then in the middle of the fight your character decides to jump somewhere or do something else that can ruin your task. All this weirdness can cost you throughout the game even a few hours maybe. Especially when you have to start the task again because some nonsense happened.
But all in all definitely a highly recommended game. Especially for those who like the pirate theme. The beautiful tropical environment and, of course, history also have a positive effect, as most of the main characters are based on real pirates.
It's also worth mentioning that it's a very big game and even after completing the main story you can travel around for dozens of hours and discover new areas and complete side tasks. And on top of that you can spend a few hours in the Animus database, as it contains plenty of exciting reading.",1586792032,1681617333,True,2,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

As a pirate game? It's the best I've ever played. The combat is the simple counter and kill system, which is fine. If it ain't broke, don't fix it (even though I'm glad they did in future games). The parkour is alright. Since AC3, the removal of the free run combo buttons for just a single button has wacked out some of the controls, but everything is still intact. The story is very good as a pirate game. It has Edward going from a greedy man trying to get everything best for his family, to a man who stands under a code and responsibility. A rather respectable man. They could've done this without the Creed, but it's whatever. The reason why I keep saying it doesn't work as an AC game is because they literally keep all that shit to the last 2 sequences. It feels very rushed, like it was never meant to be an AC game, which I'd believe it if it wasn't. Last but not least, the naval combat. It's simple, but that's what makes it just fucking great. It's way easier than I remember it being, I was able to take out 3 of the 4 legendary ships by the end of the game. Speaking of that side content though, that's what took up most of my hours, admittedly. AC4 really just draws you in with all the side content unlike future AC games where side content is just really really optional. It's still one of my all time favorite games, but as an Assassin's Creed game, it's nothing special.

What stands to me out is our character, Edward Kennway.

Unlike most AC games, where the MC is always somehow connected to the Assasin Brotherhood, be it a parent or family member being part of it or has a connection to the ever going fight between assasins and templar, like in AC 3, Edward stands out.
 
We have not a lot of background information about, but is it really necessary ? 
What is there to know about a welsh man chasing a dream, being ready to go through hell, so that his live can be full of adventure, while managing to have wealth to spend for the ones he care. 
Theres no need  if he had a rough childhood, is trying to avenge his dead parent/s or trying to protect the love of his life.(btw these welsh are just built different sheesh)

There is no ulterior motive, no ""i do it for the greater good"" or dead parents, like most AC games start.

He wants to become rich, while living the adventures life or die trying.
In a way its actually a really basic MC motivation, kinda like Monkey D. Luffy


And while following his own set path, it just so happen that he comes across the battle between assassins and templars.
It is only after coming in contact with them, and on the way losing pretty much everyone of his friends, where he realise that he can have a much bigger effect on the world.

I think I never felt so much for a character in an AC game, close to it maybe ezio in revelation, but i definitely related to Edward more.

Gameplaywise theres only one thing i want to say:

When sea battles where hinted in AC3 i was so hyped to see how theyre gonna develop it, due to next game being pirate-themed.
And by god i love it so much. 
The excitement that i feel everytime when i managed to defeat a warship ( I FUCKING LOVE THE MUSIC THEY PLAY WHEN YOU DEFEAT SHIPS OR THE FORTS, ITS SO FUCKING EPIC)   and the peak being obviously the legendary ships, with each one having a certain gimmick to the fight. (btw against the duo ship fight you can techically make infinite money if you defeat one and lose on purpose, you still get the 10000R from the first ship)

After now playing it on pc and remembering all the fun i had when it first came out and i played it on the ps3, 
I can only recommend AC 4 Black Flag to everyone who has a love for a good old open world AC game.

The blend of ship exploration, combat, and interaction with more or less classic AC gameplay is magnifique! Plus, they managed to successfully transition their entire narrative legacy into a new story line. Until this point, we followed Desmond as he navigated his Assassin lineage. But then they killed him! And in this game they introduce a faceless protagonist who explores Desmond's memories. It's the perfect way to continue the story.

At the same time, they spawned the idea that they, Ubisoft, were actually owned by Abstergo and were therefore Templars? That type of meta-narrative across, like, seven games is indescribable. 

And then there's the bulk of the narrative, which is Edward Kenway's story. And dude's a straight up pimp. Just like Ezio, we watch this cavalier, brave, and foolhardy boy turn into a decisive, cunning, and ruthless man. But unlike Ezio, he doesn't walk the Assassin's path until later in life. He just continues to greedily follow his whims as everyone around slowly dies or quits. It's devastating and tragic and like, from the Assassin's Creed franchise?

Hand to hand combat is fun. Sneaking is fun. Upgrading your ship and fighting the map corner bosses is satisfying. There's a few too many collectibles, but not too many.

In AC II, we learn the assassin's creed through Ezio who, initially arrogant, seeks vengeance on behalf of his kin and through hardship after hardship grows into the ideal assassin. In Black Flag, we learn the creed through Edward, a selfish, greedy pirate who sort of accidentally got caught in the conflict between the assassins and the templars. Just like Altair and Ezio's stories, personal conflict meets political conflict in Edward's but unlike theirs, Black Flag, to me, is a lot more personal. It's so easy to fall in love with Edward's character in this game.

Firstly, the tailing missions in this game are evil. There are way too many of them and they last for way too long, and just when you think it can't get worse, the game makes you tail ships. I enjoyed the traditional assassination missions, however. There were a lot of sequences I loved too, a lot of scenes which had gravity to them, which shaped Edward into the assassin he eventually becomes.[spoiler]It took the deaths of Blackbeard, Hornigold, Vane and Read for Edward to realise the dangers of the pirate life, a life of living for nothing, or worse, living for greed. Just when he decides to better himself, he realises it's too late as while he was wasting his life away at sea, his wife had died years ago, raising their child.[/spoiler]Black flag has the best written side characters in the series so far. Although longer than its predecessors, this game is the perfect length for its story. 

The map is huge, filled with vast negative space serving as the site of many chaotic ship battles and beautiful sea shanties. The setting of the Caribbean also plays well with Black Flag's simple yet adequate crafting system, as you plunder ships and scavenge through forests to hunt for materials. The remote forests and islands of the Caribbean is contrasted with its many bustling cities and villages. Kingston, Nassau and Havana are fun to walk through and even more fun to parkour through. However, every part of the map is as stunningly beautiful as the next. The map is so much more vibrant compared to its comparatively dull predecessors. There's so much to do in this vast world, there are so many islands, beaches, forests, villages, forts, templar hideouts and Mayan ruins to explore. You can take up assassination contracts for money, raid warehouses for materials, hunt animals, harpoon sharks and whales, and defeat the boss 'legendary ships' for even more rewards. On top of all of that, you can even dive underwater to explore caves and wrecks, and in perfect pirate fashion, search for treasure, on land and at sea, and there's just as much depth to Black Flag's naval combat system.

The way this game handles modern-day interesting. One issue I have with this is how it takes away from the special feeling of being important not just as the assassin you're living through, but in the modern-day as who you actually are. In this game, instead of being any character with any amount of depth to them, you're the most unremarkable and random researcher, so unremarkable in fact that you're unnamed.

Combat (with the exception of naval combat) is mid, stealth is mid, and while I truly appreciate how well-designed the map is, I can't help but prefer the traditional huge cities that my mind has correlated with assassin's creed. Personally, I much rather parkour on rooftops than on trees, and some of my favourite aspects of the AC games, Black Flag just didn't pay much attention to. In terms of story, characters and sheer quality, Black Flag is an amazing game, and while it's not quite what I look for when I play an AC game, I did have a lot of fun playing it.

The game's open-world setting, compelling story, and engaging gameplay mechanics make it one of the best games in the series.

Not only are cloud saves breaking and causing games to crash (4 UBIsoft games so far, including Watch Dogs 3, Starlink, AC: Valhalla, and Odyssey, any computer, any network), but UBIsoft has had open tickets from me for over EIGHT MONTHS and the experience has been one of the worst customer service experiences Ive ever had with a game company. The end result of my ticket history is an UBI tech actually retaliating against me (I was frustrated and told them I was going to stop being an UBI customer) and putting my support account into ""identity check"" mode, forcing me to verify all my info again even though we were IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. They didnt like my comment about not being their customer, and the next thing that happened was my support account is locked. 

As such I am changing my reviews for ALL UBIsoft games still in my accounts - all 29 of them that I've had for over 15 years. A company that cannot properly host cloud saves and tries to pass the buck to customers and ABUSES customer time and patience like this is not a company Ill pay another penny to.",1678319634,1678319634,False,3,0,0.557291626930236816,0,True,False,False

it has pretty good graphics

the combat is decent (although the point of the game is sneaking and assassinations so sneaky combat is better)

and music is really good, i love pirate themed music in video games

one thing i would have to say annoys me a bit is that sometimes this game glitches a bit, and doesn't allow me to hear what people are saying in the cutscenes, yes ive checked settings, and the cutscene voice setting is at 100%, like i can hear other things like footsteps, and things being opened, but all of the voices are muted.

My main problem with this game is that I've spent 50 something hours with it, and it picked up pace only towards the latter sequences. There is just so much of upgrading that it takes me away from being an assassin, and makes me be a pirate. It's a great pirate game, albeit a little repetitive game. The world is massive and full of usual filler stuff, but if you take away the assassins and just go out there to explore, conquer outposts, and gather treasures, it makes you feel like a real pirate. But at the same time, it's a below average assassin game that doesn't know whether it wants to be a linear stealth game or an open world jungle and sea combat game for most of it's duration.

Don't get me wrong, it's still among the best AC games. But the title of Assassin's Creed isn't really deserved. I'd probably enjoy it way more if was a separate game from AC series. They should have taken the AC references out completely, and named it just Black Flag. 

This game suffers from a massive identity crisis, and frankly, it's the first one in the series to have this problem, which was later manifested in entries like Origins, Odyssey, and the incredibly dogshit Valhalla, which are trying to replicate the success of Witcher 3 without having any sort of understanding why Witcher 3 is so universally beloved.

First few sequences were fine. I don't remember at which point in story it happened for me, but about halfway through I just couldn't be fucking bothered anymore, and decided to finish this as fast as possible to get most out of the story. And you know you've failed at making a game when your players don't want to explore the side content and use the fast travel thing to finish the game ASAP, only to be dissappointed even by that. After that, I spent a good few hours just fooling around the world just because of how fun it was when there were no assassins in sight.

Ah yes, the story. Where do I even begin with that? All characters were greatly written, and then, halfway through the game, [spoiler] EVERYONE FUCKING DIES except for Edward, Anne, Adéwalé, and the assassin leader [/spoiler]. I couldn't even create any sort of connection to the templars, be it positive or negative, because they get like 25 minutes of screen time IN 50+ HOURS. And it's a shame, because even in the more boring later half of the game, there is character developement, there are interesting things happening, but by that time I was so done with the story that I wished I could just tick a box and play the rest in linear story mode. The story is good, but terrible at the same time, because again, this game suffers from a massive identity crisis, where it doesn't know if it wants to be a pirate game, or an AC game.

As for the pirate parts- the gameplay has bright moments when it's on foot, but on sea it's fucking boring, even when fast traveling. The ship combat gets repetitive after a while, boarding ships becomes a chore, managing your fleet is really annoying, and on top of it all, the most enjoyment I've got out of this game was WHEN I WASN´T EVEN FUCKING PLAYING I- WHEN I WAS IN THE ABSTERGO SEQUENCES OUTSIDE OF ANIMUS, EXPLORING THE OFFICES. This is the one game in the entire series that nailed these sections down flawlessly. They aren't too long, they have some great exploration in them, and they don't exhaust you (besides the horrendous FOV, but it's bearable). 
The point where I've actually started enjoying this game was when I've finished the story, and was free to explore the world and do whatever I liked. That was when I was fully allowed to be a pirate without the game trying to push linear gameplay down my throat.

I recommend this game to people who want a pirate game and can't wait for Skulls & Bones. As for AC fans, just finish the story ASAP and then never play this again.",1533161556,1678025937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just wish developers would stop taking away control at every second turn and skip (or at the very least give the choice to skip) the repetitive and useless animations, slow menus, repetitive cutscenes, automated movements etc. It's the curse of the console I guess, or at least all these console ports suffer the worst from it (e.g. Tomb Raider), but it's just so annoying to have the game constantly leave you sitting there as nothing but a spectator. I want to [b]play[/b], not watch. The same applies to automated camera movement. It's [i]NEVER[/i] helpful, always messes up movement, has been there since the very first AC title and has always pissed me off. What do developers think this adds to their game? 
Ironically, the parts of the game that resemble the usual Assassin's Creed m.o. are the worst and most boring aspects in my opinion. The story isn't very interesting to me (which doesn't say much, as good gameplay is worth a hundred good stories for me, personally, and my patience for long, unskippable cutscenes galore is approaching zero), and the parts outside the Animus are more of the bad stuff. Slow, tedious, boring, uninteresting, and with that guy in your earpiece trying [i]way[/i] too hard to be witty.
Stealthing is so bugged and stealth missions are so randomly infuriating, it's as terrible as ever. Climbing is hit-or-miss as usual, but it feels like it's gotten worse compared to AC3 (constantly jumping on small crates as if they were a high ledge, not going where you want to go, small earthen mounds being impossible to climb etc.). But at least the naval combat is redeeming. I wish there were other single player titles focussing on that. It's what sets this game apart and makes it worth replaying.

VERDICT:
Black Flag beats ALL the previous titles, the story, the characters, the in depth world and ocean, and above all....  the SHANTIES! The only AC title that's on par has to be AC II purely because Ezio has such a strong story line and I somehow always remember him when it comes to AC but Edward and his crew just creeps above him.

This game is well worth the asking price and deserves to be played just for the leisure and the booty of course.
Total Score = 100/100.

GAMEPLAY:
 It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin's Creed III, though its modern-day sequences succeed III's own. 

The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and describes the player as an Abstergo agent. The main story is set in the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather and father of Assassin's Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton (Connor).

Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. The game's setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward Kenway captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet in an early game mission.

There is something about moving at travel speed while the crew is singing shanties that gives the nice pirate touch. This was definitely a nice twist from the usual AC gameplay being 100% on land. I've heard this is everyone's favorite AC game and it probably is now for me as well. The present-day storyline is pretty neat as well and I'm glad they brought back some people from Desmond's crew. 

There are a couple small things I have disliked about the game so far including. Opening up the map and navigating around can be difficult at times. Sometimes the it doesn't zoom out really far and it takes forever to find where I need to go.

Movement control is too PlayStation'ish for me.  You either walk like an old man or run like a sprinter, nothing in between. 

Immersion: zero. Stealth aspect is ruined by denying crouch, on the roofs you need to stand behind chimneys to hide, not something a pirate would do voluntarily.  Abstergo parts are lame, like a bad Half Life copy.

Combat is mindless outside of ships, running is super janky, and most of the story missions are tedious. This game's main redeeming feature is the fact that it's a pretty fun pirate game sometimes. Sailing around plundering ships, taking forts, and discovering islands is fun, but what isn't fun are the uncharted collectibles scattered across the Caribbean. You can ignore them, and you'll never know the pain of spending 10 minutes on getting a single animus fragment. For me, though, I like to get all the things if I can, and I've been doing that. It sucks.

There is waaaaay too much fluff in this game. Some of it's fun to do, like treasure maps, plantation heists, legendary ships, and naval forts. Still, then you have assassination missions, naval contracts, Templar hunts, Mayan steles, shanties, viewpoints, messages, manuscripts, chests, and, worst of all, animus fragments. 

It's endless, and they're all the same. 

Some of this shit at least has good rewards. Shanties are each new songs for your crew to sing, which is nice when you're sailing 3 km to get a chest and animus fragment on the east coast of Florida, and lots of chests means lots of money. Some of the naval contracts are interesting too, but it's usually ""find ship and sink it"" or ""get me x resource."" Assassination missions are rarely that fun either. It's always ""go place kill guy"" only variety is the location. The best I've seen so far was a guy who took a fort that I'd already captured and bragged about it when I went to kill him. Otherwise, they are bland and forgettable. Templar Hunts are side quests, so they're about the same as any other story mission. They're hit or miss. Everything else is "" go place get thing,"" and that's it, but there are many things. Steles are a super easy puzzle and a long unskippable animation. Manuscripts are glorified chests, shanties are annoying to catch, and messages have long, unskippable animations.

I fucking hate animus fragments, though, and they're everywhere. They're usually a climbing challenge, and climbing sucks. It's slow, janky, and tedious. It's why viewpoints kind of suck too, but at least they let you know where all the other bullshit is on the map so you can do your chores. Playing this game feels like work, and it canonically is work. I've been actively avoiding the story missions for a while now because I'm scared that I'm close to going back to the Abstergo part of this game. It's like a super long boring cutscene that you can't skip with even more bullshit to find and do. I haven't even unlocked the diving bell yet.

I played this game to completion when it came out on Xbox back in 2013 and restarted it a couple of times on pc, but never finished it again. I enjoyed it back then, but now I've sunk an extra 30+ hours into the game and see all its flaws glaring at me. About 90% of my sessions playing this game only ended when it crashed, so they were around 3 hours each. At least it saves every 10 seconds, so you never really lose any progress. Overall the game does have its moments, and depending on how you play, it may even be fun, but if you wanna get all the things, never play this game. You'll regret it. 

Now, if you excuse me, I'm going to go back to my chores.

You can choose between a stealthy approach and kill from the bushes or as a force of nature and kill everyone in a 1v10 fight which both are addictive and fun! The game is an open world pirate game which does not force the storyline upon you and you are free to roam and collect treasure if you'd like or sink down enemy ships to plunder their resources for upgrades. I found myself endlessly sailing across the see collecting treasures and sink ships I see fit quite entertaining while hours went by.

Arrrrr! And my Assassin's Creed gaming spree has ended (until new AC: Unity and AC: Rogue releases that is) for now and I can honestly say that I haven't had that much fun since AC 2. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag offers lots and lots of stuff to do. Just the seafaring on your Jackdaw ship while listening to the sea shanties of your crew truly immerse you into the pirate theme this game went into. And as a pirate themed game, I haven't played a realty good one ever since Sid Meier's Pirates Gold!... and that was close to ten years ago!

Naturally, this game has its ups and downs but compared to AC3, it is a huge step in the right direction. Black Flag has a bigger focus on ""simply having fun"", gameplay speaking. Storywise, the pirate-Animus setting delivers, while you progress your pirate career as Edward Kenway and seek help from other known pirates like Charles Vane, Blackbeard, Anne Bonny, James Kidd, etc. You have many lost treasures on maps to search in this game, which unlocks elite upgrades for your ship and I would say mandatory if you want to have a chance against the legendary Man-o-War battleships. You got the whaling minigame that opens up Edward's crafting abilities and unlocks better gear, similar to Far Cry 3. The Templar vs Assassin theme is still there in this game but not as omnipresent as previous AC games.

My biggest deception in this game was the pointless ""modern setting"". Walking around, finding sticky notes and hacking colleagues computers only to have a pseudo continuation from the events of AC 3. Another big irritant of Black Flag was the many many many eavesdropping and tailing missions. Way too annoying and very frustrating as you are forced to play these missions as how the developer has intended for you, which is don't be seen, don't do this/that... ""oh you did! DESYNCH and repeat mission! ENJOY! :D""

Aside from these irritants, the rest could be pretty much discarded but I'll still elaborate on the Positives and Negatives.


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Killer visuals! A gorgeous, vibrant world full of reasons to go exploring!
+Outstanding naval combat. (Picks up from AC3 naval combat but improved in every ways).
+Progression systems are profoundly rewarding (crafting, upgrading Edward and the Jackdaw, etc).
+Terrific pirate story that depicts how they lived and also, shows you the pirates in a human light. 
+Seafaring and on-foot exploration complement each other in a perfect mix.
+Gameplay mechanics delivers but hopefully, they'll be more refined in the new AC games. Although the moves are more fluid compared to AC3. (Played with Xbox One controller).
+Decent soundtrack from composer Brian Tyler. Also the sea shanties arrrrrr good![/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-I haven't experienced any bugs or gamecrashing glitches but read that Black Flag has nasty issues at launch, until it was properly patched that is! I did had a few glitches and were all fixed by reloading a checkpoint!
-Just too many eavesdropping and tailing missions... I mean c'mon, couldn't you have done something different here? I just hate those missions badly!
-Bland and boring modern setting. Now that Desmond Miles is out of the portrait, this new unknown guy you play as in the Abstergo Entertainment Montreal studios has little to offer in the main Templar vs Assassin everlasting confict. That setting felt forced and I do hope on the future AC games, the modern setting will be much more developed, just like the other AC games.
-I would've liked to see the other main countries in this game, like the French and the Dutch, who were colonizing the Americas of that time too and also, at war against Spain and England. More countries at war, the merrier! Might happen on AC Rogue, who knows!
-If the multiplayer is your reason to play AC games, you'll find nothing new here... same old same old and not my cup of tea![/b]


[h1]OVERALL:[/h1]
[b]Fantastic game! I really enjoyed this game which you have tons and tons of stuff to do. Ubisoft have redeemed themselves with Black Flag since AC3 was beyond disappointing in every possible way. Black Flag delivers and whether you're new to the Assassin's Creed franchise or not, this game takes a big pause in the main modern theme of Templar vs Assassin from previous games and enables you to just jump into this fun pirate theme and well, just have fun plundering other ships![/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]Yes, absolutely! AC fan or not, play this game... as long as you dig the pirate theme![/b]


[h1]AVELINE DLC:[/h1]
Short straightforward DLC that doesn't add much in Aveline de Grandpré's storyline. It picks up at the end of AC Liberation and whether you played or not that game doesn't matter for this DLC. You just start somewhere and after you've done climbing the side of a Fort, you have to liberate someone inside and the end... Very below-average! Sad because Aveline could have been a decent main character to play, aside from AC Liberation but is quite under-developed. Overall, if it comes with your Black Flag game, give it a shot since it is very short... 45 minutes max! If you only have Black Flag game, discard this DLC! You won't miss much! 


[h1]FREEDOM CRY DLC:[/h1]
You play as Edward Kenway's quartermaster, Adéwalé. This DLC picks up at the end of Black Flag. It doesn't give you any info about Edward's and Black Flag storyline so you can always play this DLC in any way you seek as it doesn't impede BF main plot. Adéwalé is a great character. His involvement into liberating the slaves of Port-au-Prince felt rewarding each time I got to massacre the slavers. You do have some seafaring missions as you do steal a ship and roam the West-Indies. You have about ten or so locations to explore. Freedom Cry has a good mix of side missions and main ones. The story is solely focused on liberating Port-au-Prince from the French slavers and there is little to no mention of the Templars. You have about a good ten hours of playtime in FC DLC. My main gripes are like Black Flag, way too many eavesdropping and tailing missions! I'd actually recommend this DLC if you get around to it. Freedom Cry is fun and straightforward while having the fun parts of Black Flag like seafaring, in the DLC.

i Remember playing this game almost 10 years ago and having a good time, I saw it on sale and thought aye why not? Assassins Creed Black Flag is probably the best Assassin's Creed game and IS the best pirate game you can play. the jackdaw is really fun to play around with and upgrading the ship not only makes the numbers go up but gives nice visual upgrades to the ship. 

The land combat is typical assassins creed combat so if you like it or not you already know what you are getting yourself into. The ship combat is a ton of fun and i always get into fights with other ships simply because of how fun it is to take one down and board it, if you like challenge then the legendary ships will be a treat.

the story is decent, the characters are likeable and Edward is a fun protagonist but the pacing feels rushed and just when you're really getting into it the game shoves you into a modern day segment which i wish the series got rid of after the events of 3.

The world is also great, the crew singing shanties as you sail the seas makes exploring enjoyable and encountering bigger, more difficult ships makes me want to just sail around and see what the map has to offer. However ubisoft cannot help themselves and have placed so many collectables that it is overwhelming and at one point i just stopped caring, i say if you are someone who likes collectables only do the ones that give you actual rewards. 

In conclusion i think this game is a a lot of fun, sure it isn't perfect and there are a ton of glitches but if you just sit down and engross yourself in a fun pirate adventure then you wont be disappointed.",1675741355,1675844783,True,3,0,0.530088067054748535,0,True,False,False

Having just watched a timeline video after, I had no idea there was an ancient alien race or a deeply connected story that spans across all the games. I had played Black Flag back in 2013 when I was in middle school, with it being the first M rated game. Up until then I had only had a Wii and was unable to run many of the AAA titles that were on the PS3 and Xbox 360. While I still enjoyed playing the game almost 10 years later, it has very obvious flaws that make it hard to recommend in 2023. Starting off with the positives. I thought the settings and characters were serviceable. The Caribbean is fun to look at and parkour around. While I can’t say that exploration is particularly engaging due to the cookie cutter collectibles, the vibe of being a pirate is engrossing and a strong motivator to keep playing. The parkour is also satisfying when it works, but I feel like often times, Edward is running up walls I didn’t want him to. Edward Kenway’s journey from a broken down family to drunk to eventual hero was rewarding. Seeing him go from a self absorbed and selfish man to one who is willing to give his life for the cause of the Assassins was the best part of the game. These moments really allow his personality to shine. Unfortunately the rest of the game is mediocre. Exploration is lazy with no real reason to collect collectibles. I’m not against collectibles, but I like when they are tied to a story or side mission, I do not like collecting for collecting sake.  Missions were insultingly mundane. Half of them felt like trailing missions which are horrendously boring. The rest were run of the mill infiltration missions that were easy due to the watered down combat and intrusive minimap. The game does not encourage exploration in a way that Fallout or RDR2 would. Where these games have a story either through a side mission or wonderfully crafted visual/environmental storytelling, Black Flag feels almost copy paste. I will say this game, despite being severely outdated and unimaginative from a gameplay perspective, makes for a fun “turn your brain off” type of game. It’s easy to pick up and play, especially when engaging with its well crafted ship combat. This is especially true on the Steam Deck, which I played on. You don’t have to think much about what to do or where to go because the minimap does everything for you. Lastly, while the story isn’t amazing and is held together by a great protagonist, after watching the timeline video, I can appreciate the expansive lore that is present in the Assassin’s Creed universe. While I can’t recommend this game in 2023, I look forward to trying Assassin’s Creed II, since I’m currently studying abroad in Firenze, where the game takes place. 4/10

1. The vast majority of the naval aspect of the game 
2. Nice main music theme
3. Great setting and presentation
4. The final act of the main story
5. This game also contains an assassin's creed game


Cons
1. Main storyline was.... meh. 
2. In my opinion the parkour system is worse than in the previous entries. It feels more ""super-heroic"", unrealistic, weird camera angles still there on occasion, difficulty jumping diagonally, still no crouch button, not cohesive (the character jumps like he's spiderman and all of a sudden he cannot climb a particular rock to save his life - a rock that I can climb in real life and I'm not a super assassin mind you)
3. I was never a fan of the stealth system. Still bad, even worse. I don't like the way they used the eagle vision that allows you to x-ray people and see them walking behind the buildings. So the character is a fusion of Spiderman and Superman but he still can't climb the rock I mentioned above. Still, when you tail someone and the target goes a bit further, a countdown begins, even when it's perfectly clear where the target is or heading. Still the enemy AI acts weird in terms of when and how they spot you.
4. The combat system is the worse of the series so far. Still very easy and not rewarding at all, which makes the stealth mode a bit pointless because you can basically kill everyone. Enemies are very polite and sometimes await the animation to finish before attacking one at a time. Combat animations are as unrealistic as they can be. Your character sometimes takes 3-4 seconds to kill a single person because he delivers an excessive number of blows. There are times that the character slashes the chest, the head, the torso, the ears and still the enemy attacks again. That's allright though because as I said, the rest of the enemies are polite and await their turns.
5. I found the map to be a bit confusing at times
6. Present day. It's like the game is saying to you ""You've had your fun, now do your chores or else you won't be allowed to play any more"". You have to earn it I guess :Ρ

Summary
It's really simple. This is an assassin's creed game integrated inside a pirate game. If you like the pirate aspect of the game and also liked any previous entries in the assassin's creed franchise, you will probably like this game very much. It's very fun. The gameplay cons are not enough to destroy the game, because the game keeps you entertained. It's fun. It's a fun game. Have fun.  Unless you don't like the pirate stuff. In that case play the Ezio trilogy again.

Bonus Review - Assassin's Creed Rogue
-> This is supposed to be a new Assassin's Creed full game. In reality it is a black flag expansion with only minor additions to the gameplay but the setting is worse, the gameplay gets repetitive because there is quantity over quality, there are too many collectibles in such a degree that they just lose their value. The writing is bad, the dialogues are bad and the story doesn't make sense in a lot of parts.  Combine all the cons above with the black flag gameplay and you have a mediocre game at best.

Everything was amazing. The characters were 9.5/10, the plot was 9/10, the soundtrack was 9/10, and most amazingly the setting (time and world building) was an easy 9.5/10 if not 10/10. I can literally only think of three complaints:
1. There were a LOT of tailing missions. The parkour/maneuverability mechanics were really good though, so they weren't terribly painful.
2. The plot took a little bit to get really interesting, but not very long, and once it kicked in it was amazing.
3. Obligatory 3 saying I wish there was more content (like outfits to unlock, templar hunts, etc.)

I will most probably return to this game at a later date, but seeing the ending (no spoilers) left me really happy and resolved the story with such a great conclusion that I need to step away for a bit.

-The highlight of this game is the naval navigation and combat. It looks great and has a lot of strategic depth. All the different weapons and tools you have are very satisfying to use and you often end up in the middle of epic battles with multiple sides fighting each other.
-What makes the above even better are some of the best weather effects I've seen in a game with massive storms, waterspouts forming and huge waves coming towards you that will create many many memorable moments.
-In the more calm moments you are sailing and singing and visiting various islands for treasure and collectibles. The graphics still hold up with some beautiful areas.
-The story, characters, writing and voice acting are all fantastic, probably the best out of all the AC games. The cities are ok with Havana being the most interesting. The parkour is worse than the previous games but not too bad.

---{ Summary }---
Pirates!!!!
This is easily one of my top 10 favorite games of all time, I play it every summer! I own this on various platforms. Ever seen the TV Series ""Black Sails""? The cast played this game on set before scenes, and in downtime!
That being said...
Graphics are pretty good considering how old it is. The soundtrack/score/shanties are awesome. There are the typical Assassins Creed bugs, but nothing that would deter me from playing. Naval warfare is absolutely awesome! Side activities include treasure hunting, bounty hunting, Assassin Missions, and more! The only down side I have to this game is the Assassins Creed part.  I wish this was just an awesome Golden Age of Piracy game but there is some futuristic aspect to this game since you are playing a game about a person playing a game... SMH...

[i] First of all, I want to say that I played this game on the day of release on my console back then. Even then I fell in love with this game. Almost every aspect of this game is brilliant, which is very funny because it was made by Ubisoft, who can no longer make good games. I consider them degrading company. [/i] 😜

[b] But that doesn't mean, that there aren't any negative aspects. [/b]

[hr][/hr]

[h1] So let's start with the PROS. [/h1]

[b]1. Graphics.[/b] For 2013 they are very good. [i] Especially for game from Ubisoft.[/i] 😅 However, it is also worth noting that for the PC port, the graphics could have been slightly improved, but this is just a port, and not some kind of remaster. So I won't complain about it.

[b]2. Plot.[/b] Well, objectively speaking, it is not bad, but it won't set the world on fire either. It is quite simple, in some moments even clichéd, but it does its job quite well. Many people do not like the fact that the main character [u]is not a trained Assassin[/u], but [b] I'll disagree[/b]. Yes, for game series about ASSASSINS - it's pretty uncommon and ridiculous, but in my opinion this story shows one important detail that [u]ANYONE[/u] can be an assassin and you don't have to be super special to become one. 
And given that at the time of the release of the game, Assassins were mainly striving for somewhat [u]good goals[/u], then such a twist may encourage the player to various actions. Also, Edward Kenway is an ordinary person who wasn't interested to save the world etc., but simply strived to live the way he wants, so that he doesn't need anything. [u]He is not[/u] ready to help everyone he meets for free. He only does what suits him and what [u]HE[/u] wants. This is quite common for [u]ANY[/u] person, and thus this plot ""twist"" makes the main character more relatable. 
About the  other different plot twists and etc., I, perhaps, won't say anything. They seem to work, but not without drawbacks. [i]Although the previous games in the series did not have any mind-blowing twists too, so, again, I won't complain about it.[/i] 🤔

[b]3. Animations, effects, weather conditions, sea and surroundings.[/b] They are done with a bang. The storm is one of my favorite events in the [u]WHOLE[/u] game. It feels dangerous and tense. It interferes with maneuvering and attacking, doesn't allow the ship to be abandoned, and also creates an atmosphere. And the music, [i]( about which we will talk about in the 4th article )[/i], adds cinematic quality and additional tension to it. I would also like to note the architecture reflects that era of the 18th century really well.

[b]4. Music. [/b] It is beautifully composed. Each track in the game has a nicely done melody, and also perfectly complements different events. Battles, stealth missions, etc. I loved these soundtracks so much that [b]I even added them to my Apple music.[/b] 😎

[b]5. Battles, both on land and on water. [/b] Naval battles and boardings are done quite well, I would even say excellently. I can feel how powerful are cannons, how strong is the wind, how quick is my ship etc., All of that adds extra immersion in the game. The maneuverability of your ship and naval strategy also play an important role. All of that combined works perfectly and you can feel the action. Especially in battles against legendary ships or fleets of 5 Manowars and galleons. I feel the scale of the battle and its intensity. [b]As for the battles on land, there were some drawbacks here. I'll talk more about this in the cons category.[/b]

[b]6. Side quests. [/b] Well, there are also some [u]drawbacks[/u] here, but I would like to note that most of the missions and activities from the secondary category are done quite well. They are interesting and have various awards. [b]For example Whale hunting is one of my favorite gameplay elements.[/b] And Templar hunts are [u]the best side quests[/u]. They are interesting, not so boring, as others and also, there aren't billions of them, which doesn't make them tiresome.

[h1]Now, let's talk about the CONS. [/h1]

[b]1. Console port. [/b] Because of this, most aspects in the game are lame. Graphics suffer, inconvenience of controls, as well as optimization. The game has the stupidest limit of 60 frames. Because of this, I still [i]( not only me )[/i] had critical frames drops. [u]ON MY $5,000+ PC[/u]. [spoiler]( Ye, idc what you will say about it. Name it however you want, bragging or smth, again, idc)[/spoiler] There are occasional frame drops. I have seen these drops more than once just over time in the game. [u]ITS UNPREDICTABLE[/u]. [b]This pisses me off.[/b] But, its not that bad. They are not [u]THAT MUCH[/u] critcal and most of the times I needed to wait a little for FPS to stabilize. 
[i]Also, this silly integration with the Ubisoft launcher also sometimes gets in the way for me.[/i]

[b]2. Parkour. [/b] In Unity, it is done very well, but in this game and previous ones it is very inconvenient, unpredictable and stupid sometimes. [b]But still, it's pretty good.[/b]

[b]3. Combat on land and stealth. [/b] [i]Let's return to this topic.[/i] Although the animations are cool and badass, this doesn't prevent the gameplay from being rather boring. Press the left mouse button million times and occasionally do not forget to press ""e"". [u]THAT'S IT[/u]. Nothing more is required from you. Terrible AI makes things even worse. The NPCs are so dumb it's not even funny anymore. Stealth aspect becomes really goofy and suffers from this combat system. There is [u]NO[/u] intended punishment for the fact that you completed the mission ""loudly"". Of course, there will be more enemies, but that's not a big of a deal, because it is enough to occasionally press ""e"" and you are invulnerable even against [u]100[/u] people.

[b]4. Bugs. [/b] [i]I wont talk about it so much[/i]. Animation bugs, not loading missions or disappearing NPCs, etc. There aren't much of them, but they still are [u]annoying[/u]. [b]But, to be fair, I will say that this was also in the version for consoles.[/b]

[b]5. Side quests and and how monotonous they are. [/b] Go there, kill that one, collect all the fragments etc. They are very simple and tedious. 
[u]BTW[/u] It is very annoying that in order to complete the game 100%, you have to swim through [u]ALL[/u] small islands just to collect [u]ONE[/u] animus fragment or [u]ONE[/u] chest. And game doesn't provide anything to help you out in this situation. Game will park your ship [u]10000[/u] miles away from island and wont give even a boat, [u]THAT PLAYER LITERALLY HAVE AND USES IN SEA HUNTING[/u].

[i] I guess that's all I would like to say. [/i]

[hr][/hr]

[b] Let's sum it up then! [/b]

[b] I think that the game is just great, [u]even[/u] almost the [u]best[/u] in the series! It has interesting plot and gameplay and also its very [u]badass[/u]😎. However, it also has downsides. The monotony of content and poor combat system can sometimes get player bored quickly. [/b]

Pros:
-Sailing the seas, ship battles, and especially boarding are super fun! Great loop
-Treasure hunts!
-Sea shanties!
-Great OST
-Great sound design
-Pretty good story
-You can take out an army once you learn to use all your tools
-Whaling boat hunts are a nice distraction
-Difficulty is just right for a casual game

Meh:
-Graphics aren't bad, but  aren't great. Beginning to show its age.
-Even on an RTX 3080 I was getting some stuttering occasionally. More annoying than anything.

Cons:
-Felt like it was pretty slow to start. I was about to uninstall around the two hour mark, but I pushed through. Shortly after, there  was a fort battle and some of the story started getting more interesting. Give it time, your patience will be rewarded.
-The fleet management mini-game gets old fast
-You will learn to hate sharks, eels, jellyfish, and sea urchins
-Aveline DLC was way too short, not even an hour. 
-The legendary ship El Impoluto defies all logic and reason and is hands down the worst fight in the game. Luckily it is side content and in no way required for anything. I suggest you find the YouTube walkthrough from EZ BLAZE. Do exactly as instructed and you will get through it without shattering your controller/keyboard/mouse.
-The big one for me, controls are on the edge of feeling dated. I died many times because the controls did something unexpected or were unresponsive. This is compounded by what seems like shifting timing windows to do a counter attack. Sometimes I hit it immediately and still get pounded by a brute with a boarding ax. Sometimes I hit with timing that should have been way too late and I roll to safety or deflect a blow. Coming from a newer AC game like Odyssey or Valhalla, it is a little jarring.

Final Verdict:
-Do you like Assassin's Creed? Do you like pirates? Do you like ships? Do you like an interesting story? If you answered yes to any of the above, buy it! But get it on sale. Not that it isn't worth full price, but it goes on sale constantly. Your patience will be rewarded.

Nothing about my computer should have a difficult time with this 9 year old (at the time of writing) game. And yet, it starts to stutter, then it full on freezes. Alt-tabbing out and back in will let it run smooth again, for a moment, then it'll freeze again. I've tried multiple fixes from online and they work for one session, then they don't work again.

The current fix I'm using is to go into task manager, and set affinity to less cores. Disabling some seems to make it run smoothly. For now... Again, each fix I try is only temporary, so who knows if I'll run out of fixes.

As for the actual game, it's a lot of fun, sailing around, pirating, assassinating targets. All a lot of fun. Just a shame about the performance. 

If you play the game and start having these issues, I'd recommend refunding it, as trying to fix them is one hell of a fruitless journey.

One of the main strengths of the game is its open-world environment, which is beautifully designed and offers a vast range of activities for players to engage in. From exploring the Caribbean sea and its many islands, to engaging in naval battles, to hunting for treasure, there is always something to do and discover.

The game also features a compelling story that follows the life of Edward Kenway, a pirate-turned-assassin, as he navigates the treacherous waters of the Caribbean. The story is well-written and engaging, and players will find themselves fully invested in the game's characters and their struggles.

Another highlight of the game is the combat system, which is fast-paced and satisfying. Players can use a variety of weapons and techniques to take down their enemies, and the game's free-running mechanics allow for smooth and fluid movement throughout the world.

In 2007, the publisher took a chance with a new title, establishing the ongoing, endless war between the Assassins and the Templar Order. Two years later, they refined the concepts started in the first game, creating Assassin's Creed II. That game moved from the Holy Land to Renaissance Italy, and traded out the dour Altair for the charming Ezio Auditore da Firenze.

The jump to the sequel firmed up the game's framing story: these adventures of Altair and Ezio were experienced through the genetic memory of their ancestor, Desmond Miles. Most of the game took place in the past, but you were actually Desmond reliving those lives in the near-future of our modern day, via a device called the Animus.

Assassin's Creed II was also the beginning of Ubisoft settling into annual release pace with the franchise. ACII was followed by Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, a title that continued Ezio's story, perfected the formula, and still stands as one of the high points in the franchise. 2011 saw the release of Assassin's Creed: Revelations, which was a rough end to Ezio's life. While ACII and AC:B felt fresh and innovative, Revelations was a bit of a retread and new mechanics like hideout sieges, didn't feel like they fit within the series. The franchise didn't completely fall over, but the momentum was slowed.

2012 moved from Ezio's tale to a pair of adventures in early colonial America: Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. While the latter was a spin-off title built for the PlayStation Vita, the former represented the first real sequel in three years. Ezio was replaced with Connor, a half-English, half-Mohawk warrior with ties to both the Assassins and Templars. Ubisoft moved to the new AnvilNext engine for the game: Connor could climb trees and sail in the Atlantic in a pair of series' firsts. ACIII also saw the end of Desmond's tale in an ignoble demise. Unfortunately, it was an uneven experience; it wasn't horrible, but it didn't live up to the pedigree of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood for some.

A year later, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were on the way out, being replaced that year by the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It's worth stepping back for a second to realize that Ubisoft had released five Assassin's Creed games within the same generation. Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, and Assassin's Creed III all launched on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. (A PC release wasn't always a given, usually quite delayed when it did happen.)

Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was a trailblazer though. It was launching on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 like its predecessors, but it would also see a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release a month later. For the first time, Ubisoft had the chance to bridge the gap between consoles.

Black Flag was still an Assassin's Creed game, but it left the land-based shenanigans behind for a high seas adventure. Edward Kenway—the grandfather of Assassin's Creed III's Connor—wasn't a hero or even a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, he was a pirate that stole the outfit for personal gain. Edward hobnobbed through the Caribbean during the Golden of Age of Piracy, counting Blackbeard, Mary Read, Anne Bonny, and Charles Vane as friends and contemporaries. He had that same cocksure swagger present in Ezio's first outing.

There's a moment when Black Flag falls into place for me. Edward is doing the Assassin thing, climbing buildings, running through alleys, and shanking guards with his Hidden Blade. But then, you decide it's time for a change in scenery. Edward goes sprinting down to where his ship, the Jackdaw, is waiting. Your boots land on the deck and you just begin sailing. It's a seamless experience, jumping from land to the high seas.

Assassin's Creed III featured on-ship segments, but they were separate from the main game. Here, both ideas are joined in a single core, and it just works. You were always free to go wherever in Assassin's Creed: that's part of the idea of the open-world. But this jump from terra firma to the deep blue sea, it feels freeing. There's a sense of exploration and freedom borne of the fictional idea of pirates: a concept forged by classic pulp serials and television shows like Captain Blood (featuring Errol Flynn), Sinbad the Sailor, Treasure Island, Captain Kidd, and The Buccaneers.

Black Flag offers up that feeling in a way that honestly no other game has before or since. It's a great Assassin's Creed game, but at points you can see the traditional Assassin's Creed side straining under the weight of years of development. Assassination and stealth were solid and strong, but instant fail tracking missions, glitches, and the lack of an easy way to get down from high places without killing yourself were all missteps. To be clear, these were issues carried forward from the best games in the series, they just continued to haunt the franchise.

None of that matters though, because the stuff on land worked well enough, the stuff on the high sea was sublime, and the gulf between the two was non-existent. Nothing was holding you back. To use part of the series' catchphrase: everything is permitted. Go find some unexplored islands. Go destroy and pillage some ships. Take up an assassination contract that'll see you chasing one target from land to sea. Swing from your mast by a ropeline and dive into the crystal clear ocean.

That ""crystal clear"" was also a big part of Black Flag's charm. The game looked good on the last generation of consoles, but jump to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One offered such a vibrant and beautiful world to explore. The detail put into the wood, canvas, and ropes of the Jackdaw and other ships. The waves and sea spray as your ship cut through the ocean, or the massive waves of a vicious storm. Of particular joy to me is just sitting in the mix between ocean and land: on the beaches there was water lapping at your feet, the gorgeous shallows a few feet in one direction and jungle plants waving in the breeze in the other. And beyond that, the signs of civilization.

Black Flag stands above the best of the series is because it carries forward what Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood did well, while also forging new ground for the franchise. Edward Kenway is as charming as Ezio in his own way and his journey from opportunist to heroic outlaw is a good one. Stealth and climbing remains as solid as it was in the past entries. The Caribbean offered Ubisoft a chance at a bit more color than the darker American Revolution, and moving to the next generation of consoles meant it looked amazing. Black Flag was even so good that it may have ruined the franchise for some folks; those who simply want another pirate game, instead of one involving the assassins.

And it still holds up. I may miss parkour down (introduced in Unity), but Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is still a high point in my PlayStation 4 library. For me, it's the best in the series, followed closely by Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Assassin's Creed Origins has the chance to repeat the feat, coming from the same creative director as Black Flag and showing players the beginning of the Assassin Brotherhood.",1673697852,1673697852,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

Ubisoft will invalidate your CD keys, even if you can provide a receipt showing you bought the game. And on top of that, you might just buy one of their games and end up in a situation where there servers are down.

Black flag is probably a fine game, I wouldn't know since their stupid copy protection sucks balls.

-The sea Shanties actually had some kind of reason for existence, which was nice.
-Being able to fasttravel between any viewpoint was Awesome, so helpful oh my god.
-Convoy concept from AC III was simplified in this version, which was nice.

Cons:
-Storyline felt drawn out way too far, they waited a lot longer than I think they shld've to have edward finally redeem himself, made it hard to root for him. All the other games were about the same concept, a ego-tistical butthead of a an entitled man who learns wisdom and self-awareness, and yet this one, I never liked the protag bc he spent almost the entire game being a selfish jerk.
-Abstergo moments were very underwhelming without your character having any kind of voice. Just let us pick a freaking gender and give them something. Super intense moments meant nothing when you just silently walk away from them without so much as a gasp.
-The metaness of Abstergo making games about the templars and assassins and revealing both orders to the world was absolutely not my vibe. It made everything feel really cheap.
-only the fanciest reward outfits had any purpose, the rest were all cosmetic, as were the art pieces, and the ships appearance. No effect on gameplay. Plus the fancy outfits didn't even have HOODS which all the animations include hoods, so he kept pulling up Nothing.
-There were just too many collectibles. I had ZERO interest in doing anything with them. just hundreds and hundreds of them, and they didn't MEan anything. What a waste of programming. :/
-Tutorials and explanations felt really drawn out, not showing up until way past the point where you already would've likely explored them or started doing the puzzles involved in them just bc they were on your minimap. 
-Rewards for completing challenges were pretty much useless. Multiplayer stuff and cheats that turn off game progression. Held Zero appeal to me.
-Inconsistencies with storylines and lore in the game. Plus half the black NPCs were voiced by white people Very Very obviously? You couldn't hire any black people to voice some NPC's?  [spoiler] Plus there was the part where they put a message on the television in the bunkers saying to look out for shaun and rebecca....with pictures...while shaun is WORKING in the lobby. and when they board the ship with slaves and edward and vane get stranded they use THAT ship. so where the hell did all the slaves go?[/spoiler]. 
-In the freedom cry dlc, my freaking machete didn't make noise. Just the machete. Bizarre glitch, for the character's MAIN weapon, thank u ubisoft.

Summary: Interesting, not a bad game at all, recommend for people who like the series and who are cool with ship battles and stuff, but still definitely has its flaws.

Dated as in the hand-to-hand combat is utterly trivial if you know where your E and Left Mouse Buttons are located and the parkour is... adequate, if somewhat janky, difficult to control, and imprecise, at times. Definitely less polished than some of the more recent games (I.E. Unity and Syndicate). The graphics, however, hold up pretty well, even eight years later.
The ship boarding is really fun and a good way to get money.
The story is pretty good, and Edward is a great protagonist. He goes through a great deal of character growth, which is always nice to see.
The Community Challenges are no longer active, so it is, as far as I'm aware, impossible to get one outfit (Explorer), one set of pistols and swords (Captain's Wheellock Pistols and Persian Scimitars respectively), and a few appearance items for the Jackdaw, but neither of the weapons have advantages over anything you can get normally, and while I do really like the Explorer outfit, I guess I can live without it... not that I have much of a choice there :/
It used to be that if you bought the Gold Edition, you wouldn't get Adewale's game, Freedom Cry, but that seems to have been ""fixed"", since it isn't said that Freedom Cry is included in that pack anymore. Whatever works, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Overall, my favorite AC game, though my perspective might be slightly stilted because it's, I think, the first Assassin's Creed I played to completion, and I don't care for the newer RPG-style games.
I reckon it's the best mix of modern enough to not feel extremely clunky, while not being an MMO.

The open world is vast and filled with plenty of things to do, from naval battles to treasure hunting and much more. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth and engaging.

However, there is one major flaw that really stands out for me: the complete lack of Somali pirates in the game. As someone who is interested in the history of piracy, I was disappointed to see that such a significant group of pirates was completely absent from the game.

Somali pirates have been active in the waters off the coast of East Africa for centuries, and they have played a major role in shaping the history of piracy in the region. It's a shame that they were not included in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, as it would have added another layer of depth and authenticity to the game.

See, Caroline didn't care about having a fortune, she just wanted to live a happy life with Edward, but Edward didn't see it as living happily with nothing, instead he hates living poor, and not having funds enough to actually feel as if he's got something good.  

Edward was supposed to promise Caroline that he'd only be gone for a year, two at most, but Caroline asks him, more like needs him to, ""Promise"", only a year, PROMISE!  Edward from that point forwards didn't exactly promise, he just starred with nothing to say.  Later Edward would be found sailing the high sea's, but he's caught in a battle between Ships, his men are dying, everything is falling apart.  An Assassin by the name of, ""Duncan Walpole"", infiltrates Edwards crew and kills the Captain, but before the Assassin could kill Edward, they're both knocked off the Ship and into the raging waters.  

Upon surviving the storm, Edward notices the Assassin is next to him alive as well.  The Assassin offers to pay Edward in hopes that he'll let him go, but Edward being a greedy Pirate, asks Duncan, ""You don't happen to have that coin on you now, do you?""  Duncan stands up with his gun pointed at Edward in hopes that he'll kill Edward, but Duncan has no bullets.  In a panic, Duncan throws his gun and runs.  

Edward chasing after Duncan, finally kills the Assassin and takes his clothing, and retrieves a letter from the Governor.  Edward takes up this letter and heads for the location the Assassin was heading, to collect Sir, Duncan's reward.

A few things I didn't like about Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, are the Tailing missions.  Gotta be honest, Ubisoft went WAY over board with these tailing missions, about every sequence had them.  Good gosh, so many tailing missions, I'm about to lose my mind!

Stealth and Combat were tedious, in a way you can say fighting Multiple enemies at once and your parry timing being slightly off, you'll get hit.  I've had a lot of times where I went to Parry, Edward wouldn't parry so I'd just die because the game decided NOT to give me a warning.  As for the Stealth, not easy when every enemy has eyes in the back of their head,  plus the snipers are annoying too.

Collecting useless items that has no use!  Seriously Ubisoft?  You really had to add pointless time wasters to your game to make it longer? Ugh!  No one wants to go around collecting pointless Animus Shards, or Sea Shanties, or even low money chests.

What I did like though, is the Story and the characters.  You get attached to James Kid aka Mary, and the entire crew.  It was sad to see them go, especially Thatch, he was a good one!

Ship Battles were very fun, which is probably the most liked thing about AC 4.

The very end once Edward is finished with all of his missions, Revenges, you see he has a flash back to his partners in crime, and the one at the very beginning you saved from the Soldier's, he was just a Humble Merchant, and yet he got caught up in Edwards ways and later you find out, not in the game, but somewhat in game, he died.

If you like Pirates and Sailing the high Sea's, get this.",1643745243,1672021779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a great time playing Assassin's Creed Black Flag! It's an oldie but a goodie! The story was engaging, the characters were entertaining, and the open world was huge and full of interesting activities. I especially enjoyed the parkour aspects of the game, as it made for some truly thrilling moments. Plus, there were plenty of side quests to keep me occupied.

My favorite part of the game was the stealth elements. Sneaking around, taking out targets without being detected, and using the environment to your advantage was a lot of fun. I also liked the combat system, which was challenging but not too difficult.

The graphics weren't the best, but they were still pretty good. The soundtrack was also great, and the voice acting was top-notch.

Overall, Assassin's Creed Black Flag was a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an ""old-school"" open world adventure.",1671939898,1671939898,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It’s a smart, sprawling sequel that’s very free and fun while trimming most of the fat that bogged down Assassin’s Creed III’s ambitious but uneven adventure.
Sailing across the massive expanse of The Caribbean, exploring gorgeous and unique islands, and getting yourself into all sorts of swashbuckling trouble provide some of the most rewarding and memorable stretches of gameplay I’ve experienced all year. Even after putting in more hours well after finishing the story, I’m still discovering new islands to explore and tombs to raid.
Tropical locales and the amazing water effects on the open seas. Minimal loading and maximum draw distances that seem to go on for miles. The way the camera zooms out when your ship reaches its maximum speed, and the sunset turning blood-orange, is simply amazing. 

Black Flag learns from AC 3’s initial 10 hours of banal hand-holding by immediately throwing you into the action. After a lean and exhilarating opening mission that places you in the blood-soaked boots of Connor’s much livelier and more likable grandfather Edward Kenway, the world blossoms and allows you to explore its vast uncharted waters. The size of the world is staggering, and the fact that it's absolutely brimming with fun and rewarding activities made me want to get lost as possible as I traveled from point A to point B.
When you ignore the main mission prompt and simply set out in search of your own fun, Black Flag is at its best. It treats you like an adult, and allows you to explore its gorgeous and activity-filled world to your heart’s content. Want to discover every nook and cranny of Kingston’s sprawling expanse in search of Templar secrets? Or would you rather buy a small fishing boat and hunt for all manner of deadly sea creatures, using your spoils to upgrade your character? Maybe you just want to sail to a remote island, climb to the top of a mountain, and gaze in awe at the world around you. Black Flag is all about embracing freedom and carving your own path through the world.

Also, the world’s vast scope invites a handful of hiccups. For instance, the body of a guard who’s holding a necessary key might disappear if you leave the area, meaning that you have to restart a mission. Black Flag is peppered with these sorts of annoyances, and though they certainly aren't deal-breakers, they had a tendency to pull me out of the experience a bit too often.
Ubisoft wisely avoids the morose spaghetti bowl that Assassin’s Creed’s plot lines have become in favor of a much lighter tale that embraces the adventuresome spirit of classic pirate stories. I loved the fact that Edward is so unlike his Assassin relatives, and much more interested in the pursuit of money than the opaque goals of some secret cabal. It's a refreshing change of pace from a series that in 2013 had started to take itself a bit too seriously.

Black Flag also tends to repeat some of the Assassin's Creed series’ favorite mistakes, like forcing you to tail a prospective victim at a safe distance for minutes on end while you’re given an exposition dump. It’s mighty annoying that I had to spend 10 minutes listening to rarely memorable dialogue before I could make the kill.

I would like to talk about the story in every detail, but I must restrain myself from spoiling it. Unfortunately the story is just too good to explain to somebody who hasn't played the game, so I urge everyone to experience it for themselves.

TL;DR: 
No Doubt is the best Assassins Creed game, and one of my favorite games overall.

Black Flag is the best pirate game next to Atlas hands down. 

The ground combat, ship battles, stealth and parkour all mix together very well. 

For the most part the historical events are still accurate much like the previous ones with a few liberties. 

It's worth getting if you never played since you get absolutely all content for a cheap price. 

You still need to worry about the stupid launcher though. The only reason I won't buy any Ubisoft games.

The Good: 
Playing as a self-serving pirate that gets caught up in affairs bigger than himself was an enjoyable introduction to the wider story of Assassin’s Creed. The pirate simulator portion of the game is really fun and IMO the best reason to consider playing it. The score is excellent, the in-universe music is lively, and the shanties are catchy. The polished visuals have aged well and really sell the Caribbean experience. 

The Meh:
The good parts of the open world overstay their welcome by the end due to Ubisoft’s signature runtime padding with copy-pasted content and pointless collectibles. Most rewards, while cool, don’t feel worth it by the time you get to them. 

The Egregious: 
Poor performance even on a modern card far exceeding the games recommended specs (due to forced double buffering compounding other poor decisions. This issue was trivially fixable). An artificial framerate cap of 60 that cannot be disabled through any means.  No widescreen support. Crashes on startup on Nvidia graphics cards. Poor support for mouse and keyboard: Menus are almost impossible to navigate, and the keybindings are nonsensical. The game essentially requires a controller or 3 hands to play. Controls are sluggish and have a mind of their own. Pressing a key when an enemy/object is highlighted often does nothing or interacts with something other than what is highlighted. This is annoying when trying to open a chest but a huge problem when you fail an assassination because of it. You don’t control Kenway as much as suggest a general course of action. You push in a direction and hold the parkour button, and the game decides what the character does. This makes precision jumping and movement impossible and leads to the feeling that success or failure in parkour sections is an RNG coin-toss instead of being based on player knowledge or skill. The stealth tailing missions in a boat that handles like… well a boat, are indeed atrocious. 

Sassy Creedo: Pirate Edition is a solid pirate simulator let down by shoddy controls that mar the gameplay and true incompetence in porting from consoles. On many occasions during my playthrough I almost didn't bother continuing, so take that as a warning.

However my biggest gripe, and why I have it a dislike, is that it has no cloud saves. I didn't realize this, and even though I do have almost 18 hrs on record, that was on a previous laptop which I don't have anymore. So all of that progress is lost. From what I understand, this is an easy thing to enable with Steam which Ubisoft just chooses not to do for some reason. Plus, even if they do want do to that, why not have a cloud save system in their own crappy launcher to remedy it?

Anyway, the game is fun, but I can't give it a Like if I can't even finish the game as I don't want to put 18 hours into it AGAIN, plus the time it would take to finish it.",1671217705,1671217705,False,2,0,0.5009041428565979,0,True,False,False

This is proper Ubisoft trash we can expect it seems, they don't just ruin games still to be made but even existing ones that were gems amongst all of them.

EDIT: After some digging I found out that the devs actually respond to these negative reviews and link a thread that has existed since July. That means that this issue has existed for half a year and somehow no progress is made, there has not been an update for almost that long as well. What's the point of linking people to a thread that does not get updates and only showing how long this issue has existed?

The reason for me not recommending the game itself is because of Ubisoft. I saw another review on here where a player's save data was lost and people were bashing them for a negative review. Same thing happened to me and it's Ubisoft's fault, but I decided I got a clean slate to play it through again. Except that now I can't play the game. Shortly into the game there's a required mission to access your fleet which requires connection to Uplay, unfortunately the game doesn't connect and you cannot progress past that mission. This has been a problem since at least September and all of the official replies in the forums have been ""we're currently looking into it"". 

Again I love the game, but it's too broken and Ubisoft doesn't seem to care to actually fix it. And if someone bashes saying that if I love the game I should recommend it, I'm not going to recommend a game that you can't get your money's worth because it's broken.

Pirate's Creed = refreshing and fun 
Assassin’s Creed = stagnant and boring 

By the third Ezio game I was suffering AssCreed fatigue and I quickly gave up on it. I’d played the two previous games in fairly quick succession but the similarities in Revelations were glaringly obvious by that point and I just couldn’t bring myself to continue. Even the lure of the wonderful architecture and the likeable protagonist couldn’t draw me back to yet another game with repetitive side missions, numerous pointless collectables and stylish but shallow combat. 

Also, tailing missions. Fuck tailing missions.

AssCreed III never really appealed to me because of the historical setting and I only played a little of it. That game had a dull protagonist and a dull setting; with the architecture of 18th century America not matching up to what Europe had to offer at the time. This diluted the parkour, the one gameplay mechanic that might have kept me playing for longer.

This is all a big preamble to me saying that Assassin’s Creed IV bought some of the fun back to the franchise for me, by making pirate ships a new core mechanic. The sailing and naval combat are a big part of the game and it’s good, arcadey fun. It also helps that the protagonist is fairly likeable, in a roguish kind of way (ala Ezio). 

Anything outside of the ‘being a pirate’ stuff is the same old Ass Creed (worse in some cases) and it gets boring quickly, but the piracy setting and gameplay additions are enough for a recommendation.

On a final note, fuck U Uplay.",1498471330,1670171699,True,36,2,0.726984500885009766,0,True,False,False

Having loved the naval battles in AC3, I enjoyed the way this new system was explored. I was curious to know about the connection between Haytham and his father, Edward, the main character of this game, but unfortunately I had to wait until the very end so I could find some easter-egg-esque mention of the two of them together. Hopefully, future games expand on this. As the first main-series game after the ""Desmond Trilogy"", one can see that the direction Ubisoft is taking with future games seems to be a good one, and this game reflects the vision that Ubisoft wishes to work towards of trying to incorporate a higher degree of multiplayer-esque gameplay, with UPlay, based gameplay features. 

The visuals, characters, and world-building were spectacular, as were the set pieces throughout the story. The story felt a bit rushed at the end but it also did a very good job of providing some much-needed exposition into the modern-day conflict between the Assassins and Templars, albeit in a very armchair-viewer sort of way. However, the introduction of new variables from the First Civilisation into the mix seems to spice up the possibilities future games could explore. The music was top notch as usual, perfectly reflecting the vibe of the pirate's life, and the sea shanties are the best part about this all that I absolutely adore. I could sail for miles with the rush of the sea and the sound of sea shanties in my ears.

While I'm not sure about the value of its replayability, aside from post-game cruising over the waves, this is a game that I will definitely recommend for those that have been introduced to the ""new"" AC games and wishing to play the precursors, or ""The Ones That Came Before"".

I love that I dont have to go to you tube for help on what to do and how to get somewhere or into a vital building for example.
that is so frustrating in most of the AC games as of late. just too complicated and lacking sensible story lines that just dont give the immersion gamers over the age of 5  are looking for.

it is my greatest wish that this one gets a ""Remaster"" for graphics, although the environment still holds its own for the next gen games, the characters could really use that update it would be a nice addition but not a game breaker at all.

|The acting and voice overs are some of the best in the series, the controls can be slightly off at times like jumping on to walls or things you dont want to or visa versa but again just a light aggravation from time to time.
 I started Vahalla, great graphics great facial animation, but I find myself coming back to older AC games and this one is the best by far, when one takes the story, gameplay and the freedom of variety of things to do throughout the game.

The same if you like pirates A LOT; then you most likely will enjoy this game, since it's pretty much 50% pirate shenanigans, 30% assassin/stealth stuff, and 20% weird sci-fi stuff. Yeah, it's a pretty weird combo, but that's part of its charm.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1669592367,1669592367,True,4,2,0.459020644426345825,0,True,False,False

I started with Sid Meier's Pirates! ages ago, played it a ton, after that I played many others, like Cutthroats, Seadogs, PoTC etc. Oh boy is sailing and taking down ships fun in this game! The attention to detail, how your first mate watches the sails, the singing of the crew, the motion of the ocean. It's not Sailing simulator 2000, but it's great fun. 
This was my first Assassin's Creed game, so I was unfamiliar with the mechanics and the backstory. The assassin's mechanics, well, they are not for me. I somewhat got the hang of it, but it did lead to many frustrating moments. When I wanted to do something and my pirate decided to do something else.
This happened a lot, perhaps I'm just bad. That's fine.

So, the sailing is great fun, ship battles are as well, boarding, shooting and manoeuvring, well done really. The rest of the game though. It's basically collecting a lot of things, chests, collectibles you can put on display in your hideout and upgrading. The upgrades you do need. As far as the rest goes, it depends on  how much you enjoy doing that kind of thing. For me the novelty quickly wore off. Once you get the mission table unlocked you can send ships to do missions that give you way better cash than any chest will give.

The main story is very straightforward, cliche and Hollywood inspired. The main protagonist doesn't have a lot of backstory and I never really cared much for him. I guess this is not a story driven game, that's fine. Just don't expect too much of the story.
If you love sailing and plundering, this game is definately worth a try. Other than that it's mostly collecting stuff. There are other side activities but they don't feel very rewarding or interesting. They mostly revolve around killing certain targets for rewards. There is no added value beyond that. 

I had a great time, mostly because of my love for the pirate theme, other than that, don't expect too much. I'd say a 7 out of 10.",1669513251,1669513251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So after purchasing the game on sale I must say: Whether it be full price or not. This game is worth it!

The story, the characters, the places and ship to ship battles are all sooo good! With that said, it's batshit bonkers that Skull & Bones can't simply follow this formula! Instead of following this formula, Ubisoft in their wisdom decided to do a Sea of Thieves clone but waayyyy more boring. But that's not what I'm here to discuss. 

The only two things I can say negatively about the game is the ""Modern Setting"" it's just sooo boring and nothing really exciting happens. In addition there is a lot of technical issues at the tail end of the game that I encountered so be aware at all times.

Other than that - the gameplay is the same as was seen in the first AC game, the Ezio trilogy, AC III, etc. As a reminder this is not the fluid traversing assassin's creed games we see today it's all set on where to climb, how to kill, etc. There's no real freedom in movement or combat; so it's stiff and boy it shows if you play Valhalla, Origins, Odyssey, Unity, Syndicate and then go back and play the older titles the two sets are night and day. 

If you can bare with the older gameplay mechanics, the story is worth it and definitely a great AC game in that generation of AC games.",1669353186,1669353186,True,3,0,0.548543691635131836,0,True,False,False

I actually only recently finished this after a many year hiatus due to these problems. I also just lost interest in AC. Later iterations have revealed how limited Black Flag's parkour and stealth systems are, and Edward Kenway feels sluggish to control. Ezio and Arnault feel more nimble by comparison and unity introducing a dedicated crouch mechanic makes stealth much more fluid and dynamic feeling.

The game is at its best when upgrading the ship and presenting you with the freedom to roam the high seas, upgrade your Jackdaw and explore the islands. Its stealth is subpar for the series; I find AC2, Brotherhood, Revelations and Unity have more fluid movement that doesn't feel as cumbersome to wield. Unity made the right call with having free run up and down options rather than bound to a single button, as I am constantly finding in Black Flag trying to hop down a short jump somewhat awkward as you make a totally unnecessary leap off a 2 foot tall box. 

This game has a monstrous amount of tailing missions and it gets repetitive, especially when it's not always clear what the prescribed pathway should be and some missions I had to resolve through trial and error. It's not difficult, per se, but having to reload and learn from your mistakes like that in a game that is narrative focused kind of kills the momentum; I ended up rage quitting for quite some time because I hate redoing things. The AC series in general suffers from a paradox between the freedom an option world purportedly presents, while the missions are jarringly linear in the sense that the game doesn't really want you to experiment in many instances. The later games resolve this, but aren't without their flaws either.

I do prefer the newer hitbox combat from Origins onward, because the older games tend to feel like glorified quicktime events. I've never really cared about feeling overpowered or underpowered. Ubisoft games predicate themselves as power fantasies anyways. As long as it feels fun, its fine. The berserk darts are so overpowered but it's kind of hilarious. Same with the smoke bombs which let you chain a million kills together.

I'm not enamored by Black Flag like so many else. It lives and breathes by its naval gameplay. You know a system is good when you can lose almost a whole night of sleep just derping around with the system, similar to the parkour of Unity or Dying Light 2, where the joy of movement and traversal is enough to keep you playing. The naval combat is challenging but fun. Your ship turns slowly especially depending on the winds, and there are some fortresses you assault while trying to battle rogue waves as well; it's not too overdone and having the option to upgrade your boat gives the system some flexibility. I didn't find the naval stuff unfair except maybe one instance where there were 4 twisters that somehow magically magnetized themselves to my ship while I was attacking a fortress.

Remove the naval gameplay and the AC portion of the game is rather underwhelming. Someone did a reddit post tallying up which games had the most tailing missions and Black Flag was near the top of the pack.

This version of Black Flag is bound to 60 fps as well. Ironically, Unity gets better performance than this and the tendency for visual assets to just pop in break the immersion a bit.

The FOV is way too close to Edward. I feel like Ezio's was zoomed out a bit more so visibility can be an issue. Another camera problem is the way it resets whenever you disable an alarm bell or pick up a body; it's jarring to have the camera suddenly reset for these scripted animations. These things do not break the game or make it difficult per se, but they make it less fun to play.",1668731306,1668731306,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

No doubt, Black Flag has a lot to offer new and old audiences, but I do feel that its age is finally catching up to it. And by that, I mean Ubisoft would rather kill off older games than maintain people's ability to play them.

While not on the list *yet*, it would appear this will be a recurring procedure that will eventually take down gamers' ability to use many features. Features like link cross-accounts/platforms and online play will no longer be possible, nor will players be able to access *ANY* DLC for the game - regardless if you've already paid for it or not.

Eventually, this game will crumble on PC until Ubisoft decides to HD remaster it and will again milk all those wanting to play it again.

Outside of this, the game has still aged to a point where it's lost its shine. My primary complaint is that having jumped into it so late, much of what made this game special has already been employed in so many other games. The pirating ship portions are still pretty unique, but they already felt shallow and too on the rails. The campaign and missions play just like any of the previous AC games and fail to offer anything new outside of pirating - which is a fun, but limited experience only truly enjoyed outside of the restrictions of the campaign.

What it does offer is a fun backdrop and setting in which you can play an Assassin's Creed game in. Not being a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series, this is the most fun I've had in one. That all said, what does it really matter if the publisher/developer is trashing the game anyway?

Story is very good. Edward is one of my favourite main. This game focus on pirates. Assassin is not primary.  The missions are almost non-repetitive and less boring. Even side quests. In Unity there are countless repetitive, boring and unnecessary tasks. 

In game system:
- Edward is not wanted, only Jackdaw is. 
- The naval battle is very interesting, especially the legendary ship. 
-  Very powerful gun and one shot any enemy (except 1 boss need to shoot 3 times but i can use 4 shots per reload xD). 
- Whale hunting and treasure maps are fun.

Limit:
- Many missions still make it difficult for players and often error like sequence 10 memory 1. I only got 99% sync because of it -_-.
- Edward sword dance is very beautiful but dame is very small and takes a lot of time to kill the enemy.
- Kenney fleet is poor and very slow. I think it is necessary to reduce the time of missions by 1/2 or 1/3.
- The villain is very weak and has been caught by edward many times. The last mission is very easy, the boss is almost waiting for you to kill.
- If you don't listen to English well, many missions you don't have time to read sub because you have to move to eavesdrop in a very narrow circle and many guards. I missed some interesting conversation.

The original was alright (for it's time) and AC2 and Brotherhood were great improvements on the formula by correcting mistakes and expanding the gameplay. AC3 was confusing and boring for the most part so getting Black Flag seemed like a gamble at first.

Fortunately Black Flag is fantastic!
A pirate adventure that surprisingly doesn't portray everything on cliches with an almost ground to earth setting and inhabitants.

The story is enjoyable and sailing pirate ships while singing along to sea shanties is one of the best game experiences I've ever been apart of.

Everyone knows that Blackbeard's the best
There's nothing more to say
But I hear there's this new bloke around, by the name of Kenway
He's always hiding in his white hood with his girly hair and crap
But I'm still the baddest pirate around
'Cause I've got this treasure map

[HOOK]
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me
Yo ho, yo ho
Murderin' fools for free
[REPEAT]

They call me Eddie Kenway, man
I'm the scourge of the land and sea
Got flowing hair, some sharp-ass blades
And maybe a little scurvy

Don't got a stupid peg leg
Or a dumbass hook for a hand
But I'll shove my blowgun up your ass
If you mess with my pirate band

I'll grab my musket
And I bust it
Got lovely hair, you can't touch it

I steal maps
Don't give craps
Got pretty girls sittin' on my lap

[CHORUS]
'Cause I'm a pirate
Living my life all high on the seven seas
I'm a pirate
Getting bootie with the cuties 'cause I do what I please

Four guns I blast
Slash throats as I pass
Kissing those sexy wenches
Because I'm a freakin' pirate, dude
And the rest of ya'll are bitches

[HOOK x2]

Boarding your ship to pillage and kill
Don't even need it I just love to steal
All the ladies love me 'cause I'm a big pimp
Hope the don't smell me 'cause I stink like ship

Eating oranges to prevent scurvy
Dammit now it's gonna hurt when I pee
You can never blame me for grabbin' your chick
'Cause most my life's surrounded be dick

I'll grab my musket
And I bust it
Got a badass beard
You can't touch it

I steal maps
Don't give craps
Got pretty girls
And I'm sitting on their laps

Well, I guess it's time for the two of us to brawl
Time to settle who's the baddest pirate once and for freakin' all

I wake up ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Don't give a fuck ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Love to drink ('Cause I'm a pirate)
I stink ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Don't shower ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Make bitches cower ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Gettin' booty ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Takin' doodies ('Cause I'm a pirate)
Eat rotten beef ('Cause I'm a pirate)

I cannot recommend this game on PC purely because of random FPS drops and freezing issues. It took me 4 hours (yes my game time), to find a setting that wasn't causing the picture to freeze for 30 seconds every 5 minutes or so, no matter what graphics settings I chose in game, the frames also drop from 60 to anywhere down to 29 for no apparent reason. Seriously no reason, if I cap the FPS to 30 however I STILL experience an annoying fps drops (anywhere from 11-30 fps). It makes no sense. 

I should be able to run the game on max settings. Tinkering with the nvidia control panel settings helped stop the random freezes and made the frame rate a little bit more stable and smoother, giving me 40+ to 60 FPS, now I just have to put up with a little screen tearing, which isn't actually that bad or frequent. 

I would not recommend playing this or any other Assassin's Creed on PC. If you want to play any Assassin's Creed I would recommend investing in a current gen console. 

Syndicate also had an abominable FPS drop of sometimes 40+ frames on any settings, even if I force the FPS to stay at 30 or 60, again I get consistent drops, the only upside of that game was that it didn't freeze up for 30 seconds every few minutes.

Edited because of developer response: You really think I tried none of those in the four hours of trying to get it to be playable? I tried everything. There was nothing running in the background (since I don't leave any running while gaming) and I tried every compatibility mode available to me.",1595431754,1665562692,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Comment:[/b]
Far less of an assassin game, more of a pirate game. Stealth is needed much much less here, except for some mission contraints. That is good for people who wanted more of an action game. Inspiration comes from the naval missions in AC3 and this is basically the core gameplay element for AC4. However, unlike AC3, this game is a sunny with a vast world to explore. You have a hideout too but I barely ever went there, your ship is your real home. Right from the start you can pickup collectibles, loot chests and do side missions. Each of these tasks is neatly accounted for in the stats and visible for each area. This makes picking up all the stuff really seemless and that is a big plus. Checklists are still present but under a really neat UI. They are also varied enough to not feel repetitive. That is except for boarding ships due to the unskippable cutscenes. You can fast travel in both the world map and the town/island map (viewpoints are used here). However, ship travel is just so much fun I rarely ever used the world map to fast travel. This time around you are not a good guy, not really, you are an opportunistic pirate that murders all the time. And it works, there is no need to save lives and Edward Kenway is still likeable in his own way. The story is great and I got plunged into the world easily and for a long time. It is a shame that a lot of the ""current world"" story is hidden behind bad hacking mini-games. They are not hard, just annoying and they waste time. These could easily just have been skipped and the lore given to the player right away. And not only that, after finishing the game I was left with a 32/33 counter (got all the files though). Turns out it can bug out if you do these during the sequences, so just do them all AFTER you finish the campaign. For multiplayer I can say it stays the same as in AC3 - it's mostly not good. Wolfpack is somewhat fun, and they also added Infection and Chest defense into it, but while the former is okay the latter is terrible. General multiplayer is just waiting in queues and overall not much fun anyway. Ubisoft was dishing out various editions and DLC ever since they made uPlay but this time around you need a chart to know what you have and want. You see some nitpicking but that is because the game is fantastic so it is easier to find the little things that could be better. So don't get discouraged by the flaws, they are minor and I really had a blast playing this game while time just flew by. The epic feeling of hard naval battles is something I have not experienced in any other game yet. Definitely recommended!

When it comes to Assassin's Creed, so far I’ve really only played through the first game in the series way back in 2008 on the PS Triple. The gameplay was pretty average, a lot of runny, jumpy, stabby actions. I remember hating that storywise everything ended up just being inside some sort of simulation, instead of you actually being in whatever world your adventure takes place in. I was also disappointed that Assassin's Creed Man looked so cool in his assassin gear, but when you returned to the real world you just looked like Adam Sandler in a hoodie. 

XBOX Live Games With Gold has thrown several more Assassin’s Creed games my way over the years, but I could only ever bring myself to play any of them for 20 minutes before flaking out. The gameplay appeared to be the exact same in every game, however the 2D Assassin’s Creed games played differently and those games were pretty decent.

I honestly am not sure who is buying these yearly Assassin’s Creed releases. I imagine they are the type of people who’s idea of a good time is watching Late Night with Seth Meyers with a large glass of lukewarm fluoride filled tap water, and laughing at every single punchline. In fact, if you are a woman visiting your date’s house for the first time, and they have a bookshelf with every single Assassin’s Creed game on it, RUN……run for your life, your odds of being turned into a skin suit are great.

[h1]I JUST WANT TO BE A PIRATE[/h1]

The reason I got this game wasn’t for the standard Assassin’s Creed runny, jumpy, stabby gameplay, but it was to get lost inside of a world where I get to be a pirate, and it does a pretty good job of that. Graphically the game looks great, the world is very beautiful to look at as you sail your ship through the crystal blue seas from island to island. It sounds great too, your crew will play instruments and sing sea shanties which help even more to make it feel like you’re a real pirate. I also had a blast (pun intended) exchanging cannon fire with enemy ships, and then when the time was right, boarding and taking it over.

[h1]PROS[/h1]

-Atmosphere.
-Graphics.
-Sound.
-Sea battles.

[h1]CONS[/h1]

-Have to log into a Ubisoft account every time you start up the game.
-The Assassin’s Creedness of it all can be tiresome at times.

The golden age of piracy is an interesting period of time to visit and interact with the likes of famous characters of the time like Ben Hornigold, Woods Rogers, Charles Vane, Black beard, and all the historical figures. If we are to rate the AC games based on the historic period, black flag is the least interesting of them all, the 3rd crusade and the American Revolutionary War are way richer and more exciting to explore.

What makes AC4 the best AC game is fun, is the most fun game in the franchise ever. You get to do tons of stuff in this open world and there is polish and details everywhere. Some reviews stated that they didn't like the main missions or the main story but for me, it was exciting: Dropping in the middle of the Templar plot and sabotaging their plans, and finding out about the assassins and the secrets that the Caribbean islands hold was a nice trip.

This game, is the best in the franchise. It's also, one of the best game's I have ever played, it has intense combat that requires cunning and quick reactions, a small selection of swords that feel good for 3 different kinds of play. The mashing of Attack and Parry is one of the best mechanics this game has to offer. The gun play is beautiful, and the stealth is masterfully done. The parkour is quick, functional and very cinematic. The exploration of different areas and finding the Mayan Stelaes and treasure is a grand treat that we have gotten to enjoy. 

I have played this game to 100%, and I say it was well worth the 66 hours I've played. You can bet that I will end up playing it again too, just like how I have when I was a kid on Xbox.

This game features the best character development and story out of any other Assassin's Creed game, Edward Kenway starts out as a greedy pirate, having wants of a better life for him and his wife Caroline. So he joins a Privateer gig, and eventually becomes a pirate.

The selling point of this game for me is Edward Kenway's Evolution from Selfish, Egotistical and Cold heartedness, all the way to Empathic, Understanding of the damage he has done, Caring and even a Father. 
This game is truly a masterpiece, the influence the Assassin's and Mary have on Edward's development, watching the death of Blackbeard, and even being forced to kill off one of his own friends, Rackham tore down the hard man we once knew, and began the reconstruction of a man that is more emotionally vulnerable and aware.

The character interactions are beautiful to watch, and the ending scene was the single, most beautiful scene in video game history, the single most perfect Epilogue that helps Edward and Us, Reminisce and understand the moral and theme of the story, which was love and freedom.",1664642969,1664642969,True,2,0,0.499387979507446289,0,True,False,False

There is no doubt this is one of the most memorable and beloved entries into the series. It is by no accident, Ship to ship combat on the open seas, looting and plundering, sea shanties, it succeeds in being a great pirate game.
However upon a recent replay I've realized that it is lacking in being an Assassin's Creed Game. The story is average compared to other entries. Not that all entries had the best narratives, but this entry doesn't really explore deep themes and concepts that the series has been known to have. The story is about a man who learns to fight for something bigger than himself. It's a real shame because there are interesting ideas and strong subjects in the game, but the game doesn't go beyond these things being just setting/background/etc.

That being said, it's still a fun game worth playing, but it is important to understand that it's a pirate game before it's an Assassin's Creed Game.",1664342321,1664342321,True,1,0,0.515050172805786133,0,True,False,False

There's the exploration, obviously, discovering new lands and giving smallpox to the natives, but more than that, I think it's that it welcomes loneliness. You're away from the pressures of society and the potential benefits of community, but it's okay because there's meaning in it. Travelling, exploring, murdering, pillaging or kidnapping, it's okay to relax, enjoy it and watch the hours glide by because you're doing it for a reason. And because you're sharing in the feeling with your crew. Even celebrating it.

This is what I love the most about Black Flag. Everything about the sailing is perfectly designed to revel in these qualities. 

Firstly, you're in the Caribbean, which is beautifully rendered with vegetation and castles and strongholds of the time - very pretty to look at. Secondly, there's no soundtrack while you're out of combat, only sea shanties sung by your crew (which, of course, slap). The creak and list of the ship, the lapping waves, the sails rippling in the wind, it's an almost sensory experience. 

And of course, being a pirate, spotting juicy merchant or British navy ships ripe for the pillaging injects a steady stream of action between the objectives of travelling across the Caribbean. Without cutscenes, pursuits transition naturally from spotting to pursuing to attacking to boarding to Batman-Arkham-stabbing and counter-stabbing your way through the crew. The ship-to-ship combat is really satisfying. Seeing the trajectory of the cannons before you shoot, then every damn cannonball hit home, the giant chunks torn out of the healthbar - the contrast between that and maneuvering to protect yourself in more intense combat makes your focus swing back and forth in a very holistic way. As for boarding, the game provides a lot of variety to make yourself feel cool when you do it. Maybe you can run across a fallen mast, maybe you can swing across on a loose rope, jump from one railing to another, OR climb all the way up the rigging, jump across to the top of the other ship's sail, kill the chap in the crow's nest and then jump-stab the captain from 10 metres up. In some missions, this also translates to stealth for even more variety. 

And you want to take all these missions, too, side-quests and all. Upgrades for the Jackdaw, your ship, are both expensive and useful. The different resources needed - money, leather, sugar, crew, etc. - also mean you have to pick your targets a bit more carefully. An extra bit of thought makes it much more engaging. One little thing I appreciate about this is that there's a hard cap on the amount of resources you can have at one time, which ensures that there's a nice flow of pillaging and returning to port for upgrades. Essentially you can't mindlessly grind until combat loses its lustre. 

So all of this is enough to make the game worth getting, but I must talk about the bad stuff. Firstly, the game does that narrative in the present day-thing that gleefully wastes your time before you can get to the sailing. It's mostly out of obligation, though, the Assassin/Templar thing is mostly ignored so that you can interact with historical figures like Blackbeard and Bart Roberts in a historical sight-seeing tour. It's a bit trite, but it's fun for what it is. 

Also, tailing missions. Fuck tailing missions, man, all my homies hate tailing missions. Let's grind our freeform pirate adventure all about disobeying the rules to a halt and have the player meekly follow instructions that don't incooperate the open world at all. Pretty as the settlements are, the quests there aren't particularly great. But you have to stop to get new shanties.

None of this is a dealbreaker, though, especially if you don't frequent Assassin's creed games. I certainly don't. Buy it. Play it. Have fun.",1663545851,1663545851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best pirate game I have ever played.. Not an Exaggeration.. EVER PLAYED.

Here is my unbiased review:

Story - I loved the story of how Edward Kenway (the main protagonist), was a privateer first, then he turns into a pirate and then he becomes one with the brotherhood of Assassin's.  NOTHING ELSE IS WORTH SAYING BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA SPOIL IT.  The story is really well paced, some pretty sick moments got me like OHHHHHHHHHHHH YEA and if any story pulls those moments out well, then yes yes yes I recommend playing it.

Gameplay - Assassin's Creed Shenanigans.. Hide in a bush kill some dude tail a dude blah blah blah you know the drill. What's interesting is that the mechanics have kinda changed coz in the previous games you couldn't crouch. In this game, they made it so u can crouch.......only in waist high bushes or grasses. Yea that's fun right? XD BUT WAIT! NAVAL F&KING COMBAT!!! YES PLEASE! IT WAS SO DAMN GOOD I LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT. 

AI - This game has some really really blind AI.. I can kill a guard like less than 5 ft away from their very eyes and they don't notice. Like DUDE! SERIOUSLY? I JUST KILLED UR FRIEND IN FRONT OF YOU XD. Anyways, coming to the detection ranges, the snipers have the most (duh) but they are so damn annoying coz 90% of the time, you just will be running on trees or rooftops coz that's easier. Stealth is pretty fun too, although the brutes or fat guards are just annoying.. Pro strat, save up, get the best pistols in the game and when you fight a brute, just shoot him once, he drops, and you stab him with the hidden blade. eZ kill.

Bugs - A few bugs which I can say existed. The first being, when boarding a ship, Edward would Glitch out and he would get stuck in an awkward position while holding the wheel. No button prompts can help. Just replay the last checkpoint. Edward constantly just not jumping for the tree branch which should be grab-able but he chooses to just not jump there no matter the controls. I have tested this out and he would grab it atleast 6/10 times. He would just get stuck on random objects but this was very rare.

Music - SEA SHANTIES? HELL YEA

Characters - Really really good and well made

Combat - Simple, Counter and kill (Hidden Blades OP) and if you have the type of ppl who block every attack, break defense and kill rinse and repeat. 

Final Verdict - 9/10 - AMAZING 

PLAY THIS GAME. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Good, but not great story, and pretty by the books combat, but the game really shines in its ship warfare, upgrades and side activities(mostly). This is basically a pirate sim but you have assassin blades so your a pirate assassin kinda. Theres a lot of piratey stuff to do in the world to keep you busy like hunting on land/sea, diving for treasure/ship upgrades, getting into bar fights, playing dice, looting hideouts. collecting sheet music for your crew to sing, upgrading your weapons, changing your ship and outfit decor etc. The negatives would be that its feels like a copy paste of 3's combat, and very little variety in combat tools. A few of the side activities, and almost all side quests feel like busy work, and most of the time you just dont care. Like i said though the main plot can hold you over and there are some touching scenes, well voice acted too. The main draw is really the seamless ship to ship, and boarding combat, taking down big ships and boarding them never gets old(until 50 or so hours in lol), and the dynamic weather can make ship battles even more intense, as you battle the seas and your foes. This is easily a masterpiece for its time(2013) and by far my favorite ubisoft game, of which i like very few lmao. 8/10 (Great game)",1663018078,1663018078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What the heck? Ok whatever the game is super high rated should be good eh? No. Two Words: Unskippable Cutscenes. My god, I just want to play the game as a pirate not take a 20 minute tour of Abstergo as a faceless animus operator. Fine, finally get control of the character again to be put in yet another unskippable battle tutorial that ends with 30+ guards chasing after me making me have to use 4 smoke bombs to finally escape (why the heck are they shooting at me over a fist fight?). Decide to do some free roam and check out the assassin contracts, make a good bit of money and buy a sword set for 6500. Realize after my purchase that I had a free set from apparently owning a DLC that was much better, so I restarted the game completely as 6500 seems like a lot to just waste so early and there's NO MANUAL SAVE FEATURE so whatever you do is permenant.  

Try my best to rush past all the starting stuff again and skip doing the contracts to just start the next mission where I have to follow behind two guards without being detected and this is where I quit the game and uninstalled it. I felt like I had zero control over my guy, he would just randomly latch onto walls even though I didn't tell him to, and when the guards started sprinting I hit shift to chase after, rounded a corner straight into a hidden lift and boom my guy goes flying up to the roof, try to get down but he's just so incapable of normal movement I'm stuck latching onto things even if I hit E to drop. Finally drop and he immediately dives into a hay stack even though I didn't tell him to and I fail the mission. I give AC: Odyssey a 10/10 as a brilliant game that I invested 200+ hours in having a blast, so I thought I'd go back and try the earlier games.

- Varied gameplay that doesn’t get stale thanks to a great number of different activities, each with its own pacing and features.

- Well-designed and surprisingly fun sailing / naval combat mechanics, that still manage to impress today.

- Most collectibles and side missions are worth doing: each has a unique final reward for 100% completion.

- Great amounts of interesting lore to discover in the form of messages, files and logs.
[/td]
[td]
- Underwhelming storyline encompassed by (mostly) mediocre characters and a narrative pace that feels rushed on many occasions.

- Flawed, low-challenge ground combat where Edward is always overpowered, and becomes even more so as you progress.

- Low variety of enemy archetypes: you’ll be fighting the same fodder most of the time; even notable targets feel generic, rarely have unique mechanics.

- Picking collectibles at sea is tremendously tedious due to the fact you have to manually stop, disembark, get them and go back on foot every single time.

[td]A decent entry in the AC franchise that has gameplay variety as its main strength, yet doesn’t shine as it could due to an underwhelming story and multiple design blunders.[/td]

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Premise & Setting[/h3]
Abstergo Industries, one of the world’s leading tech giants, developed a way to extract memories from DNA samples, then render them in a simulation. As their employee, you'll be tasked with peering into the past of Edward Kenway, and collecting as much material as possible to produce a new ‘interactive experience’...at least that’s the official version.

The vast majority of the action takes place in the 1700s Caribbean. After a ruinous shipwreck, Kenway encounters a mysterious man carrying a message with the promise of a grand reward from a local governor. Posing as the courier, Edward soon gets entangled in the millennia-long feud between Templars and Assassins, the former looking for a powerful device known as ‘The Observatory’.

Despite such an intriguing premise, the story of AC4 is rarely exciting. Most of the side characters around Edward, not to mention the man himself, simply prove bland most of the time. Events and discussions, be them pirate-y business or more esoteric ones, do not convey that feeling of mystery and excitement in a story about ‘lost technologies’ as this one should.

[h3]Exploration & Stealth[/h3]
While on foot, you’ll be able to freely move around the cities, forts and outposts, choosing what activities to pursue and being able to leave at any time, except during main missions. There’s a strong emphasis on parkour, free-climbing and using the verticality of locations to gain an edge. The world is peppered with collectibles, chests, upgrade plans and lore files that will contribute money and resources to your pirating efforts. The well-known ‘Ubisoft towers’ are of course present, revealing all points of interest in a large area after reaching their summit. Collecting these bits isn’t the most exciting activity, but is worthwhile and gives a needed break from the action.

Stealth in this AC entry isn’t as strongly-pushed as in some others. It’s the usual system that sees Edward use thick bushes or crowds to become undetectable from enemies, move bodies, and instantly kill any unaware foe thanks to the iconic concealed blades (or even unarmed if you want to go non-lethal). How does a random pirate know about secret Assassin techniques you ask? Beats me.

[h3]Ground & Naval Combat[/h3]
Combat on foot will put blades, guns and several gadgets at your disposal. Each blade set has different stats like damage, speed etc. but honestly this won’t matter much, and I saw no sensible difference between many. Guns work in the same way, but this time around the damage stat matters. Fights are melee-focused, with Edward being able to take on crowds of enemies that will mostly attack one at a time, and have some specific abilities depending on their class (Brutes, for instance, can counter-attack and throw grenades); ranged enemies are dangerous, but you can use nearby ones as a human shield if timed right.

The biggest flaws of combat in AC4 are how overpowered counters are, allowing you to remain unscathed as long as your timing is right, and how tremendously broken smoke bombs and guns result, allowing you to respectively stun all enemies in a large area or instantly kill anyone with a headshot (even bosses). These things aren’t even hard to come by, refills are common and cheap. It never felt, at any point, like it was a dangerous situation.

Naval combat will put you at the helm of the Jackdaw, outfitted with cannons, chain shots and explosive barrels to lay waste on your enemies. Other ships can be freely attacked and plundered, board them after inflicting enough damage to get 100% of their loot, or sink them for 50% - in both cases, that will be used as resources to upgrade your ship. Naval combat is fun, feels dynamic, and has a weather system with storms etc. that still can rival today’s titles. Boarded ships may also be captured and added to your personal fleet, used in a specific minigame.

[h3]Quests & Events[/h3]
Each city and outpost will always have a number of contracts to undertake, mostly assassination or naval expeditions with a variety of objectives, like escorting or destroying specific ships. There are also dynamic events, mostly at sea, such as storms that disable fast travel and spawn dangerous anomalies like tsunamis, royal convoys that house great riches but are well-guarded, or rare animals to hunt like the mythical White Whale. Legendary ships are the ultimate test of your seamanship, and you’ll need all the best upgrades to defeat them… only to receive a lot of money you won’t have a use for anymore.

[h3]Progression & Upgrades[/h3]
Progression in AC4 is represented by the quality of your gear, both on the Jackdaw and on Edward himself. As you rack up money and materials from pillaging, hunting, assassinating and looting you’ll afford better guns, improved machinery for your ship, and will be able to craft improvements with the pelts of hunted beasts that will extend your maximum health, inventory capacity or the effectiveness of some accessories. Some of these things may only be acquired after completing each ‘set’ of missions or collectibles, but are usually worth the effort as they bring special effects or perks that ‘normal’ gear doesn’t usually have.",1662741408,1662741534,True,28,1,0.732984364032745361,1,True,False,False

Перевод:

Очень многосторонни развитая игра, в которой можно  делать очень многое например  владеть собственным кораблем,  делать рейды на британские, и испанские конвои,  забирать у них добычу метал, сахар, древесину, ткани, и улучшать либо свой карабыль, либо флот.
В игре можно исследовать открытый мир, который  полн загадок, и тайн, племен Мая. Собирать камни с помощью которых можно открывать новые костюмы.
Есть собственное убежище, которое можно улучшать.
У героя появились новые собственные улучшения  оружия, и прочей амуниции, герой  может иметь до  четырех   мушкетов и две сабли, также имеется трубка с ядом, и снотворным  она открывается после прохождения  сюжетных миссий .
Сюжет игры классный,   но как по мне слишком затянут.
Музыка подходит к каждому фрагменту локаций,  иногда очень даже в тему .
В остальном игра  осталась прежней, множество контрактов на убийство, своя культура в данном случае пиратов, и сборы сундуков.

When I started playing it in 2013, I got so distracted by constant looting of ships along the way to the missions, and then multilayer, that I didn't finish the campaign and abandoned it some time later on one fourth of the way in. 
In 2022 I saw a video on YouTube about this game which reignited my interest, and, so I decided to buy it and finish the campaign. And so I did.
The campaign was mixed in the quality of storytelling and there were some high highs and low lows. Two times it actually made me feel genuinely sad for the characters, so there's that. The parts that I hated the most were when they were constantly pulling me out of the ""simulation"" and I had to walk around in an office building and hack into different things using repetitive methods designed for a three year old with development issues. Leave me alone, I wanna role play as a cool pirate-assassin, not an office plankton goddammit!
The gameplay is very repetitive and the difficulty is virtually nonexistent. Once you learn how to counter attacks, it gets very easy to destroy large groups of enemies even with your bare fists. A lot of times an enemy will just wait for you to stab his mate on the ground while having a perfect opportunity to slash you from behind. Stealth is optional and is implemented very poorly. Tailing missions, when you stalk someone while following them are the worst most gear grinding crap that I have ever encountered in a video game. Most side activities are also copy pasted, albeit in different locations. 
The exploration part is also very repetitive. The same goes for ship combat which was the most fun part of this game for me, but got increasingly bland and dull as I defeated all four legendary ships and upgraded mine to a maximum. I would say, if you want even a little bit of challenge in this game, do not buy health upgrades for Edward and only the first level upgrades for your ship. This will make the game more balanced and fun. 
Oh, and also Uplay. My external keyboard stopped working properly when I downloaded this trash software and I wasted a lot of time getting it to work every time I booted up my PC, until one day it just kinda fixed itself. I found a thread on the online forum where a lot of people experience the same problem and the only solution that Ubisoft gives is to ""upgrade your hardware so that it has USB 3"". How about you fix your hot trash of a software instead, ya bunch of lazy scallops. 
The best thing about this whole ordeal is my newly rediscovered love for sea shanties mateys!

Assassin’s Creed: IV Black Flag a wonderful pirate-themed game. If you are looking for games in the likeness of Сorsairs, then you will not find it here.
Because this is an action game with ships, here we upgrade a ship, a character, and rob convoys of ships. And Сorsairs is a simulator of ships in the first place.
I really liked the battles with the legendary ships. First of all, they are very difficult, but for loot it is worth defeating them.
The game is worthwhile, and will brighten up your everyday life.

This game is not recommended for players who hates repetitive shts, you'll just get bored.

After I collected all of the Mayan Stones, I finally acquired the Mayan Outfit. The thing is, the last piece can only be obtained during Sequence 10. Since it's almost the endgame, and I already did all the side quests and activities, the Mayan Outfit which could have been very useful in the early game is now useless. Would be better if they add New Game+ option just like Odyssey.

The rewards from completing the community challenges is unachievable, there's no active challenges anymore. Ubisoft should just give these rewards to players, especially for those who want to collect all of the outfits, pistols, swords, etc.

Just finished Freedom Cry and Aveline DLC. You can finish Freedom Cry in under 1-2hrs without doing the side activities while Aveline DLC is very short and you can finish it in under 30mins or less. Don't know much about Aveline, haven't finished AC Liberation yet.

The tropical setting of the Caribbean is graphically pleasing on the eye, with the water effects still holding up 9 years later. If you're not content with 30fps, it's rather easy to set it to 60. Simply go in to the Assassin4 file, change the refresh rate number to 63, then go into Nvidia control panel, and set the frame limit to 60. Make sure to turn Vysnc in game off, but on in control panel for zero tearing, without being locked to 30fps.

Honestly my recommendation is to just buy Origins or Odyssey. Both are vast improvements IMO. (They're also later in the series so I guess that's to be expected!)

Good: 
Graphics
Large open world

Bad:
Gameplay
Controls (seriously, why must 'E' be used for everything? Try to open a crate and the game thinks your hiding and whistles. Useful...)
Too many tail / follow missions
Too great an emphasis on stealth

Longer version:
This is where steam needs a 'meh' recommendation. The game isn't bad, so to mark it as not recommended is unfair, but at the same time I don't really feel it's a must have. The game has been in my library since 2017, and it's taken me 4 attempts to just get enthused enough to get through the intro / training missions.

The mission design is not overly creative I feel, and there is far too much emphasis on following / tailing and stealth than I care for. It's just not my play style. One could argue that it's a game about assassins, and fair point, but this isn't a simulator.

I've reached the mission where I need to locate James Kidd, and I'm not sure I'll progress further. The few attempts I've had at it so far I haven't enjoyed, I just find myself asking 'why?' Roaming the world instigating naval battles is genuinely the most fun part of the game for.

Don’t bother if you want to play on the Deck, you’ll need to enter your password EVERY SINGLE TIME you launch the game. Also requires you to be online to launch and Steam won’t refund it. I’ll be avoiding anything Ubisoft related going forward.

UPDATE: I'm changing my review a bit to add that it is possible to get into the settings of the Ubisoft launcher on the first run and change to offline mode. You have to get past the first login first. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game to do this.  This allows the launcher to at least bypass the login screen on the Steam Deck on every launch.

edit: Everything about this game is too good, The character development of Kenway was a nice flow to the story line. From being a pirate to a full on assassin, would definitely recommend if your starting out with the ac series as your starter. The game is long as most of many releases of ac games but enjoyable nonetheless.
