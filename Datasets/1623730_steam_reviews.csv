Devs should shout down official servers. The question is why they are not doing it? There is no single warning about hackers overtaking all official servers. It's obvious that devs are trying to pretend their game is working well, literally baiting new players to buy game without informing them that multiplayer WILL NOT WORK.

Why can't you build down a level? Why can you only build out a couple of spaces from a foundation, specifically when building stairs? Why can you build a slanted roof out further than stairs? Why can't you connect anything to a roof or stairs? Why can't you align things? Who designed and QA'd this and thought ""yeah, this is acceptable""?

So much has been copied from Ark, and even though that game's build and movement mechanics are not perfect, they are substantially better than this. How is this building and snapping mechanic so bad when a game such as Satisfactory exists?

For a game largely about base building and 100% about moving around, it feels pretty unplayable after a few hours - I don't even want to get into how slow and glitchy movement is...

I'll recommend this game because it is a fun game overall and obviously has potential, but the building and movement is honestly the worst of any survival-type game I've ever played.",1708856547,1708857213,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is a major issue for anyone who wants to play multiplayer but doesn't want to be limited to 4 players/wants to be able to turn off the game. Not only was the periodic save corruption not completely fixed, my old server save became corrupted and it seems like all of my save backups were incompatible. I now have to start my game from scratch. On top of this, it seems like the game is saved in a different format depending on the platform (linux, windows, etc.), so migrating my server to my desktop from my linux server is a no go. I like this game, its fun, I will probably restart at some point regardless of this issue, however I cannot recommend it anymore to new players due to the unmitigated technical issues at this point. Pocketpair has had enough time to fix the serious issues and they are moving very slowly.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
This game is really fun. It does a lot what Pokemon should have done a long time ago, and captures the market segment that Pokemon is missing (older demographic, PC players). If you've seen people complain about it being a ripoff or AI generated, ignore them, they don't know what they are talking about. Of course some of the creatures look similar to their Nintendo counterparts, and they definitely take inspiration from them, but its not plagiarism (and even if it was, I wouldn't really care, it would just be Pokemon on PC; somehow true fan games get a pass but this doesn't).

Anyway now that we got that out of the way, here are some of the things I love about the game:
- 111 monsters to catch, and mechanics to incentivise catching them more than once and actually seeking out their habitats
- Solid (albeit sometimes a little clunky) RPG combat system that integrates guns later in the tech tree
- Speaking of which--massive tech tree
- Difficulty is *very* configurable, so if you don't like drop rates, catch rates, etc. you can change them.
- Community servers (and dedicated server software has a native linux build)
- In-depth, but not ridiculously complicated crafting system
- Funny interactions between monsters

That being said, this *is* an early access game, and there are quite a few bugs to mention at the time of writing this:
- Many many graphical/physics glitches (almost all of them are minor/funny/not game breaking, although there is the occasional getting stuck in the floor; they have a manual respawn button for that)
- Sometimes very strange pathing of worker pals, and they can get stuck if you don't build your base to prevent it.
- Pals on servers that run 24/7 can and will get stuck while you're offline, causing them to not be able to eat and get depressed.
- MASSIVE memory leak on the dedicated server software, forces you to restart it every few hours
- Hostile pals forgetting how to attack (funny mostly)
- Really nasty bug where your save data can get deleted if the server does not shut down properly (I implemented my own periodic backup solution to prevent this from being an issue, if you plan on making a server you should absolutely do this)

There are definitely more that I missed, but those are the big ones I have noticed. Despite the bugs I think the game was money well spent, and am looking forward to changes the devs will make to improve the above issue and add more content to the game. My friends and I have been loving this game, and will for sure continue to play it.",1706035327,1708848051,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The game is smooth, works great, very optimized, low number of bugs, updates have been consistent to fix issues, and more. The pal designs are great (although I wish there was evolution types). The survival aspect and technology tree is immense, but needs more building pieces for sure. Tower bosses and world boss alphas are great. The game def need some more endgame bosses or raids to test our OP pals. Throw in some quests for rewards and that should turn up the fun and replay-ability. I would also love to see humans use pals to attack. The only one who does this right now is the pal merchant; i need more battles like that outside of towers. I'm sure more will come as some of this has already been announced on their road map.

The auto feeding bag helps manage food intake so you can pretty much ignore it for the most part, but still have to get food.

PALS
- Good range of Pals to work, ride, or fight with.
- A bit buggy in bases, you can also easily clip through the group/walls, but it is fun finding a good combination for what you need.
- Legendary Pals are fun to find and hunt, which is the only end-game really, but the real fun is finding their weakness and making sure your team is prepared for it.

BUILDING
- There is a lot to wish for here. It is fun to find a functional build, but honestly bigger Pals still get stuck regardless.
- Variety needs to be bigger.

Fighting
- Fun to find a good load out with guns/melee. Rocket launcher is just fun in the end-game.
- Progress of guns from makeshift to full automatic rifle is great. The damage variance is a bit low though, and could be more in line with the level difference.

Capturing
- Pal spheres go up tremendously, but the jump gets smaller and smaller toward the end. I believe the Legendary Spheres should be much higher than they are now. Small chances on level 50 Pals shouldn't happen. Honestly it should be closer to 50% on non-legendary.
- Capturing itself is fun and very addicting. The capture progress being 10 of each and being your primary way to level is fun as well.

Resources
- It's kind of boring to have ""best base location"" where there is only really one place that spawns the more important ores together at a decent rate.
- Most are buy-able in the end-game, but Pal Fluid is not, and that is a bit annoying. If I have 1 million of the currency and Pal Oil is the only thing I need, I should be able to buy it instead of spending an hour farming water types for it.

Mounts
- Most are fun, and it is fun to progress from the first ones to the later game ones.
- I hate that it takes up a Pal spot, because you breed one for specifically riding, and you don't use it in combat for the most part.
- I'll consider the glider Pals as mounts, as they also need to have a dedicated spot and not on your Pal team. The glider Pals are also fun to mess around with, and find one you like.

Breeding
- Fun as long as your hatch time isn't super long.
- Finding the right temperature for the type you want is cool, but having to have a dedicated Pal to head/cool a large amount is a bit of a pain. If it uses electricity it should be Pal-less.

There is a lot more to this game, and it is extremely fun. Sure you can say ""it's a Pokemon knockoff"", but that is mostly only the Pal/capture system you can say that on. The other systems you use are a huge part of the game as well.",1708846372,1708846372,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,True

Overall, it's like Ark: Survival Evolved with more diverse and recognizable creatures, and less nerve wracking; beat up animals until you can forcibly tame them and make them work for you collecting resources and carrying you around, use resources to build a shelter using predesigned components for floors, walls, doorways, and roofs, and invariably ragequit when you leave your base untended to for too long and everything dies of starvation leading to you having to hunt down replacements for every creature you had tamed.
Except Palworld takes all of that and makes it better. Taming animals doesn't require you to stand around waiting for an unconscious animal to slowly wake up from a coma before it listens to you, you just have to beat it up a bit and throw your balls in its face. Forgetting to feed your pals doesn't result in them all dying and you having to track down and tame replacements, they just get knocked out like Pokemon and recover after taking a ten minute time-out in the palbox. Structures don't degrade over time for no reason like in Ark, they all stay up as long as they're within range of your palbox. Caves are exciting and interesting dungeon crawls with rare resources instead of a cramped nightmare of broken pathfinding and way too many giant bugs trying to crawl up your ass and eat you from the inside out.
Don't get me wrong, there are still issues that come along with an early access game, mostly in npc pathfinding (how the hell did my loupmoon get itself stuck on the roof AGAIN!?), game loading problems with crafting stations, and a lack of main story (at least in my opinion). As with any early access game, there will be some issues, but I've played enough games to recognize which ones are problems with the core game itself, as opposed to quality of life and final polish, and so far everything here makes for a solid framework.
Just make sure to catch ten of every pal you run into so you get all the good xp, it drops off big time if you're just killing them.",1708836935,1708836935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While I've massively enjoyed other games like the Ori games, Celeste, Rivals of Aether, Slay The Princess, etc, there's just something special about this game. I'll give you 5 pros, 5 cons, and then my personal opinion of the game.

Pros
1. Look and runs otherwordly. I can't believe this games runs this well.
2. 85% of of the designs are lovely and memorable. (My Personal top five are Katress, Wixen, Sazuka, Quivern, and Chillet.)
3. Monster collecting, open world, and survival, but still separates itself enough from Pokemon, Breath Of The Wild, and Ark.
4. The memes are *chef's kiss*.
5. Every pal is different and unique in some way, shape or form.
lot.
Cons
1. Lag a lot online.
2. Mouse and controller sometimes lock and you're unable to switch between keyboard and controller a lot.
3. Boring type charts and combinations.
4. Sometimes, Pals just don't spawn in... like, at all.
5. Character customization is boring and uninteresting. Needs more options.

Overall, this is a great 9/10 game. I haven't had this much fun with a game in forever. This is far from a Pokemon rip off. While this game isn't as good as Pokemon, it has well beyond the potential to be better, and is still just in early access. If the full release does come out, if done well, this could be the game of the year. Maybe even a decades top listed.

Tech, crafting/automation, and XP (for new pals) all scale well as you level thru the game; doesn't feel to grindy until you try breeding pals, which is the only endgame activity atm.

Palworld made me realize how much I've tortured myself with bad creature-collector games. As it is now, Palworld is very fun. However, the game will feel empty as you level and explore more of the map. With its current amount of content, I'd value this game at $20-25, which is pretty close to its current asking price.

Palworld needs more options for automation (e.g. task assignments/checkboxes). Thankfully devs are working on bug fixes now; there are some handfuls of bugs. Server hosting needs to be fixed; I want to rent a server from a partner of Pocketpair ASAP, rather than use an unaffiliated third-party or giving out my IP address; this is not a development issue though.

Common critiques I see of this game are it's ""unpolished"" and ""lacks personality."" That may be true. Yet, as I said, the game appeals to some disenfranchised fanbases who know who they are. gg",1708835500,1708835500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

For now, for all the great fun there is to be had, a lot of it is an exercise in frustration and/or in messing with the rules/difficulty to make the experience acceptable.

There are 2 big points that need to be addressed before I feel I can recommend this to my friends.


FIRST. pal behavior in base is just plain horrid.
- Larger pals get stuck everywhere.
- Assignment are fluky and break all the time.
- AI sometimes simply breaks and does nothing, except go hungry and unhappy (because it's not eating). Need to remove & readd to base to 'reset'.
- Half of the big stuff (nodes mining, breeding) only happens while you are physically present in the base, making secondary bases pretty useless and defeating the purpose of a lot of the timer base gameplay.
- Impossible to set priorities, and pals make terrible decisions, interrupting their activities all the time, and switching like headless chickens.
- Transporting is a scourge, bugs all the time, and prevent pals from doing their primary function.
- Watering is currently the worse, because no small pals have a decent rating, and all the lvl 3 and 4 are VERY prone to getting stuck and breaking, needing constant baby sitting (at least other jobs have regular size lvl 3...  thanks god for Raghawk,Eileen, Verdash, Anubis, etc).
- Simply put, base management is uber micromanagy, buggy and is an exercise in frustration at the moment.


SECOND, balancing is waaaay off.  
- Levelling curve is brutal past 38.
- Catch rates are dubious, especially on later pals, even when using legendary balls with max lifemunks (I understand the need to persevere, but having to throw 35 balls every time to catch jetdragon is just tedious, give me a more expensive ball then). 
- A handful of ingredients need to be grinded (pal oil, pal fluid) while the rest is overflowing and plentiful.
- The legendary schematics drop rate is tiny and they are instrumental in end game, making the whole thing a fluke.
- Player damage and attack stat utility is clearly dubious. It does something, but it's too subtle and really it's the last thing everyone invests in.
- The final boss fight is crazy. Absolutely not in line with rest of progression Huge difficulty spike, requiring legendaries and massive breading to beat (at least for me).
- Etc.


Oh, and I would be remiss not to mention how this game was uncomfortably inspired by (aka shameless pilfered) a bunch of other great titles.  This isn't a criticism, and the result is very promising, but if everybody did the same...  hrm, I don't know.  Anyway, credit where credit is due...

- Pals are obviously Pokemons.
- The environments/world is very inspired from Elden Ring, sparsely populated, with ruins and campfires.
- The jingles and zone intros are straight from Zelda.
- The boss intros are from Borderlands.
- The core loop and base building owes a lot to a bunch of tree punchers (Valheim chiefly) but now this is more a genre than anything else.
- Etc.


LASTLY, I don't play multiplayer with strangers, because humans are terrible ;)  So I don't have the problems people are having on public servers, but apparently it's not good.  So if that's your jam, beware.  But solo or coop with friends, that's obviously a non-issue.

So bottom line, it's is normal for things in early access to not be settled, so I'm not saying the current state is unacceptable, but I wouldn't recommend the game right now. It will be so much better later, don't spoil it for yourself... I wish I hadn't.",1708813293,1708825946,False,1,0,0.485008805990219116,0,True,False,True

I've defeated most tower bosses and acquired many pals, but the end-game lacks activities to maintain interest, there is potential for improvement in this area, maybe the pal arena will be the answer. The game suffers from stability issues(lots of crashing), poor pal AI, and numerous glitches, especially with pals getting stuck or not performing tasks when you fast travel away. My brief time on official servers was disappointing due to frequent crashes and a hacker problem leading to a complete progress wipe. Despite these issues, the game offers good value, and has huge potential.



TLDR; Overall, an addicting experience, expect bugs while things are still being worked on. Avoid official/public servers like the plague until the hacker issue is dealt with. Well worth the money spent.",1708822698,1708822698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Sure there are a few bugs like the pals have a tiny bit of movement issues when traveling and doing tasks that they do on their own far better than me commanding them to do so but for the issues they have the reality is they have the greatest movement out of any NPCs ever made and the tiny glitches they have are funny and add emotion to them but are so insignificant that to correct their movements is as simple as picking them up or going to the box and moving them up and back down to the area and the tiny glitch is fixed and they mostly get hung up on your poor base building but its funny especially when you are mining and they just suddenly drop the stuff they were mining and stand on top of the rock they were mining and look smug doing so which is so human of them to take a break and pretend to be the king of the world on top of the rock.  The fact that the game renders the entire map at once and has 0 loading screens is insane on how perfect it is.  The movement is the best I have ever played in any game especially for its time.  The tiny glitches that get found are fixed faster than any other programmers have ever done.  The games map is frog flipping huge to a point of insanity and unlike every other game ever made its not empty like big game development companies keep lying about.  I normally never say this but if someone is claiming the game is bad they are lying about the issues.  Hell you can kick anyone form the server just by reporting them to the server leader and the ability to play online I have not done quite yet but dear god this game is near perfect.  The emotions the pals have.  The ability to build.  The ability to do so much with so little is just insane.  The ability to explore without being insulted is insanely good.  Straight up every thing I find in the game gets better and better and the game has so much that can be done that is being done.  There is just so much to the game that its literally insane.  The programming of how to move I can switch between flying, gliding, and back to flying mount better than I can walk in most games.  I can use the glider better than a thruster pack in Halo.  The aiming in the game is the best I have ever done.  The controls are seamless in their perfection.  The emotion and the building.  I admit it I got worse than addicted to the game.  The game put me into the gamer zone for 17 hours straight 3 times because its so good which is why I have taken a tiny break so that I can recover my strength because it caused me physical damage to smile so much from playing such a fun game.  I like to smile but the game caused my emotions to stretch myself so much it caused physical damage from being so fun to play.

Bases that are supposed to be automated, with pals mining in your absence, fail to load while your character is away. When they reload, pals are often on top of roofs, or nodes of ore, despite your best efforts to build in pal-friendly ways. (Indeed, much of the game is centered around avoiding its bugs and feature incompleteness.) Palworld should have entered early access with the ability to prioritize tasks, at the very least, as you quickly find that half your roster can't be deployed at base because they have sub-specialties in useless tasks. 

The base building mechanics are likewise abysmal. There is incredibly limited ability to snap to components, as well as lack of angled and rotated pieces (or the ability to rotate them yourself). Building on anything but level ground is a chore at best, impossible at worst, as you fail to determine how to clip objects to something approaching attractiveness.

Palworld may take its influences from other types of games or genres, but honestly, what games don't or haven't, over time? Even Pokemon wasn't original in its 'monster catching/using' idea, it just happened to be the Oreo to the Oreo/Hydrox way of things. Hydrox was first, but Oreo became the big man on campus.

That said, Palworld did something incredible in that this comparatively-small dev team proved that people were tired of Pokemon's rehashing and phoning it in, and wanted a breath of fresh air to the genre, and it made the king, the giant of that genre, bleed, from its seemingly-invincible mountaintop throne. It cut, and it cut deep with the first strike, with the wants and needs of the fans of that genre all holding and slashing that sword with that initial blow.

Is the game perfect? Not at all. It's in Early Access. Things aren't completely fleshed out, bugs are crawlin' in the gears, even terrain in certain areas have their issues. And yet, with all the flaws and roughness around the edges, you see people diving in and loving every minute.  When a game has its glaring issues and problems but you still have fans goin' for it, accepting it with its warts and all, you know you've got the start of something that could be huge.

Not only does Palworld give us a world to explore, it allows the players freedom in customizing their experiences from the start. When making a world you can set creature spawn, damage modifiers, changes to timers and building deterioration, stamina bar use, it goes on and on.  ""Here's the world, make it comfortable for you and have fun."" You capture creatures to work and explore alongside you, you meet their needs as they help you with yours, you build bases from the ground up and make patches of the world your own.

You're not gonna find a deep story right now, you're not gonna find engaging NPCs that draw you in deeper. What you'll find is go in, capture, build, explore, and just enjoy doing it while trying to work around shortcomings and bugs that may be frustrating, but with some patience and grit, you'll be ok.

With all that, I just hope that Pocketpair actually stays with it. They've struck oil, but now's the time to refine it further. If the devs can keep it up and listen well to the players while doing so, everyone's gonna be in for a fantastic ride.

I've had straight up *fun* playing this, and if you can get friends along for the ride, even better.  Ignore clickbait articles, rumors, and fans trying to rush to the defense of their precious multi-billion-dollar company as if they have personal stock in it.

But Pocketpair just knocked it out of the park! I would say GOTY, and it's still in early access. The pricing is unbelievable, to be honest as much as I hate paid DLCs, I wouldn't mind it for something like Palworld at this price range.

The game, like Ark, is very very grindy and requires a lot of time getting resources in order to build what you needs. So if you are familiar with Ark and how you level up and spend points for blueprints and then grind for materials... there is the core of the game.

Add into the Ark mix wild Pokemon type animals and the theme of knocking the health down do you can throw a capture ball at them... then reuse those creatures in battle... there is your Pokemon type of theme.

I really really love the mix of the two of these, just a lot of fun in a HUGE HUGE open world. Nice job!!

The amount of pals you can use as mounts in this game is sick as hell, using pals as weapons is a really fun mechanic, and the world has been fun enough to explore. The biggest issues with the game is the stability, especially on multiplayer serves, but at time of writing, most of those issues seem to have been solved? 

The base building mechanic seems good enough to build what you like, and I really appreciate that you can put your pals to work and still like, take care of their basic needs. It is weird that the marketing is like, "" you can work your pals like slaves!"", but the sanity mechanic really seems to disincentivize you to do that, and the game really wants you to take care of your workers so your base can be sustainable. 

Over all, I've enjoyed my time with the game, it is different enough from pokemon to feel like it's own thing. Not sure if they will add more options to engage with the combat aspects, would love to see them add more ways to use your pals directly in combat, instead of watching them fight automatically. Not sure how they would do that though without changing the nature of the combat. Looking forward to more npcs and quests as the game is developed!",1708801325,1708801325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game is insanely grindy, like, significantly worse than any other survival game I have played. Some of the grind can be alleviated through world settings, like resource drops and EXP, but others, like the insanely slow Pal work speed (which wouldn't be as big a problem if working pals had better AI/mangrment) is stuff there is no in game setting for.

It also just has the general survival open world problems. Map isn't very interesting to look at or explore (honestly can be shrunk a decent bit.. it's 70% generic open world grassy hills.) And the game is extremely glitch, but that's kinda to be expected for the stat it's in.

It has promise but is really rough around the edges, and can get repetitive very fast, even for the type of game it is.",1708801271,1708801271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The positives can be outlined in the following points.

1: The Battle system is fun and does not feel like a drag
2: progression is fast / passed perfectly by default
3: Combat and base building is similar to many other games from Sunkenland to Raft e.t.c
4: Each PAL is unique and has a specific role set. 
5: They took inspiration of the best aspects of different genres and combined it to make this alot of fun.

Downsides currently in Feb 2024

1: there are bugs in Unreal engine, you need to enable page-file for example to prevent system locks or memory leaks, this is not documented anywhere.

2: The light sources are drawn very near and cant be adjusted so at night the only light sources close to you are drawn, this behaviour cant be edited with known unreal engine cmdlets inside of the engine.ini

3: This game is in Beta and the team developing this game are kind of like Hello Games, small and inexperienced but also impassioned  so expect great things but also expect it can take awhile like no man's sky.

4: Clipping and falling through the world is common, tricks like summoning your pal and choosing F to ride to get above ground is an easy fix, but its common enough to be annoying. 

In conclusion / final thoughts.

When we consider the full priced and micro-transaction culture that games of this type are in, this game is a breath of fresh air. It comes with features and options that other game publishers should have included in their own releases a decade ago. 

In summary if you are a fan of For example of Catch em Games and or like base building games or games you need to explore in. Gives this game a go I highly recommend it. 

This game is an easy 9/10 the only let down is the bugs but don't let that stop you from shooting things in the face! See you out there

I've been asking for an adult ""Pokémon"" clone for PC for decades and now we finally got the next best thing, but please beware it suffers from performance issues, bugs, glitches and the simple fact that most features are either missing and/or incomplete as it's in active development.

We either end up with an amazing game with all of our wants and needs fulfilled, or remain stuck in an ""early access"" crunch for the rest of our lives, but in the meantime all we can do is play, give them feedback and wait.

Runs shockingly well for an early access game only crashed one time at 100 hours in testing the VR mod in UEVR at max settings on a laptop RTX3080. honestly unless your playing online this game runs better than most supposedly finished games out there, so Kudos to the Optimizer for a job well done.

the game is an interesting take on the survival genre and though the first two hours gives the impression its going to be a boring craft-a-thon like so many others in the genre Palworld saves itself from falling into that pit by its inventive use of Pal's.

where other open world survivals devolve quickly into doing daily monotonous crafting chores
you quickly learn that each pal is capable of doing a different set of chores around the house and though its a little buggy later on as your base grows more complex in the late game
a few hours in and you will find yourself Free to explore while your Totally VOLUNTARY totally not forced to work ""Family"" of pals holds down the Planta..uh..Homestead crafting the bullets, and cooking  the meals while you explore the surprisingly diverse and absolutely massive map hunting bosses and discovering new critters to catch, each having surprisingly individual AI that reacts differently to the players actions.

Palworld offers 2 preset difficulties and a HIGHLY recommended Custom mode that allows you to blend almost every element of the game to your tastes; Hate grinding? just multiply XP gain and item drop rates. Combat to easy? you can make almost anything able you one-shot you into a re-spawn if you don't dodge roll and pay attention to attack animations. want too fight 3 bosses at once?it has you covered .....you masochistic freak.

Basically the game takes the Survival Genres and uses blends of other games you may have played before like Elden Ring, or Mother Base style work recruitment from MetalGear solid and a surprisingly small dash of Pokemon and uses them to fix many of the weaknesses of Survival games that get in the way of just having fun and exploring while giving the mountains of caught monsters something more to do than rot in storage.

the rougher elements like the copy past Dungeons , some useless or dead end mechanics and craftable items could simply be due to the games incomplete state but even if we never saw the endgame or even a single update and PocketPair vanished into the night its more than worth the $30 you pay for the 60-200 hours you can get out of it.",1706230965,1708791645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

They have various abilities and you can use them to gather resources and fight for you. There isn't much of a story unfortunately but there are world bosses to challenge.

You build a base to get better equipment and to keep your team fed. It can be a bit tedious to reach max level - you need to capture each pal 10 times for bonus XP. There are many settings you can change to suit your play style.

I did turn off base raids. Defences don't always work and it gets annoying repairing stuff. There are bugs where pals in your base regularly get stuck - you have to save them or they will starve.

However, the game has a lot of non-critical bugs, which together leave an unpleasant aftertaste. If the developers release the game roughly ""as is"", it will be a disaster, which is why there is a negative review in advance.

The main problem of the game is NPC pathfinding. It's hard to find a game where it's done worse. At the same time, it is impossible to build an effective base without overcoming the vagaries of pathfinding. And this is more like reverse engineering than playing a video game.

I like monster tamers, I like exploration games, I'd even say the latter, while rather vague as a genre for video games, is probably what I enjoy the most. 
Palworld, as an open-world, monster tamer a la pokemon, immediately struck me as smth I would enjoy, and that I did. But this still is not something to get if you're looking for some kind of meaningful or memorable experience. It's basically junk food, as a video game. This game combines so many things from different titles (Pokemon, Breath of the wild, name any other survival game here); which isn't necessarily a bad thing in of itself, but it lacks a load of polish in everything. The world is rather empty, not particularly interesting to explore, the design of the monsters is mostly fun but nothing super exciting, the crafting and power progression makes the game rather grindy, which can be tuned down via world settings and I found that rather refreshing. It's fun for some time, but you really feel the fact that this game is just a jumble of different stuff, which was the same case for their previous game, Craftopia. In that sense, their games never feel like they have any love put into them, which is a shame. It feels more like a product than an experience. Yes, games are bought, and thus they are products. But to me, the value of a game often lies in the illusion they provide. When I play Outer Wilds, I get lost in the world, explore and ponder; when I play Monster Sanctuary, I get to think about how to build my team and rejoice every time I find a new exciting monster or secret path somewhere in the world, as I get lost in the fantasy of being a monster tamer; technically Palworld should provide me with this kind of feeling but it really really doesn't. I'm constantly taken out of the experience by the game: When I glide or climb, or look at the not-a-sheika-slate I immediately think of Zelda (""BUT CLIMBING WASN'T INVENTED BY ZEL-"" Yes, I know Zelda didn't invent climbing, but the fact that the mechanic was literally plucked from BotW down to the very animation, is just plain disappointing), when I look at the ""Pal Sphere"" you bet all I see is a pokeball from Fiverr (for an example of smth inspired by pokemon like this, but well done, look no further than Cassette Beasts). Palworld doesnt do anything to really distinguish itself in terms of character. And while ""Pokemon with guns"" sounds fun to begin with, it honestly just feels like the guns were yet another thing simply shoehorned into this game because, guns are fun, right? Guns are fun, so guns will sell. It's not that well-integrated into the game and feels a bit random. Which leads to this game seeming like a somewhat soulless cash-grab (which is fine, but it doesnt do a lot to improve my view on this game either) in the sense that everything inside it is just there because of its popularity, not because it works well with the other mechanics in the game. 
As an early access game, this one also has a whole lotta bugs, constantly: there are problems with the pals' pathfinding, they consistently got stuck on top of buildings in my playthrough, preventing them from actually working in my base while I was outside doing things. Pals, particularly the larger ""Alpha Pals"" would often take off into the skies or get hit by an attack of my own pals so hard, they got smashed through the ground and went out of bounds, but still continued to attack me afterwards. Climbing is a bit janky, but frankly, ""janky"" and ""clunky"" are rather apt descriptions for the gameplay feel in general.
But, that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. Which is why I'm still technically recommending this game. I might be ranting about this kind of analytical, nerdy stuff, but most people don't care about these things all too much. If you're just looking for an easy time sink with a continuous dopamine stream, you'll find it here. I'd give the game a 6.5/10. I'm sure most people will have a decently good time with this.",1708770499,1708770499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

And the patches that come are slow and 90% of the time it breaks more than it fixes. Devs ignore the fans and go in their own direction that is already a nightmare on the horizon. 

Palworld is no different in this area. The game has the whole ""Gotta Enslave them all"" vibe going for it but pathing and lack of any real story is just bland as hell. 
But when you setup a base and all is working fine but after a patch ALL of your bases are broken. This drives you to simply not want to game anymore.

As hesitant as I am for purchasing early access games, Palworld has been a purchase that hands down I have no regrets purchasing and would purchase again. Gameplay is smooth and progression is fun.

First lets talk basic mechanics. The movement feels very slow even when you are sprinting and the world is really big so it feels like it takes forever to get somewhere. The climbing is hit or miss (literally). Sometimes it seems you can grab things you where never meant to, other times you can't grab the plain flat wall. Moving on the progression feels very slow. Even on 2x it takes a long time to level after around level 12. This usually then requires you to run dungeons, which in general feel very empty and there is usually only 1 chest other than the 2 post-boss. These chests then don't drop more than some palspheres and coins. So getting anything blueprints is a bit of a grind, not to mention the resources to make the gear.

Now lets talk about the Pals and NPCs themselves. A big issue that I have seen far to commonly is that NPCs tend to get stuck in terrain. Another issue that has arisen is some will not eat even if their SAN is maxed and
they have food, leading to them getting sick. The last issue I have with them is half of them feel useless. Other than the attributes that the type comes with (handiwork, lumbering, etc) each Pal has a unique skill. Some, like the
Digtoise which can mine for you, are very useful. Others, like the Galeclaw which can be used as a glider, are less useful. (You can make yourself a glider). Many have the exact same traits but just look different. So unless you are going for the full Paldeck, they are not worth getting.

Lastly lets discuss map and transportation. As I wrote above the map is big. There are many pals that can be used to get around, some more useful than others. Many are rideable so you have your pick between ground, air, and water,
this being said, there is truly only one mount for ground worth getting imo and that is the Direhowl. It has a faster movement speed than anything else I have found so far, meaning there is no reason to grab something for movement
other than this. When I finally made a saddle for a flyer, I was rather disappointed when the stamina bar lasted 30 seconds to both get me in the air and moving. Once I did it was incredibly slow. Due to map size, this has ultimately driven me to continue ridding my direhowl as to not land every 30 seconds for stamina.

All in all, this game is fun and has a lot of potential, but I feel it needs a few updates. I'm not saying it is bad, but at this time I cannot recommend.",1708743904,1708743904,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

This title doesn't wear its influences on its sleeve - it has them tattooed on its face. Don't think that means it's any less sincere. This is not a 'good' game - not yet. It is however really fun. (EA, Feb 2024) This is the start of a potentially incredible game that could become a juggernaut in the genre once some holes are patched and more content added. That said, if this looks interesting, it's going to be hard NOT to get your money's worth.

This game is not particularly appropriate for small children. Teenagers should be fine. The Sheikah-dex leans into some content that's going to be on a kid-by-kid basis. Copyright-Friendly-Monster 069 is DTF for instance.

But this game already had a lot of positive reviews so I'm going to play as devil's advocate and provide some reasons as to why you shouldn't play this game, other than the fact that I simply didn't like the theme/genre of the game...

This game tries so hard to be everything in a sense that it tries to implement every single mechanic that makes other games ""fun"". It has grappling hooks and climbing mechanics and it also tries to be an automation game like Factorio in some ways. Unfortunately for me at the very least, all of these mechanics sucked in this game. Grappling hooks work poorly, and climbing feels so janky more often than not. Pals would frequently get stuck in weird places and couldn't find their way to a facility when your base is elevated and contains multiple floors.

IMO the progression system also felt pretty basic and it only felt unique in the first few hours of playtime. You started off crafting some basic facilities and the more you play, you will still do the same thing you did 10 hours ago except that you got to do it much faster due to better quality items/facilities and more Pals to lend you a hand. Yeah, you got to see and capture different Pals but the world itself is devoid of things that make the game interesting other than the fact that it has different Pals throughout different regions of the game.

I know of the fact that this game is still in Early Access, and so one day when they finally release the final version of the game, I will be giving it another chance. Meanwhile, I hope that they improve on the game's flaws but for now, my opinions on the game remain unchanged.",1708738270,1708738270,False,3,0,0.522408962249755859,0,True,False,True

Don't buy it if you just want a quick laugh at ""pokemon with guns"" as the guns are end game and having played 35 hours at the moment divided somewhat evenly across both a personal save and a multiplayer world with a friend, I have not yet unlocked the first gun you can craft, so keep that in mind. The guns are end game. That is all

-

Gives me feels that Pokemon hasn't given me since I was a drooling little child and played it for the first time. In the current state of each franchise, this is better than pokemon, seems to have passionate devs who will make it even better and constantly fixing bugs.

If you're worried about microtransactions, there are NONE. You can get everything in the game from playing. There isn't any function in the game where you have to pull out your real-world credit card.

There's definitely the meme that it's pokemon with guns but the guns are end-game so if you only want to buy it for a quick laugh with the gun thing, then it may not be a good idea. If you want a survivalcraft monster catcher of impeccable quality considering the development rollercoaster that spat out this game, or even if you just want a new survival game that's better than most of the indie ones that have been released in the past few years, I can't reccommend it enough. I've already ordered my first Pal plushie. I'm in deep. 

After being left behind by pokemon after being a lifelong obsessive fan, this is filling the void, not because it's copying pokemon and being the exact same game, but because it's a new, fresh and innovative take on the monster collection genre the likes of which hasn't been seen yet. This is like an alternate universe where game freak decided to be at all creative with pokemon during the last 20+ years of having the rights to make its mainline games. Completely different gameplay loop. Like a lot of other reviews said, the gameplay is more like Ark but if the dinos were ""pokemon"".

Another thing to keep in mind is that there is really no way to completely avoid some kind of cruelty towards the pals even if totally by accident (you have to beat them up yourself to catch them the first few times which was... something I had to get used to) however if you want to play cruelly you can and if you want to avoid it at all costs and be a benevolent god, then you can do that too. In my experience trying to play both games, the game doesn't reward you extra for either play style leading both to be valid options for a full experience of the game. There are people who play through with a team full of their favorite creature and people who play without catching any Pals and just use human slaves - your morality is yours to choose.

Pretty much everything about the difficulty and every setting is customizable, and there is already a pretty healthy mod scene for the game if you somehow get bored with everything there already is to see, do and experience.",1708733799,1708733799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Quite a few bugs, getting stuck in rocks if you dodge roll, falling through the map, server crashes, bad snapping when crafting but not all of this is constant and is somewhat expected for early access.

Review: The game still could use a lot of work in regards to debugging and some basic functionality issues, alongside a complete lack of storyline. I enjoy the concept of traveling the landscape trying to find and collect as many different creatures as possible, finding new eggs and discovering some beautiful scenery. I also like the combat, especially in caves, bossfights, or just trying to survive the more harsh creatures/NPCs! The downside is, unless you enjoy exploring, collecting, upgrading, and building, with a dash of resource/creature farming for materials, there isn't much more to the game at this point. I desperately wish there was a storyline or quests (or more of a point to the NPCs), and I find the economy side of the NPCs in it's current state to be very lacking. There are a couple funny easter eggs in NPC interactions, though!

It's still very fun how it is, and I hope they'll have the support to finalize this game! 

Takeaway: Definitely worth giving it a chance! It's a fun and chill game that has a lot of potential if given the proper support.",1708719454,1708719454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros - Capturing Pals is fun and incentivesed, taking good care of them while they work in your base is incentivesed. 
The map is large and diverse enough to keep intrest and easy enough to locate and hunt specific pals.
Pal breeding system is good
constant things to do while exploring keeps gameplay fun and up pace, never really dull when you have things to grab or pals to cap or dungeons to go in every 3min or less. 
CONS - early access so theres lots of bugs, nothing game breaking but lots of annoying ones that'll get worked out im' sure.
Human pals don't seem good (they tell you they're not pals and its inhumane but c'mon it's fun)
Butchering mechanic is not needed. 
Can't take one character to a different server> if you have more than 4 friends or several friend groups you'll be starting over a lot.

The content that is in the game so far matches the price, so you can't go wrong with this one. It's fine for what it is. I can see why people are enjoying it. I am too, but I'm not totally in love just yet. So far it's been fun but I need a little more; I'll get to that in a moment.

As far as complaints, the game does get a little grindy. I get why though - it needs to be that way for right now so that you don't run out of things to do right away. Also, some aspects of the game do come off as odd or off-kilter. I don't think any of it ruins the game, but you don't feel like a protagonist who is doing good things. You mostly come off as a ruthless survivalist who is doing whatever they can do to manage their situation. In a game of this genre, that doesn't really create the atmosphere you'd expect or desire. I'm sure this is related to the early state of the game also, and will improve as it becomes more complete.

Stuff I would like to see in the future would be an actual campaign / story mode, and more ways to control your Pals during battle. I really hope that's where this is headed eventually because I would love that a lot.

Holding my thumb up for now. Good stuff.

Update: Having completed my grind to 50, I still think the game has a lot of potential. Hope it turns into a deeper and more complex game over time.",1706334730,1708715853,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, I think the base building mechanics can be improved. Here are some of my suggestions.
1. Allow players to stack foundations vertically. That way we can build cool bases on the cliff, or around the cliff.
2. Allow players to build wall around the bottom of foundation.
3. Allow players to turn on/off overlapping structure from the option menu. This will make it easier for some players to build cool stuff.

A lot of people say it's Pokemon with guns. I can see it but have you played any survival game like NMS or ARK or even to a point Zelda: breathe of the wilds it takes a lot more from that then anything else. That being said the Pals are fun and you can see influence of other games within it. The game is still early access and updates have been coming fast in that sense.

Pro's and Cons

Pros: Addictive, if your into survival games. You will plan to spend half an hour playing and next thing you know 5 hours have gone by. For it being in Beta there is a lot less bugs/crashing then I expected. Game mechanics run well. visually it look good, The map is huge with many ways to explore it.  it's very open once you finish the tutorial you can do whatever you want... or ignore the tutorial and do what you want from the start with it sitting there in the corner advising you to do it. 

Cons: The tutorial is weak and doesn't explain how to do everything and maybe if i read the handbook or whatever it is called i would. I am stubborn and unless it shows me how to do something i'll just try and figure it out at some point or end up seeing a video about it somewhere. Building in the game if annoying as you can't level out the ground or thing say they overlap for no reason or won't connect where they should. No real progressive story line unless it is in the journals since you do run into other people getting a quest or fetch quest here and there would be nice. So when i want to waste 5 hours doing whatever i can but if i feel like being productive in the game i can as well.  Pals getting stuck randomly and stupidly in the base. I am not sure how many times some Pal gets stuck in the logging site somehow at the top of a tree and it doesn't matter if they do that task or not. 


Future or changes to be seen:

Ignoring the video showing new features coming and the talk of an arena for PVP. I would want to see things change without adding mods to do it. Like increasing  base influence size as you increase level, more character customisation and being able to edit character within the game. AS mentioned in Cons a quest system with main and side quest. So somethings get rid of the need to hold X to do it. like hatching an egg that you have waited for why can't i just hit it or freeing a pal from a cage even building things to a point. for building maybe take skyrim's mining approach tap it and then see the character work until you move  or cancel the action. Having a safety script or something to ensure Pals don't get stuck for no reason in base. 

Just minor things but increased or no level Cap, a pal caught counter to let you know if you need them still for the first ten or not. Quicker movement all around not dramatically but besides the animation sometimes i can't tell if I am spiriting or not. While playing with a controller make the map not so jumpy it works fine on the xbox but on the PC it is easier to use the mouse when using the Map. Adding in fast travel from Base.


Overall Thoughts

It's a good game at a good price (for now) and worth playing. Most issues I have with the game can be fixed by mods. The developers  are really cool check out there interviews. Also the PC version runs much better then the xbox version. I am sure anyone that tries this game will enjoy it and considering that again it is early access how much there is to do or get lost to do in the game is impressive.

I was looking forward to this game for years partially because of the memes but also because Pocketpair seemed to have learned their lessons from Craftopia (Which is still in development, It aint dead, though the Xbox version has been giving them headaches) from what I saw of the trailers. I played a LOT of craftopia with the wife last December and wrote a review of it.

At this point Pretty much everyone has their takes on it and everyone more or less knows what It is (TL:DR A.R.K With Not-pokemon with guns). Personally I think the controversies are dumb and its bait for the terminally online twiterrati to be mad but Instead of droning on about it (and I nearly did for half the review before deciding its not productive) I'm going to shift this in a different direction

I'm going to directly compare Palworld to Craftopia since its Craftopia 2 in a lot of ways since that's where my perspective is mostly from and its something that at least contributes to the general conversation.

In short Its overall a better experience than Craftopia, Especially at the start and as a result it is one of my favorite Open World Survivalcrafts. However I think Palworld is a weaker Multiplayer experience despite having vastly better netcode. I recommend it but It does have some questionable design decisions.

Palworld is a quantum leap in terms of QOL and this is why the game had its massive initial positive reception. Its performant, mostly controls well and has far better menus. Nevermind far shallower crafting trees (which is a good thing coming from Craftopia), better Automation, and better onboarding makes it a far more accessable experience. Its not perfect and in fact I'll call out a few pain points but coming from craftopia, its a massive improvement.

The Better automation Is the signature mechanic of Palworld. Instead of doing the tedious crafting and collecting, you let pals do it for you! Craftopia Had automation but it was kind of awkward to set up and use well with various drones and machines you had to craft (often with multiple stages of crafting). It also lead to your PC chugging with the amount of entities involved, Palworld is FAR More performant and scalable given the nature of the game being centered around the Pals instead of the kitchen sink. Instead of a hilariously chaotic factory and house, you get cute ""Not Pokemon"" doing all your jobs each well animated with far more personality than your average Pokemon, Sure the designs may be similar, but Pocketpair gets more mileage out of em because of how much they can express themselves in each Animation state. The fact that its pretty darn painless to set up (Basically pop your pals with the appropriate skills and facilities in and go) makes it leaps and bounds over most everything else I've tried in the genre.

However it is still somewhat flawed, Pathing issues aside (which can be circumvented by popping your pal inside a box and back to work or just grabbing them and throwing them outside of the troublesome spot, there still sometimes is too much ""Manual fidgeting"" involved as you cant set up a full production chain, nor can you task pals on certain things (easily at least). This makes things a little annoying when you want to say...produce ammunition for your guns as that's a multi tier production line which is where things get a bit more tedious like in most other Open World Survivalcraft games.

Craftopia did have similar creature collecting mechanics with ""Monster Prisms"" though you instead caught Unity asset store animals that you could ride, fight alongside, and throw em in certain machines to work (which would eventually kill them) and to be frank, you were encouraged to be FAR more cruel and careless with them because of the fact that they were designed to be killed for you to get use out of them (with the exception of transport and combat). Here there's hand crafted assets (No I don't think the pals are stolen, fly too close to the sun for a couple of them though) that has an entire mechanic dedicated to their care, Sanity which makes Pals less disposable as low sanity doesn't kill a pal but instead stresses them and if not taken care of, develop injuries or mental disorders that you'll have to treat. You can work them to the bone or you can be ethical about it. The choice is ultimately yours.

You do lose out on what most gamers would call RPG mechanics (Magic and Mana is gone as well as several weapon types and the entire skill tree), Vehicles, and as mentioned before some automation options (as awkward as it was to set up a whole factory, you could set up a full production chain to  anything if you had the appropriate inputs).

Whats gained however is focus, The experience is less ADD and frustrating to navigate. Menus are cleaner and easier to navigate than Craftopia ever was, and the tutorial is fantastic for getting you into the core game loop. This means going out and hunting pals and exploring is more rewarded by expanding options in your base and your base allows you to venture deeper into the world (and I still love Pocketpair's Environment art team). All of those mechanics are handled by your pals and how you manage them or by simple tech and stat progression. Everything is focused around pals, the aforementioned base building, how you approach combat (Using pals to flank a target so you can get a back-strike for a catch, using the pillars in the boss room to have them flank your target, Flying on a Vanwyrm to snipe foes from the sky, all great stuff!) traversal, and crafting all is focused on you and your interactions with Pals and its all wonderful.

Now I said this was a weaker multiplayer experience. I believe this is due to how bases are managed and progress. In Craftopia, you could build pretty much anywhere and were encouraged to find ore nodes and build extractors on them. Palworld requires you to slap down a palbox (which is limited) and then build within a circle, as you level up, you can stuff more pals and eventually place more palboxes in the overworld. If you guild up you share base progression more or less which means the leveling scale kind of breaks a little as your tech is progressing independently but your base levels up together. It feels awkward and with the new limitations I found myself sticking to my own base and my wife to hers once we unlocked the tech for a new base, nevermind we didn't share boxes. I think this game is better played solo and taken at your own pace so you can get around the awkward multiplayer progression.

In the end Palworld is an improvement. Its not perfect and craftopia can scratch a specific itch still, but its well worth the purchase if you are into the memes or the genre.",1708667585,1708698359,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love first-person building/crafting games and I liked the first-person open world adventures in the modern Pokemon games, so this definitely meets my criteria for a good Creature Collection game.

My only alterations to this approval is that the AI needs a bit more work with the Pals at your base for reacting to conditions due to ""stressful work environments"" (normal work mode specifically). The AI doesn't seem to respond well to ""normal"" working conditions and the Pals even having the positive stat bonuses to 'Work Speed' and 'Sanity' still have an easy trigger to working longer than 10 - 15 minutes and receive a negative status such as ""upset/tired and not willing to work,"" ""stressed out due to stressful work conditions."" I'm not sure if it may be misunderstanding something involved with the AI coding, but I feel that the working conditions (if set to 'Normal' working conditions) would have a safe impact on the statuses when the Pals are working for about 20 - 30 minutes at the very most and then activate a 'break' sequence where they could roam around or use a Hot Tub to refresh their Sanity. Maybe an ""Exhausted"" status would work for activating a 'Go to Hot Tub' sequence to refresh the Sanity better than the ""taking a break"" status because when your Pal would take a break, it normally defaults to a 'Wandering' trigger event and the Sanity doesn't go up very much.
Another issue I've noticed is the Wandering aspect seems a bit janky since they like to roam to the outside of the base and get stuck in tight spaces and not respond to interactive objects such as stone/coal/sulfur/ore piles and trees. But I'm sure the issue has already been reported and is being updated as I type this out, so it is just for bringing the issue to attention.

Aside from the above mentioned, this is in general a great game and I could DEFINITELY see this being improving A LOT in the future and maybe even introduce breed-able color varieties of the available Pals that you catch and put into the Breeding Farm.",1708698219,1708698219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I found right off the bat that this game feels like a mix of Ark, Pokemon, and Genshin (Statues, Graphics Quality, Traversing, Gameplay Loop). Open free range map and sandbox building is amazing! hidden caves and loot, random eggs  which vary in fatness level and with anything in side it's exciting! Battling is fun sometimes, when it comes to the boss towers it's a yes, but once you fight normal Pals it's a no. 
While i'm talking about the Pals they are cute, random in terms of skills and passive and levels' and there are shinny's which are bigger and more powerful so worth keeping a eye out. A bit annoying on how many illnesses your Pal's, but I do find taking the clever to them is cheaper:3 
The only real big issues I have found so far is that Pal's don't like to path find in buildings, or if they go to close they can get stuck on the walls & starve, Pal's just straight up ignoring jobs or acting brain dead around the Palbox. I am in the discord and they have talked about fixing a lot of these issues, so lets hope that happens. 
Besides that I'd highly recommend this game, it's a sh*t ton of fun with buddies and a great time killer after work.

However, I tried getting back to that franchise with Sapphire and Shield, but I really can't stand the turn based battles. I no longer have the same imagination I had when I was a kid.

I really feel that Palworld is the game that Pokémon should have been, but they refuse to innovate because of overpaid legacy staff and inability to transition from 2D to 3D. I love the personality of each pal from Chillet flapping its ears to Depresso looking at you menacingly while mining rocks and attempts to drown itself while on the bathtub. I like the real time battles where you don't have to respect the enemy's time and you are just as involved in the battles as your summoned creatures with guns, and your pals can help you run your base and have an automated factory to craft you more weapons and Pal spheres to ""catch 'em all"", then breed, then condense it to a perfect Pal. You also have an option to have more than 1 Pal active in battles with a bracelet for select Pals, like Daedream and Dazzi.

Though its buggy and there are times that you would fall into the world map, I think they are less buggy than what Game Freak had produced for the last 10 years. I never bought a Switch as current Pokémon is a disappointment and I have lost all hope that it will even try to modernize, and the gameplay loop of Palworld is so satisfying and I hope they would further expand the game.",1708692636,1708692636,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Your player character is actually capable of doing things in battle, too, and you aren't FORCED to carry any Pals with you - you can go out alone and defend yourself with your own weapons. (Though mounts make traveling a LOT easier, but what I mean is that it doesn't feel like my player character is useless without a Pal.) There's hunger stats to keep up, and Pals have sanity you need to watch. Each Pal I've found has felt unique in what they can do; some are better for fighting, some are better for tasks at the base. Some of those base-taskers are well rounded and able to handle a variety, while others are specialized, but also better at what they do. Other Pals have extra-special abilities, like regenerating your health, or being a sonar for things of interest. The fighters have different styles, especially mounts, so it's really helpful to have a mount with a style that matches your own... unlike what I have now with the fastest land traveler I could get yet, who only kills what I want to catch, and I swear is deliberately slow at attacking only when we REALLY need to dodge an attack, and is INSANELY lucky that I'm not willing to permanently ""retire"" any Pal that's actually done something useful-
*Ahem*
Of course, it IS early access, so there are some glitches, and things that feel like they could use some modification. (Like how you have to individually chase, hope you can pick up, then toss a Pal at a task, then hope they see the task you're telling them to do. Or, and it may just be the way I build my bases, but the walls are more of a suggestion, as my Pals often clip outside and get stuck, then I have to re-put them in the base before they starve. I've also had multiple occasions of Pals and NPC's clipping into walls. There's also the fact that Pals don't eat until they're full before returning to tasks, they eat until they're above their hunger threshold... so I have some Pals that spend all their time walking back to the food box, eating a bit, starting towards their task, then getting hungry before doing anything and going back for more.) There is also, admittedly, a solid amount of EXP grinding, though this can be made a bit easier by changing the world settings.
(And, small spoiler alert but important to know,[spoiler] you stop at level 50, and while you can reset your stat distribution, it's a fairly tedious recipe to complete. [/spoiler]Watch what you spend your Level points on!)

In the end, though, this really is a great game. The map is filled with things to do and places to go. It feels alive by actively spawning NPC's that react to more than just the player. The Pals, while some designs are[i] notably [/i] similar to some existing Pokemon, have great designs. Even the variants are interesting, since the color change makes them stand out from the original.

And, because it feels like a good summary of my luck in this game, a (spoilers) story that I know I won't forget.
[spoiler] While I avoided looking things up unless I was super stuck, I did happen to see you could catch and keep humans at the base, including merchants - most notably, to me, the Black Marketeer, who sells rare Pals. I couldn't help it and decided I'd try to bring one back to my base, but he completely destroyed me multiple times. I spent hours getting ready for a round 2, gathering resources to craft a bunch of the best Spheres and piling up on EXP. With 45 Legendary Spheres, I went for a rematch. (Not counting the one my trigger-happy horse killed-) I somehow survived, I threw my first Sphere... and hit the 14% chance first try. It couldn't have been a more anti-climactic way for my grand quest to end. 100 out of 10, couldn't have asked for a better result. Now he's the most eager one in the base to help craft things, always either the first or second to get to it. [/spoiler]",1708674693,1708674790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It offers a living sandbox experience, akin to a blend of Pokémon and Animal Crossing, with improved multiplayer functionality. As a former Destiny 2 player, I appreciate its slight shooter elements. While the game has glitches, they're manageable and expected in early access. The bases foster shared goals, but glitches affect tasks allocation and pathfinding. Food management in bases is also inefficient. Despite these issues, Palworld's innovative gameplay makes it worth playing, promising even more as it develops further.

Long version:

The main thing that this game implements is Pokemon's weakness, or inability to fully represent the environment we have come to expect from the anime: It is a living, breathing sandbox. This is also the perfect game if you liked Pokemon and/or Animal Crossing, but felt the ability to play and do things with friends was lackluster, or more trouble than it was worth. It even scratches the shooter itch JUST enough for me, coming from Destiny 2. I don't typically do reviews but wow, this deserves it. There are some glitches in the game that are irritating to some degree and it's a real shame, occasionally. However, ALL of them have work-arounds or are not required to progress, and this is early access. Given the massive influx of players and the funding they've gotten from sales, I have no doubt that they now have the means to correct these issues.

THE GOOD:

The bases in the game give everyone shared interests and goals, and the server method allows everybody to play together at once. No connecting, searching, exchanging friend codes, etc. You give someone your server code 1 time, they join you, and that's it. You just log in and there are your pals--pun intended. Time to go do stuff. Anybody can drop in or out at any time. For an early access title this is about as good as it gets. You build a base, establish a method of consistently obtaining food, building pal spheres (balls), and get out into the wilderness. Whereas Pokemon had you doing turn-based battles for the majority of the time, Palworld is real-time combat. They have added an element of skill to the game where you'll need to move your character and help fight to capture the Pals in the open environment. In Pokemon, you didn't necessarily need skill or any element of coordination to capture new ones, as combat was largely turn-based. Everything feels so much more alive this way; it's surreal and more satisfying on each capture. You don't just ""use fly"" as fast-travel: you can actually fly, as high as you're able (which levels up in time, if you so choose that skill tree) and discover. You don't just ""surf"" to cross a stream; you actually explore and find new things when you find the appropriate Pal to take you. Can't see at night? Use a fire Pal to light the way. Can't climb that cliff yet? Increase your stamina. Find a Pal who jumps higher. Find one that flies more efficiently. The practical application of the Pals you find is what makes this game shine brightest.

THE BAD:

The glitches... oh man, the glitches. I'll start with base life:

When you set up your base, everybody has a job. As with real life, not everybody likes their job. For example, 1 Pal named Anubis is extremely fast at the handiwork skill, used to make tons of items such as Pal Spheres. He can create them faster than you can, even after upgrading that skill tree 15 times. The problem? You can assign 3 of these fellas to your base and queue up some spheres to be made, but find all 3 of your Pals mining rock instead of helping you with your task. At the moment the game lacks a proper way to assign pals to any given task, especially the ones that have multiple skills. It would be nice to find some interface where I can always set Anubis to prioritize completing Handiwork tasks before going back to mining stone, for example. This would allow us to customize their behavior in a productive way, and make these Pals (that can potentially work so much faster than us) actually apply themselves.

At best, you can try to go run up to them, physically pick them up and bring them back to a certain work station, and HOPE that they don't run off when you put them down right in front of the place you intended them to be. Many times, even if you're facing a station and the prompt to ""assign to X"" shows up, they'll still hit the ground running, back to what they were doing before. Simultaneously, you get a prompt that they're ""unable to work on Y,"" as you sit there going, ""I WANTED YOU TO X, NOT Y!"" This process wouldn't be great even if it was perfected--I think we'd be much better off with some user interface where we can click and drag any given Pal to designate tasks, perhaps on an overhead map of the base that's similar to the world map.

Rather than sit and repeat this chase-and-drop process, I've opted to keep an Anubis in my party and throw him out whenever I want him to focus 100% on a certain task. Unfortunately this limits you, as you can only have 1 Pal from your team out at a time. This 1 Pal is the ONLY Pal who stays 100% on-task with what you tell them to do, and has no issues being assigned by throwing him at a particular work station. Similar coding should be applied to base pals, but I have hope for the future. If this functionality is improved, we could all be farming things exponentially faster than what is currently possible, making base life much more fun. I estimate that end-game pals used in your base are only functioning at about 10-15% of the efficiency that they could be, if they were properly coded.

That leads me to my 2nd biggest problem: PATHING. For those who don't know what this means, the Pals in your base will get stuck. They will get stuck a lot. You will leave, come back, and find all 10-15 Pals in a mosh pit, unable to move and starving. If you employ bigger Pals in your base, there will be even more issues with their movement in tight environments. You'll have to take them all out of the base, put them back in the box, and re-assign them to the base. Again, this simple work-around takes 10 seconds to do, but it gets aggravating over time. When your 3 Anubis Pals didn't create any stone while you were gone because they got stuck for all 3 hours that you were out exploring dungeons, you come back pretty disappointed.

Similarly, if you have 5 Pals who can take care of 5 different tasks at once, you would expect to kill 5 birds with one stone. Unfortunately, as of the game's current state, if you queue up 5 items to be made, you'll be lucky to see 1 of your 5 Pals actively running over to work on those tasks. You typically have to micro-manage, sending your party Pal to complete things and move through the stations 1 at a time, personally.

FOOD: Food is problematic in the base setting because even if you establish a good way to get a supply for your pals to enjoy, they frequently don't eat until they're full. You'll find Anubis leaving his task to go eat when his stomach drops to 49% full. He'll stop, run across the base to your berry supply pit, eat 1 berry, run all the way back and start working again, 51% full. 15 seconds later you'll catch him stopping his work again to go eat 1 more berry. It's frustrating that they don't eat until they're full outright, because this repeated process really undermines the speed and efficiency that you're meant to achieve by employing the correct Pals in your base. As I mentioned there are ways to work around everything, such as producing higher quality food that brings you well above 50% with one bite, but one shouldn't have to plan for that.

Summary: Excellent game albeit with many, many frustrating glitches. It speaks to how much fun it is, however, that it is still worth playing in spite of all these problems. It is a breath of fresh air to what Pokemon should have been.",1708672466,1708672857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's like P*kémon in some ways, yet different in others. The designs of the Pals are likable, and I appreciate that a lot of them can be used as mounts or be made to accompany you outside their Palballs. 

Unlike P*kemon, however, it is more violent, with the ability to kill pals and humans, and you do get food / material items from slain foes. I am cool with that, but someone looking for something more ""monster friendly"" may prefer something a little less violent. 

I also personally really enjoy the crafting and base designing aspects a lot more than I thought I would, and I've spent copious amounts of time on mine. I just wish there were some easier ways to place items without them being crooked, like offering both a direct placement mode and an overhead grid placement option. But I'm unsure how feasible that would be since I'm not a game designer myself.

Overall, I would recommend this game, and I think it's worth the current price of around $30 despite being in early access. I do think some big improvements with glitches will need to be made if they plan to charge more for the full release, though.

However, some things I would love to see in the full release are:
- Sorting your inventory automatically into all chests within your base that hold any of that item (aka quick stash all stackables)
- Improve Pal AI (especially inside the base)
- Add a ""catch bonus completed amount"" tracker next to the encounter amount tracker and owned amount tracker in the Paldeck
- Ability to initiate fast travel from anywhere (maybe unlocked through a key item from a late game ancient technology?)
- Way more space in the Pal Box. It feels like you constantly have to condense Pals with the Pal Condenser or sell them. If you want to get multiple Pals to 4 stars almost all your space has to be reserved for that alone.
- Possiblity to move and rotate objects within your base (instead of destroying and rebuilding)
- Ability to repair every structure in your base from a menu instead of with repair sets. A lot of spaces in more advanced buildings are absolutely unreachable for Pals. Additionally, the player is not allowed to fix floors or walls, only objects like the workbench, but no ""building structures"". When you have any damaged unreachable structure in your base and at least 1 repair kit in any storage all pals with a Handiwork trait will bug out and try to fix it. When they are unable they will drop the repair kit on the ground, effectively waisting it. Until the last repair kit is pulled out of a chest for long enough and despawns all Handiwork pals will just stutter on the spot. Giving us an option from either the Pal Box or somewhere else to repair everything in the whole base (it would still cost the same ressources of course) would hugely help fixing all the walls players accidently shoot with their Assault Rifle when they actually want to grapple to that spot.
- PVP
- Decoupling of worlds and characters. It would be cool to just start on a new world with an existing character or join with a new character into your existing world. Multiplayer servers should have an option to allow or decline characters that played outside of the server world. This would enable way easier PVP.

So far I really liked the first few updates (I started on 0.1.2.0 and 0.1.4.1 got quite the improvements already) and hope the devs keep up the good work!

But then like 30-40 hours in, you're in midgame and you need your bases to work, but they're not that functional because Pals are broken a.f. You are however still enamored with the Wixen stoking your ovens, and the Verdash picking your crops. You have some work-arounds that are OK, and you're still having fun probably...

And then the game just becomes more unstable and unplayable, it becomes a test of wills. How badly do you want to get to late game VS how much completely & utterly broken the base mechanics, Pal AI, supply chains, and Palbox UX/UI (or lack thereof) is. If you're like me you'll endure for a bit. . . but eventually it will just crush your will to play the game because ITS NOT FUN ANYMORE.

There's so many easy things the devs could do to at least control for and mitigate the brokeness in mid to late game, but those things just aren't there.

You can't get a refund at this point. You just quit. Don't play this game in its current state if the above jank will piss you off.

(P.S. I have almost so many hours because I started 3 separate times before ending up hosting my own server, and then doing my best to facilitate the game for my group of friends' enjoyment, and took a major detour through breeding and trying to get bases humming along... ultimately I'm tired of devs releasing broken games, even in EA, that your don't realize are broken until you're 30 or 40 hours in.

Even playing solo the game isn't so hard that it's a grind just to go out and gather supplies or materials but it's still hard enough that you need to be an appropriate level to get along, the 'pals' have a level sync so if you think you can cheese the game from day 1 and get a really high level 'pal' right of the bat than you are mistaken, it's level will drop down to be the same level as you or 1 level higher. There's no guide for putting together a house and it can be hella touchy when placing certain things, when you build up to have a two-story house and it'll hit you with 'not enough support' but there are no pillars to add support  in the game and the only way to build something that's structurally sound is you have to just build a box on top of a box so be careful when picking an area for your base, try find the most open and flat area and that'll make it easier to go hard on building otherwise just build a big f*** you fence on the perimeter of your base and leave it open-air style.",1708651900,1708651900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

(I know this is in early access, but even an early access game shouldn't have this severe a bug)
I have played for 30hrs, with nothing to show for it. If you join a dedicated server it's ridiculously laggy. I bought a personal server from Shockbyte, and it completely wiped ALL progress- TWICE!! 30hrs WASTED. They have 50,000 inquiries- yes, 50,000 for the same issue of wiping all progress. I cannot believe they released this game without fleshing everything out. It's a shame because it is super fun, amazing concept and really awesome gameplay- when it works. They SERIOUSLY need to fix these issues, or this will be a dead game. Very disappointed, wasted so much time.

*UPDATE*
They have fixed some of these issues, they still need to make dedicated servers. But honestly this game is suuuper addicting! Most fun I've had in a while- bugs and all.

Pokemon fans (me included) have asked for a polished, good looking, pokemon game that isn't a turn based system adventure. I've definitely found my needs for this in Palworld.

Achievements are also kinda straight forward to get, and that should not be seen as a bad thing. I hope to see more achievements in the future, and am looking forward to new content!",1708650677,1708650677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's tons to explore and the chance of finding a new pal that will add usefulness to your base only adds the the excellent exploration.  The gliders and climb anywhere mechanics are very freeing. Automating and optimizing your base is also tons of fun, and feeds right back into exploration and catching new pals. This game truly emphasizes freedom of play, going so far as to allow you to capture human NPCs, with only a single line of ""hey, this is considered immoral in this world,"" as a barrier. Also, Guns.

This game is better than many AAA releases in recent years, and its still early access. I'm certainly looking forward to some things though. It took me a while to realize you can still edit world settings from the title page even after the world has been created. I'm of the belief that you can always make improvements to UI.
The raid mechanics have caused me some bugs, and I could see some players not finding it compelling, luckily it can be turned off in world settings. As they sit though, the raids have potential but are a bit lacking in depth based on current AI behavior. 
The story also currently lacks depth. The idea that multiple factions are attempting to control the land and its resources makes sense, and leads to boss battles and other facets of good game design. Some cutscenes and voice acting would go a very long way in fleshing out the story of the game.

Critical points: Some of the pals are unimaginative to the point of clearly being AI designed. 
The armor design. It's bad.
I dislike suggestions that create excessive work for the devs, but some customization options for armor and clothing feel mandatory for a game that offers so much freedom in so many other places. Hunting a rare pal for materials to add a buff to your helmet? Missed opportunity.
Technology progression. This is a personal gripe, but I found the jump from tables to rusty conveyor belts a little jarring. Giving lifmunk a submachine gun before I could craft a crossbow? Not great for immersion.",1708637619,1708637619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I enjoyed the sh*t out of it, put some serious hours in a very short amount of time and I pretty much made everything there is to do. If I never play it again, I've already got the time/enjoyment return out of my money.

That's probably not how the story ends though, depending on how devs will follow-up with Palworld's success. Over time, I'm hoping for several new areas (I hope we eventually reach the sky, not unlike TotK) and at least double the amount of Pals to catch/breed. Some more Tower Bosses would be nice, again at least double the current amout. 
Random/scheduled events around the map would go a long way, some more Alphas, hopefully some sort of Raid events/areas.
I'm definitely NOT looking forward for PvP, although I also don't grudge them for doing so. If people want it, just do it. But I hope that the majority of content we see from now on is PvE. I'll also add that I've joined some acquaintances of mine in a public server and it was utter shit. No joke, it's a completely different, shittier experience. Just stick to either solo play or host the game yourself (or have a friend do so). Just keep in mind people can only join when/while the host is Online.

I have a lot more expectations for the game, but I don't want to necessarily write them all down. I really hope this game succeeds as it has tremendous potential.

The frame rate needs to be much much choppier. Where are the massive subterranean oceans I'm forced to render!? 

Also some of the monsters look stylistically similar to early-gen mons, so this is a direct attack on my childhood memories and I'm calling the police. Here is the foolproof method to prove how they are criminals with TWO WORDS! 

Please use the following mathematical formula;

[b]Element/Color/Shape + Animal  = Copyright infringement[/b] 

Fire + Fox = Vulpix. Only Nintendo owns the idea of a Firefox. How can people not see this!?

Ball + Sheep = Woloo. They have the same number of legs! Wake up sheeple!

Water + Penguin = Piplup. Penguins have nothing to do with water/ice wtf?!

/sarcasm

If you're looking through the negative reviews to see whats wrong, these are what I would consider the actual problems. 

Pals get stuck in base constantly. There are quite a few unique ways for them to get stuck. You can pick them up, but there seems to be a visual desync that can make that difficult, so its usually just best to put them back in the box for a second and redeploy them.

Building is objectively bad for a survival game. Things don't snap like they should and walls are still somehow only a suggestion for Pals, despite already receiving a 'fix'. 

Melee combat feels bad, but ranged seems like more of the focus of the game.

Other than that the gameplay loop/exploration is amazing for the price. There is no 'endgame' but this makes sense considering EA status. The ONLY real worry I have is that this Dev doesn't seem to stick with their EA titles. They've also stated that they have almost no experience with this engine, so expect fixes to be slow. That said, it seems like they've used all of their experience to make this and it's obviously much more promising than their other games. I bet they stick with this one, I just hope it doesn't say Jankworld for months and months.

That casual play goes to hardcore grind and endless hours to get a small upgrade. Honestly I stopped even catching them because the balls got so expensive to craft that I would just kill things to lvl 50 which was faster given the poor catch rates even with the best balls. 2% for a lvl 50 shiney is crap with a legendary sphere. I conquered but skipped most of the basebuilding because that's where you can waste time. I wish the pals had more strength because a lvl 50 pal and the starting area pals are so damn weak compared to the pals you find later on. I mean like 1/25 the strength. Some skills are just OP and others are useless. Grinding dungeons was the fastest I could level. I would run around in a dungeon killing stuff to lvl up. Got to 50 pretty damn fast and skipped the catching things lol. You would get a bonus for catching new pals but 20k for like palballs and the time it takes to capture. I could kill 10 mobs giving 5k exp each. Its faster to not catch things and just blow through dungeons with a good skill like shadow dash. Clearing rooms would net more than that in a fraction of the time. which is sad because catching them is the best part of this game.

The graphisms, the gameplay and the content are really good for an early access.

So why is this a negative review? 2 words: PROGRESS LOST

The game is very buggy (nothing strange, it is an EA after all) and crashes without any reason sometimes. It would not be a big deal if said crashes weren't the cause of many deleted / corrupted save files.
To give you an idea of the state of the game, way too many mods get shared across steam discussions, Reddits, Discord, etc... just to give you the opportunity to restore your save files from backups and more often that it should be, it just doesn't work and you find yourself restarting all over again.

It happened to me 3 times:
- Once on a coop server (5h play time lost)
- Once on a dedicated online server (70h+ play time lost)
- Once on a solo game (10h play time lost)

So far, it is one of the worst (if not the worst) Early Access I played in my entire life.

I CANNOT recommend this game in this current state. I know the devs know about these problems and are trying to fix it as soon as possible, but this shouldn't be a thing in a first place.
Also, I fear these fixes delay way too much the addition of content in the game.

I'm willing to change my review in a near future if they manage to deploy some fixes quickly, but as the time being, it is a big NO for me.",1708252608,1708618891,False,0,0,0.468953549861907959,0,True,False,True

 Palworld is... A beautiful mess. I'm sure you've heard many content creators surrounding Palworld say that already- as it's hard to miss the game- given how popular it has become. However- after 137 hours- within the span of a week- I can safely say that this game is extremely fun! It's still incredibly buggy and has its flaws, but the bugs weren't game breaking in my opinion. It was mostly just cases of Pals freezing randomly or the *slight* wall phasing- thankfully I've yet to phase through the ground, so that's a plus!
 The overall gameplay is enjoyable, however can feel pretty grindy at times, which to some people is great! Other times it can feel relaxing, strolling through forests or along the sandy shores, watching pals roam as they please. And then there's the other times where you'll start to rage when Pal #69 comes in hordes and destroys your base during a raid :).
 The pals themselves are excellently done. They are very well animated, so it feels like each pal has their personality. Just pay attention to the way a Pengullet waddles around with it's flippers moving about, or when it carries items on it's head! The pals look like they were made with love, which really gives them personality, and almost makes me feel bad for them when I force them to mine a bunch of stone, ore and wood for me!
 The humans on the other hand- almost feel like they have no personality. They wander aimlessly. The NPCs at cities should have more dialog. They say someone should defeat the boss, you defeat the boss, come back. say one new thing, and then someone should defeat the boss. 
 Overall- the gameplay mechanics are pretty great when combined into this game- The ARK-like technology points and choosing what to spend your points on in advancements is a really neat thing when combined with the Pokemon-like gameplay. The feeling of needing to catch all the pals continues the grind for resources. In turn it causes you to explore more of the map because you're eventually forced to search for coal to make refined ingots. Sulfur to make ammo and weapons. And eventually quarts for circuit boards- All of these things encourage the player to explore more of the map as they level up and progress. As you progress you also have to change and adapt your play style as you unlock new things- you unlock new weapons, new pal partner abilities, new areas of the map, different mounts. All while you still have to grind materials... so its easy to get sucked into it! 

 I genuinely recommend this game, however if you don't like buggy games, wait a little while until the game is out of early access, or at least until they patch a lot of bugs.
 But that's all from me- it's back to the grind for me! :D",1708452523,1708618396,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

At some point, that rewarding factor comes to a steep halt if you no-life the game. The world is big and explorable but after a while, it feels pretty quiet and lifeless. You can adjust population density to fix some of that though. 

The game allows you to change do many aspects of gameplay in your world, allowing you to curate your own experience. After about 40 hours of gameplay, I made my own world and virtually skipped a lot of the grinding. 

There are a lot of aspects of the game obviously borrowed from Pokemon, but the game has a lot of it's own unique features. Im a bit divided on the gameplay. There's a million ways to go about combat really. Unless you're using a mounted Pal, you don't command their attacks, they act on their own. Meanwhile, you can use guns, arrows, spears, and grenades to combat enemy Pals. Some pals have support skills you can command and be healed, other pals, you can turn into weapons (example: one pal can turn into a flame thrower). My favorite way to approach combat is to constantly throw and return my creatures according to the situation. I tend to recall my pals before an attack lands on them, and resummon them elsewhere to counter the enemy. 

Game runs smooth on the steam deck but unfortunately will inevitably crash after enough exploration. My PC sounds like an airplane turbine when I fly too high. Game needs to be optimized as it consumes a lot of video memory. 

Overall the game is a blast. I unfortunately hit a wall a hundred hours in, but when you have friends playing with you, it's a whole new experience. I hope to see the player capacity increase. I hope to see cloud stored worlds so my friends can play in mine even when I'm not around. I hope to see more pals. I hope to see procedurally generatable worlds. I hope to see more weapons. I hope to see much much better item customization. I hope to see migratsble characters, items, and storage. Starting from scratch is fun, but sometimes, you want to bring some creatures with you.

From using custom settings to make it harder like HP regens at 1 a second and one can only heal when they sleep to making it so one has to collect the effigys to make it the original catch rate.
I also haven't had this much fun finding bugs there's bugs that help play like the learning of furniture stacking and letting a person be able to stack garden beds and other items easily up to 4X high to bugs that just insta out of bounds a person and can kill them if they lag spike the game with viewing cages or other items the game has bugs it's early access so what who cares.

What this game also has already is life of work mods like anti-stuck pal workers, Secret I.V. talent shower yes there's secret I.V.s in this game for breeding, Paldeck Analyzer so the Paldeck becomes more like a tablet that Analyzes that a player always has on them levels can be set for this even, there's also a assign pals mod so a player can assign pals to the right objects so pals wont get confused and this is all only within 2 months of being released as a game.

It is a pitty that palworld firstly had been received with strong critiscism of plagiarism which is really unfair to the amazing work this small studio achieved to deliver.

In fact, it has a lot of inspiration on successful franchises, however, it just pick the most fun aspects of those games also adding its own personality. I love how the ""pet system"" works, specially due to the fact that every single monster has its own personality (literally speaking) , so even catching a same kind of creature it may have different personality traits among all the other specie friends.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

For instance in your base pals have no idea how to get to anything ever for any reason. They prioritize things that make no sense and will constantly get sick and produce little to no resources. There is no way you the player can influence and control any of this. You can not prioritize what they work on even assigning them to a task using the built in mechanic doesn't work. Which makes one half of the game base management basically a crap shoot of build and rebuild with no information hoping it suddenly works. The rest of the game is amazing raiding dungeons, catching pals using crazy weapons and armor even using pals as weapons. Those fun parts I think outweigh the bad parts but man does the base mechanics quickly make playing just not much fun because you can't leave to do the good parts without losing substantial resources in curing depression and other issues.",1708571424,1708571424,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Catching monsters, catching humans, crafting, whackin' trees, scrounging for materials, getting bodied over and over again... and the best part is that you can custom tailor your worlds! I play single-player, and after getting frustrated with the grind (and the multitude of deaths), I started tinkering with the world. The game itself lets you do that. No need for mods or cheats - just the game itself. I wish more games would allow us to do that! Not everyone has the time or drive to painstakingly lob 1,0000 spheres to catch a Pal, not everyone wants to grind and grind and grind to see progress. Ain't nobody got time for that, and the game doesn't punish you for it - it lets you do (nearly) whatever you want!

I can't wait for updates! More NPCs! More animations! More things to do, things to see - things to capture.

The gameplay is snappy and quick, the pal moves and weapons you use also feel strangely realistic or punchy, for lack of a better word, which is a plus. 

The mix of so many gameplay elements like base building with more to it than just building, monster catching, having the pals helping out in everything you do, from the variety of weapons and resources, it all works surprisingly well put together.

The pals all have such unique animations, sound and overall designs, not only can you have pals working at your base and interacting with so many things at once, the ones you bring along in your party can do so much to help you adventuring, being mounts for faster travel, flying, gliding or just having them around you is awesome. 

The base building is so rewarding, the way pals help out in their unique ways, to needing specific resources, I just wish the base construction radious was a bit longer or at least allowed you to invest in making it wider, even if it cost large amounts of resources. 

Dungeons and caves are a pretty boring and repetitive after the first one, hopefully that changes in the future.

Sure it has a few bugs and needs some more work to polish things out, but performance looks pretty great considering the amount of stuff happening on a busy game, it is probably one of the best early access games I ever bought, everything feels fun and rewarding, especially with a coop partner, and even by yourself, also no microtransactions, just the full package, I love it.

Absolute bang for buck of a game, I was never much of a fan of survival games, but this one peaked my interest and it's worth every cent, early access after playing Palworld has a whole new meaning personally.",1707335170,1708566274,True,3,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,True

Having a low budget PC I do experience lag, especially in dungeons where it seems to be common place for every player in general. The lag and bugs hasn’t ruined my experience to the point of this being unplayable-its still very addicting with a lot to do despite being early access. Palworld takes inspiration from several games; movement+controls from the Soulsbourne universe, monster catching/battling/gyms/breeding from Pokémon, building/gathering/farming from games like Minecraft and Stardew Valley. Some can also see this as Fortnite with monsters within its simplistic aesthetics and building/shooting mechanics. Most will just see this as an ARK survival game with the artstyle and designs resembling Pkmn.

I was never into open world or building games but this one really sucks you in, its everything Pkmn SV was meant to be with exploration in an open world. The innovation with your pals in this game brings more connection with your monsters as each of them has a role to play-whether they’re good for battling or not they can all do several different tasks within your base. Just like in Pkmn within this game you can traverse with your monsters alongside you outside the ball and also mount a huge selection of them. In Palworld like in Digimon they added monsters with guns, canons, rockets, and missile launchers, without the pooping.

Being a life long fan of the monster genre I understand why pkmn/nintendo fans are hating on this game because of the designs and the capture sphere mechanics added in resembling Pkmn so much. There is an edit online comparing pkmn designs themselves showcasing they were inspired from Dragonquest’s monster designs. As a fan of this genre I welcome any solid monster taming/hunting game since its been pretty stale the past several years and this one has it all with a bright future ahead of it. This game took it to the next level and the numbers show how many people being lifelong fans of the genre have been waiting for a game like this.

Some things I wish to be added into this game is an IV judge/checker like in the core pkmn games. There are mods for this but I'd rather not go through the hassle of finding and installing them especially with some players reporting some mods hindering their game's performance. Pkmn GO added in the IV checker after the game was released for awhile becoming popular so hopefully they do the same for this. Another mechanic in this game thats much needed is being able to assign your Pals to specific tasks, as some tend to do something else even after throwing them into a specific task. Lastly being able to feed food/meds to workers in your base so you don't have to constantly switch them into your party. 

I've only played 1 file in Single player mode and its been a great experience while still playing alone. I played co op once with a friend and it was pretty cool being able to customize the settings in the steam version and have him catch up to my level quickly. Its also nice being able to turn off incubation times. Afaik xbox is lacking these features and also not able to name your pals in it. I refuse to play in public servers as there are hackers online or just randoms nuking bases. I truly hope this game continues to thrive-I'm really excited and looking forward to all the new updates and pals added in this awesome world. Its been a long time since I’ve been addicted to a game..I was so addicted to Palworld that I ended up skipping the gym and not seeing family/friends for a week.

The problem is it is rather easy to breeze through the content itself. The boss fights are fun enough, but don't require a lot of skill to beat and are pretty easy even without cheesing or glitching. If you want you can blitz a lot of the content relatively quickly and get stuck with nothing to do but min/maxing your pals--which gets boring real fast.

I don't feel like this is an issue with the amount of content available, but rather has more to do with the game's core loop. That, however, is something that will likely change and progress drastically as development continues. As it stands now though, catching pals and leveling them up so you can catch stronger pals to level them up also doesn't really lead anywhere very satisfying, but it is fun for a reasonable amount of time.",1708560755,1708560755,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

game just crashes on me in the main menu, apparently it's due to the epic connection it has. 
hopefully itll get patched soon. the first day that i played it it worked just fine, that was on the 23rd of january.
The game is fun, and i can't recommend it enough but i'd recommend to wait until it's server issues get fixed, since i can't play it at all right now and i'm not the only one. although that'll change once it's playable again since the game is fun, though i'd say play it with a friend, makes for faster resource gathering and it's more fun with a friend anyway, kind of like in valheim. i found out that the issue is an epic connection issue so there's nothing i can do but wait for a fix unfortunately.

update: 
i got the game working by moving it to an external HDD, it didn't work on any of my ssds, other hdds or m.2s 

i've put some more hours into the game and i'm enjoying it, although loading is slow due to having it on an external HDD, it's running fairly well. there are some multiplayer issues, but mostly wonky stuff, nothing too game breaking.
wish that there was a way to party up in-game, after joining a guild to more easily diverse exp gain, right now it's hard to keep levels the same when playing with someone. 

game is fun, i don't like that the eagle has so low stamina for flying, getting wyvern soon though, so hopefully that'll improve it a bit, and i've seen theres a level up tier thing for the monsters, so maybe that'll increase the stamina limit of the flying, who knows. 

not a fan of the waves raiding ur base, fairly easy to do but doesn't really bring much to the game as of right now and i see it more of a nuisance than anything, though it does give some exp and rarely a pal you don't have yet which i guess is a pro for it being a feature. 

other than this, i'm looking forward to more in the future, i believe i heard somewhere that the devs are still making content for the game so that's good. although there's still lots to find, i'm glad that what's there isn't all to come. 

recommending at a 6/10 right now. fun game but the game has some bugs and could run better. & needs work on multiplayer/connectivity issues & more wonky issues probably due to epic servers.",1706183238,1708560713,True,0,0,0.532946407794952393,0,True,False,True

It isn't a copycat Pokemon game that exploit their consumers with nostalgia, it's more! The additions of co-op and survival gave what the community yearned for. No matter what happens to this game after its unparalleled success, future games will listen to the community if they want a chance to make history like Palworld did.

     Played over 40 hours on Xbox game pass before grabbing it on Steam to play with my girlfriend. Build your team by catching Pals and have them gather your resources(where dem ores at) while you enslave people heheh Palworld keeps you entertained without breaking the bank. If you're looking for a plain FUN game that offers hilarious moments where every life form becomes weaponized, Palword is for you!",1706807064,1708552650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I remember how amazing the game was and after I beat the games I was sad. When that happened, me and a bunch of other kids in my school were talking about how to make the Pokemon games better. *Basically* nothing was off limits, I remember one kid saying something like ""it'd be cool to eat them"" (That was the weird kid in school, I was nice to him because I am awkward) or ""You being able to catch people would be so cool, imagine the Gym Leader Giovanni getting a challenge from your character and Officer Jenny pops out and arrests him""

I recommend this game because deep down it appeals to my childhood, wanting to achieve so many cool things in game but the Devs wouldn't do it because Nintendo lacks vision and are puritians in a way. You want machine gun nests? You got it. You want to catch people and make them do your bidding (Same with the Pals)? You got it. You want Swords, machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers? You got it

The developers seem to be in-sync with their inner child and made something better then everyone got with Pokémon

The content right now is rather simplistic and it does have lots of bugs and flaws but I still got a 100 hours of playtime out of it even though I did not really get deep into end game content (perfecting breeds, collecting legendary schematics). I will be breeding the fastest Jetragon for now and then wait to hopefully see lots of content updates.

Some flaws (all in early access - some might get fixed in future updates):
The lock down to regions is pretty much not existent. As soon as you get a flying Pal you can explore the whole map without too much risk of death. This leaves a big question mark if and how this game will ever have more story content than currently (which is pretty much just level up and beat all bosses with no context what so ever). Exploring new regions also becomes kind of irrelevant since there is no real challenge getting there except holding W and shift for a few minutes.

Crafting stuff takes WAY too long or is it fun gameplay to stand and wait for crafting to finish? You may argue that you can get i.e. Anubis and breed him to perfection so it pops out all items real fast but then why is there a stat that I can level for better workspeed (which brings me to my next point).

Most stats are just useless at this point and you should focus on leveling stamina (so you don't instantly drown if you drop below the map when glitched) and weight so you can carry more stuff while hunting Pals.
Workspeed -> gets replaced by Anubis
HP -> just get better shields and armor
Stamina -> useful in the beginning but will become less useful as soon as you get flying Pals
Attack -> Pals do way more damage so why even bother
Weight -> useful

Some questions that will come up in your head over and over again during playing: Why do I have carrying weight inside my bases? Why can I not reset my stats without modding the game? Why can I not have more than 3 bases without mods? Why can I not fast travel from anywhere back to fast travel points without mods? Why does crafting take so long? Why does breeding take 10 years when end game content is pretty much breeding 1000000 eggs? Why do I not just get blasted when I enter regions that are too high for my level? Why do I have to throw 10 legendary spheres when the catch chance is on 70%?

All in all this game is addicting and fun and end game content is optional, which is good, since some players might not enjoy grinding too much. Catching Pals is fun and challenging but can also get frustrating sometimes. You can fix some of the flaws by modding your game which also works on private servers. This game is just what Pokemon fans have been waiting for over all these years of Nintendo pumping out the same content over and over again and I would really love to see this game grow to its full potential.",1708544438,1708544438,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Imagine comparing to the king of crafting survival games when ressources you harvest just disapear. If I cut a tree in Valheim and aren't careful, the trunk will kill me, if I cut a tree in Palworld, there's no animation and the tree just disapears. You need to be careful how you build in Valheim, Palworld has a barebone building system inspired by Fortnite

You can't really build a factory, it's just individual workstations with no relations to eachother. No filters, no conveyor belt, no balancing recipes, just a ""your pokemons can make bullets for you if they walk in the vicinity of the bullet station and have nothing better to do"" just to tick off that checkmark.

Fighting is horrible, unbalanced, you'll spend your time throwing pokemons and humping pillars for the first few hours. Your pokemons don't evolve, cutting pokemons for meat isn't any different than just killing them in the wild with any weapon

It's trash, and they already have another game in EA that they've barely updated and I barely trust indie studios with their first early access titles so juggling two at the same time is a huge red flag

The only thing I have not done is breeding end-game Pals, which I will be doing while decorating my base, waiting for future updates, and playing other games. 

Needless to say, I highly recommend this game despite all its current bugs and glitches. New players have to watch out for hackers in the Official servers though. This is the reason I started a 4th playthrough as these hackers have destroyed our base plenty of times. I advise against playing here until this issue is resolved. I also recommend playing in dedicated servers with friends. My first and second playthroughs were in random servers which did not work out.

*Fully acknowledged that this is early access and so everything stated in this review is written with this in-mind*

Max level on normal mode without adjusting sliders (to make the settings easy). Only change made was no item drop on death. 
Captured all legendary Pals and completed all boss towers. 
Now at min-maxing phase.

Summary

If you’re meant to be studying or working on a project, don’t install this game as it’s highly addictive! So much fun to be had. It is 100% worth the asking price. 
I’d recommend not Googling everything about the game as you go and try and just level through it as blindly as possible as the exploration and discovering new Pals is arguably the most fun part of the game. You really don’t want to rush the journey on this one as it’s the best part.  

The three main pillars of play are:
-	Capturing/Killing Pals
-	Base building.
-	Defeating tower bosses.

Subcategories of play:
-	Breeding Pals/Empowering Pals.
-	Resource farming and management. 
-	Exploration.

-	Not a lot to do at this stage (early access) other than min-max your Pals, your character and your base. 
-	Hardest achievement (that isn’t merely a matter of farming) is capturing the currently available legendary Pals and defeating all of the tower bosses.
-	Once the above is achieved the only real thing to do in terms of actual vertical progression is to re-capture and breed (and condense) the same Pals over and over until you get perfect traits and empower your pals accordingly.
-	You can also farm epic/legendary recipes for crafting the most powerful player items. 

Pros
-	The most fun I’ve had in a game for a long time. Highly addictive and very entertaining.
-	The default (normal) pacing of progression has a nice balance. It’s not too grindy nor is it overly simple and if you want you can put those sliders where you want them and turn it in to what can essentially be a sandbox game with almost zero difficulty or time-management (I wouldn’t recommend this at least until you’ve hit max level as it saps the fun out of it).  
-	It’s a very good-looking game. 
-	In essence it’s a very simple game but it manages to bring the best elements of similar games together in a way that strikes the balance between “this is really fun and just enjoyable – I’ll do my own thing” and “I’ve got to put an extra build in or capture another ten pals for XP – sleep is for the weak!”
-	Can see endless potential for end-game and wider development. 

Cons
-	Pathing of Pals can be clunky af. Sometimes you’ll return to a breeding base only to find that one of the Pals has effed off elsewhere and has got stuck doing nothing. Or your Digtoise has fell off a ledge and hasn’t eaten for 6 hours because it’s now stuck. 
-	At this stage (early access), end game feels a touch empty and depending on what you enjoy it is a tad “pointless”. Endlessly trying to min-max Pals when you can already clear the hardest content in the game begs the question – is it worth the time?

Personal Wishes for Further Development
-	More raid/tower bosses and vary up the skins/themes of regular dungeons. 
-	An interface to allow solo players to group for raids/dungeons without having to join a multi-player server. 
-	Reduce the number of Pals for the entire “condensing” process. Requiring 120 surplus Pals to empower one single Pal to max-stars is a tad much imo. 
-	Allow Pals to simply be assigned to Breeding Pens via an interface (similar to the Palbox) rather than having to grab and throw them in.

There is a real feel of progression with every level unlocking new items and ways to do things.

The pals that roam the world are well designed, and appear to be well balanced, with the 'catch 10' requirements on your pal deck pushing you to explore the map.

A few shaky bugs I've experienced, but nothing game breaking and the game is in beta so I'm not surprised to find a few - I'm sure these will be ironed out in time.

My only negative of this game would be on the base building aspect, it is very clunky and not the most intuitive at times. Coming from other survival games, I think I expected more from the building system here and the capabilities of item placement. Having said this, this does make this more rewarding when you make a nice looking build. I imagine this will also be doctored with time.

Palworld gave us something that has been missing for a long time - a huge map thats heavily populated with content and variations. I have not had so much fun exploring a new games map in a long time, no matter where you go you find pals to interact or fight with. Consistent generation of resources and chests, randomly generated caves which are great for finding new gear.

Being able to play with friends in multiplayer has been great, giving callback to various survival games we have enjoyed over the past decade. I think the simplistic approach to pals and how they are used to work within your base (Work suitability and passive skills) really hits that itch to breed the best pal for the job. The ability to edit world settings;  adjust spawn rates, damage multipliers, and other elements means you can customise your world to not feel like a grind trying to get levels up and collect necessary gear to progress.

Although at this point in time I have defeated every boss, and caught every pal, I am still interested in playing more. Looking forward to updates moving ahead",1708505003,1708505003,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

My only real complaint thus far is the limit of 5 carried Pals, there are just so many cuties I want to bring on my adventures, but I get it.

It takes a lot of different gameplay elements from a lot of different games, and blends them all together.  Like open world survival craft?  Like creature collectors?  Like shooters?  Like base builders/automation games?  This takes many of the best elements of each of the genres and wraps them all up nicely in one little box for you.  I'll summarize a few takeaways that will make your gameplay quite a bit more enjoyable.

Of course it has it's bugs given how new it is, but many of these can be worked around with a little reddit reading and insight.  Some of the biggest QoL hacks are as follows:

1) Don't play on a public server unless you're a severe masochist or hate yourself.

2) Single player mode and private servers remedy most of the issues seen on public servers.

3) Materials in base can be accessed for crafting from anywhere in base, but you can also move them without placing them in your inventory.  Open a chest, drag the item out of the slot, and hit tab.  This allows you to go to another chest or your palbox without the carry weight burden and either open your inventory or chest to place the stack.  This allows for item organization and item transfer between bases easily.  No need for the slow walk of shame.  Place chests next to crafting stations so you can move heavy stacks of crafted items this way by first placing them in a chest.

4) Wood burns.  Fire pals sling fire in combat.  Build with that in mind before you go all grandiose.

5) If production is frustrating you, stop and watch your pals for a few minutes to see where your chokepoints are, then adjust accordingly.  Sometimes a specialist pal can fix all your problems over a jack of all trades due to a lack of other distractions.

6) If you play on a server constantly online, you can avoid pal injury by putting them away until you get back on.  If you value material farming as a priority, ensure you can buy/produce sufficient high quality meds before logging off and leaving them online to work without you.

7) If you have jumpy/graphical/fps issues, you can almost assuredly fix it with a bios update/display driver uninstaller-clean start.  You don't need a wildly powerful machine.  This caused me a lot of grief on my wife's PC until i just broke down and finally went through the process.  Just do your homework first.  Immediately fixed all her issues and she's running an i5 with an rtx 2060.  Old driver directories and audio drivers can wreak havoc on your performance.  I likely would have written if off if my PC hadn't been running it just fine and is the same other than I have an rtx 2050.

8) Raids are fun, but can cause the game to crash due to massive spikes in memory usage.  If you're finding it problematic, particularly on a server, they can be disabled.

9) Entering dungeons/rapid exploration will cause crashes sometimes.  Expect it until it's fixed.  This one is what it is.

10) Most issues you can find an answer to by going to the palworld reddit and searching your issue in the subreddit.

11) IF YOU DIE AND HAVE DEATH PENALTIES ENABLED, YOU CAN RETRIEVE YOUR ITEMS/PALS/GEAR FROM ANYWHERE IN THE BEAM.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT ON THE GROUND WHERE THEY LAY.  FLY ABOVE, AND RETRIEVE YOUR STUFF SAFELY.

12) If death penalties are proving an issue due to clipping and falling through the ground when loading in, simply disable them or pick the penalty you deem best until the issue is resolved.  Again though, even if you fall under the map and lose something, you can access it anywhere within that vertical column of light.

13) If your frustrated your pals wont carry food to your cooler/fridge, simply split stacks and fill all the slots in the feed box with food, and ensure your cooler or fridge is the second closest storage container.

All-in-all, I literally can't avoid recommending this game given how well it's performed for me at launch compared to other base builder/survival craft games.  I personally find it absolutely worth what they are asking for it, and the roadmap has a lot of tantalizing features they have in the works.

I'm really looking forward to seeing what this game has to offer (raid boss for tree... wink, wink).  The legendary pals are tough and definitely deserving of their namesake.  The crafting is fun, but the base building could use some tweaks.  The pal box takes so much room, it's hard to build around it.

While still in early access, it's more stable than some bigger name games have been at launch... or still are 12 years after they released. >.> It's got plenty to do, and you can fine-tune your game world settings (if you're playing single player) to suit the experience you want. Depending on your play style, you can easily get 50, to 150+ hours of enjoyment out of this game before feeling like you have nothing left to do- far higher if you want to get really in to base building.

Base building is still a little janky, and worker management needs some love, but over all, I think it's a solid game with a ton of potential. I say it's well worth the asking price, even if you're not normally one for survival/crafting games.

As an added bonus, the modding community has taken almost as much of a shine to Palworld as it does to Bethesda games, and are creating a variety of mods including visual updates, quality of life improvements, and even some that alter the core game experience.",1708483891,1708483891,True,1,1,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,True

When I first started playing, it was fine, but when migrating the server to a private server (this can be done and there's plenty of documentation on how), the host will lose all progress. There's some weird workarounds by editing the game files, but I just bit the bullet for my friends and re-leveled and recaught everything (probably a couple days worth of casual play). Then a few days later, my friend's account corrupted and he can't even sign in anymore without starting completely over by clearing the corrupted character data. After doing some reading, I found that if someone leaves a guild and all members aren't online, it has a chance to corrupt a random player's character data which lines up as one of our friends left by accident and came back. A few days ago, one of my friends messaged me that they had logged in and all of our bases were gone. This is a locked down server that I routinely check for unauthorized access, it's all stone bases, so it wasn't a fire. Raids are turned off, so it wasn't destroyed. All the bases were built within the palbox boundaries so they didn't deteriorate. No one has rocket launchers, so it wasn't that either. A few forums mentioned noticing the same behavior if no one had logged in for a few days, the bases would just despawn. So after restarting from scratch twice and a few friends getting fed up with quitting, I can't really recommend the game in its current state until the devs finish ironing out some of the game-breaking issues like these.

If you've got a lot of patience and don't mind restarting your progress over and over randomly some times, there's a good game there and I hope they keep at it since the time I was able to progress, it was a lot of fun and QoL pathes made the game much more enjoyable each time.",1708482928,1708482928,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

It results in e.g. mating pals teleporting on top of buildings, and not being able to get back to their station. 2) Pals still stand around getting hungry and don't always reset unless you do it manually. 3) Picking up pals to assign them to tasks is faulty. Sometimes the ""Press V to pick up"" option doesn't appear, depending on what the pal is doing. 4) Level 2 mining pals should prioritise level 2 mining tasks (e.g. ore) over other tasks (e.g. stone). 5) Sometimes pals just wander around despite having available tasks, even when they're not on a break. 6) Pals should not leave their stations to fight in raids when a. you are not present, b. the raiding pals can't even reach them. Example. I went to a base and every single pal had slid down a bit of mountain to ""fight"" in a raid (they couldn't reach the enemy) - meaning no cakes, no coal, no honey were being produced for over an hour, and everyone was starving. This happened TWICE in one session. 7) It's too easy to damage your own walls and stations when fighting in raids. Remove friendly fire for allied structures 8) Attacks push enemies through your own defensive walls and into mountains making participating in raids a chore. 9) Production rate at bases seems totally random - sometimes you get heaps of eggs / ores, sometimes you don't, and it seems to depend on things like e.g. quick travel. 10) All of the standard armours come with level 1 cold protection except the most powerful - pal ingot armour... why? If a basic armour can't even be worn at night it's basically useless. 11) Stairs don't work? You can only walk half way up stairs and then you have to jump. Solutions: Give us a GUI to assign pals to tasks and set priorities. Give enemies basic collision detection (???). Reset pals when they are idle or hungry for more than a few minutes. Pals only participate in raids if they are directly attacked or you use an item (ring the bell?) Stop moving pals around randomly when you leave a base, keep them at their station. Calculate production rate evenly when away from base. Give standard pal ingot armour level 1 cold protection.",1705788930,1708478498,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In my humble opinion and as a long time pokemon fan myself, the reason why this game is good at least partially, is because it is tapping into the untapped potential that the Pokemon franchise never explored with a game. That is, TRUE open world pokemon, with real time battles, survival inbetween towns and gyms, and actual consequences to the player. Again, this game is not Pokemon, and IRONICALLY thats one of the things actually holding Palworld back is that it isnt actually pokemon, but it is doing what pokemon failed to do, and proving just how absolutely starved for good games some of us might be

On its own merits, Palworld is good. Its just incredibly bare bones and basic, right now. I really hope the devs put more meat on the bones of this project because the foundation is rock solid. Like, they arent gonna make a Pokemon killer franchise, because lets be realistic here, Pokemon is not going ANYWHERE, but the right moves made with this solid foundation would go a long long way.

It is essentially ARK with pokemon/digimon designs plastered over it. Unfortunately, it suffers from game-breaking bugs, many of which go against or rob the player of fun experiences. 

The pathing of the pals is bad. They don't do well with walls or stairs, which can limit the space you have since up isn't a great option -- especially since you need massive entry ways for the later, more efficient pals. If you're on a dedicated server, expect to wake up to any combination of hungry, depressed, and/or almost dead pals (or straight up dead). BTW anti-depressants are expensive to make, if you don't abuse certain mechanics with the black marketeers.

Battling is also a bit of a challenge. I've had days, more and more as I play, where pals just circle each other and don't attack until a solid minute or two have passed. Makes catching them easier, but it also feels cheap to just stab an standing target.

This isn't to speak anything of the floor glitching, falling through the world, randomly falling (and dying) pals, and the numerous other ""features.""

The latest bug I've encountered, which makes the game actually unplayable, is taking constant DOT because of accidentally spawning a clone. Essentially through some kind of mishap, a second you is created and takes constant environmental and hunger damage. This kills you over and over again. The only ""fix,"" at least for servers, is to reboot the server. 

Outside of bugs, there isn't any character customization once you make your character. From my experience this is a common practice, even if I think it is a little silly to wait so long for something that outwardly looks easy to employ.

The story exists in random journals scattered around the world. It isn't heavily pushed or marketed which makes it significantly less interesting. I would like to see more purpose added to the game beyond the tutorial. 

House building also isn't great. You can make cool bases as long as you don't want any corner roofs. Also you have to spend precious tech points slowly gaining most of the decor so things look nice. The weirdest thing for me is the palbases are circular and all the foundations are squares. I didn't understand that design choice.

As a $30 EA game, I do not recommend it. It has its fun moments, but at this point in time, the bugs outweigh the enjoyability. 

TLDR; The game has many bugs that make it not fun to play. For the price tag, that makes the game not worth it. Many QoL features are also missing. Scattered story. Put on wishlist, but follow development if you're iffy about buying.",1708474318,1708474318,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played at first on a server with just a few people that ended up becoming 12 people later. Restarted as a duo with a friend for 20-30 hours and then restarted again as a solo. I can speak for all parts of the experience from vanilla to boosted resources and everything in between. Virtually no server issues on launch. 

As a solo, the game can be quite a challenge on vanilla. I recommend setting egg timers to 0 and just breeding pals for good traits after about level 30-35. It not only provides more passive exp, but progresses your available pal roster.

This game seems to have quite a bright future. Some have theorized a certain landmark in the game in the northwest to be the center of the map, indicating a further 3 quadrants may be added in the future. I hope they run away with the idea of map expansions. I have waited a long time for a game like this.

TLDR; Had the best launch you could expect, is receiving updates, lots of progression. Great experience solo or with friends

Im sure everyone has heard the comparisons by now, pokemon, ark, rust, etc. Im here to say bump all that and judge this based on its own merits so for ANYONE who is looking at this you have a very good idea from someone who had done all but max out every single pal in the game whats good / bad / ugly. The review is obviously my opinion but i love this game. The game was built with FUN as the 1st priority, you will find easily as many hours as i have or more figuring things out, trying stuff, and exploring (if you dont google everything and wheres the fun in that), and building an ""empire"". This game has a little something to entice everyone WITHOUT offputting ANYONE. If you like crafting survivial, its here, 3rd person shooter its here, having companions that you can strengthen and ""customize"" its here, character building and tech its here, building castles its here, difficult challenges and problems to solve its here, exploration and world ""building"" its here. The graphics and gameplay are awesome albeit a bit clunky, however theres charm to the art style which will remind you of BOTW. Combat will remind you of dodge mechanics seen in from software games, and combat can be fun with different movesets and boss variations. There are however some bugs and glitches that will drive you up a wall sometimes. We hope Pocket Pair will fix these things before giving more content because i personally think content here is ample but we NEED to have the smoothest and seamless experience this game COULD be. You also have some issues with pals pathing, being stupid, or otherwise bothering you. Character movement is again clunky, and aiming, shooting, etc can be rough and unpolished. All things an early access title is expected to have.... the goal being these issues are addressed sooner rather than later with the roadmap content updates they have planned being on the backburner (please). This game is EASILY worth your $30, or less depending on sales when you compare it to the AAA GARBAGE that is being put out in the same genre or things this game is compared to. I dont think anyone ever wanted Ark, pokemon, etc to be THIS game but i tell you what compared to the hot BS pokemon is putting out, the buggy and BS MESS ark is now putting you through from a greedy developer, and more thats so prevalent now a days in this industry Pocket Pair SO FAR has been a diamond in the rough of good stuff for gamers. I sincerely hope they continue this path and make this game absolutely colossal in the coming months / years and when its time to lay Palworld to rest (inevitably at some point) i hope Palworld 2 or whatever they make next shares the fun nature of this game and delivers on what so many companies today fail to do; make a fun sandbox of a game for gamers to explore, have fun alone or with friends, and sink time in without feeling its a waste or takes too long to get going.

There is a considerable variety in ""pals"" although I hope more will be added with future updates. The overworld feels alive (unlike pokemon legends arceus) and there is plenty to do wherever you go. The game gives you a large amount of all kinds of settings you can adjust as you like before entering a world. Building your bases is fun too.
 
A few negatives:

1. The sound seems glitched sometimes, if you leave or faint in a boss battle, the fighting music often continues instead of the normal overworld music playing. 
2. Limited bag space is very annoying, even with pal skills that increase it, if you hit the limit (which you will if you active loot rs) you will move much slower than a snail, the slow down is too ridiculous, though limited bag space should not exist at all. It forces the player to constantly return to a base and come back to the rs location, over and over and is just a huge waste of time. 
3. Some attacks (at random!) by enemy pals and bosses come out instantly, which is a huge flaw. A player can not dodge something that has no indicator, and no charge.
4. Wild enemy pals have no aggro range limit, they will follow the player until you defeat them or you die. Any WoW player will know why this is another big negative.
5. Once you fast travelled, you often get attacked by nearby enemies as soon as you spawn near the fast travel loaction, which can easily result in you getting spawn killed. There should be nothing in close proximity to any fast travel location.

Keeping it at a not recommend until these issues have been fixed.",1708077752,1708462438,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That aside however, once I get in game it runs well, but has some frame drops in new areas, especially when in fights with pals that use a lot of particle effects. I have the minimum specs, so this is to be expected though.

Overall, I do really enjoy the game. It's fun and engaging, and even a bit challenging in higher-level areas. It can feel grindy sometimes having to get more resources, but that's what pushes the player to find new pals that can do the work for you.

had a few little bugs but nothing as yet major in 15 hrs

game has been steady and fun if just needing a tweak here and there (shocking right!)
will update if that changes and understand how some can be upset with early access as I have been there !
also your rig and experience may well be different
but for me overall this is a LOT better than most of the EA titles I have ever played this soon after release so in all honesty I will see where this goes (a lot can change)
looking good to start and interested to see what it is at full release

Well I completed it... did NOT expect to get hooked at all !
there are a few little annoyances and things that are already being looked at like the having to lift pals to set work is a bug bear but all in all they really knocked it out of the park for a new dev with a new game!

This is the kind of game that Nintendo should have released years ago, and this game will probably stay pretty popular until they do. 111 different kinds of creatures to capture and breed in an open world sandbox setting that has all kinds of PvE opportunities and base building.

That said? I do have a few small gripes with what seems to be some core features, not bugs. Bear in mind that these are mostly opinions on my part, though, and not really factual statements. I'm sure there are those who enjoy some things that I don't and vice versa.

1st.) Pal Sphere capture rates: Unless you're playing on casual mode, or have otherwise tinkered with the settings? The initial blue spheres become obsolete almost immediately. Aside from the first three pals out of 111? These things are basically useless, you're more likely to accidentally kill the pals you're trying to capture to get their health low enough for the capture chance to be worth it. It would be one thing if these things weren't so resource demanding to make, but by the time you're set up to make these handily? They're already practically useless and you're on to Megaspheres, which are even MORE resource intensive.

2nd.) Player attack targeting: So... there's a targeting reticule, but your attacks may, or may not, actually go where that's pointing. More often, they'll just automatically try to target whatever Pal happens to be within your line of sight and closest to you, which has gotten me killed on many occasions when my attack veered way the hell to the right and hit a level 35 Mammorest instead of the level 5 Lifmunk I was ACTUALLY trying to hit. That REALLY needs to be fixed, like, ASAP. Please and thank you, devs.

3rd.) Map glitches: This game is SUPER early release, and I understand that. Thankfully, the devs foresaw this issue and included a 'respawn' button in the options menu in case you get stuck. But the sheer number of map glitches I've experienced in my nearly 100 hours of game time thus far has been kinda ridiculous and could use some serious and immediate attention.

There are other minor gripes and complaints I have as well, but most of those are just the result of the game being as early out as it is. I would still highly advise anyone interested that they buy this game now before it becomes completed and the price increases further. You're going to regret it if you don't.",1708457067,1708457067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

While there are some glitches and bugs, none of them are completely game breaking.  If the game is already THIS good while being in early access, I cannot wait to see what it's like upon full release.

This is a great game, if you're into ""cozy"" games, particularly because there are so many settings that you can mess with to tailor the gameplay exactly to your style.  Don't like raids?  Turn 'em off.  Hate the idea of building degradation?  It's gone.  The ability to make those individual changes goes such a long way to making these game enjoyable for everyone.

My biggest complaint about the game is the lack of auto-run.  If you've got wrist issues, this WILL begin to impact your gameplay and limit your game time.

It doesn't do anything new or unique that hasn't been done before in some other way. But what this game does right It goes all in on making it one of the best early access survival/craft games you can buy. People always compare it to pokemon which is honestly stupid and ignorant, because this game and pokemon have nothing in common except from creature capturing. The combat isn't built around RTS and pals aren't really scaled at all for combat. The typings don't flow like they do in pokemon and each thing is only strong to one type (except fire which has two strong types). If you want to compare it to anything, this is Ark meets Breath of the wild. 

Starting off with the pros, the game drops you right into the world and let's you go do whatever you want. There are several starting locations you can respawn to, but you're better off just staying in the area it drops you in.

A few NPCs will guide you on what to do, and the tutorial system holds your hand through how to build a base and level it up. Once you hit level 20 you can go challenge the first boss and the boss fights are really fun. You have free range to adjust just about every single setting in your world down to how much damage you deal, how many pals spawn, how much damage you take, experience you gain, etc, etc. The freedom of the game is the best feature and i don't think enough people really appreciate that.

Another huge pro is the freedom with building and how easy it is to just get into. Most survival/craft games make it a chore to build and limit you on what you can do. Palworld let's you do pretty much whatever you want. You get up to 3 main bases you can leave pals at, and you can craft small bases anywhere on the map. There are a few restrictions to building that I hope gets fixed in the future (snap tools being added, place stairs easier and where ever I want). The real fun of the game comes from making your own bases and defending it from raiders, and i can't wait to see how this improves in the final release.

The bad is...well a lot. Unfortunately cheating is a massive problem right now and the developers are working that out, but playing on public servers is risky. Thankfully when they add in EAC it will be optional to turn on for private servers and single player which is amazing.

Secondly after the 15 hour mark the game becomes a long, tedious grind where you have to strategically place your bases for farming rather then what's fun, or else you'll be wandering around. You can technically capture humans which is funny at first, but loses its appeal as you realize you can't really do much of anything with them. They will only attack with fists even if they are armed with weapons, and working around the base they are decent but not decent enough to replace a pal. The one exception is the black market dealer who you can place in your base and buy things from.

There's a lot more I can talk about and break down but I think this is enough. If you like survival/crafting games, enjoy base building and third person shooting then you'll enjoy this game. If you go in thinking it's a pokemon clone you'll be disappointed because as I said above, this is more like Ark.",1708424726,1708424726,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

That being said, there is a great deal I don't enjoy about Palworld.  I really do not enjoy the survival mechanics, and the crafting grind later in the game is really, really slow.  There are very few Pals with actual good designs. Almost all of them look like the dollar store versions of existing pokemon.

Sum of Gameplay: Exploration, building, traveling and discovery, A LOT OF GRINDING OF RESOURCES, simple combat mechanic, and guns (though not that easily crafted).

The good of this game is that it gives satisfaction on progressing through the game and being able to discover new things as you travel around the game's world. Yes, some of the models is similar to Pokemon's but they at least give it their twist on the mechanics to make it not feel like you are playing Pokemon. Sure you have the models, the ""gyms,"" and the ""spherical balls,"" but you can just beat them up yourself, make them your pal, and put them to work or sell them at the black market.

     The bad is that it's revealed to be a survival build game with a lot of grinding to the game (especially ore). The biggest fix I think to satisfy this downside is to allow servers to edit stat limits especially to weight since you're going back and forth a lot for mining.
     The main point of the game that got everyone (even you) to buy the game is that they put guns in the game. The issue is that you'll have to play at least 4 hours (or grind experience really fast) to get your first gun which would be a musket. The advertised gun in the gameplay trailer is at the very end of the game after playing for weeks 6 hours a day with LOTS of grinding for the resources to make the gun. And that's even if you have the points in the game to make the gun, in order to get anything in the game you need to both level up and get points which is obtained through grinding anyway.

     If the grind is an issue though you can tweak this in the game to receive more materials, but the stats of the character cannot be changed so hauling material back to your building is still an issue (You can either get a pal that can handle your weight limit or you can level up and put points to your weight limit, but then that's the only stat you would be focusing).

     Just so everyone knows, they did remove some trailer videos from their page which dwelled into more of the mechanic of ""sweatshopping,"" but this was removed since they didn't really have a means for people to actually mass produce without you getting your hands dirty.
     There are bugs in this game while this review is posted, but I will not include them here since the developers are REALLY on top of things concerning to be an issue.

     Yes, the game is completely fun. Just that you do have to do a lot of repetition to progress and unlock the cool stuff you are actually interested in.",1706997142,1708413199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you like games like this expect to get 30 hours out of it solo before you grind to a halt in progression and the game loses most of its allure.

Not every game is made to be played forever at the end of the day. Fun while it is, but I won't be returning unless there is a notable update to the game as replayability pretty much doesn't exist here as the grind stops being fun at about level 25 and is dreadful come level 30.

The game is surprisingly stable even at such an early stage, there is the odd bug but after 40 hours of play i've only had  a handful of minor bugs that made no difference to gameplay other than 1 single game breaking bug which was very easy to solve: If you try to ride the Azurobe and dismount in the water and fall to your death so you can't recover your items since they're at the bottom of the ocean, ALT + F4 out quickly and when I reloaded I was up the hill (lucky save position I think) I have put azurobe in my palbox to not be used but I expect it'll be fixed within a month or two.

I guess I should be like 40% of steam reviews that just go  ""It does or doesn't have sex"" or ""I'm gay"" ) or my other steam reviews when I hop in discord one time and ask if multiplayer is worth the trouble despite there being clearly very little reason to grouping up. I can already tell that it's just gonna be people in random places building their own base and collecting monsters, I highly doubt it goes further past that. Then, they bring it up afore mentioned steam reviews for some random irrelevant reason as if some how they got mad at me to daring to question their mid as fuck monster collecting game that I'm surprised has any characters in it with text dialog, or apparently they got mad because they work on this game. lol

Picture this: roaming through the Palpagos Islands, doing your thing, when suddenly, a wild Pal appears. But instead of throwing a Pokeball, you whip out your trusty shotgun and go full Rambo on it. It's like Pokémon meets Fortnite, and let me tell you, it's as crazy as it sounds.

But Palworld isn't just about catching critters and turning them into soldiers. Nope, it's also about survival and building your own little army of Pals. Need a guard for your base while you're off gathering resources? Just drop your Pal into your base via PalBox and watch the chaos unfold during a raid.

Sure, Palworld has its quirks. Some say it relies too much on shock value, and others grumble about its not-so-original designs. But let's be real, who cares when you're riding into battle on the back of a machine-gun-wielding giant yellow rabbit or unleashing a barrage of missiles from the back of a dragon?

Games basically Ark without the bloated install size, more quality of life, cuter creatures and a more straightforward taming mechanic.

Only real issues I have had are some of the bigger Pals getting stuck on buildings in bases we can make, kind of hard to avoid though considering we can catch the various world bosses and they don't shrink in size after you catch them. Path finding could use a bit of work both in are bases and in combat both for are Pals and enemy Pals.

As for the black company treatment side of things, despite it being one of the most mentioned things about the game you really have to go out of your way to be an A hole towards your Pals, I left their work settings on normal, only downside was it took a little bit longer for them to get work done, you can play just fine without needing to mistreat your Pals. 

Once you get the Jet Dragon mount you will probably never be able to go back to any of the other mounts, it's so fast it makes you wonder if you even need to use fast travel.

Late game basically boils down to hunting for rarer schematics for weapons, armour, catching more Pals, breeding, Pals with desired passive traits and making your favorite Pals stronger. Tearing down your bases and rebuilding them more to your liking.

Fixed for 5 minutes then back to constantly taking damage. The game is now physically unplayable for me after 70+ hours. This game somehow has more glitches and bugs than Gen 1 in Pokemon.

TL;DR: Play it, or don't. It's a solid little bit of fun. There are some polish issues, and the menus are a little clunky, but the character controls are smooth, gathering and crafting are relatively painless, there are plenty of drops and pickups, and the Pals are equal parts adorable and terrifying. 


What it IS is a solid survival game with easily recognizable, solidly built survival and exploration mechanics that have become nothing short of an industry standard. Try playing *anything* survival-based without movement mechanics, transportation mechanics, clothing, weapons, crafting, etc. Yes, it has a glider. Yes, it has guns. Yes, it has pickaxes and axes. Yes, it has tiers. What next, are you going to call it Minecraft with Pokemon? That's called Pixelmon, thank you kindly. Pokemon with servers? That'd be PokeMMO. Let's move on to the real meat and potatoes here, yeah?

Palworld looked cool from the second I saw it, and I wanted to at least give it a shot as soon as I saw a giant blue dinosaur with rocket packs on its back. The second I jumped into the world, I realized it for what it was: a love letter to every ARPG and Creature Collector that ever came before it. I can see elements inspired by Horizon Zero Dawn, Fortnite, Pokemon, Minecraft, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Tomb Raider, Borderlands, Monster Hunter, Mario....the developers clearly looked at things and went, ""Alright, so this was successful. People enjoy it. It would fit in our world. How do we make it ours? How do we make it better?"" Did they succeed? 

Yes and no.

Here's the nitty gritty Pros and Cons of Palworld, in my opinion:

Pros:
- Clean, colorful style
- Highly customizable for repeated play
- Recognizable creatures
- Good balancing
- Decent progression
- Ability to upgrade catch rate
- Solid exploration options
- Plenty of pickups
- Well-executed open-world environment
- Multiplayer Option
- Devs that care and communicate

Cons:
- Pals get stuck a lot (logging sites especially)
- Stat Points feel like an afterthought
- Run out of space quickly, in both backpack and storage options
- Polishing issues in the environment (collisions and gaps, mostly)
- Weird loading errors occasionally
- Can't really reliably command pals in your base
- Menu navigation is, honestly, super-clunky
- Keyboard control scheme feels weird

Look, it's not Ark, it's not Pokemon, it's not Fortnite.

It's Palworld.

Give it a go, or don't. If you do give it a go, I have one piece of advice for you:

Don't make the giant leaf mammoth mad until you KNOW you can handle it. Not think. KNOW.

Also, you can play a normal game and just turn off the lose items on death thing. It's in the settings.

Also also, put some bloody clothes on. 

Also also also, don't forget to free the pal in the cage when you come across the campsites.",1708400042,1708400042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is strongly recommended that mouse input and controller input can coexist.
We controller players really like gyroscope aiming, but if the gyroscope is mapped to the right joystick in Steam, there will be a dead zone inside the game itself, resulting in a poor experience and subtle movements will be ignored. If you map the gyroscope to a mouse, the aiming accuracy will be very good, similar to the air mouse effect.
But after mapping to mouse, as long as mouse input is found in the game, it will be switched to keyboard keys. For example, the x button of the controller is used to pick up things. When the game detects mouse input mapped by the gyroscope, the button will flash and change to E/x, and various skills will not be released normally when riding a mount.
Gyro aiming is really good news for the majority of players, and also good news for the gaming industry. I hope kind-hearted producers can consider this suggestion.",1708398996,1708400020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I tend to shy away from EA games, or at the very least piddle around with them for a few hours and then shelve them until they get more gameplay. I'm not one to play a game for hundreds of hours, and then do it all again every time there;s a major update. But, with Palworld, I got . . . hooked. I don't play survival games. I don't really play creature collection games. I don't play (many) crafting games. I enjoy Sun Haven and Stardew Valley for farming games, so I thought that aspect alone might get me going awhile.

It's here the game ""got me"". The game is in EA so it's janky. Pals pathing is terrible and you have to constantly monitor them getting stuck in walls, or refusing to climb stairs. I have crashes when I exit to the main menu and try to go back in. The AI enemies will take off running - straight into a wall. There's not a lot of variety for crafting and farming in it's current state, but what IS there is addictive and fun and it gives me that ""Lemme just do this one thing before I log off"" and then I wind up playing for another 90 minutes.

I kinda expected this game to be a pile of slop that I'd just enjoy for a little bit based on what I saw people saying, but it's actually good! It's really cool having a monster tamer with *this* much interactivity with your ""pals"". You can throw em out to run beside you whenever, manage how they'll help craft stuff at your camp, and you can mount and manually control the moves of a pretty surprising number of them. Once you get some faster mounts the game really opens up. It does really feel like a really good implementation for an open world pokemon-type game. The pals are tied in with pretty much every aspect of the survival gameplay and I really like it.

It's not really beating the ""copying pokemon's homework"" allegations with some of their designs though, like Lycanroc was pretty much ripped into this. He's one of my favorite pokemon though so meh, I like him here too. There are a lot of pretty original pals in here that are cool though, and while they really didn't go out of their way at all to differentiate their designs from pokemon, I think we can let games share concepts like ""water type penguin"" or ""round sheep"" without much fuss. I expected to go into this game and point and laugh at a bunch of plagiarism, but was pleasantly surprised. Any monster collector game is going to feel like pokemon since they dominate the genre, but this is a fun game and does a lot to show cool new directions that this genre can go in.

Strong 7/10 (bugs included in score)

Pros:

- Easy to learn survival system, combat, & pals (tutorial included)

- Informative & helpful UI/Menus

- Over 100 different Pals to catch. Have many uses for combat, resource gathering, traversal, farming, cooking, breeding new pals.

- Buggy, but fun AI & resource automation at home base. Using pals to farm resources at base is extremely useful & very fun to look at.

- Pals have unique animations & personalities

- Can play relaxed at base helping pals, & farming local mobs & resources, building a nice house or explore world and find new pals, tech, & syndicate bosses

- Great pokemon/monster catcher combat fantasy game

Cons:

- Items randomly disappearing when disassembling storage. lost many important items and hours of progress farming and processing resources.

- Clunky gun combat

- Lots of pop In when traveling or flying, hard to see pals at high heights. Needs better fps performance/stuttering

- Pal AI during combat is buggy, especially with large/Jumbo pals & pal melee attacks. Pals also constantly getting stuck in base & hungry, especially when mining ores on non flat ground, or on mountaintops

- Can't assign pal priority tasks

Bugs:

Clicking Right stick works to sort inventory while swapping with storage items, but not in the actual inventory menu

Pals constantly getting stuck while at base and dying from hunger & simple injuries

Pals getting stuck in walls when escaping a pal sphere near walls, or in small areas

Pals Idle and refuse to work

Pals are obsessed with moving my repair kits from one storage to another, all over my base

Pals ignoring tasks when thrown to assign

Pals spawning stuck on top of objects

Pals keep falling off edge of mountain base and getting stuck, slowing production

Pals keep ignoring kindling tasks

Pals ignore ore that is partially clipped in the ground inside base

Pals getting stuck inside wood defense wall

Enemies clipping into ground and mountains when invading base & confuses pals

Base invasion notification doesn't appear onscreen when using pal box or menus

items randomly disappear when disassembling storage

Would like:

Allow transfer of items between bases

Assign resources to be stored in specific storage boxes by pals

Add top down base editing option to move around and place objects

2; A lot of pals, some breeding exclusive, some you need to be maxed level, with maxed level pals and the best gear and still struggle against.
3; Overall plays as a mix of third person shooter, base builder, monster team builder and bits of other genres mixed in to make it a unique overall game with some (VERY HILARIOUS) issues that crop up.

Cons:
1; Building is VERY wonky, and you'd think Foundations would snap to stairs if you are going downhill but you (For Now) will need to find various tricks to put foundations to build a second level up stairs on say a hill or a rock to make a bigger base...
2; Some of the things the game tells you to do are pretty much a 'find it out yourself, newbie' on what the hell it means.
3; On occasion while playing my base literally just clips through the ground, and would wind up stuck underground with no way out, so be aware the building is still VERY wonky, but still fun.

Double (or triple) palbox size; For players like me who like to breed the perfect pals, we need larger palboxes to accommodate all of our projects. Plus it's near impossible to get a 5 star pal from condensing with how little space there is.

While there are elements of survival and base automation, the game centres around hunting creatures by either capturing or killing them to grind through a tech tree. 

If you want to treat your Pals kindly, you will have a hard time enjoying this game, since it is exclusively cruelty that is rewarded.

[b]Updated after 17 hours of game play.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The start of the game has you capturing Pals and building a base, and I found a lot of enjoyment in getting set up. Despite being a survival game of sorts, I had no struggle with inventory management and picking up early resources, the biggest frustration being unable to move buildings and workbenches. Pals help out around your base with delightful mannerisms, giving you a sense of their character. You are also given plenty of time to learn and experiment with the basic mechanics of combat and base building, which I appreciated. 

Pals assigned to your base can become stressed, and they might ""slack off"" and stress eat through your food supplies, but there are no early game mechanisms for the player to address this issue other than 'storing' the Pal away and replacing them with another Pal. More experienced players seem to opt to ""butcher"" the offending Pal before replacing them. Pals get stuck regularly, many buildings require manual feeding of resources, and your base visits will always be a micromanagement chore.

I played fully solo on normal mode. You can adjust grind settings, but I found doing so was a band-aid solution where grind is still unavoidable to craft mid-game items.

[h1]What Could Have Been Better?[/h1]
[b]I wanted to feel my character was struggling to survive on an island of magical beasts. I would have loved some early game structures and better variety of options to address Pal's needs.[/b] 

Rather, the game is content with having you grind to collect as many Pals as possible and gives you no reason to form an attachment to any of them. Why give the creatures so much personality and then treat them as disposable in the game mechanics?

In fact, Palworld seems to nudge you to believe that that Pals are to be treated with disdain. I can only assume such disdain is used to justify repetitively capturing Pals to grind experience points. For an open world survival game, Palworld's has an over-dependence on extrinsic reward. Why is the game telling me I need to collect 30 Pals as my first objective? Why do I need 10 of each species to get bonus experience? Surely the player should be the judge of how many Pals they need to manage their base and accompany them on journeys? 

Instead, grinding is used to compensate for lacklustre world building. Minor adjustments to the tech tree could make it more balanced. The NPCs scattered around do little to help enrich the world building, and their shallow dialog detracts from it if anything. I would have loved if Palworld did not feed exposition in the form of dialog and on-the-nose shock value, but rather introduced implicit storytelling. 

[b]Building a community of creatures and collecting new species, especially of a more challenging variety, is where my enjoyment was rooted.[/b] The real-time battles are certainly fun and the game might be worth it for that alone. One frustration I had with combat was the risk of accidentally killing Pals before you can capture them, even after repeated capture attempts despite an enemy being one hit from death. Again, the grind comes in of crafting increasingly more powerful Pal Spheres to capture them.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Palworld seems to try to appeal to audiences of creature capture and monster hunter games who were looking for something slightly different, but not too different. I like the idea of creature capture games, but I was never able to get into the series of games Palworld tries to imitate, and I suspect this is why Palworld falls short for me. I do not like grinding without meaning. The addition of a story, or more focus on the role-playing aspect of the game would have certainly sold me on the concept. Or at least better base building & management mechanics beyond butchering misbehaving Pals. Palworld explores dark elements like slavery, but offers no moral contrast - shock value without meaning. 

[b]I would love to be given choices that would allow for me to form meaningful connections with my Pals or with the world itself, but alas, I must capture yet another dozen Pals to grind through the tech tree.[/b]


[h3]Updates[/h3]
[list]
[*]The treatment of Pals gets worse as the game progresses. If you want to treat you Pals kindly, you will have a hard time enjoying this game. Its difficult to ignore that Palworld prioritises being edgy over making its game mechanics enjoyable. Take the Butcher Pal command - few players enjoy sitting through the butcher animation to get those bonus resources. Why not add a ""release Pal"" command alternative, or NOT give bonus rewards for butchering? In Palworld you play as Evil or Very Evil, there is no in between. I would just prefer if I had more options.

[*]I am coming from survival games like Sons of the Forest and Enshrouded, where survival, exploration, and base building/management are the focal points, and where the grind is more immersive and intrinsically rewarded, allowing the player to measure their own progress and do things in their own way. Palworld is very restrictive in how you play, effectively giving rewards for completing a checklist of tasks.

[*]I have expectations around bugs and content in early access games. I've played too many EA survival games with known bugs that persist years after release out of EA. Pocket Pair does not have the best reputation maintaining updates for their EA games. 

[*]I maintain that even after 15 hours, Palworld feels shallow as far as survival games are concerned.

This game really captured me and I enjoyed it with all of its bugs. I could potentially go past them. But after having two stacked bases, with very rare resources, items and materials, everything was lost from a simple action of leaving an inactive guild. Yes, without a warning, both the bases exploded, leaving me only with all my pals but zero resources. Feels like a lot of hours went down the drain for no reason. Very disappointing.

Now let me tell you about the bugs i turned a blind eye to:
Combat glitches - enemies get flung through walls and get stuck there. No, it does not happen once in a blue moon, but in almost EVERY single combat, especially in dungeons. Rookie design error.
AI stuck - not just being stuck into walls, but the AI of your Pals and enemy pals freezes occasionally. Leaving them to be easily picked off.
Base chaos - a lot of Pals are huge and the base is always tiny. When Pals are in front of a box or PC you want to use, they block your access. Also when you have two objects too close to each other it will be a pain to try selecting one or the other. Also, your pals get stuck, or refuse to do the jobs you assign them to (sometimes they do, sometimes not)
Empty husk of a world - with lots of treasures given generously to distract from the fact that there is no story. Just landscapes with spawns. And 5 towers, which are the equivalent to gyms in Pokemon, but can in theory be all completed within half an hour if you are high enough level.
Lack of elemental thematic - while I really enjoy the 9 distinct types and a simple circular type effectiveness chart, there is not much ""theme"" that sets the various types apart. The game has just a handful of moves for each type, and everyone can learn any move, which kind of kills the themes a bit. 


I turned a blind eye because I was sick of Pokemon games, and this is a very fresh take with a lot of elements I wanted to see in Pokemon and some fresh ones that I did not know about.

But when a game wipes ~30 hours of progress, it's too much, and I can't overlook that. It's the biggest sin a game can commit.

But Early Access!

Yes, I understand it is early access and it is a very ambitious project. And I was really really patient. But If you ponder purchasing this in Early Access, I'd say give it a pass unless you are a massive Pokemon fan. It's got a really long way to go and the mechanics of the game are not there yet.

Before I say what I find is important, I must emphasize that I'm not writing this review to hate on this game. I don't wanna put this game down. I want for this game to become better, A lot better. What I see here is a great concept and a good mix of multiple games (Such as Pokemon, Breath of The Wild, Minecraft, Fortnite, Elden Ring etc.). This game is basically a mix of these games and many more. And though I like the idea of this game itself, man does it have so many issues that make this game an absolute slog to play through.

For starters, I LOVE the Pals designs in this game. They look amazing man. Honestly, these designs are better than modern Pokemon designs. And I mean that wholeheartedly.

I also love the boss battles and how they're designed. The combat itself even! I think the combat in this game is fairly balanced, and the level system/catching system is fairly evened out so that its enjoyable and good for this game. Honestly, this game has a lot of merit in its capabilities. I also think the fast travel system is... fine. Kinda a worse version of breath of the wilds fast travel system, but it suffices. I really am looking forward to future updates in hopes that these things, and MANY others things are improved upon in the future.

Now for some of the bad stuff. One of the lesser and more minor issues is that the map feels incredibly bland and empty. I understand that this game was released in early access. It was released that way to garner attention and hype for this game, hence garnering more money for the team as well. I can also understand that the devs may have released this early due to wanting some perspective from the fans too. But look, none of these reasons are (In my opinion) good enough to justify releasing a game in such a bland, boring and broken state, and calling it GOOD. As you go through the map at around maybe mid-game (Which in every world the map is the same for everybody which is incredibly lame) you start to see the same pals over and over again. So many places in this game feel insanely empty, and thrown together. So much so that I was literally able to walk INTO the map structures in some places, which in my opinion isn't a HUGE issue, but it is embarassing on the devs part and really makes even the 30$ price tag hard to justify (Again, EVEN if it IS early access). This game feels rushed and bland in so many places, to the point that it literally lacks its own identity. And that would be okay, only if it wasn't such a BAD copy of the games its trying to duplicate.

Speaking of this game being a bad, bland and broken copy. The graphics and characters (Not the Pals, Just the characters) look like they were ripped straight out of fortnite. In fact, the whole games graphical style looks like an empty version of the fortnite map. And I don't even like fortnite. Ain't play it fr in 5 years. Yet the first thing I said when entering a world was ""Wow, this looks so much like fortnite"". And it doesn't get better graphically later on at all.

Moving a bit faster here, The stat system is like a 5/10. I'm sorry but the whole weight thing is garbage and makes the entire game feel like an empty slog. They should replace the weight system with a speed system so the player could run faster, considering it takes until like lvl 37 to get a mount for an ACTUALLY POWERFUL PAL. All the pal mounts at the level 20's are available for using Pals that are bad for your main team since they're weak and underwhelming in combat. And running in this game without a mount is so slow that its just awful. Thats just how I feel about it.

Bugs, glitches and crashes roam around this game like wildfire. They make the experience much worse, so please be ready for them. Ik a lot of people say this but I don't think the brokenness of this game is still emphasized enough, considering how much it really ruined my experience of the game. Falling through the map, crashes, pals stuck in trees, pals stuck in buildings, its endless. And Ik peoples excuse for it will be that this is an early access game, but that just doesn't justify releasing such a badly broken product in my opinion.

Soundtrack is not great. Very generic boring songs, but I can get past that since it doesn't really matter too much for this style of game.

The building. The BUILDING. What happened here?! The building is so terrible man. Idk how on earth they managed to make it as bad as it is honestly, and Any new players gotta see it for themselves. It feels so clunky and innaccurate, like, again, a worse version of fortnite. 

Moving even more quick here, the food system is pretty bad. Just make a bunch of berries and cook em and you're good, no diverse food selection needed. But 9 times out of ten your pals won't even eat any food set for them since their either too big and glitch inside the walls of the base, or they just don't feel like it, so they start starving anyway. That gets very annoying as well, and that problem never stopped for me throughout my almost 50 hours of playtime in this game.

Theres so much more I can say but MAN. This is Palworld. I wish the best for this game and I really hope it improves. As a matter of fact, some stuff I would love to see from it includes,

- Randomized Map seeds
- Bringing your single player pals into online multiplayer for battles and trading.
- Wonder trade system, similar to Pokemons.
- More fleshed out environment in maps and less generic dialogue for npc's.
- Lots more Pals
- Fixed building system
- Speed stat
- Less berries around the map to balance out the food system
- MORE WAYS TO GAIN GOOD AMOUNTS OF XP, PLEASE!
- Dungeon Map (Dungeons suck to walk through)

And so much more.

That is my review for Palworld. Also for the record, I got almost 50 hours out this strictly due to the Pals themselves. I really like their designs and battle mechanics. So I made the goal to try and catch all of them. All of the issues I mentioned made this game absolutely horrible to play through for me, But I still managed to get around 90% of all the Pals. I also played this game in multiplayer with people, so that's another thing to mention. I'm likely done with this game for a long time until more updates come out.

	- Recommend playing this game with friends in a guild to make the world feel a little less lonely. The game is still enjoyable solo however.
	- You need to enjoy the 3 elements of creature collecting, base building\crafting and survival. If you don't, you won't progress far in the game. Co-op doesn't alleviate this.

	- Game focuses on catching multiple of the same Pal's to get XP.

I have made it to level 43 and really have no urge to finish the game at this point. It's the same thing over and over again, and there really isn't any type of reward when you finish a boss fight or something. (the boss fights don't even feel like an accomplishment) (Also seems to get really ""grindy"" around level 40 as well.)

The appeal at the beginning is discovering all of the different types of pals and what they can do. When you realize they're all pretty much the same, except visually, you start to question why you are even playing the game still.

I think anyone could get a solid 15-20 hours of fun from this game, but the fun drops off dramatically at some point due to the fact that there is really nothing to do; the world does not feel dynamic. Sure the pals are cute but that's about all this game has going for it after 30 or 40 hours of play time.

visuals are nothing amazing, just a technical pass, but yea pokemon style so well it not gong for cutting edge visuals anyways by design, so yea, just a pass, can be forgiven, nothing amazing to be seen. 5/10 visuals.

audio, technical pass, nothing amazing, but annoying on the combat music kicking in all the time. 5/10 audio, should be better, but early access, will wait and see.

AI is dumb as rocks, technical pass for what it needs to do since its just a pokemon style game, but it could do much better if the AI had half a brain, 5/10 as is, again will wait and see.

Gameplay concept is good, but not well implemented as of yet, it has some fun elements, but get tied in with poor implementation or lack on content as things progress, balancing issues, progression issues, repetition, building issues, basically the longer you play the more obvious the issues become, its a game that is clearly not finished in development = a good thing as this means the devs arent treating is a finished game or that = a instant thumbs down.

they have made a stack on $$$, so they have no excuse at this point to go the full mile, the full distance to make this game good, so for now its thumbs up as its a good start, but it better keep going and i expect to see some major content drops and changes by June 2024, otherwise the dev has no excuse, zero, none, zip, they got more money then they could dream to get and unless Nintendo drags them into court, they can afford to get people working on this game full time and get the content out, since base, core game and functionality is already there.

Far as AI bs used to dev the game? havent seen any evidence, just claims this far, plus AI isnt a fullstop label and most people who bitch about it, have no idea what they are talking about, have no clue how it works, their entire education is a youtube vid by a idiot and at the end of the day it doesnt matter long as copyright isnt infringed and it hasnt been AI or otherwise as this game currently stands, so who cares, most the Pokemon copy/paste claims are a bogus and depend on stupidity to believe it or fanboyism to drive it. Nintendo is a absolute starved beast when it senses the slightest opportunity for a legal case, yet they have done zip... After all the same case could be made against them, if per say we imagined they won a legal action, others now would have a case against Nintendo, as Pokemon are hardly original to Nintendo. virtually every game would come under scrutiny, so no surprise Nintendo are not doing anything, because the Pals are not direct overlaps, eg direct infringement.

its also Nintendos fault for not giving gamers what they want, much like how the indie seen keeps growing for the same reason AAA just dont care to deliver the goods, when someone else does they will make $$$, its not rocket science, so i hope to see more of it, especially as AI make it more viable for people who lack technical skills, but have all creative skills to make a good game.",1708388273,1708388517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You end up having to farm chests at specific spots on the map for ancient technology tablets which only give 1 technology point. Another thing is that capturing pals is about all that is there to do. The only extra stuff you can do is breeding pals for the perfect one (takes such a long time for just 1 of them) and leveling yourself up which will be a grind because to do that the most effective way is to katch 10 of each pal.",1708382473,1708382473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's basically as they say. pokemon with guns. so it has the same game play and vibes of a pokemon game which we all love let's be honest. and i haven't even gotten to the place where you build the factory chain like bases.
then recently the game developers responded to the drop in players after a few weeks. and let me clarify this, they are legends.
their response was if you play palworld we love you, if you don't anymore we also love you no hard feelings. go play more games more genres more types of games ect ect aka, they are not salty about players playing different games. 
they mentioned we are a small company we need more time to develop new expansions but no worries they will come and we hope to see you again by that time.
and this gamer response, makes these guys legends in my book. i feel the developers are not business men in here to make a quick buck but these are gamers developing something they genuinely love. and that deserves the highest of fives. 

I will continue playing this game, sure switch it off with other games. but this one won't be forgotten. and when the dlc arrives i'd be happy to invest again (yes i said that. i don't know if it will just be a update for free or a paid expansion but honestly the way they responded to the drop of players makes me think F it, the game was reasonably priced, if the dlc is that as well i'd be happy to pay a few bucks to expand the game again.)

You can have a total of 3 bases with pal workers (I personally think there should be more). You have a pal box with 16 ""boxes"" with 30 slots which sounds like a lot of space but this game gives you more exp for catching pals and for those of us who like to get the best stuff quick that space gets used up quick. You can also tier up pals by condensing them amount of pals needed growing (4, 16, 32, 64) making it to where you need 116 of the same pal to get a max tier pal which is a grind of itself and taking up 116 slots out of your 480 slots which is almost 1/4th of your palbox. The game is loads of fun with friends or even by yourself. I have had loads of fun with the game and it still has some early game bugs like if you are fighting a boss sometimes they will get launched into the sky and be right back at their spawn location sometimes with full health but thats if they come back from the stratosphere. Pals get stuck on literally everything which causes them to starve if you are not paying attention to them cause you're grinding out levels or a new saddle. You have no actual control over any storage organization when it comes to your pals and it seems like they just put stuff wherever making it difficult to keep your storage consolidated. You cant build on water so dont make my mistake and build your main base at a pond with a waterfall (did it cause I liked the view and thought the palbox had more base building space then what it did). Would be nice to have more base room as well. Overall though for it being a new game and all I give it a 3.5/5.",1708377631,1708377631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I 50'd a character... then had it crash on start of the game repeatedly and thought the save was borked and started and 50'd another character.  The crashes on gamepass were so bad I switched to Steam.  This is a much more solid and stable version, as there have been no crashes yet and gamepass was crashing for me multiple times on start of game, then it would either freeze or crash every 20 minutes or so.

This game is Ark, instead of Dino's you have other creatures that can help you around your base, doing your work for you (usually much better than you could).  I expected to not enjoy the game but was pleasantly surprised.  I don't believe this game is prefect, it's far from it.  It's not going to blow you away with amazing graphics, the AI needs work and the game will drag for you in the 30s and 40's.  It may get sued, it may not be the most original game out there, but it's surprisingly fun.

If you enjoy spending 5 minutes fighting something and trading out your pal's trying to keep them with agro while you whittle it down with your crossbow, dodging attacks and then cheering when you finally have the capture succeed, this is your game.  If you enjoy spending 2 hours making your base reach to the sky to see if it can be done, this is your game.  If you enjoy finally beating and capturing a max level world boss, powering it up and then building a team of equally unfair pals, then marching them into a huge boss fight with the timer ticking and your not sure you have the damage to beat it but you go all in anyways and spend a ton of resources nuking it with mines, rockets and grenades, this is your game.",1708366628,1708366628,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game is a mash-up of a lot of other well loved things.

It's good in this sense, because you see so many things you like coming together, and to see HOW.
From Ark, to Conan Exiles, to Pokemon. There are even Dark Souls influences and more!

For anyone who plays a lot of games, it's well worth exploring for that reason alone.

The down side however, is that it tries so many things, it'll inevitably be weaker than the originals. You have to allocate your effort points somewhere, and this game did it on ""merging genres"".

Which means, its down sides include:
- no real automation
- not as ""pretty"" as satisfactory or ark
- the building mechanics are very basic, and incredibly restricted (area size). They don't even come close to measuring up to Valheim, or ark
- the breeding mechanics cost a lot, and don't get you much (not infinitely scaling like ark)
- the combat is too easy, and bosses fall absolutely flat compared to Dark Souls. (these are more time trial bullet sponges)

Should you just play those other games instead? No
Because this is a very interesting thought project.

And it's hilarious just to see what memes they manage to pull off with JUST ""Pokemon"" and ""GUN!""
Hell, just getting in to a fistfight with a terrified pokemon to catch your first is barrels of laughs.

Overall, it feels more like a play-and-put-down kind of game.

Making the effort to avoid as much info on this game as possible has got to be the best decision I could have made.

I haven't felt such wonder and awe playing a game since gens red/blue, crystal, and ruby/saphire.

This one time, I wandered too far from my camp, and forgot my torch. As night fell while I wandered around some old ruins, I can still vividly remember the shock and awe I felt when a shrill cry heralding fell wings, lit ablaze, icy blue and haunting, bore down on me. The panic I felt as I scrambled to switch to my crossbow and throw out one of my pals, only to realize that I'm almost 10 levels under. The exhilaration as I'm down to my last pal, out of arrows, and I just barely manage to catch it with 4 balls to spare from the 60ish i started with.

I remember the absolute hype I felt when I stumbled upon katress for the first time. The feeling I had when I stumbled upon wixen for the first time can only be described as ""seeing the yu-gi-oh duel city duel disk sitting on display across the aisle at toys r us""

My most recent highlight memory from this game was when I was out catching a couple box worths of wixen, and as I made my way along the coast next to their spawn point, I saw what this majestic looking Phoenix soaring way up high through the air over the bay north of the lava river. Gentle sways of still, flowing red wings of absent flame. Bright, striking yellows piercing through billowing crimson plumage. Too far off for me to get a name out of it or show up in the paldeck, so I could only sit and wonder. I spent a solid 2 or 3 mins just sitting there staring at it as it gently glided by. I'd been spending about 9ish irl hours in this area hunting for wixen captures, and this was the first time i'd seen it. I continued on my way, coming back to this area regularly for more wixens. It had been a solid 3-4 irl days before I decided to take a break from this game, and I had yet to see it again.",1708362985,1708362985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

At lvl 41 and 184 hrs at the time of this review: 
It's been a long time since I've felt this feeling from a game. Like FANF, Undertale, Poppy Playtime, ect. had before in the past. It feels like the beginning of something big. These games gave you curiosity about the world and the people in it. It gives me the feeling that it CAN become something great, OR it can become another shit game rotting on the pile of poor decisions of the devs. It's tittering on that that knifes edge right now,  

I had a hard time getting the game to stop crashing first. I finally started to start working after I used -dx12 in the launch options section in the General settings of Palworld on steam. There are youtube videos to help with those issues, but the devs REALLY need to get that fixed so you need to jump though hoops to play. That or I have a shit computer. 
As for jank, bugs, and breaks: nothing too game breaking. In the beginning caves/dungeons I gotten above the map by using the grapple hook in the center of the big open areas. You can short range teleport pals into walls if you fail to catch em since they come out up and to the right of where you threw your sphere. A list of other things. Annoying sure, but like I said above it has jank levels of Fallout 3. Annoyingly lovable jank you can tell your friends about and have a good laugh. Now with the computer specks I listed above I can run Palworld on low graphics somewhat comfortably while running youtube and a web browser (not recommended to run anything at he same time as Palworld). Palworld is a CPU hog to be sure for me at least. If the the Pal jank becomes too much then just slaughter the offending pal to teach the game a lesson.

Now Palworld is made for the long range attacker. Sure you can make a bat or a spear, your bread & butter is going to be your long range stuff/pals which attack mostly with mid to long range attacks. No claws or biting. Guns take a bit to get too. Game play is fine/fun. Building is fun but base space is limited, but you can have multiple bases. (everything deteriorates outside of the base till it breaks). The world is enjoyable, varied, and memorable enough to be talk to someone else about it and have them understand where you are talking about.  Dungeons aren't that varied in shape or Pals, but make up for it in looks. A hot area will look different from a starting area dungeon. OH you can slide in the game by pressing the crouch button while running. 

Catch over killi is the name of the game in Palworld. You get more EXP for catching rather than killing. Also get the items when you catch them as well. Pal spheres disappear after use, so if you miss you waste a sphere. Pals themselves are helpful (when not bugging or being difficult) and your workforce. Unless to like the F key on your keyboard a little too much and wish to wear it out, Pals are your to to for base building, resource gathering, food growing and manufacturing. As well as for protection, riding, and gliding. Early levels means you can't have guns, BUT you can build guns for your PALs as a unlock-able limited PAL move. Or (with other unlock-able moves)  turn your PAL in to the weapon like a grenade, grenade launcher, flamethrower, ect. They are upgrade-able. Some PALs are just suited to base work. It's possible to breed pals/find eggs and get PALs you haven't seen or too high of level to catch at the time. 

Story: No story per say. You're on a ""deserted"" cluster of islands with ancient civilization traces all over. Deal with it by force.  There are journals to find, but that's it. The NPCs mostly look alike, with no in depth personality or looks. About one or two lines of dialog for each.  One friendly small settlement with 6 or 7 people in it. A weak part of the game. I would like to see some personality given to these NPCs in the updates. Maybe a quest or two. Different clothes and faces too. 

I've gone over what I thought was important to talk about, and will add more if I remember/new stuff changes the game drastically. It's a good 6 almost 7 out of 10 game and I feel worth your time and money. Even in it's current early access state. Also more and more mods are being made if you're into that. I could see this turned into an manga or anime at some point. Hope this was worth the read and thank you for your time.",1708362544,1708362544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But instead of catching Cows and Goblins you get a fun variety of Pals which feels like a natural next step.
Having the pals running around the base makes it feel alive rather than so many base building games where its basically Hermit simulator unless you play multiplayer.
I like that the pals actually move around on their own rather than the alternative approaches of NPCs that act like talking statues or workstations with animations of people on loops.

My wishlist for Palworld
-I'd like better melee mechanics
-Less stamina drain on gliders
-The first gun, the musket needs a faster reload time as its practically worthless...much better off with bow or crossbow

So I reached max level, explored everything and just have the final 2 bosses left, but I think that's it for me until the next major content update. A lot has been said about the good that this game has to offer (its a great game!) but I want to mention the stuff that I think is genuinely an issue.

There are problems with balancing that become apparent later, XP doesn't scale enough as you level up (single player) so you end up grinding for hours to get nowhere. Then the bosses require different teams of pals to beat, so you end up grinding again to level your pals up. The only way to make this actually work without getting extremely tedious is to adjust the XP level rate in your world options once you hit level 30, but its impossible to guess what the correct rate would be and having access to this multiplier is tempting to just max it out. 

My 2nd issue is with bosses always getting agro on the player. No matter how much damage your pals are doing, the boss will always target the player every 2nd or 3rd strike. You cannot possibly get enough health or firepower to counter this so you have to run and dodge constantly but your stamina bar depletes really fast. If you get too far away you can't monitor your pals health so boss fights are super tiring to do.

3rd problem is large pals, they can't be used in dungeons or caves since they get stuck, they're useless against bosses because they get stuck and dont attack. The strongest pals are freaking huge (looking at you jormuntide) but not usable because they get stuck. Flying pals constantly fly out of your base and get stuck and die or somehow fly inside rocks and get stuck in there. Bulky pals get stuck in trees, builds and items and die. Basically you have to keep only small pals on your base unless you want to spend all your time babysitting them but even then, the humanoid ones somehow get trapped inside rocks too. small pals are the least effort to manage but most useless skills. 

4th The building is pretty bad, it's extremely basic and very clunky. Pals can't navigate through it well and it doesn't snap to terrain well either.

Final issue I have, the last two zones (desert and snow) are really bare and boring, there's very little incentive to explore and continue once you reach level 40 as these areas are very clearly unfinished. I think once you've cleared the fire zone the rest is worth waiting on for the team to update and polish. 

In general though this is still a good game and has scope for many more updates and continuity of play, it has potential to be a long running game if the developers wish to maintain it. I'd love to see classes with player skills as there are 3 different starting zones this should be possible. More equipment and variety of weapons and tools. More villages or more developed ones and more interesting NPC's would be great, NPC quests and challenges would be welcome as well. I look forward to seeing more pals and new island in future updates :) It's a great game and I will definitely return.",1706357958,1708357847,True,2,0,0.54703831672668457,0,True,False,True

There are problems and changes that should be made but the game is in early access so I can't complain too much.

Some things I think would be cool to add is instead of lifting the pals to assign them things to do, I think it'd be cool if theres a device or something in the menu that allows me to tell them to do a bunch of different things. (I know we technically already have one but it be cool if theres more commands you can give pals)

Also, please add a recommended level to dungeons and tower bosses. I've lost a lot of good stuff due to fighting a boss that was way stronger than me.
Overall I enjoy the game and I'm excited to see what other updates are coming in the future.

Some stuff i see that needs fixed is

You cant build to close to objects or other bases. Pals like to walk where your building and block you from building also. Its to hard to Glitch to catch the Trainers riding Pals. This should be allowed as long as its your 2nd time or more fighting them. I don't like the ""Shiny"" sound its annoying but helpful. I realise im not playing minecraft but i cant stress building changes hard enough. People hated the building mechanics in fallout 4 and this is a lot like that. We also need more world options when setting up our game, I am having to use external stuff to change it which is risky in itself, hopefully since im only on my own world or my friends who also uses it it will be fine. Its basically mods but im seeing those up already on the nexus also. Hopefully they add matchmaking or opening your world to public or something.

The world is huge and very well designed. The scope is quality. The guns, armor, and travel modes are great. Exploration is fun. Combat is cool. 

 It would be better without the Pals.  

The crafting tables become obsolete once you advance tech. The pals are glitchy. Pal response time in combat is slow. For it to be the ""selling point"" of the game Pals should engage when spawned not after multiple attempts. Enemies fall through the world. Bosses get killed by humanoid type NPCs through the ground resulting in respawn timers. 


Building is trash. A single shrub on the ground hinders snap points.  After the ""Hype"" this game is just another spot occupying the library that won't be accessed even with future patching.

small issues: your pals never hold agro so you spend the whole time running/dodging. You are also a paper towel and die to one/two attacks. Annoyingly hard to capture pals as you yourself do little to no damage unless you have end game guns. Your pals like 2/3 shot other pals, so you can never really get pals low enough to capture.

Some of these issues have been resolved such as falling through the map.  However Pal AI in base as well as mid to late game still have significant issues.
2/19/2024.
***End Update***


After about 24 hours of pal world its playable but god damn is it buggy
Base design doesn't seem to matter match.  Pals tend to randomly fall off cliffs, bug out their Pathing/work AI and have infinite light bulbs, go to the feed bucket every 5 seconds.
I've had 3 pals basically become unusable because infinite light bulbs.  the dodge has no frames, some of the resources are kinda absurd.  Ingots are absolute hell and you never have enough in multiplayer, and food is rather unbalanced the larger pals you have.

Some additional Bugs I've come across are falling through the map while fighting an enemy, luckily this reloads me at my base like a teleporter.  The other is have the enemy fall through the map, not die, and bug out my Group AI.

After spending some time with the Base, it could definitely use a complete overhaul with the ability to have like a management screen of sorts as pals dont want to priortize very well leading to inefficencies. Another big issue is if your base is not completely flat surrounding the palbox you can try to save it with foundations tho it doesnt work well.

In its current state its still decent and enjoyable however If you can definitely wait on this game for some patches as theres currently a Huge memory leak issue as well that has yet to be addressed.",1705905263,1708353579,False,1,0,0.502074658870697021,0,True,False,True

For an Early Access game, it is already well fleshed out. I am impressed with the number of systems in this game. Creature capture, base building, weather, day-night cycle, crafting, climbing, shooting... Many games struggle to implement half of these. So far (about an hour in) the game feels the right amount of scary and chill. Night time brings cold and some Pals that will one-shot you. But it is also chill enough that you have time to explore, catch Pals, and build a base without having to micro-manage every second. I am definitely looking forward to seeing what all this game has to offer.

(Edit) 115 hrs in:
Not going to spend a lot of time here as the game is wildly popular and no one will see this review anyways. This game is pretty amazing. Honestly, the marketing/buzz did it a bit of disservice. There is surprising depth to this game. Many times I encountered something and thought ""wow, some thought went into this""; the breeding system, the type advantages, and team composition to name a few. You could spend an entire 2 hour session doing just one of these: upgrading your base, raiding dungeons, hatch and breed pals, prepping for and fighting a boss. Each of these activities has its own pace and feel. It is nice to be able to change pace in an open world survival game.

Are there some bugs? Yes, mostly minor things from my experience. 
Could the NPC navigation use some work? Yes, sometime npc's will get caught on walls or rocks.
Could base  building/defending use tweaks? Yes.
Does any of this make the game not fun? No, it is a blast and deserves all the hype.",1705673992,1708348788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's Pokemon with guns and Fortnite!

Overall Score: 8/10

Pros:
+ Cute Pokem- I mean Pals
+ Great Pal animations
+ Great customization, although I want more depth like making face type and beard separate.
+ Great graphics, even at low settings
+ Great world and atmosphere
+ Ok UI
+ Ok combat system
+ Ok soundtrack
+ Ok building mechanics

Cons:
- Assigning Pals can be clunky
- Pals pathfinding
- WANTED mechanic being too basic
- Optimization issues: FPS drop in certain areas
- Some bugs and glitches (from other people. I haven't encountered those so far)
- Capture rate. IDK if the Lifmunk effigy bug is true or not
- A bit grindy (given that this is survival game), although you can tweak and customize difficulty and exp rate.

Things IDC about:
- Public multiplayer. I think this game is not designed for that. It is designed for single-player and co-op experience
- Story. Do we need some?
- ""Pokemon ripoff."" Like c'mon. Really?
- ""Ark ripoff."" Like c'mon again. Really?
- ""Zelda ripoff."" *sigh* no!
- ""AI art and asset flip."" Hypocrite! ik yall using ChatGPT in your homeworks or resume or coding or whatnot! And this has been debunked lmao
- Slavery and animal abuse. It's player's choice afterall. You can enslave them or not. It's a free country. You do what you want.",1708332229,1708332445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

PRO
. Pokemon with guns description is apt despite the core gameplay loop owing more to titles like ARK. Letting the player get involved in the thick of battles is not only great; but makes it feel like the title Pokemon should have evolved in to by now.
. The pals automate alot of the tedium around the crafting survival genre, keeping micromanagement to a minimum & letting you do what you really want to. Explore & capture pals.
. Like grand strategy, crafting survival titles usually bore me at some point, here though it's addictive. Thanks not only to automation from the pals, but also handles progression. You're given a to do list of base upgrades to accomplish & once done, bam you can unlock more research for further upgrades & better equipment.
. Takes the darker elements of it's universe & does what Pokemon refuses to do; embrace them! Kill & eat pals. enslave humans, work your pals like they're in a Chinese sweatshop & the pal Lovander exists in lore & game as blatant (parody) horny waifu bait!

CON
. The pals look like they don't belong in the game's world. Same problem as Sonic Frontiers. The world looks photorealistic while pals & humans are animesque. So there's this jarring clash of artstyles.
. The core crafting gameplay is copy & pasted from the devs prior, & still in early access, game Craftopia. Which itself was basically Breath of the Wild crossed with ARK.
. Bugs & glitches are still fairly common & mar the experience. During the first syndicate raid on my base, one thug didn't even reach it because his foot got caught on a bridge. Then after getting dislodged he kept hovering in the air. This may be in early access but it is very stable so when these happen it can be annoying.

Overall I'm glad I got it. The game kicks ass & can only get better as updates are released.

Building needs still a lot of work (like you should be able to place foundations on top of another and there should be more variety in pieces (triangular foundation, please)). Also path-finding of pals needs fixing (they get stuck or drop through the floors in base quite often).

Still ... this game has a lot to boast about and if gaming system is not that innovative on it's own, it's definitely a successful mix from others. For me it keeps interesting even after playing quite some time.

Pokemon is honestly a tangent in this game as it just about art style and the way it looks similar. But what they can't take away is the utility from the pals so they don't just stay in your pal box(poke box in pokemon) as storage. Since it's early access, I can say that single player playthrough is by far the best to get your money's worth as dedicated is it counterpart. Super laggy and more bugs on dedicated that pals tend to get sick due to pathfinding and other issues my friends were having in the game. If I had to tell you what makes the game easy is the moment someone posted about breeding combination; opening the possibilities of possessing powerful job pals to automate your base much faster than a average player.

My experience has been on a dedicated server so if you're planning on playing with friends on a dedicated server, expect the worst and hope for the best. I would assume playing the game solo, locally on your own machine would work just fine. But there are constant bugs such as: not being able to swap to a weapon, falling through the ground, rubber banding back into enemy skills, pals not respecting fixed assignments and just doing whatever, entire secondary bases freezing with no production if you're at a different base or out exploring the world, pals getting stuck when pathing which leaves them starving and debuffed. The list goes on, but you get the idea. It's hard to know how many of these issues are rooted in the hosted server specifically versus in the game itself. But given that it just released and their warning about bugs in dedicated servers, I suspect it's the latter.

I cannot recommend the game for multiplayer in its current state. I would say just follow along with development and if they squash a lot of bugs then try it out later! The concept is rock solid and the gameplay is fun (when it works).

I have ventured into realms both real and fantastical, yet none hath captured my spirit as Palworld hath done.

From the moment mine eyes beheld its radiant landscapes, adorned with creatures of whimsy and charm, my soul was enraptured. Yon creatures, companions of feather and fur, doth frolic and gambol in fields of verdant splendor, invoking a sense of wonder that doth stir the depths of one's being.

The tapestry of gameplay, intricately woven with threads of adventure and camaraderie, doth beckon the weary traveler to embark upon a grand odyssey. In Palworld, one doth not merely play, but partake in a symphony of creation and exploration, where each encounter unfolds a tale of friendship and loyalty.

Oh, how my heart doth swell with delight at the sight of these creatures, loyal companions in the face of adversity! From the humblest of beginnings to the loftiest of heights, they stand by our side, steadfast and true, a testament to the bonds forged in the crucible of adventure.

Yet, it is not merely the companionship that doth captivate the soul, but the myriad wonders that abound within Palworld's embrace. From the bustling markets teeming with life to the tranquil beauty of the countryside, every corner reveals a new facet of this wondrous realm.

And lo, let us not forget the trials that await the intrepid adventurer, for in the crucible of challenge doth one's mettle truly shine. From perilous dungeons to towering citadels, each trial is but a testament to the indomitable spirit that resides within us all.

Let it be known far and wide that Palworld is not merely a game, but an experience unlike any other. A symphony of sights and sounds, woven together with the threads of imagination and wonder. I offer my benediction upon this masterpiece, and pray that all who venture forth may find solace and joy in its embrace.

Oh, gracious Creator of realms unseen,
We beseech thee, hear our prayer serene.
For Palworld, a land of wonder untold,
Where creatures roam and mysteries unfold.

Bless this world with thy guiding light,
Where friendships bloom and spirits take flight.
Grant us courage to face each trial and test,
And wisdom to journey at our very best.

May the bond between us and our companions dear,
Grow ever stronger, year by year.
In Palworld's embrace, may joy abound,
And in its beauty, may love be found.

Guide us, O divine, through valleys and hills,
Granting us strength to conquer our ills.
In Palworld's embrace, may we find delight,
As we wander its realms from morning to night.

So let us cherish this world so fair,
With gratitude, love, and utmost care.
In Palworld's embrace, may our spirits soar,
Now and forevermore. Amen.",1708315018,1708315018,True,1,0,0.514098107814788818,0,True,False,True

I am currently playing the game in a world of wonder. I am not power leveling, just playing for several hours and in that time, hit goals, and discover something new. Today I just used my crafted saddle on my Nightwing and soared around my base island. Along the way, unlocked chests. I also utilized my Average Feed Bag and was able to automatically feed my pet and myself two types of crafted food. I also crafted buff items that help activities in the base. 
     I love this game. Its like a vacation for me. No need to get a whizbang to be the best in five minutes guide. Just play, enjoy, battle, and level up. I love my base, and the ability to craft things within it. I love having my pets all doing things to help out. I think this game is worth buying and trying out. I play solo. Down the road I will go to a public server game and play with others. Even though this game is early access, I havent had a crash or experienced gamebreaking bugs. It got a good amount of polish on it now.

P.S  In terms of the game Palworld, I'm going to leave a thumbs up and hopefully, this review 
has been eye-opening and insignificant in every way

So far I'm really enjoying this game, even with the bugs for an early access game. This is a dev team worth it's weight in gold for there open responses to controversy, and their explanation of the intention behind an early access release.

I despise games that only target new GPUs to run them leaving a minute amount of people that can actually play it, then having the balls to charge $110. As much as many want to believe that Palworld is a ripoff of Pokemon or steals UI elements from Ark or Zelda, word of advice? grow a pair. Palworld is inspired by the best aspects of others games because news flash, they're good ideas. Creativity has given life to this game through the assistance of AI (it's an efficient tool that expedites production).

Overall I'm enjoying this game, fairly similar to Ark grinding for resources, with the help of pals to speed up the process. Definitely some mechanics need altering for flying creatures stamina and speed wise.

monsters collection , base building , explorations , crafting , boss fightings , this game is as much busy then any of your typical open world game.

all of the different monsters you collect fill different roles , some farms , some can help you crafting , smelting Iron , cutting wood or gathering rocks.

the game itself is fun and I've already spent enough time in it to consider it was worth the purchase.

yet I'd say one warning is that in it's current form the game is a bit unstable , I've played it on both my PC desktop and the steam deck and sometime even with the steam deck the game crashed a few times.
from what I see , I think it's a memory issue since the game eat a lot's of ram and the usage just slowly ramp up as you play until the game just give up.

if you want to get this to exclusively play on the steamdeck I'd recommend waiting to see if things get refined and optimised for it.",1708311497,1708311838,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,True

Considering this is early access, I eagerly await future additions to the game with more funding behind it. Now, all that being said, as great as this game is, it definitely suffers in some ways. In my 42 hours of playing the game, I have experienced a few bugs, but not many and nothing game breaking. For instance, one time I accidentally clipped through the wall because i got on my mount when I was too close to said wall. Another time I clipped through the floor when fighting a dungeon boss, causing me to have to re-do the dungeon, which was a bit annoying but not a huge deal. Speaking of dungeons, I think that they need to be fleshed out a bit more. I haven't done every single dungeon in the game, but the ones I have done were kind of the same thing over and over. There are different tunnels that lead away from the main boss, but they only yield basic chests of mediocre items, and I find myself skipping them and going straight for the boss. Maybe there should be more incentive to make the player want to explore the depths of every tunnel and pathway. And lastly, the AI definitely could use some work. There have been many times the Syndicate thugs just kind of stand there when they should be fighting you. Or during a raid, I don't feel like there is an imminent threat because they just run past me for the most part, and then my pals just obliterate them.

My final thoughts...
I think Palworld is an awesome game, especially coming from a small company with such a small budget. I am having a lot of fun playing it with my friend, and if you enjoy survival craft games, then you will enjoy this game too. But do be aware that there are some bugs here and there. One thing that I think would add to the game as a feature is procedural world generation. You could choose the default map, or your could have a randomly generated seed (or manually input your own seed).

The movements were stiff and I found it annoying that I couldn't shealth my weapon or tool and had to leave a empty slot open.

After about a hour and a half I realized how dull and bare bones the game was.

To break it down: 
Catching system: 7/10 the increasing difficulty is understandable but at times seems just ridiculous because at extra low health any ball should have at least some chance. 

Breeding: 8/10 once you can make cakes efficiently it is a wonderful system though I hated leaving the server up when I am offline so I eventually decreased the egg hatch timers. 

Crafting: 7/10  Steady at first but like all games that get progressive the materials get annoying to farm. looking at you high quality pal oil and others that have to be caught or killed to get. 

Combat: 8/10 can be repetitive but overall enjoyable

Bases: 7/10 Need better building options and mapping but overall decent. I like the option to decorate. 

My biggest issue is I want more to explore and more Pals. I think the idea is great. I would also like more dungeons that vary in levels not as dramatic but maybe in 5 lvl increments.

Sorta feels like a freemium game that was changed though not last minute.
Really felt like i got tricked into becoming a game tester.

Pros: 
Funnier than the other tamagotchi.
Lots of ideas thrown in here.

Cons:
Battle is tacky. for a game that's open world of [redacted], should've gone all in.
The gliding Pal (Galewing, that manta and hagyu) isn't usable in combat since gliding is important in battles. 
Switching pal / weapon / sphere is slow with auto-hide UI on top.
Combat on mounts is janky. so many slow casting skills you can't move during. Can't dodge roll mounted.
Pals don't feel too different, all offensive. Should've gone FFXII / DA route with 3 active with gambit + presets on top. 
If pokemon is rock-paper-scissor, then this is that in real time without much of the effectiveness.

Cons Again:
Selling gold coin loses me my money instead.
The repair cost is too high and durability is too low. Good gears require repair using items that aren't sold / auto-mined.
Crafting ammo is too slow.
Crafting pokeball equivalent is too slow even with an ore that you need a specific base to auto-mine.
All bases dont share the same inventory, therefore cases like above you'll need to carry base-focused item (ingot, sulfur). Yet the movement speed when item is full is silly slow.
To quick teleport you need to die / reach statue. But exploring isn't much fun due to lack of objective,.
Minimap aint even there. 
32 hrs in, the first character boss tower after tutorial i can't even spot on the map. Alrd overleveled for it.
I spent most of my time in bases.
Asset & Music sounds like stock.
Only ran into 1 town, and it's dead boy. No story is one thing but NPCs are freemium on poverty

At first glance people may think this. When, really, it's more than that.
I like to think of this game as 'inspired by...' more than just ripping it off completely. 
If you're a child of the 90s you'll remember that boom in 'pokemon clones'... Digimon, Monster Rancher., etc...
This isn't any different. This just takes that idea and adds some, at times, questionable situations.

We all had those thoughts back in the early days of pocket monsters. 

""What if you could use weapons in the pokemon world?""
""Why did they never try to catch humans with pokeballs?""
""Other than chansey working at the pokemon center... why didn't the other monsters have jobs?""
""WTF DOES A POKEMON TASTE LIKE?""

This answers all those questions. Well... kinda. 

However, Even though this game looks as if it has a lot of content...  after playing it for a few hours it becomes pretty boring. Luckily, because it's still in early access this means there is a chance they'll add more content later. Also, because it's in early access it means there are a few bugs in the game. The creators of the game seem to be good at patching the issues, though.

If you like builder games, open world survival games, and poke-clones you may find this game interesting.
If not, you won't be missing anything if you pass on it.

Gameplay (4/5)
Content (4/5)
Monies Worth (4/5)

So capturing Pals, which is required to level up, was such a pain in the ass. Even though it is fixed now, I still find capturing Pals very tedious. Maybe in a year or two when everything is polished the game will become better. We have to stop overhyping these games and wait for release because its not really what people think it is.

Its very open world and I can see a lot of similarities to Ark Survival Evolved so if that's what you're into I definitely recommend this game.

Very rarely do I ever buy a game on day 1 of its release because I have been repeatively disappointed in the past. Pirate Software streaming this game convinced me to buy this game, and give it a chance. 

I have to say I am very impressed this game despite it's early access status. This game despite being unfinished is more complete and fun than other so called AAA titles on opening day. Palworld is still in active development and Pocketpair has shown commitment in improving the game. I look forward what Palworld v1.0 will look like.

What I would like to be incorporated in future updates:
*More optimized server and client
*More stable on Steamdeck
*Able to set specific servers as favorites
*Have full controller support on the PC version of the game.
*Have a separate box for favorite pals or a way to set pals as favorite, which can be easily sorted
*Have condensed pals become worth more in the condenser when used as fodder 
*Have an unlockable tech upgrade that lets you see IV of captured pals
*Have a minimap on the screen, which could be toggle on and off
*Have 20 base pals when playing on dedicated servers like when playing on single player

That, coupled with no end game content or story really leaves this game feeling like a copy of Pokemon meant to draw attention (successfully so) but doesn't do much to keep you entertained beyond the shock value or what you can do.

Long end: I bought this game for the giggle factor after reading the reviews and being interested in the idea of a ""real world Pokemon"" experience.  I enjoyed it at first, but there was so very little engagement and a massive amount of frustration with the amount of bugs there are (there are A LOT).  

It felt like I had taken on a babysitting job for my Pals.  They can not walk up the stairs you build, at all.  However, they will somehow teleport items they gather to storage containers they can't get to.  I end up having to go through all of my storage to compartmentalize everything each and every time I go to my base.  They also can't walk around certain landscapes or structures and frequently end up in trees somehow.  They also seem to have a severe case of ADHD, jumping from one task to another, regardless of whether I assign them to one or not.  Seriously, it's like watching a seven year old run around the house from one activity to the next and it's exhausting to try and get them to stay on task.  I don't even have kids, but I have a preview of what it's like now.

There's also the factor of enjoyability.  So, yea I can run around and murder Pals for loot and experience, but what else?  I can build a base to make that easier and store things to assist in the murder of these creatures.  What else?  There really isn't anything as far as I can see.  No reputation, no notable features, no engagement with the NPC's.  

There's also the moral quandary I feel when playing.  I'm literally just going around murdering creatures, enslaving them and eating them with no moral implication whatsoever.  You have so many opportunities to exert some level of dark impulse upon these creatures and I feel bad doing it, even if they are just digital beings.  I know some people would look at this and think I'm silly, but I dunno man, I'm reading some of the reviews and seeing I'm not the only one.  

Anyway, that's my feeling on the matter.  Maybe in like a year or so this game will be more worthwhile, but for now I feel like I wasted my time and money.",1708284330,1708284330,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Few things to consider before buying:

1) The game is very buggy. Yes, the game is in early access but some of the bugs are game breaking. Pals have troubles with pathing, sometimes getting stuck on fences and just starving. Sometimes pals will suddenly teleport to the top of a house. This is very time consuming just spending time dropping pals into the box and taking them back out.

2) I haven't been everywhere in the world, with about 43% of the map explored and I've captured 85 of the 111 pals. Either not enough pals in the game or they are not spread out enough. 

These are the two most pressing issues that I see about the game at this time. Definitely worth a play through, but just be aware of the above.",1708283820,1708283820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's more grindy and less focused on combat, but you are able to dodge attacks, as well as i-frame them, so dodging forward through an attack is a viable option too.
There's not much to the story other than small hints you pick up from talking to npcs here and there, but it's not like there's anything hidden or grand either. They are just spoilers on whats to come.
You are given a mission to seek the towers where the bosses are. They are quite visible even from a long distance so you have the goals right from the start on where to go. Thus exploration comes in the late game, when you already have a fast if not the fastest mount avaiable.
For time spent, its:
~5% bossfighting
~5% exploration
~30% collecting pals (the game's actual levelup mechanism)

The single biggest issue is the totally wobbly base-building. It is impossible to build consistently and on top of that the AI path-finding is so janky for the Pals that even simple stairs and fixed game-world terrain cause them to malfunction, jumping off into space, running in circles or just getting hung-up and doing nothing.

Other issues such as falling through the terrain, having your Pals disappear or having them all teleported into some group-love pileup and made comatose are also game-breakers that need to be addressed before this title is worth buying.

Hopefully they also fix the logic and balancing issues with breeding trees, i.e. crossing low-level Pals resulting in epic end-game pals which make ll subsequent boss fights a complete joke.",1708279467,1708279467,False,2,0,0.426229476928710938,0,True,False,True

Is it a bit like ARK? Yeah. In the ""survival and build"" aspect, sure... but you could also argue that ARK is like The Forest. Or Rust. So the genre of ""Survival Games"" is kind of simplistic in that if you have a survival aspect of your game... it's going to seem familiar.

Is it a bit like Pokemon? I suppose. There's cute useful creatures that don't look like normal IRL animals, that have silly names and super powers. But if you want to argue that. Palworld is to Pokemon, as Pokemon is to DragonQuest. In that regard Digimon is to Pokemon as Palworld is to Pokemon. Anyone remember Monster Rancher? That was a thing. What about those rip off games on the phone that are literally Pokemon but instead of pokeballs they use ""soul traps"" or some garbage like that? What about Monster Hunter: Stories? You catch Monsters... and hatch monsters... and fight with them... and ride them... In either case- Pokemon did not INVENT the 'monster catching and fighting' genre. It just grew larger than any others. Squeaky wheel and all that. 

Is it like Breath of the Wild? Okay yeah. There's some sounds... and the open world aspect of the game that seems VERY much like BOTW. But again- BOTW did open-world right. it's also sorta like Dark Souls in that- where you can wander into an area you have no rightly business being in at the level you are and get absolutely CLAPPED. Then collecting all the effigies is kind of like the Korok seeds... but way easier. Since they glow so bright at night, if you have a flying mount you can practically see all the ones on the map!

So yes, the controversies have valid points, but there is no ""New Games"" anymore. Everything has practically already been done. The only thing I can say is these guys sat down one day and had a conversation about games and the basis must have been ""what things about these amazing games do we hate? I hate how in Pokemon you HAVE to evolve them to make them the most powerful... why don't we make it so you DON'T have to evolve to be powerful, you just make a slurry of OTHER creatures of that particular one and inject it into that creature to make it more powerful! I HATE how in BOTW you can climb anywhere- but you're completely limited by your stamina which is garbage. Why don't we make it so you can have a setting that can make your stamina drain less- for people who would rather just be able to climb everywhere, then the try-hards can leave it at normal and struggle with the stamina, while everyone else enjoys less drain!"" etc etc. in that fashion.

I for one very much enjoy all the pals, they do seem VERY similar to other things we've already seen... heck I even have one nicknamed ""Totally Not Sylveon"". But it doesn't bother me at all, I GREW UP with Pokemon. I was there when Gen 1 dropped. (God I'm old...) so you would think I would be upset about what others are complaining about. But I'm not. It's honestly refreshing to have a game like this... a game where us Pokemon fans thought we were getting after being teased with Arceus. But was slapped in the face when it wasn't continued like that. So YAY for these developers for understanding the need for a game like this... then added GUNS!! That was part of the game I wasn't really into, none of my Pals have the gun attachments they can have... not even I have a gun, just the crossbow at the most.

I just hope Poketpair (in their Discord) allows for the community to draw/create pals that can later be implemented into the game! The possibilities then are endless- and it would create an engagement that most people crave for games like this! Looking forward to new updates and everything moving forward with this... Pocketpair can rest assured, at the very least, they have ONE fan in me :)",1708278213,1708278213,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

the pals working at the base at first seem simple, but later on it takes some proper planning to get them running the base properly since higher tier pals will be able to do multiple tasks and won't always do what you want them to do.

as it is still early access at the timme of writing there may be bugs, but my experience has luckily been limited to pals somehow getting stuck outside of the base (im looking at you chikipi's that are suddenly on top of trees) and ending up hungry.

Base building is nice but i would like to be able to upgrade existing base without destroying it first.
I have noticed that pals get stuck on rocks or even outside my walls and starve if not moved so that's not handy.  Maybe add a pal door that only they can go in and out of for that.  
Relocation is also a pain when you move areas.  Resources in containers have to be moved a little at a time; base resource sharing would be nice even it needed a pal allocation for it; like fallout 4.

I went to click on her to talk to her, yet I bitch slapped her. Then she showed me her real personality, all of her boyfriends came out to kill me. It was saddening. I ran and ran to my own secluded place, and constructed my own fortress of solitude to keep that horrible lady out. I continued to build my base, collecting more and more Pals to help me with labor, to complete my ultimate goal. Several in game days passed my base was better and better, my weapons more damaging, my pals even stronger. Then I knew it was time. I marched my way back up to what I thought was my first love. I stared her dead in her eyes, and then threw my sphere at her. Her time had come, she would be mine. One. Two. Three. And just like that, in my box she would go. No more boyfriends. Just me.

Official Multiplayer on the other hand, is a complete waste of time. With zero anti cheat hackers run rampant.

Had my entire base completely destroyed while I was offline and all my items either destroyed or stolen.

Using modern tech and real-time gameplay to become a TRUE king of the world. You can be the El Chapo of the fantasy island's, your drug? Pal-balls you capture your monster or human slaves with, slaves who do your bidding or die if you wish.

As someone who gets bored of survival games easily, the poke-Pal system really adds a layer of fun and collectability to it i feel most survival games deeply lack. I've already sunk more hours into it, having fun all the while, than i have any other survival game I've tried. I regret the purchase of all those games aswell, they got boring fast for me. Not this though!

Its VERY worth the purchase price, no MTX at all (although a skins/cosmetics DLC pack in the future i'd buy in a heartbeat to support the devs, burning all that cash on dedicated servers) and any of the current issues I've encountered thus far are all very solvable by the devs if they do their part in the future, its an early access release so i wont expect some mega-patch next week to fix anything though. 

Make sure you check and recheck the settings of your world save when playing, to customise your playstyle to suit you, many of the more obnoxious and irritating game mechanics can be reduced or removed by your whim via the world settings. Its a huge mark of personal freedom i truly appreciate.

Was a fun combo of many recent successful games/genre's in a very easy to approach/easy to learn (and colorful) package. I will say as I approached the final boss, the last 5% of the game becomes a bit of a slog (which from what I hear, is a common problem in Poke games), and a repetitive grind, but the journey getting to the end was highly enjoyable.

Pros:
[list][*]Plug n Play Action - within maybe 20 of launching the game, you're getting into the groove, learning the ropes and having fun
[*]Responsive combat controls - I often worry about cartoonish bubbly aesthetic games as they sometimes have slow response action/controlls, but not the case here. Controls are super fast and responsive
[*]Huge Map/Lots to explore
[*]If collecting cute anime buddies is your thing, you're going to have a good time.
[*]I sadly played most of my runthrough solo, but my experience with multiplayer seemed to show that that's the preferred route.
[*](Not for everyone, but) Super friendly for younger players: While there are guns, etc. There is no blood, gore, foul language etc. (for some reason the weird obsessed love dinos have a huge fuzzy heart patch over their crotch *shrug*)[/list]

Cons:
[list][*]Pal AI - Number 1 of the top 2 larger issues I had. The Pal AI is pretty... well, shitty.  Whether in a good way (enemy raids on your base simply cannot get past basic rock defensive walls until the last tier of enemies start showing up, and even then, they really can't get it done) or in a horrid way (the AI for Pals doing jobs at your base, especially while you're gone, is successful maybe 50% of the time. Or when you summon them for battle and they just bumble around watching you get thrashed for a good 15 seconds before deciding to help) this is a huge sticking issue the devs need to prioritize.
[*]End Game - Without spoilers, it becomes a game of [stop what you're doing to focus on making nothing but bullets for 10-15 mins] + [try to get your chosen Pals to level 50, but doing so kills resources within 10-15 mins] rinse and repeat. The regularity in timing of base attacks and need for food, plus a Pal AI going bonkers, causes you to have to stop what you're doing to repeat a super repetitive process of farming.[/list]

TL;DR Game was super fun, and worth the price. Had a blast over the last couple weeks playing it. End game needs serious QOL improvements to remove the offputting final grind. Fix Pal AI, and I will be back for a second playthrough by late summer!",1708270065,1708270220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some criticism; scaling for Bosses levels 40 onwards seems exponential, also xp requirements level 30 onwards seems way too high. This can easily be resolved however by amending the world settings for xp gain.

Some of the end game items requiring a massive amount of ore to be farmed etc, this can make it a bit of a tedious gameplay loop for specific items. E.g legendary pal world heat resistant armour is 200 bars, each requiring 4 ore iirc, 800 ore total. Paired with the carry weight this requires a lot of travelling back and forth to the base.

Of course there are some bugs, but I imagine these will be fixed in time, the only disruptive bugs I have encountered is some terrain issues where I've gotten stuck and pathing issues within the base for the pals (Already being worked on by the Devs).

Already have to any and all who would listen. Is the game perfect? no, but heck its not even out of early access at the time of this review. 

I would say, this games greatest short coming, is the fact its incomplete right now. Cause the gameplay, and main loop of, capture, build, capture bigger thing, build more things, is deceptively entrancing. If you enjoy Ark or rust, youl likely enjoy this game. If you are one of those bastards that enjoys messing with people in rust or ark, give it a bit. They are looking to implement PvP in the coming months. For those saying this is a pokemon clone, keep in mind that Gamefreak has never successfully sued Digimon, nor has Dragon Quest managed to get Game freak on the hook for copying their designs. Not to mention the fact that thei've had years to nip Pal world in the bud, but decided not to. Meaning that there is not much they could do against it right now, And I doubt they can in the future, if the sales numbers are anything to go by. 

Drama aside, at the time of this review, the game is good, and has insane potential, minimal bugs for an early access title, and a bright future. even if you decide not to buy it, it recommend at least following it, cause its going places.",1708266661,1708266661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Is it inspired from Pokemon? Yes.
Is it stealing from pokemon? NO.
Palworld is a fun game that mixes the fun aspects of catching creatures, leveling them up (as well as yourself) and battling with those same creatures (like pokemon) and the building of minecraft, and the NPC like pals of sims. 
If you want to mass collect and farm resources, you can do it, but its not a requirement. 
Plenty of different mounts (ride-able creatures) for Land, Sea and Sky.
It also allows your pals to be petted, feed directly from the player as well as emoting (more so player moral support which feels nice)
This game provides players who like to grind out items, battling strong monsters, and exploration, suitable for a majority of players. The ONLY thing I have against this game, is the clipping problems when your trying to build your base, but it is the Alpha so they might improve this in the final game. 
10/10 Game, would definitely recommend.

You have a hella large map to explore and collect resources. as well as Lifmunk Effigies (that can enhance your capture rate as you offer them to the statue - just like in Genshin with the Anemoculi, Geoculi, etc.), and chests! You also have to fight bandits (and capture them, yes), sell Pals on the black market, release bandits from bandit camps, discover villages, and much more!

However, the gameplay loop is fun and addictive, combined with base building. I personally like not having to grind endlessly for a bigger base and Palworld does a good job here.

Long-term however I think this game will not motivate players in its current state. There need to be more challenges, like either more and challenging dungeons or more challenging fights (only allowed to use certain pals or don't use pals at all etc.). In the meantime, as this is Early Access, it's definitely a ""what Pokemon could have been"" and better.

In-order to fight the Pal you (and your Pal) need to get stronger or get a better equipment,
In-order to capture Pals better, you need a better Sphere,
In-order to get stronger and have better equipment, you need to grind (gathering resources etc)
In-order to grind easier, you can use your Pals
In-order to get a better Pal you need to explore and get stronger
When you explore, you met something new or interesting

So me and a few of my friends have been playing pretty heavily and now we have reached a part where the dedicated server won't even run because our map file is to big (59mb) which is kinda crazy to me that the game cannot work after that.

It took some of the most enjoyable mechanics from several games and turned it into something interesting.  Truly a great open world experience.  The bugs are crawling, but instead of making the game frustrating, they give us more things to exploi... I mean experience.   

But the thing that kept me interested, was Palworld's very fast, almost zero loading times aside from initially loading the game.  No lags or sudden fps drops either.  That's coming from a base with 200 campfires...which would be enough to freeze the screen on my other games.

It also gives you a sense of morality, but then winks at you and turns its back while you do you.

The only things I dislike is its early access state, which means incomplete dialogues, no pvp (yet) and  the fact that you can butcher humans, but not breed or equip them or get them to use skills to get the ultimate inhumane companion.

Apart from forcing adorable creatures and people into unpaid labor, there are many aspects of this game that every player can enjoy: base building, farming, exciting treasure hunting, and intense raids and boss fights. The learning curve is thoughtfully designed to ease players into the main gameplay loop without overwhelming them with complex mechanics, so they will always leave their base with a clear task in mind. The world feels consistent with regions smoothly transitioning into one another, and each region having a distinctive landmark or property that makes it unique. The gameplay area is not limited to the player's base plus a couple of fruitful locations for farming; exploration and free roaming are very rewarding, providing uncommon resources and refreshing encounters.

Every encountered creature possesses distinct traits and personality, prompting players to optimize their choices for character progress, taming and bonding with one Pal, only to replace it with a stronger version ten levels after and dispose of the one no longer needed.

This game is more fun than I thought possible. I can't stop playing, even after finishing the game, that desire to collect all the pals, make an awesome base or bases, even thinking about playing a nuzlocke challenge some time in the future. I love this game. It truly is what I wanted from pokemon for decades.

What a game! 
I was expecting it to just be kind of an edgy pokemon, but man has this game surprised me. There's so many cute monsters to catch, and they all have something to offer, skills, work, some you can even ride!
There's absolutely no expectation of you to mistreat the Pals, by the way, I'm doing great on hard mode and all my pals are well fed, have a nice place to sleep, even a jacuzzi to relax in.
The combat is a little clunky and in hard mode you basically have to only focus on dodging and hiding from the other pals, but it's so much fun, catching is a real challenge in this game.

There's a huge amount of content here, and the sandbox, open world nature of the game lets the player proceed pretty much at their own pace and choose the direction they take their game in.

Pros:

 - Robust single and multiplayer experience.  Co-op shines in this title.
 - Lots of different pal types
 - Large amount of base / building structures and decorations
 - Large over world map
 - World settings can be changed beyond just the difficulty level 
 - Developer is patching frequently

Cons:

 - Terrain clipping for pals and players
 - Pals in base may get stuck when trying to reach a destination.  This happens mostly when objects are built close to terrain features or right next to each other.  Pals in this condition may need to be placed back into the box and re-deployed to the base.  

Overall:

The game is in early access at the time of review and the cons (for me at least) are primarily just bugs at this point.  The basic game play offered is solid; it's clear there was a large focus on blending catch / train mechanics with base building, exploration, and crafting progression all while allowing the pals to remain the center of attention in several of these activities.  Types have unique background details and animations that add to their charm and it brings the general world to life. 

At this point it should be clear that this isn't a story driven game, so it's not going to play the same as other monster taming series.  Taken on its own, it's a fun, addicting game well worth the asking price.",1707630476,1708238851,True,1,0,0.50301206111907959,0,True,False,True

• Palworld offers an amusingly irreverent experience that seamlessly combines Pokémon-like creature collection with survival and open-world chaos.
• The gameplay is intuitive, and the combat is both silly and satisfying, providing 100-plus hours of unrelenting fun.
• Despite being an early access title, the game is surprisingly engaging, with intuitive survival mechanics and action-packed combat.
• The cooperative efforts of Pals in automating tasks at bases add a unique and adorable dimension to gameplay.
• Multiplayer mode, supporting up to 32 players, enhances the experience, making exploration and battles enjoyable with friends.
• The game's humor and unexpected features, like capturing humans or giving weapons to Pals, contribute to its overall charm.



❌ The Bad
• Some areas require excessive grinding, particularly for ore, affecting the overall flow of the game.
• Capturing and battling with Pals may feel a bit weird initially, especially with the gun-wielding mechanics.
• Despite the amusing designs, the Pals themselves can be perceived as ""almost copyright infringement"" and somewhat derivative.



⚠️The Ugly
• Technical issues and bugs, while mostly minor, are present, including rough framerates, crashes, Friendly/Enemy AI and multiplayer disconnects.
• The need for manual resource grinding at bases, particularly for ore, can be a cumbersome and repetitive task, specially late in game.
• While engaging, the story lacks depth, and more NPC interactions and evolutions for Pals are needed for higher-level relevance.
• Enemy/Pal AI needs major work.




Overall Score:
8.5/10



Detail break down

🎮 Gameplay
• Intuitive gameplay with a surprising mix of creature collection, base-building, and open-world survival.
• The combat is both silly and satisfying, providing over 100 hours of unrelenting fun.
• Capturing and battling alongside Pals adds a unique and enjoyable dimension to the adventure.

📖 Story
• While lacking depth, the story involves surviving a harsh land and facing off against rival human factions.There is really nothing else to it.

🦾 Mechanics
• Intuitive survival mechanics with cooperative efforts of Pals automating tasks at bases. Areas like capturing, leveling up, and fighting alongside Pals contribute to the overall enjoyment. Some areas, like the constant need for ore, require excessive grinding and manual work.

👛 Content/Price-point
• The game offers a surprising amount of content, with an enormous map to explore and varied activities. Multiplayer mode enhances the experience, making exploration and battles enjoyable with friends.

⚖️ Balance
• The game strikes a balance between creature collection, base-building, and open-world exploration. Some areas, particularly resource grinding, require retuning for a smoother gameplay experience.

Spec Breakdown

🌌 Graphics
• I had no issues running this on my RTX 2080 Super, there were instances of glitches but that was due to the server side of things.



🔊 Sound
• The sound design complements the game, adding to its overall appeal. The chimes IMO can get a little annoying when teleporting to and from places.
The music when fighting is the same throughout the entire game, it drove me crazy after a few hours.



🤖 Enemy/Friendly AI
• The cooperative efforts of Pals in automating tasks at bases can be a bit overbearing. They typically never stay to an assigned task for long and usually move onto other things. This became increasingly frustrating when trying to focus on specific tasks.
Also, there were instances when my pals would just sit at my base and starve to death even though there was food. This to me is the area that needs the biggest improvement.
Enemy AI typically do the same repetitive moves without any change, making interactions go stale quickly.


⛱️ Quality of life
• There are some thign Palworld gets right, and a lot of things it got wrong. When moving items or pals within the palbox, choosing to click and drag or click and move was annoying to say the least.

There's no story or lore that will keep you interested. Although you can find some archives lore when exploring the world but do you really want to read all of it just to keep interesting... ?  The game just tossed you everything to survive from scratch and p*kemon battle. It will be repetitive after sometimes. The game is slow and tedious when playing solo. Good thing I have friends to play with but it only interesting until everyone just wanna do everything on their own. Can't blame them though, because i did the same. 

We made the main base until it can sustain itself then we go exploring, raid some villages, capture p*kemon, breed or butcher them, meeting new enemies and bosses, and build new bases all around to upgrade more equipments in order to survive. Yes thats about it. It really repetitive.  Just do all of that until you become Pal Master.  Dont play solo, play with friends, at least you can see what different shit everyone can pull off. 

Ohh here's the tips when playing with friends if you're lazy player like me, play with them a little while, if they really active players, stop playing for a while and wait until they upgraded every kind of base, come back and free load every equipment and upgrades you can freeloader.

There is no motivation in the game--at least not one I could see--that would make you want to keep playing for hours and hours. The map and especially caves are boring. The only thing it really has are pokemon imitations that you can ride and have as slaves. Overall, this game just feels pointless, boring, and unpolished. Unless you're really into anime-style games with goofy looking monsters, I don't recommend buying this game.",1708232443,1708232650,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Picture it like a less immersive Skyrim, but Pokemon + Minecraft. It can be repetitive. But the current map is pretty large and it's fun to play with friends. I can't see it keeping longevity if they don't spice it up a little bit more. But it'll burn about a hundred hours if you're really just trying to get lost in it all. Once you figure it all out you can start to speed run it through new playthroughs. But you have plenty of content if you're playing the first time. The soundtrack is nice, and the ambient sounds is really immersive.

well its part of a game but its very hollow. will it be one of the very few ""early access"" games that actually changes and adds a tons of content?  i highly doubt it, i can only think of 1 early access game that has actually changed dramatically and became a full game. it'd be nice but as of now save your money. this game in its current state should be 5-10 dollars.

there's basically nothing to do outside of the core game loop of gotta catch them all. the boss gyms are a joke. there's the start of a story but then nothing. there's no end and the tree your supposed to get to for the ""story"" is blocked behind a wall.

the riding mechanics are a cool twist to the pokemon genre. 

the environment and the pals look like they were made in 2 separate places by separate people in separate art styles. its be nice if the environment was done in the same art style and beautiful textures like the pals are.

add some towns with npcs to trade or battle with. the current towns are a joke 
add some form of gyms the current gyms are dumb. just open the door fight the bullet sponge boss then leave the gym.
on that subject dungeons and caves are underdeveloped and serve basically no purpose except for the skill fruit at the end. dungeons and caves have 1 to 5 human enemies and only 1 pal if you are lucky. other then that there is 1-2 chests randomly placed in the dungeon that contain useless rewards and 2 at the very end of the dungeon that have a chance to  have skill fruit. other than the skill fruit there is no reason to go into caves or dungeons. also all the dungeons are the same tile set so once you have done one dungeon you have seen them all, very pathetic..

base building needs to allow for a bigger base and needs more things for building

healing pals is bugged, ive looked online and tried the meds, picking them up and setting them on the bed, ive put them in my palbox and no timer starts. there is just no way to heal my plas so now ive got like a box full of sick or injured pals

on the topic of the palbox, the game has designed into it the feature of combining pals. for one stage that is 64 of the same pal infused into the 65th to strengthen it that is 2 of 16 boxes to level up a pal. plus if you have 1 of each pal in male and female for breeding that is already half of the space for pals and getting other pals ranked up using the infuse system. that makes it impossible to naturally rank up your pals. you have to pick 1 or 2 pals and only catch them otherwise you will not have enough space for ranking up.
solution add more space, preferably the only limit is the users hardware

i hope it gets better but it needs alot of work before this is anything but a ""lite"" or ""fremium phone game""",1706915789,1708225939,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This game will just smother you in cuteness. It REALLY gives me the same wonderful vibes I got when I first stepped into Grounded, albeit with Pokemon-ish mobs in a fantasy world, and more cuteness by far (and NO SPIDERS, for all you Grounded arachnaphobes out there...).

Game world has temperature and food-based survival, as well as trying to avoid aforementioned white fluffy Lamballs rolling over you and other obstacles which can make you die and have to run back from spawn to pick up the loot you dropped on death.

Here's the gameplay:
Make a cute little toon with serviceable customization, nothing to write home about. Wake up on the beach of this new world surrounded by Pals (cute little stuffed toy looking creatures similar to other Japanese cartoons like Pokemon and Digimon). Pick up some sticks and stones and make tools. Night time comes and you realize this brings with it new, more aggressive mobs, as well as cold temperatures which cause you to lose health over time if you don't take the precaution of making clothes, a torch or a campfire to stay warm. Realize you would be better off following instructions and building a base before attempting to venture further. Make or find your first Pal sphere thingy (the little balls you throw to catch the Pals in, I forget the name). Realize it's easier to capture the Pal if you beat the cute little bastard into submission first (but not quite to death...). Feel as guilty as I did the first time you beat one up, but quickly move past this sentiment in about 1.5 seconds of remorse before proceeding to run rampant with the sudden, overwhelming urge to collect more, ruthlessly menacing entire populations of animate stuffed toys with your stick, foaming at the mouth as you go. Plop them down at your base using your Pal Box, and have them perform all manners of menial and defensive tasks. Get up from the computer and wish you could somehow get the Pals into the real world with you to help you with dishes, laundry, vacuuming, cooking, etc. Realize this isn't going to happen, sit back down at the computer, forsake your laundry and dishes for days, watch the state of your real life home deteriorate rapidly around you at the expense of constructing a proper tidy little base full of your new best friends, a bunch of Pokemon-inspired animated stuffed toys in videogame that will never refuse a virtual hug. Die happy.

From the outset, you can reach high vantage points to look out over a breathtaking, sprawling, vivid fantasy world, but later on as you reach those places in the distance you start to wonder if they were afterthoughts neglected in favor of milking panoramic visuals for the starter zone, as higher level zones look lackluster in comparison to the point of apparent laziness, even to the point of being downright ugly in contrast. The starter zones are imaginative with winding paths, canyons and thoughtfully-arranged decorative natural scenes like waterfalls and flowerbeds, then, somehow, they utterly fail at delivering any comparable awe in the desert and snow zones, which are typically the strong suit of many other videogames.

Combat is pretty janky, with your Pals sometimes unresponsive or stuck behind something and unable to obtain a line of sight to a target, and, being a long-time PvP gamer, there's absolutely nothing about it that would lend to any sort of PvP element for the game, so hopefully Pocket Pair doesn't go wasting undue effort on attempting to make it so at any point - the focus here should be maximizing the utility of Pals, such as fixing their pathing AI and combat responsiveness, as, let's face it, the adorable Pals are what we came for.

Lastly, base-building is terribly simplistic and limiting, being some of the most basic and inflexible of the many survival sandboxes I've played. In order to place the roof you end up having to make walls to connect the eaves, which is terribly cumbersome, so base-building is certainly not the strong suit of this game.

But the Pals are adorable. Foxparks are my new spirit animal.

PS - you can play with ACTUAL real life pals (friends) in co-op.

Game is already better in early access than other AAA titles are on release, and, much like Grounded, at a quarter of the install size, though, unlike Grounded, this game isn't overly polished and leaves a lot to be desired (but the Pal animations look great).

8/10 - Say NO to real life. Say YES to Pals. Say goodbye to your friends and family, Pals are your new friends now. You ""think"" THEY are YOUR pets... BUT in REALITY...YOU are THEIRS!",1707676164,1708224997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some pals can be ridden, especially the giant or airborne ones, or even thrown like a grenade. The base building and pal breeding combine with the tech tree to make the late game path to victory visible and crazy fun with plenty of viable options for party loadout and such.

Bugs, specifically, one type of bug that has caused this game to stop being fun for me. One of the core pillars of the game is the base building and having your pals do jobs around the base. This is a fine idea but, whenever you move away from your base for any period of time and come back, you will find that some or even most of your pals are stuck. I have had pals stuck on top of rocks, buildings, farms, trees etc. and they stand there unable to do anything. Even (and this is the most annoying part) the flying pals WHO CAN FLY get stuck on top of things for no reason. If you are gone for long periods of time, they will eventually start to starve and get upset/sick. Micromanaging the jobs of the pals is fun. Micromanaging the bugs involved in the process is not.

Building is a travesty in this game. Compared to it's competition, this game is severely lacking in the building department. Sure, you get all the crazy interior and exterior decor you can dream of but the actual building pieces like walls, foundations and roofs are a joke. You have 3 options for style and a handful of pieces for each. No where near enough variation to make it enjoyable. Along with the lack of style, the actual process of building is infuriating. Trying to snap roofs onto buildings is a nightmare as they have exactly 1 snap point it seems and it's not the bottom of the roof but the peak of it. I found myself making the same basic home for each of my bases because it was frustrating trying to find out half way through a build that I couldn't do something due to weird building restrictions.

Boss fights and dungeons. My only complaint with the boss fights is the arenas. They're all the same. Each boss should have a unique, personalized arena to make the fight actually stand out. The little intros before each fight is a nice touch but when the arena is the exact same each time, it makes the experience less memorable. Dungeons on the other hand, are boring. I believe I read somewhere they're procedurally generated but that is not the case at all. Once you've done one, you've done them all. They're almost exactly the same each time. About the only difference is they may have a different skin on them depending on the region you're in.

As I mentioned before, I know this game is in early access and it's still being developed and I'll end up coming back to this game some time down the line and give it another shot once it has been developed a bit more.

It is more fun in a private world with your friends online, but if you don't mind a lot of crafting in your games, you could enjoy this solo as well but be prepared to spend a lot of time crafting. 

The game's combat AI could use some improvements, a larger variety of Pals, and a fuller world. Player damage feels very low, and when you get to later levels with guns, you will spend a lot of time gathering and crafting ammunition to feel relevant in boss fights. The game world feels a bit too large if you aren't playing in a public online server with multiple clans and bases all over the map, and the creatures and discoverable items are somewhat procedurally generated, so there is a lot of empty traveling around the map while you unlock fast travel points. In your camp, you can direct your Pals to do tasks but they often forget or get stuck on terrain or fall off of cliffs, so that can be frustrating constantly managing that.

The story is also paper thin, and some nonsense.

The devs have been fixing bugs during EA, so I will believe that they will continue to listen to the fans and make improvements and bug fixes, including expanding the game and hopefully dialing back on the crafting because right now it feels empty and there is way too much work involved in enjoying this game. 

Don't buy this game if you have any responsibilities for the rest of the week. It's so fun, but you will spend more than 75% of your time grinding for materials and crafting things. If you don't like crafting games or games with EXCESSIVE grinding then you will probably dislike this game.

Brincadeiras à parte, é um jogo divertido e está crescendo bastante. Mal posso esperar para ver aonde vai chegar. Se esse jogo estabilizar esse sistema de servidores deles para termos servidores privados, e abrirem um sistema para facilitar os modders a inserirem coisas novas no jogo, vai decolar.

After playing for an unbroken 10 hour first session, it doesn't feel like ""Minecraft + Pokémon"" was [i]entirely[/i] what the developer had envisioned. To me, it felt like the vision behind Palworld was to make [i]The Everything Game.[/i] A game that has a little bit of as many different genres of gaming as could be feasibly crammed into one game, Minecraft and Pokémon just so happen to fall within the scope of [i]everything.[/i]

The Game includes elements of:
[list]
[*] Survival Craft
[*] Base Building
[*] City Building/Citizen Management
[*] Factory Management
[*] Open-World
[*] RPG
[*] Even some, limited FPS elements
[/list]
All of them are easily within the game's scope, aspects of the game that you will encounter through regular gameplay. It even includes elements of other game genres, such as Soulslike in the importance of defensive actions during combat, though to a lesser degree than the aforementioned aspects listed above.

Palworld could easily be a fun game for groups of almost any make, though not necessarily any size. The four player limitation seems to be a temporary one, but at least at the time of writing, it seems like the only limitation that isn't just a reflection of where the game is at in development.
Water looks weird? Still Early Access.
Animations are a little janky? Still Early Access.
Limited number of players in one world? That one may not be a reflection of Early Access, but it also may not be around for long. The game's settings allow for the creation of up to 20 guilds within one world, and I can't imagine that being a thing if there were only ever going to be four players at most, I suspect that's a temporary problem.
While the number of players in any one world may be limited to four, I believe that any group of four friends could easily find something they enjoy doing within the game; there's enough different kinds of content that each player could even branch into doing their own thing, separately, but have it all tie in well enough that it can still feel like a cooperative effort.

tldr; don't get Palworld because it's ""Minecraft + X"" or ""Pokémon + X,"" get Palworld because it's [i]everything.[/i] The developers continued work on the game will determine just how [i]everything[/i] the game continues to be.",1708211663,1708211663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Has a lot of issues with pal pathing, random clipping from getting hit by mobs that forces you under rocks or trapped under the surface of water to where you can't get out... you die from lack of stamina.  Today the game glitched on reloading and I was stuck in a ""box"" of ground with a yellow sun in the middle of the screen.  Attempted to respawn - lost ALL my inventory as none of the inventory was able to be recovered.  I see the X on the map, but nothing is there to pickup because it is likely clipped under the surface or high up in the clouds.  I once saw a mob get shot up in the air and it kept going up and up and up - it never came back down.  Oh... and pathing for pals in caves - yeah - HUGE problem.  There are quite a number of times where you summon your pals in combat and they do nothing - they just sit there and take damage and don't move.  That happens a lot in caves.  When you start your game and you have ANY structures built next to the PAL console, larger pals get stuck there and will never move until you move them yourself.  Annoying!  Lots of clipping with pals in structures - happens all the time.  And there is literally no way to designate priority of pals to a job.  If they have 2 skills, it can sometimes be random which skills they choose to use.  You could have transport and watering for example and have 10000 items laying about your base... your pal will do nothing until a crop place needs watering, go water that, and then do nothing for another 5 minutes till it finally realizes there are items to pick up.  It will then pick up one item, then take a break, and by this time... your crop field needs to be watered so it will go water that and leave the 9999 items still on the ground.  No real way to organize chests at all - pals will dump items randomly in chests in multiple stacks in multiple chests - even chests right next to each other!  There is zero designation for items placement or organization.  makes it hard to unload your inventory from adventuring cause you have to click each chest to deposit all your items - annoying!  Many of these issues are simply ideas that have never really been thought out properly or tested.  I could go on and on about so many other things... but you get the idea.  Not worth the money at this time - at least till they do a major update and fix a lot of these issues.",1708207640,1708207640,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Palworld has actually forced me to care DEEPLY about how my Pals are doing in a way that Pokemon could never hope to do. If your heavy hitters in Pokemon go down, you go to a pokemon center, heal up, and move on. If your heavy hitters go down in Palworld? It brings your progress to a halt, because now you need to wait for ten minutes for them to recover, and you have no one to blame but yourself, getting into a situation over your head.

If the Pals that you assign to your base get injured, they work slower, and if this goes on long enough, they go down as well.

Palworld combines elements from many popular games in ways that honestly work very well. It is an open-world survival game filled with creatures you can capture and tame to battle alongside you, with base building mechanics involving automation by having the creatures work in your base. While you might be able to make comparisons to other popular games like Pokemon and Ark, the way Palworld uses these elements is undoubtedly... Palworld. Not Pokemon, not Ark.

You may hear a lot of people say Palworld is just ""Pokemon with guns"". The problem I have with this criticism is that the guns actually have a place in this game, and it's executed perfectly. Normally, you as the player in these creature collect/battle games are just an accessory to the action. You don't do anything, you're just the vessel under which your party clears the game. By giving the player weapons with which to properly get involved in every part of combat, this problem is solved. You're not the accessory, you're the sixth member of the team.

While I'll readily accept that the game is clearly in very early access, there is a level of polish that shows the game is cared for by the team that develops it, with the updates the game receives showing that it is heading in a good direction. Performance and AI of worker Pals in your base could do with a major overhaul, but the game you get right now is genuinely worth the price.",1708204531,1708204531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Crank that up or it'll be a slog in between levels. Also why make better versions of pals if you could simplely just evolve them. I guess it would make it too close to pokemon but idk. Coromon, Nexomon, Temtem got away with it. You can even throw digimon in there. They also need to lower the amount of Pals it takes to raise a pals star level. It takes an obnoxious amount to even bring up it up a single star. Finally the bugs, The amount of times my pals decided to leave the base or get stuck in walls is insane. I tried everything to prevent them from getting stuck. You may think it's not a problem. But it is. If your not paying attention. They could starve because they're stuck in the wall. I almost had this happen several times. And the AI is terrible. Alot of times my pals will refuse to attack. And the enemies it's even worse. Specifically talking about raiders.

The art was cute but I always found myself going back to Zelda, Spyro, Star Wars games more. Despite that I do enjoy creature catching/hunting games. I really enjoyed Temtem in early access, Dauntless was fun for a while and now Palworld is a hybrid of so many games I enjoy. It combines the early building and survival of The Forest/Minecraft with the creature catching of Pokemon/Temtem and the hunting aspect of Dauntless/Monster Hunter. 

This is what makes the gameloop so addictive. There's always that ""one more thing to do"" pull. While that starts to wane in the 20s and 30s levels it does still stick around. For the $26 I spent for this game I enjoyed over 100 hours. It catapulted to a top 10 most played Steam games for me. It even made me drop The Finals that I was previously addicted to. Palworld has plenty of bugs and some performance issues but it is still highly enjoyable in its current form. 

I highly recommend it to people that enjoy Survival games with creature capturing/hunting aspects. The building is the weakest part of the game and is similar to The Forest early in development. There isn't half walls or half stair cases and limited clipping you can do. Don't let the ""it's a Pokemon clone"" comments make you ignore this game.

Refund not being issued or acknowledged as a solution
Hi after a few weeks of the game being released and attempting to play a game that's unplayable as your progress can be deleted at any second . You can be blocked by a random person hacking and unable to rejoin the server of your choice and lose character progress ..
This game is unplayable until they fix this main issue and they have no option to refund this game that's not functional .I email their customer support and I emailed steam as well and no contact for 7days+ from neither party .

Pals can:
-cook
-build
-logging trees
-mine 
-defend you
-use guns
--farm
-plant seeds
-water
-transport items
-refine ore

I view my world in palworlds as a homestead and everyone helps out and does chores to keep the homestead a well oiled machine and that pal can take breaks and you can build a hot tub to keep them happy and even pet them.

For combat wise there are dungeons, your base will be raided  by hostile herds and also the free pal alliance. You will also see syndicate bases as you explore hostile humans who built a base.

At least for single player..

- I lost all 200 hrs of progress when my game crashed, logged on and my world is gone. I've tried multiple fixes but nothing has worked to bring it back. 

- Pals (especially the bigger ones) have incredibly bad pathing in a base. They get stuck on everything, so you can't really build a base they way you'd want because it ends up being a jail cell for your pals who will get stuck in the walls or on some feature you built. 

- Pals are constantly avoiding their assigned tasks lol. The breeding farm has been a nightmare keeping an eye on your pals so they don't wander off.

- Unfortunately its very unbalanced right now too. Legendary pals are the only ones worth using, even if you breed a beast they will never have that extra 10k HP...

- Falling through the world or getting stuck inside walls in very common. That includes your pals & wild ones too.

I've been a Pokemon fan since forever, but Nintendo's games didn't quite hit the spot for me. Then I stumbled upon Palworld, thinking it was just a parody. Turns out, it's a game-changer.

Palworld felt like the game I've been waiting for. The market needed this, big time. From creating bases to catching pals in different places – it's a blast! And yes, Team Rocket RPG totally won me over.

This game's got the perfect balance. Bases are like crazy hubs of fun, and catching pals in various spots, raids and legendary pals keep things interesting. Palworld took the cool parts of Pokemon, mixed in some wild chaos, and bam – you've got a game that's pure entertainment. Enslaving pals (oops, I mean catching) has never been this much fun!

In a sea of same-old games, Palworld is a breath of fresh air. It's like Pokemon and chaos had a baby, creating a mix of cool and cute animal collecting that's been missing. Early Access started strong, and it's already a surprise hit. 

So, get ready for Team Rocket RPG to steal the show. Palworld is not just a game, it's a rollercoaster of excitement where every catch spins into an adventure and losing half your spheres trying to capture Jet Dragon, and yeah, you're going to die a lot during the process.",1708178826,1708178826,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

With that said, I can say that the game has me hooked. I wanted to add my input on this game, as I am excited to see where it goes in the future. 
So, what do I like about Palworld? My simple answer is this game is unique to the point it has held my attention since I first picked it up weeks ago. It’s apparent through its seismic initial release that there has been a desire for something fresh as opposed to what we have, up until now, had to settle on with recent Pokemon games. To be honest I played Shield for a long time, couldn't stomach Arceus, and put Scarlet down in a matter of hours. I can admit that those titles target a younger audience now, so it does make sense the appeal is just not there anymore. However, those of us who grew up on Pokemon are now in our 30's or 40’s and we want something a little more mature and engaging. This is where I see Palworld having the potential to really take things further with the genre.
Really, the game keeps you busy grinding away on managing your bases. From setting up production lines of key resources to just making components to crafted items, this game isn’t for those who do not enjoy this type of grind. However, I prefer games that require a grind as it gives me something to do. Apart from that, venturing out to capture Pals and clear the tower bosses is a nice goal keep me pushing forward. This is where I can see the developers adding in more tower bosses and even raids (pretty sure they already are working on this). 
All in all, I’m interested to see how big this world gets and what else gets added as features.",1708141587,1708175929,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

The dumbest things can make games so much more fun like being able to punt a living ball of wool across the map or blowing up a village on a dinosaur strapped with Grenade launchers. Just the perfect variety of  exploration, discovery, funny names, diversity of tools and weapons as well as the diversity of creatures along with the weapons and guns they can be strapped with just make this game really fun. And an open world game that follows a story line whilst still allowing the player to have as much freedom to do whatever they want is really nice. you're not forced to go straight to the next ""checkpoint"" if you will. Also they somehow made farming and grinding resources and exp surprisingly fun. Love this game so much even tho its still in development. There is so much room for adding even more dumb and funny things. This game has huge potential. Id say just as much potential as minecraft when it was in its early stages, and that is something very very few games can accomplish.

It is very rough using mostly stock movement and ai, and has map bugs on par with rust or ark... yet It has a very fun gameplay loop, as everyone says its pokemon(actually closer to shin magami tensei since YOU actively take part in combat) but new and fresh.


Pros 

The capture system is pretty rich taking into account hp, positioning, aggro, status effects, and current hp. As such you are rewarded for putting in a more effort. It would be nice if we had some pal moves that had high status rates and low/no damage but I'm sure that will come.

The pal skills are mostly pretty good, with very few that seriously need tweaking. Ice missile can be deleted tho...

The animations while simple and not so evenly spread across all pals for now, are ooozing personality... ~depresso~ laying face down in the spa pool is priceless. Not all pals have unique animations as of now, but hopefully they will be filled out as they game progresses. 

The world has a good bit of flavor for now design wise. Also movement is ... pretty good for a early access title. The inputs are a bit weird in places like having to cancel your grapple with ctrl rather than another mouse click OR simply hitting space to cancel right into your glider. I'd like to see the gliders and grapple flow a bit more like Just Cause in the future, aka being able to grapple objects mid glide then cancel back into gliding in order to boost your momentum and regain height. 

Most pals DO have a function, and while some will be simply replaced in their respective roles, the breeding system allowing you to crossbreed to create different pals allows you to benefit from all tiers of pals by using low tier pals as quick breeding stock to compile skills and IV's to pass onto your desired final species.

Cons ~earlyaccess woes~

The ai is barely functional for now, resulting in mobs suddenly becoming lobotomized, staring off into the void while you shoot them, or running into walls. No easy out here, they used stock ai, and it shows. hopefully the billions they are making right now is enough to hire a competent ai dev to really bring the wildlife... to life.

Movement pal skills are VERY broken, the pathing is very broken so dash skills will just get stuck on tiny objects or map dips causing them to dash in place... and leaps are even worse as they suffer from collision with their target, causing larger body targets to shoved them out of the area they are attempting to land mid animation either resulting in them missing the long cooldown ability OR getting stuck mid dive forever. Partially removing collision during said skills should easily solve this easy enough however.

Difficulty is not really difficult, just punishing. The difference between hard and easy is how much pal damage the player takes. Basically on hard you WILL get one shot or 2 shot if you have a shield, and unfortunately the ai does not like to pokemon battle. Aka you throw out your pal, and the enemies just attacks you instead. As a result even low level spots are insanely threatening even if your pal is a absolute immortal death machine... and there is little you can do to resolve your characters durability besides hide in a corner(also causing the bosses to just run into walls trying to reach you while your pal fists them from behind).

 Furthermore riding mounts does NOT offer any immunity to attacks, so in ~hard mode~ doing so is a death sentence. Lost track of how many times I was insta killed off the back of my pal from a homing attack shot as I passed by. Tho depending on your active pals ~intimidation~ hidden stat wild pals will just ignore you or run from you.

You WILL clip through the ground and into walls, yet you can not actually swim at least there is not diving/underwater content as of yet, and very little in terms of sub terrain content. A huge missed opportunity that will hopefully be corrected going forward.

Hopefully a more advanced ai will have wild pals only retaliate against the player directly IF they are attacking them directly, otherwise having the ai focus on the players pal first, OR offer more in terms of player defensive progression so that the attacks from those lower level pals are as impotent against the high level player as their pals.

There is no Vaporeon, and lovander feels a bit too bill cosby for my taste.

Pro/con

Alot of the current pals are just pallet swaps or very slightly tweaked ~evolutions~ of eachother. This is nice if you like your early pals designs, but results in a the actual selection of pals being quite limited for now. Its a good idea to create progression lines for popular species, but I personally prefer a wider range of more unique creatures to encounter.

The game is just full of potential, but its just that ~unachieved potential~ IF the studio is serious this could easily be a minecraft situation... or they could grab the bag and run treating it as a simple indie pump and dump.

 I actually bought this game because I don't see how they could rationalize doing so with all the attention they have gotten. AAA studios spend BILLIONS trying to get this level of positive fan reception, so it would be pretty stupid to let it go to waste.",1708169030,1708169030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Overall, very excited to see what is to come in the future with this game and hope for a long success and a long life span both to enjoy such a great game and to bring some competition to certain genres. 12/10 rating (Even though there were a few bugs that got worked out with updates I still give this game this rating especially with interviews of the developers and how they view their community and the gamin community as a whole for bonus points.

Nintendo fans savagely trying to cope?  Maybe.  People with AI derangement syndrome going rabid when someone even implies something might have to do with AI?  Perhaps.

Whatever the claim, they keep moving the goalposts to continue hating it.  First it was wild claims of AI that proved to be false.  Then claims of copying which turned out to be made up.  Then calling it low effort, which is easily disproven if you play it for 4 hours.  Now they've gone on to call the player count dropping a sign that it's bad.  The truth is they put their 60-80 hours in and have finished the game, so are moving on like any normal person does all the time.  There will be some new reason they hate it next week.

That's all not to say it's a perfect game.  Or that the game isn't clearly heavily, heavily inspired.  Or that its using lots of popular game mechanics just to attract people.  But there's nothing wrong with any of that.  In fact, most AAA games do that too, they just maybe don't make it as obvious.

If you like survival crafters, and like pokemon, you'll have fun with this game.  If you hate those game genres, you won't.  And that's about all their is to it.",1708160603,1708160603,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The core gameplay loop of capturing more Pals, unlocking new tech, developing your base and gear, and then venturing out to battle or capture even harder Pals is quite compelling. Graphics are cartoony but suits the world quite well, performance is okay (but to be fair it is still in Early access). 

Does not have a story mode or any major quests at the moment - but this could be added in future updates. 

Overall it's a really enjoyable game to play and in pretty good shape for an Early Access Title.

So far its basically a weird love child between Arc: Survival Evolved and Pokemon with some Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild mixed in. I am mostly a crafter so I will not speak much on combat, but it seems alright. Nothing too special but nothing much wrong with it.

Crafting is split between what you can and cannot do. Most things can be done with the right Pal, but there are some things that you can also help with. Farming, Repairing, and Cooking food are some examples. Item Progression flows alright, and sometimes it helps to have the right Pal for the job. Unless you stack Work Speed, then you leave all your Pals in the dust and only need the ones for the work you can't do yourself. Crushers(Water Pal), Furnaces(Fire Pal), Etc.

Multiplayer it a bit of a hot mess. None of the hackers are being banned yet so the servers are riddled with them. The servers themselves are laggy and unstable, and chat cuts your sentences off.

Special shout out to the customization sliders, you can change almost everything about the world. Want more items to drop? You got it. More XP? Sure. More Pals spawn in the world? Yup. You take more damage? Of course. Don't want to wait an hour or two for eggs to hatch? Just change the slider.

Really lets you make the game your own. If you're playing online they're set by the server. If you're single player you can change them as much as you want. Makes this game super approachable for casual players, can make super grindy (less resources, less xp) if you want that, you can make combat difficult if you want to be challenged that way. Really unique, more games should do this.

In the same vein, the memes about forced labor can be funny the first time or two because of how ridiculous it seems, but the game really doesn't lean in to it that much. It's really the player that can make life hell for the pals. You can give 'em luxury beds, hot tubs, feed them pizza and burgers and salad, pet them, let them take breaks and eat whenever they want, give them medicine when they're sick, etc. Or if you're a psycho.... you could force them to work grueling days, give them limited breaks, make them sleep in piles of hay, make them continue to work while injured, force them to eat raw meat, and then butcher them when they inevitably start lagging. The game is super open and really lets you play how you want.

Overall, this game is pretty much everything I ever wanted since I was a kid, it's so open. It lets you interact with your Pals and actually fight alongside them, it's great. Gonna date myself, but remember how Pikachu coming out of the ball and following you around was such a big deal in Pokemon Yellow? I feel like Pokemon never really evolved past that surface level of interaction with your Pokemeon. Even the most recent ones (maybe with the exception of Legends: Arceus) don't come close to touching the level of ""creating a squad and your own community of cartoon monsters"" that Palworld does.

This game takes that and blows through the stratosphere. I didn't know this mashup was even possible. Fight with your big green panda. Give your big green panda a grenade launcher. Shoot your penguin friend out of a cannon. Fight with a big beetle pal that protects you and adds to your defense. Throw a pink cat at  your enemies and watch it scratch and distract them while you focus on getting headshots. Almost any strategy is viable, and even some of the cute Pals from early in the game can stay relevant throughout. Oh, and there's base building and everything else to go along with that. I don't remember being this obsessed with a new game since Elden Ring.

It's still in early access and there's supposed to be a lot more content coming, but even in its current state it's worth it (IMO). I've easily gotten 50 hours out of it, and had a blast the entire time.

One thing to note: DON'T play on official servers. I play local single player but from videos and posts I've seen, there is rampant griefing and cheating that the devs are having a difficult time squashing. Some people are losing entire bases and lots of progress. I mean, the game's been out for like a month and they weren't expecting it to be this big. I don't blame the devs, just stay off of official servers for now. Either host your own (or buy a virtual server to use) or play single player until this is fixed.

One other minor thing: Type advantages are suuuuper simplified. I'm fine with it, it makes it more accessible, but it takes some adjusting if you're used to Pokemon. I can't count the amount of times I used ice moves against grass, or water moves against ground types, or electric attacks on a flier, etc. thinking they'd all be extra effective when they weren't. There was def an adjustment period. Part of me hopes they add a bit more complexity, but deep down I know that's probably a bad idea.",1708152052,1708154152,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It is relaxing. It isn't hard. But it is annoying in one particular way.

Coming from a background of survival craft games, Palworld has easily one of the worst base building mechanics I have ever interacted with. At least in the early game. If how the wooden constructs operate are indicative of how the rest of the constructs in the game operate, it'll be frustrating for anyone who has enjoyed base building in other survival craft games. The only one that I can think of off the top of my head that is worse than this is Stranded Deep, but that's a different expectation to base building. When you have an open world and open ended building, it needs to be crisp, not clunky and frustrating to use.

If you're someone who really loves base building like I do, you're definitely going to have an aneurysm like I did. It is still a great game nonetheless. Hopefully since it is in early access, this is an area I expect to be vastly improved.",1708152161,1708152161,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I will choose Palworld over Pokemon any day.

The franchise of Pokemon was dying, and it became more and more obvious that they were just following the same boring formula, becoming lazier in implementing an open world in this form.

I got so bored of pokemon sword and shield and other versions since it was always new pokemon and non of the old ones were featured. Yeah you could take them for picnics, but it was all the same wasn't it? A team rocket you had to defeat, defeat these big trainers to move on...and the pokemon couldn't follow you all the way unless you got to the end game or something silly.

Palworld, it has that, but so much more! Explore a huge map, climb mountains, find treasure chests, craft, cook, survive. Take your Pal everywhere you go and make a new home and family with them while protecting your base for threats of the world!

I have been playing for 70 hours, mostly because I was just trying to get a flying pal I loved and explore it with my Pal/friend.

The world is beautiful and fun to interact with, and finding random eggs in various hiding spots is my favourite hobby.

It is nice that you can just enjoy the world instead of always battling and fighting; this is what Pokemon has been missing, a way to just enjoy yourself with no pressure to follow their formula to get through the game; just play as you wish and explore.",1708149476,1708149476,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Palworld has no official proof of copyright infringement, IP theft, or even using AI technology to design their creatures. Please do not believe everything you read on Twitter.

The only similarity to Pokemon this game has is being able to capture creatures in balls. That's it. Beyond that, this game is actually much more similar to survival/ exploration games such as ARK. Typically, I don't play survival games like that, but I've enjoyed this very much! The Pals are very cute, and even while some share clear inspiration of some Pokemon, many of them are entirely unique and creative. 

The world is very large and fun to explore, especially alongside a Pal you can ride. The combat is fun shooter-style action with dodge rolls and sometimes hiding while your Pal dishes out attacks. Much like ARK, you can ride a Pal and use their abilities to fight, whether that's breathing fire or wielding a mini gun. Base building is a bit archaic and needs updating, but I like it. It's fun building a base that's efficient and aesthetic at the same time, and I like that each Pal has their own jobs they can perform to varying levels of skill.

Yes there are bugs, glitches, and issues. It's missing depth and memorability. But the gameplay loop is a constant stream of satisfaction, the progression of your character and the scale of the world is a straight line up. It's ridiculously charming how much personality is in the animations for your pals, and how much the game is trying to pack all in to one experience. There are things that could be added from it's opposing games in the genre that would improve it in many ways and that's an easy arguement to make. But if you want to make it, realize that it should go both ways and Palworld blows its competition out of the water with a blindsided alpha release that has plenty of content to come.

If you want to argue that craftopia was a failure, it released in a very negative state and did nothing but improve for years in to a quite enjoyable game. If this is Palworld on release, I am nothing but excited for it's future. Not to mention the modding community is already hard at work creating the tools for people to create their own perfect experience.

It's satisfying, fun, a massive world full of things to enjoy/collect/craft whether you're solo or with a group. Just play the game. To say I've gotten my moneys worth would be a hilarious understatement.

I've been hard it, getting stuff like FSR, NVAPI, and various little community-made optimisations going.

At first it just ran bad. To be expected, it's unoptimised and you're basically getting a dev build for what you pay for. You would be fine if you played for a bit then saved, went back to the main menu, and then loaded again. Seems like after a while of playing the game is slacking off and doesn't manage memory properly. I still can't tell if it's GPU or CPU related, but there's more to be said about VRAM in a moment.

After more tuning I was starting to get more consistent performance. Capped my frame rate to 30 to save on frame processing time, and actually got a workaround to replace DLSS with FSR, which is something my 1060 lacked.

Now today as of writing, I ran into a fun new issue. The game was running better than ever. Sure! I'll take the boon. But, why was it running better? Up until now I couldn't see how much VRAM was actually being used until I finally crashed for the first time. 50 hours in, first crash. But the crash was caused by an out of memory error on the graphics pipeline. Oh hell. I have 6GB of VRAM. You mean to tell me it wanted even more? This does make me conclude that at current, Palworld's graphics are its biggest problem and if you wanna play it, seek out the various tricks to wrench down and optimise memory usage.

---

As for the game itself, it's addicting, sure. It does things no other monster raising RPG has done before, or had a stronger investment toward doing.
At times, Palworld does have moments of being itself. I think the core combat is where that comes from.
You can be tag-teaming a boss with your Pal, trading who's got agro. It could use some more flavour like a more in-depth command system instead of ""attack"", ""attack but only who i'm attacking"", and ""don't attack ever, even when you're getting hurt"".

I'd love to see an option where my Pal could just, lower the enemy's health to as low as it can get without killing it and backing off so I can try to capture. Hints that the Pal combat system is not fully cooked yet and I'll just have to wait for future updates. Fine.

There's also stuff like collecting ammo that's useless until several hours and levels in (such as AR and shotgun ammo), which makes me think we need more middle-tier weapons that can make use of them, even if they're garbage.

The NPC pathing is absolute dog. You need to build a whole parking lot on your base just to make sure the Grinder or Mill has enough space for a water Pal to power them. There's no clear indication whether NPCs of any size can even path to a certain place, and you kind of just need to guess and watch what they do.

Balance changes are needed. The handgun is pointless. Expensive to make ammo for. Makes zero sense to use when the Makeshift is more powerful for cheaper material cost. While we're on it the rifle ammo almost makes sense, but I'd like to produce 10 ammo instead of 5. Or the other way around and have handgun ammo produce 10 rounds.

Otherwise, making use of your Pal party is required to compensate for either a lack of firepower, or ammo. Their ammo is food. Kind of a strange balance, but I wouldn't say no to a change.

---

There's so much stacked up against this game. Whether it's controversy, the developers being harassed, or just the concept of the game in general. There are those who want to hate this game and see it fail so badly. Maybe even suggest that you play other similar games, made by even smaller devs, even if the gameplay is nothing like it.

---

Stuff I like.
It's not ""X, but messed up"", like some have suggested. It's got a medley of game mechanics and aesthetics going on where I'm not sure anymore if it's genuinely ""derivative"" of its contemporaries more than it is a cute jab to say hey, witness me. It may not even share the same look by its release for all we know.

The Pal designs themselves are fun too. They aren't garish and (not all of them) are designed to be these provocative parody level creatures. It's fresh. Some are really thought through. Yes, I do think there's a couple of Pals that get dangerously close to being a full-fledged parody. Not naming names, but the second or third Pal you see in the game is straight up just a stylised cartoon chicken. ;D

--

Verdict? All I can say is if you have been eyeing this game, don't feel bad for buying it. Some of you may find it more worth to wait a year when more dev-time has been put in, and I respect it.
For right now, Palworld is what I believe many would call it ""feature complete"". There's still a lot more PP could do, and much that really needs to get done. But if you're on the fence, this side does have some nice lush grass to sit in. Come on down.",1708145595,1708145595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It plays like ARK with visuals evoking the charm of Zelda, promising players a survival and adventure experience like no other. The addition of Pals, alongside collecting and breeding, adds depth to both PvP and automated farming, enhancing the overall gameplay.

Dedicated servers and PvP mechanics opens doors to boundless possibilities, encouraging both co-op ventures and intense duels among comrades. While the concept of raiding and base defence holds promise, current challenges such as duping and cheating detract from its viability. Still, the potential for skirmishes with your chosen companions is undeniable.

As with many titles in their early access phase, Palworld grapples with the inevitable rough edges and technical hurdles that accompany such ambitious projects. Frequent hiccups and occasional glitches disrupt immersion, particularly when Pals encounter issues navigating environments.  The developers show a lot of promise in addressing issues and coming features, it is early and I can only hope they dont pander too much to all the silly noise and jealously that comes with the hype. While it's early days, maintaining focus on the core idea and optimising to perfection could lead to lasting success.

While its current state may deter some, those willing to weather the storm of early access may find themselves really enjoying the game as I have. Palworld has the foundation for greatness and definitely has the opportunity to evolve into a standout title within the gaming landscape. Don't listen to all the dweeb pretend nerds that cant let go of the past and autisming hard for nostalgia, they are the reason nobody even wants to dev for the- 'now now now, entitled ego rat generations' anymore. Majority of games now are just swindles and mental loop traps.

Far from being a simple copy, it makes its own niche by brilliantly combining different types of gameplay to suit a wide range of gamers' tastes. Here are some reasons why PalWorld is a great adventure that deserves all the praise it gets.

Gameplay: PalWorld has great game play, with survival elements, strategic battles, and a large crafting system all working together to make a smooth and fun experience. There are so many things to do that players get lost. They can build complex bases with the help of their Pals or fight in high-stakes battles that test their strategic thinking. PalWorld is a unique game that pushes the limits of its genre thanks to its deep gameplay that makes every moment full of discovery and excitement.

Replay Value: PalWorld has a huge amount of replay value because the world is always changing and there are so many Pals to find, friend, and fight. The open world of the game makes it fun to explore and try new things. In battle, you can use different strategies and put together different teams. Also, the crafting and base-building features let you be as creative as you want, so no two players will have the same experience. PalWorld is a game that people will want to play again and again because it has so many different parts. Each time is like a new adventure.

Multiple Players: Playing PalWorld with friends makes it even more fun. As players work together to defeat tough enemies, fight, or just explore the huge world, the game encourages friendship and a sense of shared adventure. PalWorld is a great choice for people who want to share their gaming experience with others because it has a multiplayer mode that adds a lot of fun and teamwork that you can't find anywhere else.

Graphics and World Design: PalWorld's graphics are stunning, and every part of the game's huge world is rendered with great care. The settings are not only beautiful, but also full of life, making players want to explore every corner. They range from lush forests to dry deserts. The design of the Pals is just as impressive. They have a lot of different creatures that are creative and look good. This careful attention to detail in the graphics and world design makes PalWorld a very immersive experience.

Unique Features: PalWorld stands out from other games because it has unique features that make the game more fun in real ways. Survival elements give the adventure a more realistic and urgent feel, and the full crafting system lets you be as creative as you want when you build and customize your character. These features, along with the strategic depth of PalWorld's combat, make for a fun and challenging gaming experience.

For the most part, PalWorld is a great game that deserves all the praise it gets. It's a great example of what creativity and passion can do in the gaming industry because it has great gameplay, a lot of replay value, fun multiplayer options, beautiful graphics, and new features. No, PalWorld is not just a game. It's an unforgettable adventure that gets 10/10 from all of us.

The end game is pretty bad though. The base construction is extremely lacking. You are limited to very simple constructions. The pals you are using are also pretty dense. I ended up using 5 end game pals specialized for manufacturing. Instead of operating my machines, they ran around picking stuff up from the ground (eggs and milk) and putting it into boxes. Even if I assigned them by throwing them at the machines, they just changed less than a second after. It's a general problem. With more or less all the pals. Which is infuriating. The breeding is also buggy as hell. As soon as you leave the base, the pals does all sort of stupid s**t, and the egg timer stops. 

Also, I'd recommend staying away from the mods. It made the game buggy as hell. So it wasn't really worth it for me at least.

A small indie company managed to create Palworld, a game that is arguably better than Pokemon S/V, despite the latter being produced by hundreds of industry professionals with years of experience in game development. Palworld has striking graphics (at least compared to Pokemon) and addicting game play. Each pal has various animations that add depth to their personalities. Additionally, I've seen a lot of criticism online about the inconsistent art style, but I personally like the juxtaposition between the cartoonish pals and the realistic world. Pals are reminiscent of Pokemon, which automatically gives them an innocent nature since that franchise is targeted towards children. Meanwhile, the realistic world emphasizes the very dark and real-life themes that are prevalent in Palworld. 

Palworld does have numerous bugs, but so did Pokemon S/V upon its initial release, which is unacceptable considering its $60 price tag and the unlimited resources available to its developers. Ever since Pokemon transitioned to the Switch, Game Freak has produced nothing but half-baked games, because they know any Pokemon game will sell due to brand recognition and nostalgia. Pocket Pair put passion into this game, which in evident in the quality. They also took significant risk and almost went bankrupt trying to get this project off the ground. Even after its release, they're regularly coming out with patches to improve and refine the game for players. Palworld is half the price of modern day Pokemon games, yet it's far more enjoyable IMO.

With all that being said, the only big issue I have with this game are the blatant rip-offs of certain Pokemon (Verdash, Fenglope, Dinossom to name a few). I know Pocket Pair was working on a tight budget, but I honestly would've preferred less pals in this game if it meant we didn't have some that felt totally uninspired and looked AI generated. All in all, a great game though. 8/10.",1708121805,1708121805,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Some things they should work on is optimization. Game becomes laggy for me with a somewhat dated gaming pc from 2017. Movement of pals in base needs more work as they frequently get stuck in odd places and because they are stuck they can't eat. 
Some dialogue on npc's could add more interesting tidbits/lore. Anything useful. 
One of the stores should sell pal fluid imo as it's a chore to go back and farm it when you need it for cement and also I don't want to kill pals, they are too cute.
Building placement needs work, you can't build a staircase from one foundation and then connect a new foundation to the other side of the staircase. This makes it so that your buildings are very limited to flat ground. Overall building pieces should also be placeable slightly clipping ground. It's weird I can sink a foundation down 90% but i can't put a wall on the outer edge because there's a little bit of sand there.
