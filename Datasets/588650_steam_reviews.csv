I am 49.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707204289,1708882613,True,1,2,0.5,0,True,False,False

Its sleek, iridescent scales shimmer like a thousand tiny emeralds, casting an ethereal glow upon its surroundings. Its body, reaching lengths of up to 10 feet, is adorned with intricate patterns that resemble ancient hieroglyphs. The boa's head is triangular, with piercing golden eyes that seem to penetrate the very soul.

Beneath its scales, the emerald tree boa possesses a remarkable adaptation: heat-sensing pits located between its eyes and nostrils. These pits allow it to detect the body heat of its prey, even in the darkest of nights. With lightning-fast reflexes, it strikes with deadly precision, its sharp fangs sinking deep into its victim's flesh.

Curiously, the emerald tree boa is known to have a peculiar dietary preference: it exclusively feeds on birds. Its arboreal lifestyle allows it to ambush its feathered prey from the safety of the treetops. Using its prehensile tail, it coils around branches, patiently waiting for an unsuspecting bird to come within striking distance.

Another fascinating fact about the emerald tree boa is its ability to change color. When threatened, its scales darken, blending seamlessly with the surrounding foliage. This remarkable camouflage technique allows it to evade predators and remain undetected in its rainforest habitat.

In the realm of reproduction, the emerald tree boa exhibits a unique courtship ritual. Males engage in elaborate displays, swaying their bodies and flicking their tongues in an attempt to attract a mate. Once a pair has bonded, they perform a synchronized dance, their bodies entwined in a graceful embrace.

As the sun sets, casting long shadows across the rainforest, the emerald tree boa emerges from its daytime slumber. Its eyes gleam with an otherworldly intensity, and its movements become fluid and graceful. It is a creature of mystery and wonder, a testament to the boundless diversity of life on Earth.",1708192193,1708192193,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game is hard and punishing but rarely in a way that feels arbitrary, just occasionally cruel in a tongue-in-cheek way. I've still never cleared through BC4 and I don't know that I ever will see the true ending of Dead Cells, even now that it has been forced to stop development (by the by, Motion Twin, a curse upon your families <3 dont do stuff like that and maybe you'll have a real reputation in the future, if this boneheaded decision didn't damage it already beyond repair. won't be buying windwhatever though) 

The amount of content packed into the whole extent of Dead Cells with its DLCs cannot be easily overstated; if you like the format I guarantee you won't exhaust the game's environments, weapons and interesting secrets for many dozens of hours at least.

This game just keeps delivering all the way through time, with participation beta's and alphas, before going live. It's incredible. Long live dead cells!
IT'S SUPER ADDICTIVE,  1BC is where the game really begins., I did no assist mode, and hunted for a long time, still need like 700 cells for Legendary forge unlock, 
Once i hit the 3000 for this Cell, i needed to unlock Boss Cell 2 to unlock the S grade weaponry findings

Difficulty modifiers to make the game apply different layouts to the game, so it descends and ascends a lot more, than the long passages of enemies you're used to, 
you NEED to use your tactical gear (max 2) 
Armadillo backpack is a must :D or a weapon with the other in-game upgrades.
There is also a new way to play each round, check below the prisoners quarters, before going into the tailor, passage left, there's a new way to play each one, but you may not progress further than thou hast so far. It is hard-locked to not giving you anything new, whereas normal mode there's always recipes popping out, EVEN AFTER 100 hours, there's still stuff locked away in levels with no current way to reach it. 
100 Hrs, for my first 1 BOSS CELL, is what this game is about. It's DIFFICULT> Twin motion requires full attention. It's really quality work in every single way

This game is made with love and continues to get more love as time passes. This game is a benchmark for platforming. You can leave when you want and come back to resume where you were in your current, or new lives. Easily accessible game right here. 

57.6 hours to get the RECIPE for advance forge, where you may now upgrade your equipment TWICE< so the replayability continues to get more favourable, the longer you play. You find new variations of the same stuff, with new mutations, and other combo's - It's VERY GOOD< top of the pyramid,  of many genres.

Took me 48 hours to get the spider wall climbing, which is necessary to access parts of each level, so it's got a lot of places to go! .:) very very still happy with this.

Double-Jumping, amazing platformer. You may even grip the ledges and wait for the ideal timing to attack your enemies.

I wrote a review previously, but it was expunged due to game being out of EARLY ACCESS> 

Great game overall, beautiful to look at and truly immersive.

Nice to teleport in the same level.
Time races are there. Racing through the same levels for different goals will be how you proceed.

Playing for permanent unlocks = life.
It's really so good, and easy to pick up, put down, come back later, resume exactly from where you were.

There's also custom methods of playing this game, so you can do exactly what you want.",1590406161,1707992772,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The awkwardly-laid-out procedurally-generated levels get old fast, there are not many enemy types, and you're stuck with the base weapons for far too long 1) because of how expensive the upgrades are, and 2) because of how many essential upgrades there are before it makes sense to unlock many weapons. The bosses I've encountered so far are all joyless damage sponges that take forever to whittle down. They're tedious to the point that I have zero interest in fighting them again, but you need to do so hundreds and hundreds of time if you want to grind for more than a sliver of what this game has to offer (and there are even multiple boss rush style minigames if fighting the same bosses hundreds of times in the core game wasn't tedious enough). Even the soundtrack, which was fine enough at the start, has so many variations on the same theme over the different levels that I'm quite sick of it.

Another major frustration is that there's often so much going on on the screen that it's tough to see what you're hitting and what's hitting you. This made me gravitate to bows that would let me kill enemies from off screen with limited risk (boring) and strong melee weapons that would stun the enemies I was hitting so I could button mash and not worry about taking damage from an attack I couldn't see (mindless). Almost none of the weapons I've used so far felt smooth and satisfying to use, as even the fast swords take a fraction of a second to swing and the arrows take a fraction of a second to nock. Everything just feels slow, and as far as I can tell you're animation locked and can't roll cancel your attacks, which leads to a lot of cheap damage.

With that said, it's commendable that this game runs at 1080p / 60 FPS and without noticeable input lag on a dual-core Celeron from 2015 with integrated graphics. Even in 2D games I often have to reduce resolution to get a consistent 60 FPS, so I was impressed by the smoothness here.

I also appreciate the number of very nice gameplay settings that allow you to do things like jump just as long as you have the jump button suppressed, hold the attack button to continue your combo, and hide lore rooms. Unfortunately all of these options are all off by default and I discovered them after I decided I was done with this game... They wouldn't have been enough to redeem my other issues, but if I had been aware of this earlier and/or if some of the key ones had been on by default, I would have had a better experience. If you ignore my review and decide to play this game anyway, at least be sure to give the settings a good look.

If you're looking for a roguelite, Hades is the gold standard; play that instead. The story and progression system were far more effective at keeping the grind fun. If you're looking for a 2D side-scroller with good combat, try basically any metroidvania (e.g. Blasphemous). I've had nothing but better experiences in that genre.",1707964119,1707964215,False,1,0,0.439999997615814209,0,True,False,False

Do not trust Motion Twin. They have a history of building up games and then abandoning it to work on their next project, leaving the community in the dust. If it happened to DC, it will happen to any game that they manufacture.

why does the game start spamming these enemies on 2+ BC?
it's NOT FUN to dodge 3 or more projectile enemies simultaneously in a cramped 2d environment while you're trying to deal with more aggressive enemies

also, curses are way too harsh past the lower difficulties
i just don't like having to cleanse 3 curses just to die on the 4th one
""just don't take them lol"" and miss out on scrolls, which would screw you up in the long run, making you weaker on the last bosses where that matters A LOT? and miss out on 10k gold on a difficulty that makes healing virtually impossible unless you have cash?

Imagine the game as a 2D roguelite with heavy focus on combat but where similar games hardly offer any real exploration here it gets a metoidvania vibe. don't be mistaken, in the end this game is a linear 2D action game, but every run feels varied enough and especially paired with the fantastic DLCs (which I also would highly recommend) the whole level structure resembles a Starfox style level progression.

Also the music, graphic design and the tidbits of lore here and there are well done and keep you well engaged. Don't underestimate the difficulty though. My first complete run took me about 30 - 35 hours to achieve with the run itself taking about 45-60 minutes.

Steam's vast library of games has seen its fair share of rogue-likes, but among the myriad choices, there stands an undisputed champion – ""Dead Cells"". Developed by Motion Twin, this game transcends the boundaries of its genre, delivering an adrenaline-soaked experience that leaves players utterly captivated from their first electrifying encounter to the heart-pounding final showdown.

""Dead Cells"" is a visual spectacle that seamlessly blends pixel art aesthetics with modern design sensibilities.

""Dead Cells"" deftly combines strategic decision-making with lightning-fast reflexes, creating an intoxicating game-play loop that never grows stale. The intuitive controls become an extension of the player's will, allowing for endless creative approaches to each skirmish.

What sets ""Dead Cells"" apart from its contemporaries is its ingenious take on the rogue-like formula. Death is not an end, but a new beginning. The constantly shifting levels and enemy placements ensure that each foray into the unknown is a unique challenge. The game offers a wealth of weaponry and abilities that can be tailored to suit your preferred play-style, encouraging experimentation and evolution as you uncover devastating synergies. This creates an irresistible loop of progression and discovery, urging players to push their limits and delve deeper into the labyrinthine world.

The haunting melodies and atmospheric soundscapes of ""Dead Cells"" are an auditory delight. From the haunting echoes of desolate corridors to the pulse-pounding rhythms of intense battles, the music becomes an essential companion on this treacherous journey.

Dead Cells doesn't give the real original Nintendo feel, it gives you the trumped up version of the original Nintendo games when you were younger.

It is literally everything you want without any of the drawbacks that actually existed when you were younger.

I paid 17.99$ for the game and all DLC and it was worth it in spades.

The user interface or rather ""Controls"" are beautiful. What gives this game the perfect nastalgic feel is adding music with fidelity and graphical layering that wasn't possible with Nintendo. The feel of your first love, but as good as you remember, not the poor quality it actually was. Music, graphics, color contrast, story, controls, weapons... every aspect is polished. Well worth the money. I can't say it's a 40$ game with DLC and all. But for 20-25$ when on sale, it's worth it all day long.

P.S. if you aren't into the graphics, don't play the game. This is a blast from the past, but everything is better kinda game. Not for everyone, but 5-Star all day long for the audience it was meant for.",1627137813,1707245179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Gameplay/Combat[/h1]
Hit stuff with melee/ranged weapons until they die, with occasional dodge rolls/shield parries; or simply run past enemies to get to the next level and reach the next boss; rinse and repeat until the final boss – hopefully you’ve collected enough attribute scrolls & good enough weapons to reduce the boss’s hp to 0 before yours run out.

Having finished to the end in about 6 hours, the replayability of the game seems a bit concerning considering subsequent runs becomes stale rather quickly. The meta progression aspect of the roguelite contributes a bit to its staleness I think, because it takes a bit too long to unlock new weapons/traits/tools etc, thus you play with the same repetitive tools for quite a bit until you accumulate enough cells unlock the next one.

Not a big fan of the stat system, which incentivizes upgrading a single attribute as high as possible, it restricts your equipment pickup options only to those sharing the same color, as the ones aligned to other attributes will be significantly weaker.

Upon completion of levels there are reward doors which you may be able to open if you finish the level quick enough, or kill enough enemies/kill the boss without taking damage, which I think functions well to reward skillful plays, but also impacts exploration negatively

[h1]Exploration[/h1]
Exploration isn’t intuitive, an external guide and a lot of mental notes is required if you want to get to a specific level, unless you’re into stumbling around blindly In a maze, while a timer runs down potentially locking you out of additional rewards. For instance, to get to the Slumbering Sanctuary to obtain the spider rune, you need to pass through Prisoners’ Quarters => Toxic Sewers (vine rune) => Ancient Sewers(ram rune) => Insufferable Crypt => Slumbering Sanctuary, which you’d probably need to learn from an external guide because the game doesn’t do a good job incentivizing exploration by providing information in-game that leads players to actually take different paths instead of the same one over and over. The world map UI does a poor job in explaining which biomes connect to which, which requires which traversal tool, and which is currently inaccessible; also doing a shit job at incentivizing exploration.

The level completion timer locking off rewards disincentivizes thorough level exploration. Granted, Dead Cells uses semi-randomly generated 2d levels, in which 100% exploration of a level isn’t particularly helpful because it will change on the next visit. However, the element of which biomes are connected to which and which traversal tools is required to reach which remains the same throughout the runs. Repetitively getting into dead ends in Dead Cells because you don’t have traversal tools unlocked or DLCs unlocked or that simply because it’s a dead end feels timewasting and potentially punishes you by taking away resources simply because you travelled the wrong random direction by chance, and that door at between levels will remind you of that.

DLC levels sucks two-fold: cluttering up the world map UI with inaccessible areas, and acting like more dead-ends in game, some of which has long corridors before you’re told you can’t access it. Having DLC elements not appearing in game unless you’ve purchased it would improve the game for base-game players; but I suspect the developers would rather try to manipulate people who already bought their game through FOMO.

[h1]Writing[/h1]
Not particularly good, but the roguelike/lite genre isn’t known for good writing in the first place (probably with Hades as an exception), more often than not relying on addictive repetitive gameplay loops – and replayability is already an issue with this game.

I would say though that placing a shit-ton of easter eggs doesn’t really make the game “cooler”, it just dilutes the game’s identity (currently about half of my weapon unlocks are easter egg weapons) and make its world less believable.",1707186037,1707186235,True,1,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

I absolutely understand the allure of Dead Cells and it deserves tons of credit for it’s innovation. However, I’m just not a big fan of having to restart from the very beginning in a game and having weapon drops be random. There was a part of me who wanted to try collecting as much as I could and eventually DL the DLC but I just do not see the point. If you like the added challenge of having to restart from the beginning and using different tools to advance this is certainly for you. But it gets very dull having to redo the first few levels again and again.

I would much rather play something like Hollow Knight which increases difficulty in all sections as time moves forward with randomly spread-out bosses there is no general order to fight. I have never played Dark Souls before but many have said it shares similarities to it due to frequent deaths and restarts.

In any case definitely not a bad game and worth beating at least once but I don’t have much desire to go further.

I think I originally played DC on the VIta, PS4, then again on Switch, and now on PC/Deck. It's like Skyrim in that way that I will probably always have a copy of it on every console I ever own. It feels timeless and holds up just as well in 2024 as it did back in 2018. 

And now I got all the DLC that's come out and it's just sort of dawning on me how much I love this game. Like, top 5 of all time love this game. It's so hard to explain exactly why. 

I never paid attention to the story except that your MC is a total smarta**, a blob of goo inhabiting shells of humanoids to complete runs, collecting dead cells to roguelite it up, and that's about it. That's probably all you need to know. 

What really matters in Dead Cells is the gameplay. That sweet sweet trance state of gameplay that Dead Cells induces in me like no other game has been able to do. It feels like my brain is drooling on itself when I play. 

First off, Motion Twin, thank you. For everything. And thank you to the numerous other indie devs who have participated with Motion Twin in making some of the most fun and hilarious cross-over content I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. 

Beyond that, there is something with Dead Cells that occurs at this particular intersection of play where you 1. have cultivated a heavenly loadout, 2. are familiar enough with your surroundings to feel competent (but you will be punished SEVERELY for any lapse of attention, no matter how brief), and 3. you are in a movement flow with both your MC and the BGM that makes you feel like an unstoppable wave of pain, and it's this intersection that I am trying to find in each run and it's NEVER a disappointment. 

In roguelite fashioin there are so many upgrades, mutations, and configurations that even items you don't care for (*cough*NUTCRACKER*cough*) can have a benefit or use. And I won't get into all of that because there is just SO much of it now. Each run is almost never ended in vain. 

I am still working through the new content and new items but so far I have found that if I just lean into something I have a good time. Some loadouts I thought were going to be total crap ended up being a total blast and got me a lot farther than I expected. There is a fluidity of movement that the MC has that is almost idescribable. Sometimes this is dependent on your loadout and playstyle - I tend to play very aggressively and I feel rewarded for it. Everything has an appropriate sense of weight and impact, and I always feel confident about where the MC is at in space even when things get hectic on screen. Quickly running through and wiping out a map while using both weapon slots and both accessory slots (and backpack) produces such a delightful rush of endorphins. 

I also really love the ENTIRE art direction and OST/BGM. Really no complaints from me at all on those areas. I love the enemy design and variety, even the real PITAs, I have enjoyed the boss encounters, and I have also, surprisingly, enjoyed every biome so far, even ones I don't traditionally enjoy like Sewers. 

HLTB says 30 hours for main + extra, 90 hours for completionist, not including DLC which can add another 30-ish hours (up to and including Return to Castlevania). I think this is all going to be dependent on your enjoyment and skill with Dead Cells. 

I have had zero technical issues with the game, both on PC and Deck (and every other console for that matter). 

It's just pure video game FUN. If you like action platforming/2D action, roguelites, your a** is getting burned by all the sOuLsLiKe MeTrOiVdVaNiAs, or you just want to see what the fuss is all about I urge you to pick this up over any other.

I'm 16 hours in and there's still so many things to unlock. And the devs even put in QOL features for speedrunner. I'm not a dedicated speedrunner myself but I still appreciate it.

This game is designed for masochists, it's extremely unforgiving in a bad way. The game likes to reward you for not getting hit in a biome (Levels), or bosses, that you are guaranteed to fail constantly after stage 1, or maybe stage 2. The enemies and bosses can be seem unpredictable, and seem to hit you when it looks like they are in hit stun. 

 If you like getting 100%, this game is also cryptic in the most asinine ways, be prepared to constantly look up guides to get through it.

If you want a good rogue-like, I'd recommend either 20 minutes till Dawn, or Hades instead. Both are way better designed overall.",1706893069,1706893069,False,0,0,0.479452043771743774,0,True,False,False

And one of the most over-rated for sure. Its purpose is to waste your time. Its a grind but not even a good grind. It lacks identity. It ""borrows"" stuff from other games cause they actually don't have stuff of their own. 

Its thing is that its ""pixel 2D roguelike"" and other than that It has ZERO redeeming quality.

I can not recommend this game to anybody. Even if you have a LOT of free time, there are WAAAYYYYY better roguelikes than this with much more style, much better combat, and much better story.

I like Dead Cells.

I actually have trouble putting it down.  Now, in fairness, I also like Super Metroid, some of the Castlevanias, Hollow Knight, probably a couple others, so 2D platforming with upgrades is clearly something I'm in to.

The things that turn me off for rogue-lites is that I always feel like I'm losing too much every time I die.  I feel like there's no progress.  The game is usually far too hard, and I feel like I'm just running on a treadmill.

There are a lot of variables a game developer can play with when making a rogue-lite.  I think Dead Cells got the balance here just right:
[list]
[*]The game is fast.  You move pretty fast.  You're spending most of your time playing the game and very little time in cutscenes (often skippable) or loading screens.  When you die, you're back to a new run in maybe twenty seconds.
[*]I've probably done thirty runs so far, and I'm still seeing a variety of content.  I feel like I might see something new every run.  I imagine that might change after hundreds of runs, but right now I feel like I'm rewarded every run I make.
[*]Likewise, every run I feel like I'm making it a [i]little[/i] bit further.  My power-ups are making me a [i]little[/i] more powerful.  If the difficulty was one hair higher, my desire to play this game might be much, much less.  (There is an ""assist"" mode you can turn on that probably makes the game easier.  I haven't tried that yet.)
[/list]

So: Tons of content (I have all DLC), tight loop between runs, difficulty is just barely low enough for me.

The only other thing that I think probably makes this game more playable for me is that I'm playing it on my Steam Deck.  Since you're not able to save, when I have to go to ""adult things"" that can't wait, I can just put the Deck to sleep and pick it up again later.  If you don't have that sort of freedom with your computer, this may be a problem.  However, I do feel like they should just let people save in the middle of a run.

Finally, the controls are really, really good.  All the movement feels absolutely [i]fluid[/i].  And combat is nuanced but fair and brutal; it's just really satisfying combat.

I never thought I'd be recommending a rogue-like of any sort, but here I am: Get Dead Cells, play five runs, and I think you'll be hooked.",1706398707,1706398707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
++ game was clearly made with love and there's plenty of references to other roguelites if you like that kind of thing
+ animations are very lively and full of character
+ satisfying parries (albeit maybe too forgiving)
+ SOME interesting weapons and items
+ unique modifiers can make some weapons more interesting
+ clearly some lore involved, albeit it's sparsely scattered around
+ there's a conscientiousness like the timer being frozen in shops, lore rooms and between levels present throughout most of the game
+ some okay level variety once you unlock all of the runes
+ game can feel pretty nice when you're speeding through it, and speedrunners have access to options for their gameplay

Cons:
--- super limited weapon, item and mutation pools, like, REALLY limited, there's probably as many mutations/items/weapons total as EtG has in just guns and nuclear throne can match it as well despite being a much smaller game
--- the damage type system, whilst somewhat unique for a roguelite, carves down the previously mentioned limited selection even more and shoehorns you into specific items whilst creating various build incompatibilities that hurt variety even more
-- the limited mutation pool gets limited even more by a hard limit of 3 per run, stopping you from getting ridiculous combinations you'd see in other roguelites like EtG, RoR, etc, which is then further harmed by weapon scaling not affecting the mutations that'd affect the weapon, ie, you have a bow that scales with survivability, but the arrow effects and buffs that come from it would otherwise depend on tactics mutations for their effects. similarly, a vast majority of the ""brutality"" skill tree mutations are locked to just melee weapons and tactics to ranged, hurting build variety even more on top of that.
-- ultimately this means that hybrid builds are essentially not viable in any way shape or form, especially since scrolls only get stronger the more points you put into them, but because mutations are all bound to specific stats, opting into any other scroll for survivability or utility purposes, ie to support your turrets or defensive gameplay for example, is kneecapped
-- boss variety is extremely limited, only having 4 in the base game
-- game can get quite repetitive, a bad sign for a roguelite
- bosses have an arbitrary damage cap of around 15% HP per hit, so even if you've got weapon mods like, ""+300% damage dealt and taken"", your damage will be neutered anyway, and whilst i'm familiar with boss DPS caps thanks to EtG, at least that game has some rare weapons that allow you to bypass it - having it unilaterally is a unreal wet blanket

ultimately the game seems sabotaged by its own mechanics, and whilst the lack of variety could maybe be remedied without the limitations, unfortunately they do exist and i'm not convinced i'd like to pay the game's cost all over again just for the DLC

The community is great, subreddit is probably the most wholesome subreddit I have been in. The weapons and mutations and biomes are wildly diverse, look gorgeous and have so much creativity behind them. The dev's to this day still update with big innovations each time even this many years on. Zero in game shop or anything, everything is in-game; weapons, skins, everything. The DLC I was on the fence for a while but after owning it, I can say its 100% worth it, very pretty environments with new bosses and new weapons.

The game has beautiful pixel art with a stylish world of horror, and a huge variety of skills and weapons to find. The permadeath is rough but you still keep the possibility of picking up any unlocked items that you earned on previous play-throughs and you can play harder versions of the game to challenge yourself and see new content. Once you know what you are doing you can probably beat the normal difficulty in a couple of hours or less but dying and learning how to do that is the fun of it.

It is referred to as a metroidvania, but I would not call it that exactly because it is not a big open world where you cross over the same areas and discover new things in the same playthrough. It is more linear with some branches that all go to the same place and you discover new things between different playthroughs, meaning you will die and start from scratch with only the unlocked possibilities. I really like the old metroidvanias, but the dying-and-starting-over mechanic is less fun to me so I will rate this lower.

Shields are useful on occasion yes, but if you are gonna get hit why not...dodge roll? Parrying tends to be more risky than dodge rolling....

The Good Stuff:
[list]
[*] The movement in the game feels so good. It's fast, fluid and precise.
[*] Level design is done super well. While the level as a whole is procedurally generated, the elements within are often more designed. The devs nailed it with their parameters for stitching everything together.
[*] Level design encourages a great mix of platforming and combat. Every encounter can be a puzzle.
[*] Weapon/item variety and balance is phenomenal. It's astounding how every item can have its place in a run and be viable. All it takes is the right combo of other gear and/or affixes to make my least-favorite weapon into a fun one.
[*] Combat is challenging and feels awesome to master. 
[*] Enemies vary wildly in how they approach you or how you approach them.
[*] Death feels meaningful and fair. (Usually. Rats are probably responsible for the most ""WHAT?!"" exclamations)
[*] The crossovers, tie-ins and easter eggs are so plentiful, there's bound to be something in here that makes you smile.
[*] Accessibility features are comprehensive and useful.
[*] Assist Mode now exists for those who want to play the game as more of a platformer than a roguelite.
[/list]

Your Mileage May Vary:
[list]
[*] This game is hard and it gets harder once you beat it the first time. I relished the challenge, not everyone does.
[*] There isn't a whole lot of plot. There's a fair bit of environmental story-telling, but it's no Dark Souls.
[*] Music is great ... until the 80th time you've heard the song for The Prisoner's Quarters. Having dedicated themes per zone will have that problem. (Castlevania DLC is worth it just for the soundtracks)
[*] There are sooo many outfits. If you like unlocking things and/or playing dress up, this game has you covered. I basically stuck with the Hotline Miami outfit once I got it because I like readable fonts for damage numbers.
[*] Once I consistently made it to the end of most runs, I found that run length averaged ~1hr.
[/list]

The Not-so-Great:
[list]
[*] All your friends will have the same advice: ""git gud""
[*] Other roguelites will pale in comparison.

Gostei bastante, punitivo e satisfatório no ponto certo. Já havia jogado no xbox e admito que nao curti muito, até que eu decidi dar uma segunda chance e comprei aqui pela steam, simplesmente amei.

Por mais que a gameplay metroidvania seja bem boa, os cenários/ biomas bem bonitos e diversificados (sem contar as das DLCs, que dadas as exceções são genuinamente muito boas), porém, após a conclusão do jogo quando a dificuldade é aumentada me perdeu um pouco, achei extremamente cansativo, pois para que você consiga rezerar,, matando o final boss, é necessário explorar cada ponto do mapa, o que depois da 100a vez é beeem chata e desprovida de novidades.

De modo geral foi uma experiencia majoritariamente positiva,, recomendo você comprar as DLCs só depois da conclusão do jogo base, pois você pode enjoar e n ao aproveitar elas propriamente (assim como eu).",1705358347,1705358347,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have this game on PC and android but I play with a PS4 controller so the game is so gameplay is same. 
I was never into rouguelike games and when I installed it for first time I deleted it after 20 minutes because of no saves. 
But the combat and art style is appealing to me so I tried it again after 6 months and learned that the game is great for those who enjoy to master some combat like Tekken games which I play on PS. I like fighting games and PVE games so much. DC has so many weapons which are satisfying to use. So I gave it a chance and this time I fell in love with this game. 
There is a little story in this game which is nice but you can finish that story with custom difficulty mode and unlimited ammo enabled if you find the game is too hard you and frustrating. I am sure 90 percent people will never get the 5th bc ending so thanks to developers for providing custom mode which is also good for unlocking mutations and blueprints like weapons or clothes. 
But this is not about story the real entertainment is in combat. This game is a 2d game but I think this is the best satisfying combat game I ever played. This game is on mobile too so it is a go to game for me whenever I want some gaming entertainment.
Art visuals, sound effects, music is really magical. I want a game on this setting from these devs but with a better campaign or adventure game.
My personal favorite weapons in this game are survival weapons because they are more satisfying and rewarding but they are tough. Broad sword is so cool. Other two types are also good. 10 by 10 from me. I dont have words to describe how great the experience was. But if you want to buy it please check some reviews about what kind of game it is. I

Now that I'm digging further into the base games deeper mechanics, I'm finding an incredible amount of depth and complexity that I didn't initially expect. I've already gotten my money's worth out of Dead Cells, but I certainly will not be putting this game down anytime soon. I'll be buying the DLC thereafter! 

Update #1
I've nearly doubled the time in the game since my initial Positive review, and my continued play time has only pulled me even deeper into this game's mechanics - the game's complexity is truly incredible, though not quickly apparent. Replaying the initial levels started to wear a bit on me early on when my focus was primarily just obtaining cells for unlocks. Now, my focus is on weapon/stat builds with mutations, and clearing these early levels without taking a single hit. Incredibly powerful builds are certainly possible, but everything comes with a cost - moving to the Custom game mode to take unwanted items out of the random drop selections came with some fun surprises, that's for sure! 

I absolutely cannot wait to delve into the Castlevania DLC, but I'm holding out until I push much further into the base game's content. I'm pushing myself to whip through the base game's content before delving into the DLC.",1704166515,1705249760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The countless cute and funny references to other media is always fun to come across, and adds to the charm. Adding on to that, I think the pixelated 3D artstyle is one of the reasons why I keep playing this game in comparison to one such as Hollow Knight. And nostalgia reasons, of course. 

While the game can be difficult, and lead to many moments of rage quitting after dying when you're seconds away from chipping off the last chunk of a boss' health bar, the various amount of weapons and builds you can put together makes sure each run is a possible success. I enjoy experimenting with various equipment and upgrades and at one point I made it all the way to the end of a run with only the beginner shield lol. On the whole, the game is incredibly well-balanced (the base game is at least).

The DLC is woven into the base game seamlessly, and when I first started playing I would end up on a DLC path without realising, thinking it was an alternate route. Which in a way, it kind of is, as there's is only one final boss. [spoiler] Barring the secret ones. [/spoiler]

My problem with this game is retention and the lack of desire to come back to it, unlike Hades. Although there are LOTS of different weapons, they all basically feel the same - mash your attack button, dodge, and keep mashing until the enemy dies... making no weapon actually feel unique... just some were worse/better than others. Hades on the other hand, each weapon combined with different boons to make each weapon feel unique. Some of those weapons were better with certain boons than others, and those weapons had different play styles even though the core of the game was still just mash attack and dodge.

The long term progression in this game is extremely slow... which can be seen as a good thing by many, giving them something to constantly work towards. But for me, the game didn't have me coming back with its base mechanic to make me want to put more hours into.

A problem I have with this game are the ""kill streak/timed run"" doors. I think they're bad for the game (One time I actually got BOTH on the first round so that was cool)... The reason I think they're bad for the game is... if I missed getting one of these doors on the first level I almost felt OBLIGATED to restart my run. Not because these items are necessarily needed (although not getting one of these will be a major hit in your power spike at the start of the next level), but because it just felt pretty terrible to miss. Also this is by far the biggest power spike you'll be offered during any single dungeon, you just get so much from opening one of these doors. Now, if there was comparable loot within the level where you could go ""oh it's okay I didn't get this door opened because I opened up a chest that has loot on an equivalent level"" that wouldn't be bad. Some people may disagree, and say that they deserve the loot for perfecting the level. I agree, you deserve something, but again missing these makes me instantly press escape and restart, totally ruining the fast paced momentum this game is supposed to be about. Some people may not care if they miss these doors and continue regardless, but for me it was an itch i had to scratch.",1704850238,1704850238,False,4,0,0.543745934963226318,0,True,False,False

Verily, it is with great enthusiasm that I pen this missive, extolling the virtues of a game that hath, in its essence, encapsulated the very spirit of relentless perseverance and unyielding tenacity.

From the initial foray into the cryptic corridors of the cursed castle to the tumultuous battles that ensue, ""Dead Cells"" doth weave a tapestry of challenge and reward. The symphony of clashing blades, the staccato of arrows finding their mark, and the resonant echoes of triumphant victories compose an opus that resonates with the true aficionado of the digital amphitheater.

Methinks the roguelike nature of the game, wherein each demise begets a wiser resurgence, doth provide an unrivaled sense of accomplishment. The procedurally generated realms, though capricious in their design, do foster an environment wherein adaptability and skill burgeon in unison. A knight errant traversing the ever-shifting landscapes, battling monstrous adversaries, is met with not only a test of mettle but an odyssey of self-discovery.

Ah, the artistry in the pixelated panoramas! ""Dead Cells"" bestows upon the discerning spectator a visual feast reminiscent of yore, harkening back to the golden era of 16-bit wonders. The amalgamation of nostalgia and modern design coalesce into an aesthetic symphony that doth satiate the longing for a bygone era whilst tantalizing the gaze with contemporary finesse.

The armory of weaponry and habiliments offered within the game's arsenal is nothing short of commendable. Each blade, bow, and shield exudes its own distinct flair, fostering a myriad of playstyles to suit the preferences of the valiant player. The pursuit of evermore formidable armaments becomes a noble quest in itself, an ardent endeavor that adds an enticing layer to the already rich tapestry of exploration.

Furthermore, the continuous support and updates bestowed upon ""Dead Cells"" by its vigilant developers is a testament to their dedication to the gaming community. The addition of content and refinements bespeak a commitment to perfection, making the game a living opus that evolves with the passage of time.

In summation, let it be known that ""Dead Cells"" is not merely a game; it is an odyssey, an allegory of resilience, and a symphony of pixelated mastery. Thus, with a heart brimming with enthusiasm and a quill dipped in resounding endorsement, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Dead Cells"" on Steam to any valiant soul seeking an unparalleled escapade through the crucible of challenge and triumph.",1704302087,1704302087,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game has a pixel style, which reduces the cost of development. 
I really like the fact that some level maps change randomly. 
Each repeated play can bring a permanent ability upgrade to my game character.
Multiple game modes bring longer play time to the game.
The game requires players to clear it multiple times to reach the true ending.
This design reflects the lack of content in the game, but after completing the game multiple times, the content of the game levels will change, rather than remaining unchanged.

[strike] At present, I am not satisfied with several aspects of the game.
The levels in the game that require DLC do not have clear indications.
In the game, after obtaining 3 BOSS cells, there is an imbalance in the strength of the monsters.  Instead of increasing the BOSS’s health, new skills should be added to the BOSS, or more minions should be added.

While the game excels in mechanics and replayability, it falls short in representing a diverse range of characters and narratives.

The pixel art aesthetic, while charming, doesn't excuse the lack of diversity in character designs. The protagonist and enemies alike seem to adhere to traditional tropes, missing an opportunity to introduce characters from various backgrounds, cultures, and identities. It's disheartening to see a game with such potential for creativity and imagination opting for a more conventional and unvaried approach.

The narrative, though minimalistic, could have benefited from including a more diverse cast with unique stories and perspectives. In a gaming landscape that is evolving towards more inclusive storytelling, Dead Cells feels like a missed chance to break away from the standard hero archetype and explore a wider range of characters.

While the core gameplay loop is addictive and the challenge is ever-present, the lack of diversity ultimately makes the game feel stagnant. In an industry that is increasingly recognizing the importance of representation, Dead Cells could have stood out as a beacon of inclusivity.

Not for everyone, but becomes magnificent once you learn to master your skills. This is probably the best combat centric rogue-like I've played. The various weapons you pick up can completely change the way you play the game, making each run feel like it's own individual experience. This game definitely combines a souls-like combat style with the randomly generated levels of a roguelike better than pretty much any other game out there. 

The game is smooth, has very pleasing visual aesthetic and color palettes, great animations and a lots of cool outfits. Even though they advise for  you to play with a controller, i didn't feel the need for one, prefering keyboard and mouse instead. 

The controls feel good and are fully rebindable, attacks are satisfying to land and the enemies have tells that stand out enough that taking damage doesn't feel cheap. There's a lot of platforming involved, and the map is full of secrets and powerful loot. Also, the soundtrack is a certified banger.

A complete run can last up to 1 hour, 1 hour and a half, depending on the difficulty, route and personal skill.
Dying is not bad. I repeat, DYING IS NOT BAD. This game teaches you stuff through death, and it's a great learning tool. You get destroyed by an enemy you've never seen before? Great, now you know to play safe around them or avoid them altogether.

The art style is some of my favorite in all of video games and the gameplay is a very good. Every kill on an enemy brings satisfaction and there are lots of unlocks that keep the game fresh and interesting. The only thing I can really complain about is that there are certain areas that are open for you to look at but cannot continue those areas without DLC. I think DLC is good for the game but having the areas open without owning it can be a real tease sometimes. Its a very minor complaint though and once you learn the rooms you can simply avoid them which is nice. Overall I am extremely pleased with my introduction into this genre and I think this is a fantastic game to pick up. 10/10,1703307694,1703917822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, there's no way to skip these levels and you have to explore them if you want enough upgrades to survive the later levels. This means wasting 20 minutes going through repetitive levels just to die at the same part over and over again. You really don't get the chance to learn the parts you died at because you're too busy going through the early levels.

The game has an incredible amount of weapons and skills to unlock, but a lot of them aren't very good except for very specific builds. You can toggle off the weapons and skills you don't like. The permanent unlocks didn't feel like they contributed meaningfully to my progress making it feel kind of pointless.

Dead Cells is a fun platform slasher that will test your skills and can at times be frustrating. 
There are challenges and many different weapons and items to use so you can find what is best for your playstyle.
There are also many different levels and routes you can take which is fun to vary each run. 

Whilst I've had enjoyed playing Dead Cells, it can be an acquired taste.

The pixel art visuals are a nostalgic delight, and the combat mechanics are as smooth as they come. Every weapon feels unique, and the procedural generation keeps each run feeling fresh and unpredictable.

The blend of roguelike and Metroidvania elements is executed flawlessly. The challenge is steep, but it only adds to the sense of accomplishment when overcoming each level. The continuous updates from the developers keep the content exciting, and the community engagement is commendable.

While the difficulty may be a turn-off for some, it's the heart of what makes Dead Cells addictive. Learning from each death and adapting strategies is part of the fun. The only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score is the occasional feeling of repetitiveness in level design.

Overall, Dead Cells is a must-play for fans of challenging gameplay and pixel art aesthetics. It's a game that keeps on giving, and I find myself coming back for more, run after exhilarating run. Highly recommended!",1703419210,1703419210,True,17,1,0.667039334774017334,0,True,False,False

This game will not make you any less stressed, but it will take your mind away from your original source of stress, by replacing it with the stress caused by playing (yes!). This stress is different though, because Dead Cells engages your body and soul (aka getting into the flow), leaving no room for your ordinary perma-stress, effectively giving you a relief. In addition, when you finish a good/lucky run, or discover something nice, the game will often offer a good sense of accomplishment  - a thing that rarely happens if you are perma-stressed and stuck in real life. I reckon, it is more efficient than playing games designed as peaceful and/or meditative where nothing really happens and your mind clings to your normal sources of perma-stress, like Dorfromantik (even the birds chirping were getting on my nerves there).",1703026081,1703026081,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

and this was my first rouge-like and damn im in love with it, was playing it everyday, did feel slightly boring after i kept dying and having to do the same thing multiple times but that was a skill issue at my end, personally there are so many game play styles, playing methods, and hours you could spend on this
in short:
rating: 7/10
pros:
fun, lots of possibilities and dlc for hours of contents
art is great, i love the 2d art, its so detailed yet simple

1. If you die, you restart back to the beginning. You get to keep some things, but mostly you will lose every item, power, and scroll you picked up along the way.
2. The game is VERY hard. Just expect to die. No matter how much health you have, you will get comboed into a pit of spikes by every monster in the game.
3. Every time you die, you learn something. Whether you die by a new enemy's attack, or die by a falling elevator, you will learn.

+ Nice graphics and character animation
+ Fast and fluid movement
+ Satisfying combat
+ Many items to equip
+ Randomly generated levels and a lot of stuff to unlock give it a good replay value

- Can be too difficult at least at first, when you haven't unlocked the upgrades yet
- It seems that in later game, enemies can deal massive damage very quickly, as your main character doesn't seem to have much of so called ""mercy invicibility"", so that they keep taking damage constantly if you get cornered by enemies. You can literally go from full health to none in like two seconds. Just one mistake can end your run and that can feel very frustrating.

- the game has practically no story and I don't understand who the character I'm playing is and his motivation;
- the game is always the same repetition (except for some randomness in the level generation which doesn't bring me novelty enough) and I have no feeling of progress;

It's like I'm always starting the same game from scratch and I don't find this concept interesting, it doesn't entertain me, it doesn't push me forward.

It also didn't help that this was the first game I played in a long time and my first on steam since my comeback to games since years, so I was I bit naive and I didn't knew what roguelike games were (repetition), and that they mostly lack history. Two concepts I usually do not appreciate.

But ignoring the repetitive, it's good, the first gameplay and the graphics were good.

The combat is amazing, the level design is amazing, the lore is enjoyable, the soundtrack is great and extremely memorable, great difficulty gives you even greater reward, and there is nearly infinite replayability because of the random generation of every zone and harder difficulties introduce even more enemies to kill and die to. All these pros and so much more.

cons: 

it cant cook my dinner",1702614467,1702614467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not a big deal though since you can actually unlock his head in the game. Anyways, despite that slight disappointment I was glad that the gameplay was extremely fun and quick. It feels so satisfying to get a kill each time and I love how all the weapons are balanced in a way that they're all viable. The game can feel so chaotic at times when battling, especially if your weapons has a bunch of effects, and seeing all those effects come into action feels amazing to see. I typically prefer melee weapons, but with the amount of choices this game provides I might test out bows and arrows more later down the line. ALSO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE SHIELDS these things were my SAVIORS in a lot of my runs and I shouldn't have underestimated them when first playing the game. since rolling has a cooldown, shields comes in clutch soo many times and could save you the run.

Each run feels unique thanks to the procedural generation and the vast array of weapons and abilities at your disposal. The difficulty is punishing but fair, encouraging you to learn and improve with each death. The art style is captivating, with environments that are as beautiful as they are deadly. 'Dead Cells' offers an exceptional balance of risk and reward, making each victory feel earned and every advancement a thrill. For anyone who enjoys action-packed platformers with rogue-like elements, I wholeheartedly recommend 'Dead Cells.'

This is the most accurate explanation for what you are getting into, gameplay-wise, but this game is also FLOWING with charm, and I know most of the people who have played this will agree. There's a story that drives the player, but doesn't take up the main focus of the game. There's witty dialogue, fun secrets; the game almost feels alive at times. I was never super into Metroid, Castlevania, or even roguelites or roguelikes. But this one? This one is one of my favorite games of all time. It hits that niche of inspiring me to get better, try harder, without making the losses feel TOO brutal immediately. It scales with your ability, each run varying completely to still give you a challenge and help keep the player engaged enough, while also introducing new elements to the play. I love this game.

Say you're having a bad run. Your first weapon wasn't great. You missed a bonus reward from not getting hit because the hole you jumped down had spikes at the bottom that you couldn't possibly tell were there. You barely scraped by and made it to a shop. You FINALLY found a good weapon. This should be the turning point, but nah. The shopkeeper was a mimic. It's as hard as a full fledged boss fight and you're already having a bad run so now you die.

Stuff like this happens all the time in this game, and it just wears you down. Every time I felt like I was having fun with the game something would happen that just ruined my run and felt strangely cheap and out of my control.

Now I get turn my quarters in for plastic and just buy the thing to have countless plays and challenge myself by turning up the heat making the game hard as nails or you can make it easy peasy lemon squeezy!
The choice is yours. The challenge rating is all up to you.
There are daily runs you can take part in and lots of other content for you to enjoy. Granted they are broken up into DLC.

I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves arcade style side scroller with tons of collectibles and unlockable weapons and equipment to suit your play style. Fast paced style that really shines when you git gud.
You can pull off some very impressive videos when you are good at the game. But it takes time and lots of practice.

Me personally I have only passed the first stage on the default settings. When I get to the boss he puts the hurt on me!
Where as I put the difficulty down a few pegs and I can beat the game. Each time I beat the game I raise the difficulty one point. Has an enjoyable game loop and many paths to take to beat the game, provided you have the DLC.",1679503059,1701788463,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you enjoy playing the same level over and over again then this game is for you. The price tag is unreasonable. I hope you like listening to the same 10 seconds music track over and over again. Half of everything in the game is behind a paywall, half the weapons, and half the environments. The interface is so small you can't see what is happening, or what is killing you half of the time. The game gives you three types of weapon types to choose from, only one or two of them are a viable option. The ranged weapon is too slow, so is the green weapons. I really don't see the point of playing this game. You're just making number go up.

Pros
- Fluid and responsive controls. 
- A metric fuck ton of weapons/spells/shields/pendants/random shiny objects
- Complex and varied zone paths so each run stays interesting
- tons of secrets to find!! just. so. many. its amazing I love it
- deep story (kinda falls close to salt and sanctuary... but not enough so I'll let it slide)

For ages I had been told that me criticizing ""hard"" games was just me having a ""skill issue"", that most, if not all of them, were mechanically sound and well-designed, and that my critiques were invalid. I'd been made to think difficulty by itself made games unfun for me, and that a game being hard inherently meant I wasn't going to like it.

Dead Cells was refreshing because it confirmed what I had believed to begin with. Most ""hard"" games just suck. This one is an exception. 

I've been a fan of roguelikes for a minute now, even being really new to the genre, having only really dived into them this year, and I can tell you firsthand that Dead Cells is among the best I've ever played. Very rarely do I feel like I get punished for things outside of my control; just about every single hit I take feels like it was completely, and more importantly, realistically avoidable. It doesn't fall into the trap that a lot of hard games do where it just throws a bunch of barely telegraphed baloney at you and expects you to know what's going to happen; every attack an enemy throws is easy to telegraph, with the difficulty coming from your ability to multitask and plan out how to avoid as many enemy attacks at the same time as possible. This, too, never falls into the realm of being realistically impossible; once again, I never feel like hits that I take are anyone's fault but my own. Hell, I rarely even get pissed at the game because of it. 

Now that's not to say the game is perfect. While I haven't been through that many boss battles, the ones I have been through have been, uh...poor. The Concierge is a total pushover until he decides being functionally invincible on occasion is a good idea, and the ninja guy I totally forget the name of is just needless projectile spam to the point of parody. It makes it extremely hard to tell what's a special effect and what's going to actually hit you, and perhaps most importantly it doesn't feel realistic to be able to dodge all of these (although I'm sure it is). Weirdly enough though, I've haven't died to either of these bosses once, though Fortnite ""Ninja"" Blevins did come quite close. 

All and all, while the price is a bit steep, I feel like the content is there to just about make this worth its price, especially on sale. I haven't even mentioned that the developers still regularly make content updates for the game. And I don't mean paid DLC, though that does exist, I mean free-to-everyone content updates, which is always extremely nice to see. I can absolutely see where the love and adoration for this game comes from, and even with my (currently) limited playtime, I can already tell this game is going to be a mainstay in my library for a loooong time.",1701404760,1701404760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If each drop is randomly picked from a pool, then the bigger you make this pool, the less likely you are to get a weapon you want. This means you're actively punished for unlocking new weapons, as there is no guarantee that they are good or suit your playstyle.
- Waaay to many items are references to other games, to the point in my first runs of the game I barely saw any actual weapon from Dead Cells and most of my ""inventory pool"" consisted of references to other games. This is not only tiresome, but also weakens the identity of the game.  Couldn't help but roll my eyes at the 90th reference to this other game.
- Whenever people talk about Dead Cells, they highly praise the movement and controls. I think those people should play more 2d sidescrollers. Dead Cells movement/controls are nothing special. Yes, it's good, but it also has plenty of bads. Wall crawling and ledge grabbing is all sorts of weird and wonky, you don't have aerial movesets (instead you just ""stand"" on air while attacking), double jumping feels bare minimum to function. The few movement upgrades you get if they even quality for that don't really become part of your moveset and some of them are redundant or just lazy.
- People also often praise how this game has so many different weapons. They forget to mention how 90% of them are completely worthless, with weird ass movesets that feel like they are different for the sake of it.
- The game is incredibly short, it just takes a long time to finish. It pads itself out with repetition, grinding and permadeath masking an actually pretty short game with only very few levels not counting the DLCs. And the levels themselves are not interesting, it's just rooms of monsters with an occasional simple platforming puzzle, but as the maps are procedurally generated and the monsters randomized, there is no intent or real level design, it's just stuff mashed together without any thought put into it. The music is nice and there is some level of atmosphere, but that is ruined by the next point...
- The game doesn't take itself seriously, and doesn't take the time you spent on it seriously either. This becomes especially evident after the free DLC boss, if you had any sort of investment into this game's story, you are an idiot, and the devs don't respect the game or you. No, they're actively mocking you. It wants you to spend hundreds of hours grinding through its bullshit higher difficulties and inane crafting requirements only to give you no reason to care. It is not funny, it's not quirky, it's pathetic and childish. I bet the writers of this game think marvel quips are the pinnacle of writing and saying a lot of bad words and showing the middle finger makes for good ""adult"" humor.
- The way the devs throw the DLC entrances right at your face when you don't have them is what I expect from a free phone game, not something I bought off steam. If you don't have the DLCs, the entrances should not be there. This is at best nasty. Really tells you the type of people the developers of this game are.

One of the best games out there. Pinnacle of it's genre. Incredibly tight and fluid controls combined with the absolute plethora of weapons and skills allow for all manner of playstyles, from long distance ranged gameplay to becoming a tornado of death blitzing everything in your path if you have the skill for it. However, if you like to adopt that sort of playstyle (as I love to do, I think the fast paced action you can have in this game is almost unmatched), you can never get too comfortable because one slip up where you get lazy and you can easily lose 75% of your hp and suddenly you don't feel so invincible anymore, if you aren't already dead. But it is not unfair, if you lose health it's on you.

Massive amount of content and many amazing DLCs that are all worth it. The Devs are awesome, still continuing to deliver great updates and patches. Brilliant sound design, weapon and skill variety, environment design and even humour. Has only gotten better and better with time, do yourself a favour and pick it up. Can't recommend it enough.

Original Review

This is a very good game.  The controls are very crisp and responsive, and every time that I have died, I have felt like it was my fault instead of the game.  You could say that I feel like I'm fighting against the monsters and not against the game.  

I finally made it past the first two levels after two hours.  I struggled really hard against the elite archer in the middle of the second level, but when I finally beat him, it was super satisfying.  It's a great game to burn a few minutes here and there because the runs can be so short.  However, the game is good about saving where you left off, so there's no worries about needing to exit in the middle of a run.

Things this game does well:
* Tight, snappy controls
* Good progression of difficulty as you get better and progress further into the game.
* Decently good random generation of levels (they all look and feel the same, but the layouts can be slightly different)
* Good distribution of upgrades throughout a run (shop, pickups, chests (normal and cursed))",1495081927,1701191843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It says something about the quality of a game when they use it to teach games design at university... and that's how I discovered this. It's a roguelite semi-metroidvania combat platformer with a brutal but mostly fair difficulty curve, a very refined gameplay loop, and years of well-crafted updates and content. 
Death isn't an obstacle, it's a beginning here. Go out, fight, take cells, invest them or die horribly trying, learn, repeat. Succeed.

It is far more accessible to new players than it used to be, both from exhaustive updates to balance and content, but also through accessibility options that come at no mechanical penalty to use if you're struggling or just want a less controller-breaking experience.

6 years later, the game has changed so much and I still love this game. I'm better than before, but I still suck at this game.

------ Updated Dec 06, 2017 ------
Turns out I was stupid. And I change this review back to recommended.

This game is still under developing and it may change in every possible way. I beat the Watcher way before the Brutal Update, and the world has changed a lot. Some pathes seem inefficient, now are necessary. After reading the comments under this review, especially thanks to ""A slightly disapointing Arnold"", and reading through reddit, I realized that I have to take some different pathes to get the new runes in order to have access to more maps, hence more space for farm.

In the past I entered the Clock Tower with highest tier at 6, now I normally get 14 or more. And I've beaten the Assassin twice!~

Tips: 1. Currently I suppose Survival is the strongest attribute. 
         2. Clock Tower, that Forgotten Area and the Assassin are still the last part of the current game. They are beatable, but still I believe it needs to be balanced in the new update.
         3. DEATH LEADS TO PROGRESS. Again, thank you, ""A slightly disapointing Arnold""

------ Updated Nov 24, 2017 ------
The game is good, addictive challenging and still under developing. Strongly recommend!

Currently I really need some help otherwise I believe I'll never be able to beat the Clock Tower.

After playing the game for another 10 hours I changed my review to NOT RECOMMEND:

There is something nice in the Brutal Update like the new scroll system, alghough still not good enough, that shows the team's efforts. But this update is still unbalanced. Not only it's unfriendly to new players, but also old players. 

I can't achieve every 100% completion in every Metroid or Castlevania game, but I do can finish every one of those games by practice. If your act game skills are just like me, trust me you will never get pass the Clock Tower.",1511456316,1701181227,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

Dead Cells, a Metroidvania-inspired game released in 2018, is just one of hundreds at this point. In it, you’re a nameless entity running through a twisted world for no real reason other than you just know you have to. You explore a series of interconnected levels littered with enemies, gathering new weapons and gear, learning new abilities, and spending gold on needed upgrades. And death means you start all over again.

What really appeals to me about Dead Cells is its lightning-fast pace. From the moment you launch the game you’re thrust into the world, sword in hand, trying to fight your way out. Should you perish, you’re quickly put back into your boots, with a new sword in hand, at the start. While the game never rushes you along, the only true downtime is between levels, when you’re spending your hard-earned Cells on new items. The gameplay is brisk, offering intense, fast-paced combat, yet it’s forgiving enough for those who prefer a more deliberate approach. This balance between speed and strategy creates a thrilling and engaging experience.

The game really shines in its player-driven experience. The ability to play how you want by letting you freely combine a wide assortment of weapons, items, and powers, tailors the experience to your own preferences. Granted, there’s a hefty dose of RNG involved, which will keep you on your toes. But the DIY approach adds depth and encourages experimentation. The semi-non-liner level design also provides a great sense of freedom in choice. Each level offers various paths and has many secrets to be discovered, allowing you to decide your own route and encouraging exploration, adding a necessary layer of replayability. All this ensures Dead Cells remains fresh for a long time for many playthroughs (or attempted playthroughs).

The combat has a certain je na sais quoi that makes it hit harder than similar games I’ve played. It’s a visceral feast of satisfaction with fluid animations, impactful feedback, and titillating sounds. Tight controls and sensible weight of every strike provides a hearty sense of power, making battle exhilarating as you rip and tear your way through the levels.  

While Dead Cells might seem to be just another pixelated side-scroller, it’s far from just that in its visual presentation. The art style is vibrant, the world is captivating, and it conveys great detail in its simplistic graphics. The environments and level design come together to form unique and memorable atmospheres. And with the many characters and enemies scattered across the levels, it all blends together to create a visually distinct and immersive world, proving that even with its pixelated art style, Dead Cells can rival the more graphically inclined games in terms of sheer beauty.

Perhaps the most remarkable quality of Dead Cells is its welcoming embrace to noobs. Even for those with little experience with roguelikes, like yours truly, it’s remarkably easy to pick up and get going. The game avoids overwhelming players with unnecessary mechanics, offering a gentle learning curve. Yet, it keeps you invested by introducing new elements and challenges gradually. This approach strikes a fine balance between accessibility and depth, making Dead Cells a game that can be enjoyed by both veterans and newcomers alike. All in all, a true testament to great game design.

Dead Cells also achieves what few games manage to achieve, and that is that death doesn't feel too punishing. I never felt that I wasn't up for a retry.

It has become one of the definitive games in the roguelike metroidvania genre, which has now become a genre unto itself, chock full of amazing options. I never get tired of this game.  I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I did or put as many hours into it as I have. I may put it down for a few months, but I always come back because the developers are constantly releasing new free content for it. I happily bought the paid DLC simply because of all of the free updates that they've released. I can't believe how much the game has grown and changed and become an even smoother experience. The combat is still incredibly smooth and satisfying, and the variety of weapons and biomes has only grown over time. 

Most of my deaths don't feel cheap, they were just because I got careless or cocky, or because I've hit a skill wall and need to practice more. The movement in this game is incredibly solid, giving you much-needed control over your character as you dodgeroll and slice/bash/explode/etc. your way through enemies. The variety of tactics and strategies you need to use for enemies is great and the number of weapons you get to apply those tactics and strategies are various and sundry. The game has added a ton of weapons, biomes, and enemies since release, in addition to outfits and weapons that are crossovers with some of my other favorite games, such as Risk of Rain, Blasphemous, and Terraria. 

It is admittedly rough to deal with the fact that each run is permadeath and unlike other roguelike-ish games, it doesn't give you passive/active improvements as often to carry over into future runs. In this game, unlocking new weapons and adding them to your pool or improving things such as how many times you can use your potion or how much money you get from recycling weapons are your main ways to improve your runs as opposed to, for example, passive increases in health.  [strike]These unlocks can take time, as they require the titular cells, with the passives sometimes costing in the hundreds to unlock. If you're not prepared to have some patience while progressing because you're used to swifter/differently tiered progression in other roguelikes, this may not be the game for you.[/strike] 

Dead Cells added a major accessibility update this year, which was one of the best decisions they could have ever made, that makes the above comment no longer as accurate. It makes the game playable for many more people, and that can only be a good thing. I was very appreciative of their approach to soliciting feedback from the playerbase and the fact that they worked directly with AbleGamers for input on the update. There are now various ways to adjust the gameplay with its Assist Mode, with multiple types of accommodations added. The additions are too numerous to list here, but as someone who suffers from RSI and is living with post-concussion syndrome, I'm very glad a bunch of options were added that could keep one of my favorite games playable for me. 

Way back when, I called this ""one of the best action-platformers I've played in a long time"". A few years later and with many more roguelikes/lites under my belt, I can safely say this is one of my all-time favorite games in any genre, period. It's a comfort game for me now, familiar enough that I can easily listen to a podcast/audiobook while I play but still requiring my focus in a way that is soothing to my brain. I'm legitimately grateful to Motion Twin and Evil Empire for creating and continuing to update this game and involving the playerbase as heavily as it does. I hope to be playing it for many more years to come.

[Edit] Another year, another update to this review. An unlikely crossover with Castlevania of all things released this year, adding new bosses, weapons, outfits, and absolutely fantastic music that isn't to be missed. The level design and art are still utterly Castlevania while giving it that Dead Cells spin. If you're a Castlevania fan, the little homages and secrets will delight you. There's another pending update as I write this to add more content focused around Cursed items/gameplay. I love that there is always something new to look forward to in this game.",1562636226,1701152847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first it takes some getting used to like learning how to move, block damage or how little health and room for mistakes there are. But you get past that in a few hours.

killed the final boss only 4 hours in on my first interaction with him, trick was to use the healing flask which you easily forget to use throughout the game. but of course a good gear combo and picking up scrolls is a game changer. you unlock higher difficulties once you beat it so it does get more challanging.

An unforgiving and addicting game. After killing the big boss, I can do it again. And again. And again. It'll never be the same.
This game is simple yet challenging. 
Collecting cool and rare things also motivates me to play more. Also has a nap system. I don't know what it is but basically after killing endless enemies, I get to take a break before jumping back in to the next chapter.

With said nap system or whatever, I found myself playing for hours. I can't stop. A game too good, it might not be healthy for me.

Edit: I have played for 72 hours now. I forgot about this game. I lost hope after playing it for, well, 72 hours. Can't beat 3 Boss Cells, it takes patience. In the end, this game rewards you for your patience and being consistent. Can't do that; I rather play other games. But it is cool that the developers kept updating the game.

I won't buy it, so instead I will write a much deserved recommendation for Dead Cells. Unlike Destiny, a game ruined by monetization and grind, Dead Cells gives you much more than you pay for.
For one, just look how cheap it is compared to AAA titles. There are plenty of small studio or indie games that are amazing, well worth more money, and they still charge so much less. I got this on release for PC because roguelikes are some of my favorite games, the first DLCs when they first came out, and now I have ALL the DLC and game on my phone, just because it's so nice to have whenever, wherever, and the controls are simple enough they work well on a phone, but harder content of course won't be easy with touch screen controls! Phew that was a run on sentence. You like roguelikes/rougelite? Enjoy 2D platformers and combat? Enjoy ""soulslike"" combat? If you said yes to all three you need to play Dead Cells, and if not still give it a try. This is the best game of its sort on steam, and on the app store. Don't look at my hours on steam, I've played plenty more on my phone.

It is one of those games that you'll use as a comparison of quality for other videogames.

Dead Cells is a run based hack and slash random dungeon adventure.
Heavily inspired by the metroidvanias out there, but it is so much more than the some of it's parts.

The items and loot are unlocked slowly, the story peeks and draws you in to make you chase it, the game feels so fluid and natural to play it will feel like a classic in moments. And to top that off, it's really hard. Once you're dead, it's over. You are forced back to the start and all the dungeons layout is shuffled into something else. -and yet in that defeat, you'll still feel accomplished.

You might have found and banked a blueprint, or finally unlocked a skill rune (one of the few things you get to keep) or even discovered a new area all together and just seen it ... before you were brutally destroyed by an enemy you saw for the first time, your collection of cells exploding all over the stage.

You won't get those cells back, but failure is always an option. You'll get back there, and you'll get them this time. Just one more run.

I've been playing Dead Cells since it came out and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite games of all time. I constantly go back to it. and if you've never tried it you really should give it a shot.

For me, the progression and difficulty was perfect: Challenging and rewarding, but never frustrating. That is, until I tried beating the game on 3 Boss Cells, where I stopped playing. Until then, the game was a lot of fun with satisfying combat and exploration. So I got 40 hours of fun out of it, which is a lot of value for the prize.

The soundtrack is great, the different weapons and skills keep the gameplay varied and it's fun to try to beat the game using cheesy builds and weapons. As a minor nitpick, I think the internal balancing of weapons could be a bit better, because the game almost becomes to easy once you discover how overpowered damage reduction is. However, the game is constantly rebalanced, so you have an evolving meta of different builds and it is fun to discover new builds.

It's absolutely crazy how much support this game still gets from the developers. It has been out for many years and it's still regularly getting free content updates and constant rebalancing, which gives this a huge replay value!",1542876115,1700908438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do i ever get frustrated with myself due to how brutally the game might punish your mistakes at times... Yes, yes i do..

But the game FEELS good. It does really hit that "" just one more biome "" really well.
Sure there are plenty games i have more hours in, but i will sing this one's praises none the less. 

It looks good, the background story is fascinating, it sounds absolutely amazing, and most importantly it plays really REALLY well.

9/10, really excited for the next update, so i can finally do a full castlevania run, as i really quite enjoy those biomes.

gameplay, artstyle, soundtracks, atmosphere, boss fights, variety, controls, progression, level connectivity - everything's excellent.

The devs are amazing as well. They've managed to gather many other indies and form a strong community, which, not a lot of games have managed to accomplish. They really care about this game, they keep updates coming, and they listen to their players. Not much else you can ask from a game developer.

Dead cells is the game that got me hooked into Roguelite/like genre. 
I first heard of it when i was watching random game play videos on YouTube, then i got it on sale. Played it every day for like 2 hrs and during the early hours it felt too difficult and would make me rage quit. Later, when i started learning the enemy patterns,weapon mechanics and the affixes the game started becoming much easier as i was familiarized how the game was functioning.The game has got few difficulties ranging from 0 BC-5 BC (BC meaning Boss Cells) with 0 BC being the easiest and 5 being the hardest difficulty.I always had fun playing dead cells either i got defeated or when I defeated a Boss, it truly is a wonderful experience when you beat a boss who you previously died to several number of times.Dead cells gives you a actual sense of progression and the satisfaction of getting good at a game.

[b] DLC's [/b]
Dead cells has 2 DLC's and few more to come i assume?. The 2 dlcs at present are : 1) Bad Seed, 2) Fatal Falls

[b]Bad Seed[/b] :
Bad Seed introduces 2 new Grassland/Swamp-ish type biomes and 1 New Boss(Early-game) : [spoiler]Mama Tick[/spoiler].
I am personally not a fan of this DLC's content (the environment and weapons), but I would say that its a good addition to the game . I would take this route if i wanted some new variety in my runs.

[b]Fatal Falls[/b] :
 Fatal Falls DLC adds 2 biomes : Fatal Shrines and Undying Shores and 1 Mid-game boss : [spoiler]Scarecrow[/spoiler].This DLC part of the game is my most favourite addition to the game.

[b]Extra Note[/b] : If you do have extra bucks to spend, go ahead and purchase the Soundtrack for Dead cells as its really beautiful and every biome's soundtrack is befitting to its atmosphere and theme.

[b]Conclusion[/b] :
Dead cells is the perfect combination of Rogue lite,Metroidvania,Platformer put in a single game you could find on Steam imo. Don't get discouraged when you get your ass kicked by some enemies in game. Only thing you need to do is [spoiler]Git Gud[/spoiler],jk.
Add this game on your wish list and try picking it up on sale, its definitely worth it.

In a world of chaos and decay,
Where death and destruction hold sway,
There is a game, so thrilling and bold,
That takes us on a journey, both new and old.

Dead Cells is the name, and it's a game of might,
Of battles and fights, that last through the night,
Of jumping and dodging, and slicing with swords,
Of traps and enemies, that make us work towards.

The game is a challenge, so hard to beat,
With enemies that swarm, and bosses that cheat,
But we keep coming back, for the thrill of the fight,
For the rush of adrenaline, that comes with each plight.

We collect power-ups, and upgrade our gear,
To make our way through, without any fear,
We learn from our mistakes, and push ourselves more,
To see how far we can get, before the next door.

And yet, amidst the chaos and the strife,
There is a beauty, that's hard to describe,
In the graphics and the music, that play throughout,
And in the satisfaction, that comes with each bout.

Dead Cells is a game, that's hard to put down,
With its challenging gameplay, and its sights and sounds,
It takes us on a journey, both thrilling and new,

The game was definitely rougher when I first started playing many months ago and there was a patch or two that I didn't like, but the latest version is a complete joy to play. It does a great job of balancing rogue-like elements within a metroidvania genre that I've always loved. 

The gameplay is fairly simple, but there is so much room for learning and growing your skills at the game with every play. The vast majority of my deaths haven't felt cheap. Most are simply due to stupidity and/or lack of skill on my part. You learn what works for your play style, how to approach different mobs, and can experiment with many different weapon combos. The replayability is off the charts in my opinion. This game is, by far, one of my favorite games to come out in quite some time. Worth a buy for sure.

Edit: I continue to come back to this game over others and have logged more than 150 hours. There's enough new items and progression to keep me interested in coming back over and over with the promise of new content and interesting changes. Also, this is my annual labor of love nominee.

With a large variety of weapons, skills and outfits, and the fact that each level is somewhat randomly generated provides replayability. You earn cells by killing enemies, which you can trade in (between levels) to craft permanent upgrades and blueprints that you gather, reducing the effect of death. The DLCs also add plenty of extra content, with the most recent one (Fatal Falls) including 3 new areas and a new boss-fight.

You can have a pick up and play time whenever, you can save and comeback to the exact spot, lose your entire evening in what feels like 10 minutes.

Some of the ledges are weird to get used to but it doesn't detract from the game at all. It'd be neat to have some character customization built in, but I just like being able to recolor costumes in games.

Title: ""Roguevania Bliss: Dead Cells Delivers a Masterclass in Replayability""

Review:

Dead Cells is a relentless, exhilarating journey that seamlessly blends the best elements of roguelikes and Metroidvanias, creating a gaming experience that's both punishing and deeply satisfying.

From the moment you take control of the nimble protagonist, you're thrown into a procedurally generated labyrinth filled with grotesque creatures and challenging foes. The combat is precise, demanding skill and strategy as you navigate through intricate levels, uncovering hidden secrets and unlocking new weapons along the way.

One of Dead Cells' standout features is its fluidity. The controls are razor-sharp, and the responsive gameplay ensures that every death feels fair. The permadeath aspect might seem daunting at first, but it's this very element that keeps you coming back for more. Each run feels like a chance for redemption, and the thrill of discovering new weapons and abilities adds a layer of excitement to every playthrough.

The game's pixel art is not only visually stunning but also serves as a testament to the attention to detail that went into its design. The atmospheric soundtrack complements the dark, foreboding tone of the game, immersing you in its mysterious world.

What truly sets Dead Cells apart, however, is its replayability. The procedural generation ensures that no two runs are ever the same, and the vast array of weapons, skills, and power-ups allow for countless playstyles. The constant sense of progression, even in the face of defeat, is addictive and keeps you hooked for hours on end.

The developers have been incredibly supportive post-launch, regularly introducing updates and new content that breathe fresh life into the game. It's evident that the team behind Dead Cells is passionate about their creation, and it reflects in the overall quality of the experience.

In conclusion, Dead Cells is a must-play for fans of challenging roguelikes and Metroidvanias. Its tight controls, captivating pixel art, and endless replayability make it a standout title in the genre. Embrace the challenge, hone your skills, and revel in the satisfaction of conquering the ever-shifting, hostile world of Dead Cells.",1700602138,1700602138,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As mentioned by the overwhelmingly positive reviews posted, this is one of the greatest games you could play or even have sitting in your Library.  Its sheer presence alone will improve your life even if you never play it.  

I won't delve into game play mechanics or things of that nature.. it has been talked about extensively before in great detail.  What I will say is that it will be challenging but very rewarding.  Similar to a Souls-like game, its wants you to win and get better.  This game entered my life at a very difficult time and after not touching a video game for well over ten years at this point, I was immersed entirely in this experience.  I have died in this game Waaaay More than I have succeeded.. However, you will start each new run with potentially some new items, upgrades or even just better playing skills in general.  Initially starting out, I could barely even get past for the first few biomes, let alone finish a run or even defeat a boss.  At this point, in a short period of time due to the need to decompress from life, I have put in many hours of gameplay.  Filled with emotions ranging from joy, excitment, sadness, devestation and the desire to get better.  Each run contains one if not all of those emotions at certain points (losing two blueprints 3/4 into a run at the bank on 3BC is ROUUGHH).  Yet somehow the inner deep seeded desire to run it back and be better remains intact and possibly grows stronger.  
It's a rouge-lite game, there are many like it.. Its a metroid-vania style game, there are many like it.. But this one is special. I like to think of it as a Super-Sayian simulator almost (makes me feel old remembering the OG days).. You die and you come back stronger.  Games like Hades and Enter the Gungeon have given me similar experiences and are exceptional games that I have thoroughly enjoyed.  Dead Cells is special in its own right and I'm blown away that it still gets updated to this day.
After playing this game at a friends house for a weekend a while ago, I became mesmerized. The moment I got the opportunity, I purchased this game full price with the DLC's (I highly recommend to fully support the devs) without hesitation even on a  some-what limited income.  It's been an Amazing experience to say the least..So Here it is!

Starting with the most basic mechanics. The movement and combat feel crisp and extremely responsive, the input lag is minimal/none existent. The ability to customise every detail of you character each and every run make the game offer quite a lot of replay-ability, however that can be said about every rouge-lite(like) so what sets Dead Cells apart?

Starting off with extensive library of abilities, utilities, and weapons which the player has access to and that grows and expands as the player continues to explore. Along side these combat oriented things, you'll find several different costumes to re-skin your character -- some being references to other popular video games. Why this is important is because of one reason, the fact that some of the costumes have actual use in the game and can help the player unlock new areas/worlds.

Speaking of worlds, the shear amount of levels all utilising different types of level design and ways to lead players forward while still keeping true to their ground principles is amazing work. From the smallest detail always fitting, to the choice of enemy abilities working perfectly in combination with the level they're featured on is something few games accomplish.

Dead Cell quickly became game I hold in high regards after giving it a 2 hour test drive on PS5, it's a game I enjoy boasting about just as much as I love playing it.

A great game with extreme amounts of depth AND it's only 2 GB!

Not dying all the time tends to do that though.  Post boss difficulty increase seems a bit too much.

Dead Cells is nothing short of a gaming marvel! This game has captured my heart and soul in a way that very few others have managed to do. From the moment I picked it up, I was hooked, and it has only gotten better with time.

The first thing that strikes you about Dead Cells is the exhilarating gameplay. The fluidity and responsiveness of the controls are a testament to the developer's commitment to perfection. The combat system is an absolute joy, and every swing of your weapon feels powerful and satisfying. The adrenaline rush you get as you face hordes of challenging enemies is unparalleled.

What truly sets Dead Cells apart is its roguelike elements. The procedurally generated levels keep each run fresh and exciting. Every death feels like a learning experience, and you'll find yourself coming back for ""just one more run"" repeatedly. The sense of progression is brilliantly balanced, and you'll constantly discover new weapons, abilities, and items that make every playthrough unique.

The art style and pixel art graphics are stunning. The dark, gothic atmosphere of the game world is perfectly complemented by the detailed character and enemy designs. The visuals create an immersive and captivating experience that pulls you deeper into the game's lore.

The soundtrack is a masterpiece in its own right. The haunting melodies and the pulsating rhythms create an atmospheric backdrop that perfectly matches the game's tone. It's a soundtrack that will stay with you long after you've put the game down.

Dead Cells also offers a variety of gameplay styles, allowing you to tailor your character to your preferred playstyle. The multitude of weapons and abilities ensures that you'll never run out of ways to experiment and strategize.

The community and developer support for Dead Cells are outstanding. Regular updates and new content keep the game fresh, and the community engagement is second to none.

Dead Cells is a game that will captivate you from the moment you start playing and won't let go. It's a roguelike that sets the gold standard for the genre, with exceptional gameplay, beautiful art, and a killer soundtrack. It's a must-play for any fan of action, adventure, and challenge.

[b]Do I recommend Dead Cells?[/b]

[b]Short answer, yes with an if; long answer, no with a but.[/b]

My review is a positive one because not only most people want a short answer, but I also wish to support the indie studio Motion Twin with their work, choices and setting a good example of how video game studios could work.
Dead Cells is fun. It is extra fun, if you like the genre (platformer rogue like with unlockables), and even more so if you like the style (32bits 2D graphics with modern processing; CD quality audio with medieval inspired music).
But it is also frustrating. And it can be VERY frustrating.

So short answer, if you like rogue likes with unlockables, can deal well with frustration, do not mind the rather high asking price, and possibly like the style; by all means, go for it. 

[b]Now, let's get to the longer, ""no with a but"" part:[/b]

So, why would I not recommend Dead Cells; if it is fun, assuming it is done without too many bugs?
Well, the main reason lies in the way the game is developed: the developer is a small French indie studio, in which every member is equal. While I respect and salute the initiative, it shows a clear community-oriented mentality; which could be a good thing, but unfortunately has some pretty important drawbacks:

[u][b]While not marked as such, Dead Cells is effectively an Early Access game.[/b][/u]

The reason for that is very simple: the studio listens to the community a lot. A real LOT. Again, this isn't necessarily a bad trait, but it definitely gives the game a much less stable gameplay, and much less stable overall experience.
So if you pick Dead Cells, you can reasonably expect your experience to change, sometimes drastically, after any update.
For example, the recent update (1.1 - AKA pimp my ride) has angered a lot of players, and even if it has IMHO improved a lot of things, it has unquestionably made the game harder.

Some changes that made the game harder were:
[list]
[*] extreme nerfing of the damage reduction items and skills
[*] elites are more dangerous (they have more skills, like beams or shields)
[*] enemies with a shield cannot be stunned anymore
[*] item stat rerolls got more expensive
[*] the YOLO mutation (get a ""free"" death once) does not allow the player to pick another mutation once used (hence making it pretty useless)
[*] some HP buffs prevent the character from healing in some ways (looking at you ""dead inside"")
[*] ...
[/list]

Those changes are not necessarily all bad, but the amount of them coupled with them touching the essence of the gameplay; makes the game feel a lot less ""released"", as the game is being heavily modified regularly.

Now the other main reason why I would not recommend to buy the game is the fact that while the studio is listening to the community when adding features or re-vamping the experience, they do much less when it is about fixing bugs.
[strike]There is still no way to adjust the deadzone of a joypad, and as a result the character randomly faces the wrong direction, which in a game where it is important to kill enemies fast, is a HUGE drawback.[/strike]
Also, when the character is about to die, or the explorer trait activates, the game laggs by about one second, which usually means you take damage (in the former case, it means you can never dodge if an enemy is about to kill you, and you always die anyway...)

So, if you want a polished, consistent experience with your games, I would not recommend it, but stay tuned in case the developers eventually chill about modifying the game and start fixing the bugs.",1545933705,1699104325,True,57,0,0.772354006767272949,1,True,False,False

I bought Dead Cells while I was waiting for Rogue Legacy 2 to launch. I played it a bit around the first three biomes (levels), movement and dodging felt good, initial weapons were a touch underwhelming, parry mechanic didn't feel like there was a lot of feedback or benefit to it, music was good and the art style looked a bit gritty but stylish. The game's sense of humour and hinted-at background lore reminded me of Hollow Knight. The art stye choices made some creatures or attacks feel a bit obscured but all-in-all I was glad to own this and could see it being a pleasant and competent distraction, well worth the cash I'd dropped on it.

For one reason or another, I didn't play it much. Rogue Legacy 2 dropped and I sunk time into that instead as it's art style was much clearer and the gameplay more immediately engaging. 

After finishing RL2 on my Playstation (a great game and available on Steam, check that one out too), I saw an update for Dead Cells that made me salivate - Return to Castlevania. I bought this, enabled the castlevania soundtrack and suddenly, Dead Cells clicked for me. The addition of the music and some call backs to games I knew gave me enough interest to spend a little more time in Dead Cells and I have to say, I was a fool for putting this one aside.

Dead Cells isn't an immediately engaging game and instead grows over time to hook you deeper and deeper into it's systems, combat options and exploration. In the first few playthroughs, you'll get the sense that it's a quality game with a lot of love and care put into it, but it might not really grip you in the way other Metroidvania styled roguelikes can do. The deeper and more fulfilling gameplay is largely emergent here - Dead Cells tries to teach you the basics of play with simple beginning weapons, an easy first two levels and some mysterious story beats, humour or objects here and there. The more you play Dead Cells, the deeper it's hooks get into you.........then you blink and it's 2AM and your Wife is shouting ""when are you coming to bed?""

Don't be like me and miss out on a fabulous experience - buy Dead Cells and give it more than a couple of hours to settle on you. As you unlock more and more items to appear in your runs, as you kill bosses and take more movement options on, as more biomes become available for you to explore, you'll realise that the early hours don't even scratch the surface of this gem. Late game, Dead Cells seems to evolve again, becoming as much about the strategy of picking biomes to match the opportunities that your item pool RNG has given you. 

If you like action-platformers, Metroidvanias or roguelike platform games Dead Cells is simply a MUST BUY. I'm a fool for not giving this more time and I intend to correct that mistake. I'm teaching my wife to play so we can do relay-runs and she might understand how addictive this little game can become. 

Last thing: If you are a Castlevania fan and you are done with Bloodstained, Get this, get the Return to Castlevania DLC and have a blast - the Death and Dracula boss fights are wild and the music is always on-point. Maria's cat is brilliantly OP when combined with the Mushroom Boi pet. Don't worry - that statement will make sense to you after you've put a couple of hours in, I promise. :)",1699013344,1699013344,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the positives.
The game is really fun. I love rogue-likes and metroidvania games, and this smacks it out of the park.
I think I find the game so fun because of the amazingly designed combat combined with the strategic aspect of finding synergies between your weapons for peak efficiency.
The game is really re-playable. With other rogue-like games, (e.g. Hades) I find that it can become quite repetitive and you can lose the motivation to play continuously unless you really like working towards far off upgrades. Unlike Hades, for example, Dead Cells offers lots of customisation and unique things that make the game a refreshing experience each time you start a run. Firstly, there are heaps of weapons to unlock and use, each requiring the player to buy them with Cells. Then, there are the upgrades, which are also bought from Cells at the Collector. The upgrades are really good in giving a more permanent change to each run, really making you feel like you're progressing. Then, there's the runes you can unlock, permanently allowing you to visit new biomes and secret areas that you otherwise wouldn't be able to go to. This is a really neat way of adding huge amounts of content without overwhelming a new player, as runes are rare and hard to find.
Then lets talk about the biomes. The biomes are absolutely amazing and are completely randomly generated, giving a whole new experience to each run, so you never see the same thing twice.
Also, theres new content updates and fixes all the time, and it's great to see the devs haven't left it behind.

Negatives:
- There's a lot of DLCs which have to be bought to experience the game fully. I suggest if you want to get the most enjoyment out of the game, they are worth a look because they add lots of new biomes, and again, lots  of replayability. Unfortunately they cost a bit of money.
- It sometimes can be frustrating if you are struggling to get blueprints to buy upgrades and weapons that you want. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can really do about this except play daily challenges which I think award you with a blueprint when you finish it...
- It's currently not co-op or multiplayer. It would be really cool if multiple players could do runs together and fight bosses together, and I think it would be a really good addition to the game, but unfortunately it doesn't look like multiplayer is going to be added to Dead Cells, which is a real shame.
- There's a high skill floor. By that I mean it can be hard for new players to pick up the game, and it will take many tries to get your first win. Just keep in mind that as soon as you pass that skill level to beat the game once, you will probably be able to beat it again and again. Great thing is, there's a virtually limitless skill ceiling, meaning your expertise in the game can always improve. Additionally, you can add more Boss Stem Cells to your run to increase the difficulty, therefore increasing the skill floor needed to beat the game on that difficulty. (I kinda turned that negative into a positive, but the game's just so good I can't think of much bad things to say about it...)

Aside from that, I can't think of much other negatives about the game. It's really well done, and a polished game. It's rare to find bugs, and generally they'll be patched quickly.

Dead Cells is a really good game, and I strongly suggest giving it a try.",1698663868,1698663868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I deleted my save for the version 1.0 and after one hour I have to admit that I really did forget how sluggish and frustrating the beginning of the game is. 

I finished the game during EA. And now I don't want to even beat the first boss (which is virtually unbeatable if you have nothing more than the first sword). More items unlocked right away would have been much more pleasant. 

Really survivability should not be so dependent on the time spent on the game and its unlocks. The amount of souls required for some key unlocks is downright ridiculous. 

Take Binding of Isaac as example, if you are skillful enough, you can beat the game on your first try with a new save and unlock tons of new stuff on the way. That absolutely not how it feels with Dead Cells where progression plays a huge factor on your survability. Additionally, death can be huge step back on your progression if you are holding a lot of souls which just add insult to injury.

It's a different approach, I can understand that. But when you don't have much time available, this structure can feel so frustrating at the beginning.

I can't say this game's praise loud enough. This game has everything I need in a roguelike. Very challenging, incredibly satisfying and fast-paced combat that goes hand-in-hand with the game's solid platformer elements, gorgeous backdrops, a great soundtrack with some real bangers, crisp sound design (that dinging crit noise is a massive dopamine injection), as well as tons of secrets, easter eggs and references to other classic franchises that can easily take you over 200 hours of gameplay just to see them all. The game has a simple yet very rewarding affix system which allows you to create new synergies every run, is run by passionate developers that keep on dishing out fantastic content (the DLCs especially!), has an intriguing world and story, a very high skill ceiling and a custom mode if you just want to play with your favourite weapons or tweak your run in some creative ways as well as an accessibility mode for players who want a casual experience without much stress. In addition to all that, there is a huge amount of unlocks in the game that require you play on higher and higher difficulties just to get them all. Every single one of the unlockable weapons all play differently, and unlockable mutations give you additional upgrades you can equip in between stages. Even after unlocking every weapon, item and outfit in the base game, there's fun daily runs (which also grant you weapon unlocks), boss rush (with even more unlocks, arguably the most challenging to get in the game), and so-called ""aspects"" that alter the game significantly by giving you some really overpowered and fun abilites to play around with. Easiest 10/10 of my life.

(Okay so that isn't true anymore, but Dead Cells is my 2nd best game of the year. Sea of Stars beat it lol. Sorry.)

Technically, I began playing it in 2022.. but it was for under 2 hours and then I stopped. As the new Castlevania DLC was coming out in March 2023, I was thinking then would be a good chance to pick the game back up and give it a better chance. After all, I didn't hate the game. I just stopped playing it for some reason (a strange trend I do when I start a game then proceed not to play it for an extended period of time)...

Regardless, about the game. Every part about it is absolutely delightful. The gameplay? Fun and challenging. Winning battles feels rewarding and even when you lose, you're still learning. The weapons? Fun to use. I was a brutality enjoyer when I first started, then I slowly started sinking into the survival class. I've never been a fan of tactics unfortunately... But the game is pretty balanced for the most part. You can also turn on some features to make the game a little bit more attuned to your tastes, to help you ease into the harder difficulties. When I started 5BC, I had been using the cursed chest aspect, but slowly overtime I began to stop using it (I wanted to be able to get gold costumes lol).

The amount of items that there are in this game comes nowhere close to what a game like The Binding of Isaac has (literal thousands of hours), but it also doesn't have a shortage of items. I'm 139 hours through playing and I still haven't found all the items (where's the ukulele!?). I know I could just use the item made to get blueprints guaranteed, but it doesn't feel as nice then. But it's always there if you ever want to get all the items.

The diversity in areas? Amazing! Of course if you don't own the DLC's, you'll only be going through the same one or two paths over and over. But with the DLC's, it offers you so many different paths to take and of course, all the other stuff DLC's have to offer. If you haven't picked up Dead Cells, I would suggest getting the DLC's with it. It makes the game so much bigger in so many different aspects.

And the music.. OH, the music. It wasn't as great as something like The Messenger, Hades, or Omori in something I would listen to again, but the music absolutely does not disappoint. And the Castlevania OST as well? Even more fantastic! I actually prefer using that one. The music on Fractured Shrines with the Castlevania OST on is my favorite track. Next to the music in the spoiler biome as well.

I'm pretty sure there's a LOAD of categories I'm missing about this game, but that just shows how much there really is to it. Just.. get Dead Cells. You won't be disappointed. I surely wasn't.",1690744941,1697784475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The excellent musical score, amazingly responsive controls, huge variety of weapons, challenging bosses - the developers have really just put everything together in an amazingly tight package.

Props on the longevity of support, too - the game came out 2018, and there's a new free content patch that just entered beta testing this week.

Dead Cells has over 100 weapons, each fitting into at least one of the following categories: Brutality / Tactics / Survival. Brutality weapons tend to be fast, but hit for smaller amounts (swords and daggers, mostly), Tactics are almost all ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, and whips, mostly), while survival weapons are almost all hard-hitting, very slow weapons (mauls, hammers, etc.) Many weapons fall under two categories (for instance, most crossbows are both tactics and survival), so that you can wield multiple weapons using a single upgrade path.

You've also got two slots for skills, which follow the same rules as weapons, but can be anything from traps, buffs, magic attacks, or pets. Pets are handy because (with the exception of the Owl) you can just summon them at the start of a level and let them do their thing. Most of the other skills are more powerful, but require you to actually remember to use them when they're available to get the most utility out of them - which can be a problem in the hectic frenzy of combat that is Dead Cells.

Everything in Dead Cells, from the music to the timed doors at the end of levels, pushes you to be a whirlwind of destruction, endlessly running forward to kill everything before you. It's actually not a horrible strategy - if you can accomplish it without getting hit.

Dead Cell's major claim to fame is it's extended game - specifically, its system of Boss Cells. Acting as a New Game+ system, each time you win the game under an increased number of Cells, you unlock a new Boss Cell. These increase the difficulty of the game - mostly by introducing harder enemies and reducing and/or removing the healing stations between levels. However, they also increase the number of scrolls available (which can drastically increase the damage of your weapons) as well as unlock how many cells can be spent on the Forge, which can increase the potency of weapons that you find on a run.

It's pretty much the perfect game for when you just want to go balls-to-the-wall killing some dudes for half an hour. Expect most runs to end in failure, but those runs that do not are some of the most amazing adrenaline highs you'll ever experience.",1697423120,1697423120,True,21,1,0.732641398906707764,0,True,False,False

For people who are struggling with the first few floors, as the expression goes ""get gud"" because this game is easy to learn and master, I also guarantee that there's probably a play style for you given the vast amount of items and weapons you can collect.  Also the development team has accomplished so much considering how small the team is and this game sets a very high bar when it comes to metroid-vanias and souls-likes and it really sets itself apart from all the others.

The majority of the gameplay progression is exploring levels and finding items to better defeat enemies and bosses.  The player has some agency in routing through the dungeon by picking pathways that lead to predetermined ""biomes"" (i.e. If one wanted, one could go through the poison swap every run or the castle gates etc.).  The gameplay itself is very rewarding, with items and weapons all feeling fairly unique and having mechanics that encourage a certain style of play on a per item basis.  For example, the Baseball Bat deals more damage to stunned and rooted foes, so you seek out items that can stun and root foes, making combat be a setup for combos.  Simple but effective. 

I think most people who enjoy roguelites in general would enjoy this game.  If that's you, then give it a go. The DLC is not required to enjoy the base idea of the game, but they absolutely enhance the experience if you find the base game enjoyable. 


This below is mostly just a rant, which is not well written and you can reasonably ignore. I just had to b*tch:

My biggest, and really only, gripe is the platforming.  Most of the times it is benign, mostly acting as a medium to facilitate the combat more interestingly.  At other times there are small, mandatory platforming sections throughout levels that can be fairly dangerous, but these are mostly manageable as well.  However, there are some ""optional"" platforming sections one needs to complete to unlock additional items or to obtain additional scrolls that increase your damage.  And I write ""optional"" because I can't imagine the game expects me to NOT attempt to get the ""fancy dinner jacket"" outfit for my character.  Furthermore, on higher difficulties, not going out of your way to grab additional damage scrolls can make the run significantly more difficult, especially since damage scales exponentially in this game. The game does not offer really any items to affect one's platforming ability, so one just has to be good at the game, which is fine in its own right.  But I'm not playing Super Meat Boy where I can just retry a level.  Some runs take me, and I might just be a poor player, 30 to 50 minutes to get back to these ""optional"" sections.  And the game isn't a necessarily difficult platformer like SMB either, but it is just infuriating to lose a long run because I missed an unintuitive jump too many times.  And I have only died perhaps a few times to each ""optional"" section compared to bosses or mobs, but it is exceptionally demoralizing comparatively.  Get rid of this crap, man.  If the items don't really affect my ability to complete some challenge in a *roguelite* then that challenge shouldn't exist or should not be able to jeopardize my run.",1697050329,1697306062,True,0,0,0.482758641242980957,0,True,False,False

The game itself is incredibly difficult (or it may just be the fact that im bad at video games), as it took me 250 runs to beat the Hand of the King (final boss) in normal mode. Getting to the hand, is no easy task, as you will have to go through a series of difficult biomes filled with deadly enemies (and jam-packed with a bunch of items from bows to shields to swords and even grenades). Bosses are one of the easier elements of the game however. For example, the first boss you encounter, the Concierge is very easy to dodge and predict its attacks. Dead Cells is a great game that requires practice, if you want to even get far. The rogue-like element to the game makes it one of the most punishing games i have ever played.

The enemies aren't fun to fight against. I cannot comprehend the way they move and attack. There are no wind-ups for most of them and the devs use the exclamation mark as indication. I don't wish to condemn their capabilities but relying on an ""!"" leads me to believe they know the issue as well. 

Seeing a tiny ""!"" in a room filled with many types of enemies, with the explosion of colors and particles the game showers the screen with just doesn't feel fun. 

Another issue I have is there are no ""items"". Almost all games in the genre have items that modify many aspects of a run but in this one, it is only ever gear. Weapons and tools. No items. There is nothing to look forward to in a run. you got a nice weapon? You won't be looking at anything else. 

No wonder they lean so heavily towards speedrunning. And I have nothing against speedrunning. This is just an observation. There is just nothing worth finding in the areas.

This is currently the second-most-played game in my library and I am leaving a negative review. This game gets stale like many other roguelikes.

Modern buzzwords aside, Dead Cells is an action platformer with procedural levels that grant you infinite replayability. It's one of the best platformers with the smoothest movement, the most epic combat and some of the most beautiful 2D pixel graphics out there. It's refreshing to see a developer try and innovate on oldschool visuals like this, just shows how far we've come. This game has also taken huge inspiration from classic games and learned all the lessons of the days of yore, taking this knowledge and combining it with modern technology and experiences to create something classic but polished and approachable. It's like the ideas of classic action platformers finally realized to perfection. 

Dead Cells can be brutally difficult, but considering how fluid the amazing combat is and how crisp the controls are, it's a pure test of skill. If it gets too intense, don't forget to just stop for a bit to take in the beautiful art and amazing music. Hell, I wasn't really a fan of Metroidvanias, Souls-like games or 2D platformers in general going into this, but this game is so good, I loved it anyway and it changed my mind on all of those. I feel like with this experience, I might try and conquer an actual Souls game now, and maybe a Hollow Knight or Shovel Knight on the side. Until then, I will always know that I have one of the best roguelikes on the market to fall back on.

P.S. After you inevitably get seriously invested and then seriously addicted to this game, research the lore! It's kind of hard to experience it within the game itself because of the random dungeons and difficulty, but Dead Cells has some of the most fascinating lore ever!

I started playing this game right when it was just first in early access so many years ago.  It has always maintained its excellent gameplay at the core but continuously added quality content.  Sometimes paid and sometimes free.  I have the majority of the DLC and I also own the game on Switch.  Worth it.  I still keep coming back after years.

The ""music"" is droning with no real melodies or tunes. Just orchestral ambient sound like every other indie/western developed game! The graphics and aesthetics are terrible. Sprites and backgrounds are incredibly basic, while modern bloom and other lighting techniques are applied to pour excrement onto the already mediocre graphics, making the overall presentation nauseating. The environments themselves are also poorly designed and entirely unmemorable. The gameplay has the potential to be good, like the variety of weapons at your disposal. Unfortunately this game controls like Wayne's World on SNES. I'm not one to complain about short games, but I reached the ending of this in a mere 2 hours. Nothing compared to the intricately designed maps featured in the Castlevania games, which feature true exploration and puzzles.

Yes, you'll be using the wiki quite a bit, it doesn't help anyway. There are very clear build paths that you're supposed to happen upon without help in blind a blind 'playthrough.'. 

The item descriptions don't make any sense in regards to synergy or how they're supposed to work half the time.

The worst part, is that you'll be spending hours getting to the same area you were before just for 3 minutes of new content and unless you lucked your way into a nice build, you'll be spending another hour to get there.

I'm not a huge fan of 2D platformers, but this game doesn't ask too too much of you in that regard so I'm alright with that. I admit that I had a bit of a bias going in because this game is a rogueLITE, and I'm a tiny bit of an elitist when it comes to roguelikes. That's a personal thing, though. The roguelite elements are fun, and similar to the likes of Hades or Binding of Isaac. Not handholdy at all. I hadn't realized that this game is a bit of a metroidvania, and am very much enjoying that part of it. 

I mentioned character. Honestly, the trailer for the game communicates the game's tone pretty well. It's set in one of the most depressing settings I've ever seen in any media, but the tone is still very lighthearted and fun. And this is the first non-rpg I've ever played where the main character flips off an NPC. (Don't worry, it's pixelated. The whole game is.)

I do not recommend it for its end game difficulty increase modes since it puts too much of an emphasis on playing perfectly with its ever so dwindling supply of health potions for the entire run, and getting rid of ways to restore your health after boss fights, which is made more punishing by there being a chance of getting weapons that are too weak to do the later parts of the run and thus making fights lasting longer than it should.

Was always nervous to try out playing any Rogue-lite/like games because the thought of dying and losing all progress seemed like the complete opposite of what fun sounds like to me. My only experience was that I tried Binding of Isaac and thought it was okay. Then one day I was hanging out at a friend's place and she asked me to try it out, I sucked pretty bad but I liked the movement and combat. It didn't matter that I died though because it wasn't my file, so I tried a few more runs and thought it was neat that you didn't actually lose everything. Then I got home and had the urge to try it again but had to wait until I visited again. I played it a couple more times over there and each time I left I wanted to play more but didn't want to wait until I was over at their place again so I eventually bit the bullet and bought it for myself. At first I thought I wasn't gonna have as much fun since I had to start from square one, then I played it and time and progression flew by quick! This has become one of those games where I can keep going back to time and time again and start playing whenever I have nothing else to play. Basically everything about it is great from art direction to controlling your character and even the option to make it easier or harder if you want. I ended up buying all of the DLCs which I think says something for a game I was hesitant about getting in the first place.

It is also constantly getting updated by the wonderful Motion Twin, adding new content through updates and DLCs.

588650,143746100,76561199021065459,0,7,7364,0,7364,1691601379,"I'm very on the fence about this game. Once you get into it, it's really fun. It lends itself to fast-paced gameplay, zooming around tearing through enemies, which is incredibly satisfying. Improving feels rewarding, and earning your first few Boss Cells (rewards for completing a run which send you back the start to do it again, with increased difficulty) is really satisfying. The OST is also exceptional and the artstyle, though a somewhat mixed bag, really shines in a lot of the backgrounds for the different environments.

The problems - which to be honest are inherent to the game from the beginning - really start to show themselves once you hit 3/4BC as the game just becomes such a complete slog. 

There is definitely an element of mechanical skill to Dead Cells - you need to be able to react to enemies, obviously. But a large part of getting good at the game is purely knowledge. There are an absurd number of enemies, each with their own attack patterns and telegraphs. Becoming familiar with all of these is the biggest component of ""gitting gud"". Each biome has its own pool of enemies (some enemies show up in multiple places; others are exclusive to certain biomes), so learning a biome essentially constitutes learning how to read the enemies within it (and re-learning that pool each time new ones are added with new BCs).

Because the game never changes fundamentally between the Boss Cell levels, you're running the same biomes every time. You're therefore faced with a choice - you can just stick to the one route and minimise the amount of setbacks you'll face learning totally new enemies in addition to the BC difficulty increases (which really, is optimal, for reasons I'll get to), or you can mix it up for the sake of variety, but substantially increase the time you spend playing as you get used to dealing with new mobs. In the case of the latter, the variety is largely cancelled out by the frustration of losing what progress you'd made, since your existing mechanical skill only carries you so far against completely new enemies.

So you do the former. And this is what makes sense, as there is quite literally a best route in the game. Sewers->Prison->Sewers->Graveyard->Cavern straight up just gives you more scrolls. And you want scrolls, because the multiplicative scaling is really the best way by far to counter 5BC. Either you nuke everything, or you get nuked. And when one scroll is worth potentially hundreds of percentage more damage, of course you're going to take it.

All of this to say, grinding 5BC essentially just constitutes staring at Toxic Sewers for hours on end, especially if you're doing lots of runs to try achievements, or multiple routes/bosses. It ceases to be fun entirely.

Some other miscellaneous issues:
- The scroll system is poor. As soon as you start scaling, you're locked into a colour and two thirds of weapons become actively detrimental pickups.
- Weapons suffer the same issue as enemies. There are so many that you can either devote hundreds of hours to learning them, or turn on custom mode and engage with a handful you're comfortable with.
- The visual clutter is the worst I've ever seen. The accessibility update options mitigate this somewhat, but it's still not great. Pixel vomit everywhere.
- The game insists on having platforming sections despite the platforming being godawful. The jump feels sluggish and you snap to ledges to mantle them from miles away, removing pretty much any and all room for tight, skilful platforming. It's actually frustrating when you try to make a precise jump past something only to snap to it from halfway across the screen because the game is more interested in catering to people who have never played a platformer before.
- A lot of the ""difficulty"" comes from cheap enemies that wallhack you from off-screen and just very high volumes of very high-damage mobs that just get spammed more and more as the BCs go up, rather than any tests of mechanical skill, or game knowledge, which is part of what contributes to the sloggy feeling.
- The writing is painful. The game tries to have its cake and eat it too with le spooky mysterious vague lore a la Hollow Knight, but also le epic Rick and Morty taking nothing seriously jokes and banter, none of which is funny. One of the more poignant story beats (though that is a generous description) is undercut by the cringest line and le epic troll middle finger moment I've ever seen. It's like the Marvel ""so that just happened!"" on crack.
- The super secret ultra final twist boss is wildly underwhelming. One of the blandest, easiest final boss fights I've ever encountered. The rest of the bosses are also nothing to write home about. The game's combat shines better in biomes, at least before the grind wears you down.
- The devs milk this game to an obnoxious degree. Middling, half-hearted updates and DLCs years after launch, balance patches for a single player game - just move on lmao. All it serves to do is add bloat, which is bad for the player, because all these new weapons just take up space in your loot pool over the weapons you actually want to see, unless you're willing to sink potentially a thousand hours in learning every single weapon, but the combination of how insane an undertaking that'd be, and the existence of custom mode, makes me assume that isn't how the game is intended to be played.
- Also on the devs, they literally launched the game without an ending, and while the DLC that added it was free, the rest slotting into the main game despite being paywalled feels a little slimy.

Overall, Dead Cells is a game that seems to discourage you from engaging with it. It's designed in such a way that optimising for the smallest amount of content makes the game most bearable. And given how obnoxious it becomes anyway, maybe that's for the best. If you're content just playing this to 3BC, you'll probably have a blast, but as a full experience, I can't recommend it, especially for a comparatively high price tag (especially accounting for the DLC) as indie games go.

5/10 - The core gameplay carrying the first few difficulty tiers isn't enough of a silver lining to outweigh the unpleasant grind Dead Cells becomes.",1691621285,1693781192,False,48,3,0.671413004398345947,1,True,False,False

Dead Cells is a roguelike metroidvania that has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. It's a perfect blend of challenging gameplay, rewarding progression, and addictive atmosphere.

The game's procedurally generated levels are always fresh and exciting, and the combat is fast-paced and brutal. There's a huge variety of weapons and abilities to experiment with, and each run feels different from the last.

I also love the game's sense of progression. As you play, you'll unlock new weapons, abilities, and items that will make you more powerful and help you reach new areas. It's incredibly satisfying to see your character grow stronger over time.

The game's atmosphere is also top-notch. The visuals are dark and atmospheric, and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. It really sucks you into the world of Dead Cells.

The new Return to Castlevania DLC is a great addition to the game. It features new levels, enemies, and bosses that are inspired by the classic Castlevania games. It's a great way to relive some nostalgia, and it also adds some much-needed challenge to the game.

Overall, Dead Cells is a masterpiece. It's a must-play for fans of roguelikes, metroidvanias, or just great games in general. I highly recommend it.",1691742043,1691742043,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly this game jumps on the 'souls like' train so you know what that means.

Souls-likes always suffer the same problem - every enemy becomes a knowledge-gate instead of a skill-check. There's more to be learned from souls games than just ramping up the volatility but few designers pick up on that and gamers foam at the mouth to be whipping boys for this style of arbitrarily hard gameplay. The result is you either waste weeks learning each knowledge gate or you put the game down and get meme'd on by everyone suffering from sunk cost fallacy - either way there are no true winners.

Overall dead cells feels like it has the potential to be a pretty solid game but squanders it. I can't see the combat design as anything other than lazy and while it tries to make up for it with fast gameplay to get you back in the action this just results in an incredibly repetitive experience without the substance to make investing in it worthwhile.",1690301979,1691659944,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The writing is absolutely charming and it's filled to bursting with references both indirect and direct, I love playing as Jacket from the Hotline Miami series to bash in Castlevania enemies.

The game is really fun and the synergy between all the equipment you can get is fantastic, but I have two complaints about the game. The fist is the final boss. You're placed in a very small arena and the boss has very quick attacks, which can kill you in two hits. I used the training area to practice against this boss, but I still couldn't get it down. I think this boss battle difficulty is too high, even on custom game mode. The second complaint is how long it takes to unlock things. The game takes a lot of grinding, even for costumes.

Can hop in and hop out for a few runs at a time, get frustrated at getting ganked by a bunch of enemies and take a break, then hop right back on again the next day.

With its dynamic combat, procedurally generated levels, and stunning pixel art, this game offers an unforgettable experience that leaves you craving more.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
The pixel art in Dead Cells is a visual treat. Each environment is meticulously crafted, from hauntingly beautiful dungeons to eerie forests and treacherous castles. The attention to detail and smooth animations add depth to the game's world, making every moment visually engaging. The blend of dark and vibrant colors sets the perfect mood for the game's challenging and atmospheric gameplay.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Dead Cells' gameplay is where it truly shines. The fast-paced combat is a joy to master, offering a satisfying mix of sword-slashing, arrow-shooting, and spell-casting. The game's ""Roguevania"" approach, combining rogue-like elements with the exploration of a metroidvania, creates a compelling and ever-changing experience. Each run feels fresh, as the levels, enemies, and loot are procedurally generated, keeping you on your toes and encouraging experimentation with different playstyles.

[b]Audio:[/b]
The audio design in Dead Cells complements the gameplay perfectly. The ominous soundtrack sets the mood for the intense battles and exploration, while the sound effects provide visceral feedback to your actions. The clashing of weapons, the creaking of doors, and the eerie echoes of the environment immerse you in the game's dangerous world, adding to the adrenaline rush of combat.

[b]Story:[/b]
While not heavily story-driven, Dead Cells offers subtle hints of lore that pique your curiosity as you progress. The game's mysterious narrative and enigmatic characters encourage you to piece together the game's world and history bit by bit. It's a testament to the game's design that even without a prominent plotline, players find themselves drawn deeper into the game's secrets.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Dead Cells strikes a satisfying balance between accessibility and challenge. The initial stages provide a smooth learning curve, allowing new players to get accustomed to the mechanics and enemies. However, as you progress, the difficulty ramps up significantly, demanding quick reflexes and strategic decision-making. Each death feels like a learning opportunity, motivating you to return and improve your skills.

[b]Grind:[/b]
The grind in Dead Cells is thoughtfully balanced. While gathering cells and blueprints to unlock new weapons and abilities requires some effort, it never feels like an overwhelming grind. The diverse and rewarding upgrades make the progression feel worthwhile, encouraging players to explore different paths and strategies.

[b]Game Time:[/b]
With its replayable nature and ever-changing levels, Dead Cells offers a significant amount of gameplay. Depending on your skill level and desire to uncover all its secrets, you can easily spend tens to hundreds of hours immersed in the game's challenging and addictive world.

[b]Price:[/b]
Dead Cells' price is well worth the experience it offers. The depth, variety, and replay value justify the cost, making it a standout title in its genre.

Dead Cells is a triumph of game design that sets a new standard for action-platformers. Its addictive gameplay, stunning pixel art, and engaging audio create a seamless and immersive experience. If you're a fan of challenging and rewarding games, Dead Cells is an essential addition to your gaming library.

I wasn't gripped by the core gameplay loop, and at first I wondered why. This game seemed to have made some waves in the roguelite space. It definitely seemed popular, it has all this DLC released well after it's launch. Surely it must be good?

But I don't think this game really shapes up to it's modern competitors. Maybe in 2018 the combat was visceral and fast, but we have games like Hades now. Maybe back then the metroidvania elements were alot more fresh, but we've had both Rogue Legacy games now and it's successor delivers so much better on that feel.
The visuals are unique, gave me little nostalgias about the weird 3d graphics of some gameboy advance games. But whilst a unique and interesting art style is no less an outstanding achievement - it's practically a given for any major release in this genre, let alone the main vehicle that indie games use to stand out.

I guess in the year of our lord 2023, I'm alot more interested in rogues with more unique gameplay experiences like Gunfire: Reborn or Domekeeper. Funny game where I keep restarting, move left and right and hit man with funny basic 3 hit combos isn't as fresh today and have much fiercer competition.

If you're interested in Dead Cells, check out any of the other games I just mentioned. I'd also like to point to Risk of Rain 2 and Enter the Gungeon.

That’s Dead Cells core concept in three little words. This Castlevania-inspired roguelike charges you with journeying through an ever-changing castle, surviving using only your wits, learned skills and a variety of different weapons and gadgets.

Along the way, you collect Cells. These are gathered by wiping out enemies or liberating them from secret areas in the game world. They can be used to pay for upgrades that persist forever: perhaps there is a special weapon that you want to unlock as a piece of loot in game, or the ability to heal yourself twice with a health potion, or even three times.

Eventually, you’ll die. There are no checkpoints and you will be unceremoniously dumped back into the starting area, ready to try again. While you lose your money and Cells, your upgrades will persist and you get to try again.

Certain upgrades can let you keep hold of a chunk of your cash, but it’s losing the Cells that really hurts: these can only be spent on the progression-enabling upgrades at the end of each level, so several times during play you could find yourself losing 30 or even 50 Cells after a death. It’s not an exaggeration to say that losing a significant chunk of these is agonising, and provides a strong impetus to perform better next time.

This loop of performance and self-improvement is the chewy meat that holds Dead Cells together, and it’s satisfying enough to carry the entire game on its back. While the levels are procedurally generated, they obey specific rules and by learning them you can start to see the patterns in the generation and use them to your advantage.

To escape from the castle ramparts you need to venture downwards, the mushroom doctor’s room has a hidden passage, and digging into the bottom of the well will often yield goodies. There isn’t always a well, or the mushroom doctor’s room, and they may look different each time, but learning these little bits of information will help you make an impact each time these opportunities rear their head.

This is true of the enemies too. It’s important to learn each adversaries’ unique attack patterns and behaviours if you want to survive. There’s a remarkable amount of variety throughout the game’s roster of enemies, whether it’s angular scorpions firing venom, mages firing projectiles through walls or even teleporting swordsmen that, after they’ve caught your scent, never stop chasing you.

All of these appear in the first few areas of Dead Cells before you encounter the first major boss, and all of them are immediately challenging until you learn how they work.

You’ll also get to grips with the game’s remarkable arsenal. The weapons — roughly divided into melee, ranged and shields — and power-ups that you can get your hands on are interesting and drop at random, with similarly random traits and rarities.

A gold quality weapon, gold being the highest rarity item, will often come stuffed full of invaluable traits to help you wipe out enemies. Get a couple of these and your run is somewhat charmed, a series of weird particle effects and damage over time attacks chipping away at the swirling mass of enemies around you.

Some of the items feel overpowered, and I initially thought the Ice Bow in the game would redefine any run. Later, I found success with a Hokuto’s Bow: this wondrous thing massively increases the damage that an enemy takes.

Then I got a gold rarity shield that wouldn’t allow me to parry but meant that I took the bare minimum of damage from attacks and reflected 300 percent of any damage blocked while taking a tiny chip of my health. Suddenly, anything I’d marked that attacked me instantly exploded, and two of the games big bosses also fell afoul of it, taking big chunks of damage every time they tried to hurt me.

It’s the combat in the game that keeps me coming back. No other game has quite managed to capture the joy of combat like this. Whether you’re clutching a bow and sword, or hiding away behind a shield and tossing throwing knives, the kinetic energy of the combat makes the unforgiving nature of the game feel like a strength, not a weakness. After learning how the enemies tick, tearing through them is a joy.

The sound and visuals are excellent too. The movement and attacks look nice but it’s the smaller details that really make it; ride an elevator and sparks come off the walls and chain, fire spreads across the floor, glowing blue if it touches off some oil left on the ground. Get to low health and you’ll leak blood.

There is real care and attention that’s been given, and it’s impossible not to notice. The different levels all have their own distinctive look, and the technical performance is flawless, so even when everyone on the screen is being torn apart, everything looks good and the framerate is stable.

What problems Dead Cells does have is in its progression system. Broadly, while you can succeed at the game with just a couple of the ability-granting runes, getting to many areas requires you to pick up items that will allow you to wall-jump or smash through weak floors below you.

Getting these is poorly signposted, and as these persistent upgrades are key to exploring some of the weirder areas in the game, it is frustrating to bash your head against it repeatedly until you work out where you’re supposed to go, as you fight your way through levels again and again.

This is a shame because the game really does thrive when you explore, with amusing writing and some excellent environmental storytelling. Unfortunately, more casual players will probably be turned away by the sheer amount of work needed to get the final two skill runes, and writing the game off too early because of that.

Coming into the crowded Metroidvania genre was a bold move, but one that seems to have paid off as Dead Cells has delivered the best example of the genre in years. The game is deep and rewards exploration, with exceptional combat and so much content it’s honestly a little intimidating.",1686160580,1688936126,True,1,0,0.505102038383483887,0,True,False,False

When the battlefield becomes deleterious and laborious....
I can always rely on your sweet and broad shoulders...

No one could ever resist you avant-garde style,
I adore the way you dress me up and compliment my singular otherworldly eyeball...
Sometimes I fantasize that your scissor may cut the fabric off my shell.

The game has added multiple DLCs which add a more of what makes the game great. Even has a streamer mode which pulls the chat into the roles of Captain Chicken (who allows you to heal, when they want), and even can add abilities to the Bosses, as well as a voting feature to make every level harder or slightly easier.

By the time i finished it I was more relieved that this game was over rather than sad its come to an end. Nothing really matters and its mostly RNG for a good set of items that lets allows the player to shred the levels no problem. Its not really a great game, however,  it will take time which some players seek. Its nice that the graphics are very old school so any PC can play it. There are a few bright points however most the time after the player takes damage they feel cheated rather than shown that they played incorrectly. Very inconsistent hitboxes, enemies not responding to players position consistently, parry symbol not matching timing of parry, alot of cltter on the screen which most the time makes the player have no idea what hit them. There are better games on the market right now and I cant recommend this game. Most likely any person who reads this and disagrees will just say ""Skill Issue"" but like I said I beat this game BC5 100% I dont want to give away any spoilers multiple times. 

I felt more frustration during my play through than I did any other emotion. Clearly I am in the minority but just be weary of this games groupthink culture.

And I think I have to give credit to Dead Cells because it has shown to me that I don't like rougelikes, or rougelites. Or whatever the hell is a rougevania, which is possibly the worst thing I've ever heard. This game is not similar to a metroidvania at all since all progression is lost upon death except for weapon and skill unlocks. And progression with better stats and new abilities through a persistent map is a core concept of a metroidvania so I highly disagree. This is not a metroidvania. But sure pop off I guess. 

I'm getting sidetracked by my hatred for genre names. 

Dead cells is a fun game. But one I could only tolerate for up until beating the first boss, at least on pc. On the switch I put about 20 hours into the game and had a fun time but stopped. The reason why? Simply put: with rougelite games there tends to be such a fixture on tons of content to unlock and meta progression that there never feels like there's a level of rewarding progress for me the player. It's always progress towards making the next ""run"" potentially better. I know most of my issues with the game could (and probably should) be chalked up to my lack of skill in these types of games. But it's just something I don't vibe with. I never feel rewarded for playing. I always feel punished for trying to get farther and farther in these kind of games, by constantly hitting a wall of sorts and being thrown back to the start of the game with nothing except the ""unlocks"" I got to maybe, randomly, help me *this* time. So what feels like something that would take me around 2-5 hours in a non-rougelike game, feels like it's going to take me 20+ hours to beat in a game like Dead Cells, purely because of this ""meta"" progression and luck. And I do not have the patience to put something like 200+ hours to beat a game like this.

I know this isn't just a problem in Dead Cells but other rougelite games as well. Hell, I am even fully aware that this meta progression is the exact reason some people really enjoy these types of games. But for me it takes me right out of the game.

Obviously most people really enjoy this game. It has like a 97% overwhelmingly positive rating here on steam with over 100,000 reviews. That's incredibly impressive, though more of just a stat to show how well this game has reached it's target audience. So I'm not looking to change views on this game at all.

But I still have to give credit to Dead Cells, because it has helped me confirm that even if a game is popular, doesn't mean it's a perfect match for everyone.

Although be warned it has one of the biggest skill floors ive seen in any roguelike ive played, its not very casual friendly and is quite hard (kinda markets itself as so, dont expect to just win a run because u get good rng).
Lots of player agency and control, fun enemies with good patterns, its just a nice reward good game.

As an action rougelike-metriodvania, developer Motion Twin knocked it out of the park. Every biome / area the player explores is vast with tons of enemies, secrets, goodies to find. As in the name, the rouge like nature means every run or attempt feels different. I can play through the same biome 20 times in a row, and each run will never feel like the last. The combos is crisp and fluid. Attacking, jumping, parrying, etc, every control the player can use is fully based on skill. When you get a kill that's 100% on you, but the same goes for death. This game does not cheat you, when you die, its 100% YOUR fault. There are so many weapons and skills to unlock, so many areas to uncover, and although this game was release almost 5 years ago, they are still updating it with more content. The cell shaded graphics are terrific, and the music goes hard in every single level. Not much to criticize here except maybe the lack of a multi-player mode. I feel like this game have functioned well with a 2-4 player option.

When I first got it I thought it'd be simple and fun, how wrong I was, the game BROKE me when doing the 100% grind for all achievements. But it was so rewarding when I saw that golden badge appear. Definitely the toughest achievement was running through all levels with a cursed sword against all bosses. Now let's get to the core aspects of the game!

OST: 8/10, the songs are pretty good, they do support the theme of a medieval like island.
Gameplay: 10/10, The gameplay is super unique no matter what path you take, you'll always end up in the same place or another.
Weaponry: 10/10, Every weapon has an insanely unique play style, attack pattern, and attacks, so no matter the run you'll always be trying something different to reach the Throne.
Bosses: 9/10, The bosses are indeed interesting, learning their attack patterns are a pain but worth it when you do the cursed sword run for those delicious achievements. 
Zones: 10/10, All the zones you see in the game follow a specific theme, like the sewers or dilapidated obituary, whatever it's called, you can see the world just flow with life and death, as you run through the zones!

The game was indeed fun to play, especially trying to get all achievements. You'll definitely need to use some forms of tactical prowess to get through all the achievements for that golden medal. Especially the more annoying ones, that require a specific rarity or loot drop. 

Final Rating: 9/10, the game was good. Just still feeling the pain of achievements after beating it all.",1686678533,1686678533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously, this is probably one of the hardest games I have ever played (sure city builders can be difficult too, but this game is on a completely new level). One bad move, incorrectly timed parry and you can be sent all the way back to start. And after you beat the first final boss, guess what. This was just the beginning. The real difficulty starts only now.
But the combat is incredibly satisfying, controls are responsive and all the areas are beautiful

Ever since I started playing this game as it was in early access, it's been my favorite game of all time. I've played quite a few games in quite a variety of genres, and while there are some that come within a swinging distance, nothing has ever reached the heights of how amazing this one feels to play for me. The movement, the mechanics, the replayability and constant progression, the story and how it's conveyed, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, and all of the subtle touches that the game never explicitly points out to you (such as auto-turning you around if you initiate an attack while facing away from an enemy) culminate into the most reliably enjoyable experience I have ever had with any piece of media.

I don't know how reliable of a source I am, I'm hardly somebody to look to if you're searching for any kind of objective take. Many things I've heard other people criticize about this game are also things I have noticed, but appreciate about this game. It is one of the most punishing things I've ever come across -- with how much lenience and the insane variety they provide the player with, the game has to be as unforgiving as possible within the bounds of the rules it sets -- but I have never had as much fun in the process of butting my head against a wall as I have with this game, and no other gaming accomplishment has reached the satisfaction of finally overcoming something that has thrown me in the dirt time and time again. It's also extremely refreshing to see a development studio as passionate as the ones behind this.

Tl;dr, easily my personal favorite video game, without a question. I do feel like a lot of it is something I specifically am predisposed to adoring, but I will always recommend this game. Unless you don't find fun in experiences that cause frustration at times, because this game will piss you off.",1585938332,1686082561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I remember when I first picked up the game in 2020 on my XBOX One, I have not put it down since. Not only is this game beautiful design wise, it also has a kick ass ost that really captures the overall aesthetic of the game and lore. Each level has it's own theme, color scheme, and soundtrack making each run unique depending on what route you take. There are a plethora of weapons, upgrades, and secrets to unlock to help you take on the vast amount of horrifically awesome creatures each level offers. This game immerses you in a medieval-ish environment with mechanics that make you feel like a total bad ass while playing. The combination of pixel gore, gruesome monsters, and humor is very refreshing and well done. If you love unique indie games like Hollow Knight or Katana Zero, I absolutely recommend Dead Cells.

You can have weapons that do over 30K damage per second at the end of a run, or you die trying to get to the next level because you picked up a curse and overestimated yourself. The game is basically die and die again till you achieve something, and then you die again. And also, the soundtrack is just gorgeous, I origanally bought it because of the Castlevania DLC but the whole game is just amazing. The variety of weapons and playstyles you can have is also a thing to point out. You can have bows, Swords, shields and so much more. And as you progress through the game it gets better and better because you unlock more of the weapons, the mutations and the outfits for your playercharacter. Then there are those little secrets like the Starfury from Terraria or the Pure Nail from Hollow Knight for example. You even get those weapons in little areas from the games, like the bench in Hollow Knight. Overall I would say, this game is absolutely worth the try.

if you're not Super into roguelikes there's a chance that addictiveness will be good enough for you, and i think that might actually be where a lot of the positive reviews are coming from.

otherwise, i really can't recommend this game. the gameplay feels great right up until you take damage, then everything becomes clunky as hell, including stun-locking you to death for messing up a single dodge or parry. i'm sure a lot of people would say ""just don't get hit lmao"" or suggest that's the core of the game; everyone's supposed to be a glass cannon. except there's tons of items and passives that revolve around actively taking damage, mitigating it, and recovering, so no, that's just an oversight at best, poor design at worst.

after a while it starts to feel like the game was designed around non-boss levels specifically and bosses were an afterthought. any enemy that you can't one-shot or kill before it can act tends to feel half-thought-out and bosses are just those kinds of enemies but with more health.

according to another review on here at least, the devs have admitted (bragged) that one of the dlcs is so difficult that most people would consider it unfair, and specifically that kind of mentality has become a rampant problem with developers of difficult games. they seem to get the idea that ""unfair"" and ""difficult"" are perfect synonyms, or at the very least they think ""so long as the game is hard, our job is done, no further thought required."" imagine a man puts a gun to your head and says ""juggle or i'll kill you"" then he ties your hands behind your back. yeah i'd say that's pretty hard, mission accomplished.

then there's the fact that the game's true ending is tied to the highest difficulty, that is; tied to extreme masochism.

now that i've made some attempt at fair criticism, i hope you'll forgive me for a more emotional comment. this game doesn't even come close to earning it's overwhelmingly positive review status and the boss fights feel like sudden-onset diarrhea.",1685396442,1685396442,False,2,1,0.471023410558700562,0,True,False,False

Wot I liked
- The protagonist does not speak much but is very expressive;
- It has a surprisingly deep for a roguelike combat, which is more soulslike: you got dodge, block, parry, ranged, melee, spells, pets, traps, bombs;
- Many weapons: melee, ranged, shields, spells, thrown - slow and fast with different moves and abilities;
- Very deep and customizable options (game's still very hard);
- You can reach some areas after gaining various movement abilities;
- The game is pretty hard on normal, then you can crank it up 5 times more hard;
- A bunch of Easter Eggs and pop culture references;
- There is a book promoting other indie roguelikes (I had to note that I had played most of them);
- Very stylistically cool DLC collabs with other IPs.

Wot I disliked
- You could say it's a bit pricey for an indie game, but it seems their team is quite big;
- The bane of all roguelites: your run can become prohibitively hard depending on your luck.

To sum it all up, Dead Cells has everything a soulslike metroidvania need and more.

Finally got to the Hand of the King...and I'm bored.

It's fun for a single run, but overall this gets stale incredibly fast. The enemies are downright pathetic in design choices. They're all monotonous and boring. The bosses too. Despite being 1:1 enemies, they seem to have about 3 attacks each. This gets boring spamming the same pattern over and over. Honestly, you end up impatient just waiting for the healthbars to trickle down. There's no cool effects by combining mechanics. Hades did this better, where you could combine effects to create some truly menacing builds. In this? It's stack bleed or crit damage for DPS. There's only three useful mutations, and they're so useful there's no reason to pick anything else. Parrying is worthless and unfeasable for the later runs, when everything starts to spam bombs for some reason.

It's fast-paced and actively rewards playing as such, however, everything is very much only meant to be seen as a blur.

Developed by Motion Twin, this roguelike metroidvania is a true masterpiece that kept me hooked from start to finish. With its innovative mechanics, stunning visuals, and addictive gameplay loop, Dead Cells has become a benchmark for the genre.

One of the standout features of Dead Cells is its gameplay, which strikes a perfect balance between precision and fluidity. Controlling the agile protagonist feels incredibly responsive, and the combat mechanics are satisfyingly weighty. The wide array of weapons and abilities at your disposal ensures that every encounter feels fresh and engaging. Whether it's slicing through enemies with a lightning-fast sword or decimating them with explosive traps, Dead Cells offers an immense amount of versatility and playstyle customization.

What sets Dead Cells apart from other games is its roguelike elements. Each run through the game is procedurally generated, meaning you'll never experience the same layout twice. This adds an element of surprise and strategic thinking as you adapt to the ever-changing environments and enemy placements. The exhilarating rush of progressing through each level while managing your resources and health creates an addictive cycle of risk and reward.

Furthermore, the game's metroidvania-inspired design rewards exploration. Unlocking new areas and discovering hidden secrets provides a sense of accomplishment and fuels your desire to delve deeper into the sprawling world. The level design is meticulously crafted, with interconnected paths and shortcuts that cleverly loop back to previous areas, encouraging you to revisit them armed with new abilities.

Visually, Dead Cells is a feast for the eyes. The beautifully animated pixel art style is stunningly detailed, and the atmospheric lighting brings the hauntingly atmospheric world to life. From the grim dungeons to the eerie forests, each environment exudes a distinct ambiance that perfectly complements the gameplay.

The audio design is equally remarkable, with a haunting soundtrack that sets the tone for your perilous journey. The sound effects, from the clash of swords to the groans of defeated enemies, are crisp and satisfying, further immersing you in the game's dark and foreboding atmosphere.

In terms of replay value, Dead Cells is unparalleled. With a vast array of weapons, power-ups, and upgrades to unlock, the game constantly encourages experimentation and replayability. Each playthrough feels unique, as you adapt your strategy based on the randomly generated elements. The inclusion of various difficulty levels and unlockable modifiers ensures that even the most experienced players will find new challenges to conquer.

Dead Cells is a triumph in game design, offering a near-flawless experience. Its tight controls, addictive gameplay loop, and breathtaking visuals combine to create an unforgettable journey. Whether you're a fan of roguelikes, metroidvanias, or simply enjoy challenging and rewarding experiences, Dead Cells deserves a spot in your gaming library.

Its challenging gameplay and my repeated purchases across multiple devices have made it a standout title in my gaming library.

One aspect that sets Dead Cells apart is its ability to teach resilience through repeated deaths. In the game, dying is not just a setback but an opportunity for growth. Each failure becomes a lesson, pushing me to analyze my strategies, adapt my playstyle, and uncover new paths to success. This iterative process of trial and error has honed my reflexes, sharpened my decision-making abilities, and fostered a sense of determination that translates beyond the game itself.

The game's difficulty curve strikes a perfect balance, ensuring that every encounter demands precision and skill while avoiding frustratingly insurmountable challenges. Dead Cells keeps me engaged with its smooth controls, rewarding combat mechanics, and procedurally generated levels that guarantee fresh experiences with each playthrough. Overcoming seemingly impossible odds and emerging victorious instills a genuine sense of accomplishment that few other games can provide.

Moreover, my multiple purchases of Dead Cells across various devices have amplified my enjoyment of the game. The seamless transition between platforms allows me to delve into its addictive gameplay whether I'm at home, on the go, or simply seeking a change of scenery. Whether I'm slashing through hordes of enemies on my gaming console or exploring its intricate world during a commute on my mobile device, Dead Cells never fails to captivate me with its responsive controls and captivating visuals.

In summary, Dead Cells has not only elevated my gaming skills but has also taught me valuable life lessons about resilience and perseverance. Its challenging yet fair gameplay, combined with the joy of playing across multiple devices, has created a gaming experience that is truly exceptional.

The metroid-vania style gameplay is easy to pick up and fairly simple to improve at. Other highlights include: The weapons are fun and the enemies all are clearly defined but , albeit, sometimes repetitive, although that's ok because the combat is very hack'n'slash in nature. The progression system for unlocking new weapons and abilities is pretty good, as well as the difficulty and enemy progression as you get deeper into runs.
      My biggest (and probably only) gripe with the game is that all of the DLC other than the free ""Rise of The Giant"" DLC is pretty uncreatively implemented. When you get to a door that takes you to a new biome, there's a label above it that tells you what biome it will take you to. The DLC doors look exactly the same as the rest, no locks or gates preventing access, leading players to assume they've found a new biome that's ready to be explored. However, instead of entering the door, a popup appears, saying, ""You need [insert DLC here] to access this area."" preventing the player from entering until said DLC is installed. I mean, from a marketing standpoint, it's genius because it compels players to buy the DLC, but from a game play standpoint, it's just kind of annoying for the the player to be presented with a new area to explore, only to be blue-balled by a pop-up. 
       Other than that, it's a great game with plenty of secrets, cross-overs, references, and lore. I highly recommend buying this game if you like rogue-lites, and I probably will end up playing at least some of the DLC.

Review:
In a vast sea of information, our voices often go unheard. Yet, I find solace in expressing my thoughts freely, unaffected by external expectations.

This review delves into the essence of my experience, knowing it may never reach its intended audience. In the digital realm, my efforts seem futile, but this reflection is not about despair. It reminds us to embrace the intrinsic value of expression, rather than seeking validation.

The absence of readers liberates this review, allowing open exploration without conformity. It's a cathartic release of unburdened ideas, devoid of external scrutiny.

Consider the irony as you stumble upon this digital artifact, reflecting on the countless unexplored creations in the abyss. Let us appreciate the act of creation for its own sake, as attention becomes scarce.

This review is a testament to the beauty of expression, even in invisibility. Whether read or not, it serves its purpose—a symbol of authenticity, creative freedom, and human resilience.

Reasons why I recommend:
- Difficulty  
- Should run on almost any PC given the graphics quality 
- In-game music is ear candy and blends well with the environment of each biome
- Customizable difficulty using BC (boss cells), which are earned upon further progression in the game 
- Wide variety of weapons and skills to choose from
- Layout of each biome is variable between each run, so gameplay is seldom repetitive

Reasons why I don't recommend:
- Difficulty (for those coming from Hades, expect a significant difficulty bump esp. in latter biomes)

Expect to try, and fail, a lot if this is your first rougelite/rougelike. Overall, highly recommend even at full price. Would still suggest finding the game discounted as sales on Steam are quite frequent in general.

to give you an idea of difficulty and depth, theres a total of 5 difficulty levels divided by boss cells, each time you beat the game on the hardest difficulty, you unlock the next. im only on 2 boss cells, and i've gotten achievements that only 5-1% of people have gotten. its not easy, but its fun as hell and theres plenty of references to other games to keep you playing, plus the weapons can be fun as hell if you know how to play with them",1683738632,1683738632,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I noticed a couple of bugs, for instance the sorting layer for candles probably needs to go behind doors. If some candles and doors are too close, the candles are seen through the door when it opens. 

There's a couple of other issues, like jumping can occur, when you don't want, i.e. when WASD jumping it'll use all of your jumps at once instead of just 1 jump until you release. It could say more about the input system.

Beyond that, from I've seen a well crafted highly-refined art style with robust atmospheric qualities and a strong desire to form an immersive experience. This is a rare gem among a sea of stones. 

I haven't tried the DLC but the combat mechanics, variety of weapons, stats and abilities, and upgrade options, currency / exchange usage, and NPC spread, it's an instant classic. 

I'd rate this up there with Fallout 3 for me, personally. One of my all-time favorite games.

Геймплей у этой игры очень даже интересный, затягивающий и сложный (последнее постепенно начинает угосать всё сильнее и сильнее, пока не появился режим помощи, с помощью которого абсолютно легко становится проходить изначально хардовую игру), но постепенно начинает раздражать тот факт, что большинство оружий впринципе не особо играбельны на высоких сложностях (возможно это сделано, чтобы игроки могли сами выбирать, насколько сложно будет играться, но ведь достаточно просто всю игру ходить с маленьким кол-вом свитков или с оружием низкого уровня, нафига вообще нужно большую часть оружия делать сомнительным, мне никак это не понятно). Музыка по началу может казаться нормальной, но постепенно она не просто приедается, а раздражает. Возможно в игре самой она впринципе еще может работать, но желание слушать треки за пределами игры нет. Задники выглядят прекрасно, спорить с этим не буду. Имеется множество интересных локаций, каждый из которых обладают уникальным строением. Мне не особо, однако, нравятся модели все существ, которые являются 3Д модельками с пиксельными фильтрами, как по мне, это выбивается из 2Д стиля очень сильно. Достижения получать в этой игре болезненно, долго, но когда ты их выполнишь без особенного режима (за исключением достижений с оружиями, в обычном прохождении хрен их получишь), получишь невероятную эйфорию. В этой игре есть интересный лор, но разработчикам на него плевать, поэтому он не сильно расскрыт, хотя с другой стороны мне всё равно на сюжетную составляющую игр, без неё могу спокойно играть в игру, чтобы играть, а не чтобы кинчик посмотреть, но хотелось бы немного больше инфы про эту вселенную. Есть три вида свитков, определяющие твою игру: брутальность, тактика и живучесть; брутальность довольно сложна для среднестатистического игрока этой игры, но частенько через неё удобнее играть, чем с остальными видами свитков, особенно битва на маяке; тактика является очень хорошим выбором как для начинающих игроков, так и для проверенных игроков, являющаяся самым полезными типом геймплея; с живучестью есть некоторая проблемка - она нужна исключительно для тех, кто очень часто тычки в лицо получают или для тех, кому нечего уже делать, так как полезных предметов с таким типом геймплея очень мало, есть конечно причина, почему оружие очень медленное, но уж лучше быстрым кинжалом нанести столько же урона, сколько и нанес один удар шар бабой на живучести, с которой играть вообще не весело и заторможенно. А еще забыл про очень странный скачек сложности сказать: почему-то слишком резко возрастает сложность игры на 2 и 4 клетке босса, что вызывает раздражение. 5 клетка практически такая же, как и 4, только в ней присутствует система хвори, стимулирующая игрока убивать как можно больше, быстрее, эффективнее, не более. 

Bad seeds  имеет хорошие локации, нормальные предметы, фигового босса, к которому ну вообще не хочется возвращаться (можно списать это на пробу пера) 

Fatal falls имеет хорошего босса, уникальные локации, красивый новый пейзжа (особенно вторая локации этого длс выглядит великолепно) и набор очень даже хороших предметов для гг. 

Rise of the giant  имеет невероятно сложные и шикарные локации, кастомизации внешности, отличные предметы. Непонятно лишь то, какой смысл это длс делать бесплатным, можно было это сделать в виде крупного обновления. В любом случае из всех дополнений, это является всё ещё самым лучшим (иронично, что все длс, стоящие деньги, проигрывают бесплатному, но именно так всё и есть на самом деле) 

Queen and the see имеет разнообразные, но весьма дерьмовые оружия, с которыми играть вообще не хочется (они в патче хорошие тонфы сделали неудобными, за что???), также ну такого себе финального босса, но вот чем тащит это длс, так это новой локацией и предфинальным боссфайтом. Новая локация выглядит очень хаотично, необычно, интересно, в отличие от всех остальных локаций, поэтому проходить его одно сплошное удовольствие (возможно это только я такой eбнyтый); новой битвой является маяк, который очень даже крутой, весёлый, шикарный до тех пор, пока ты не пытаешься пройти   это без урона. В общем и целом, длс было бы лучше, если бы оружие хотя бы норм были, а не полнейшим мусором, а так я считаю, что это длс даже лучше fatal falls  (имхо) 

Return to Castlevania...А вот это длс по-настоящему разочаровало и разбило меня. Враги все абсолютно такие же, как в самой игре (можно это оправдать тем, что именно из кастлы пришли некоторые враги в мёртвых клетках, но даже так это не отменяет тот факт, что появились копии существующих врагов, которые никто не просил), лишь скелет отличается, и то даже ему зачем-то копию сделали, классно. Оружие...мэх, пойдёт. Костюмы красивые, эстетичные и интересные, более про них нечего сказать. Первая локация выглядит хорошо, но вот она сама по себе абсолютно скучная настолько, что можно её без особых напрягов пройти всегда. Вторая выглядит очень красиво, но опять же, ничего интересного, появилась лишь агрессивная тварь Горгона, способная за короткий срок избить тебя до смерти и это классно. Зачем-то они решили сделать замудренный способ попасть во вторую локацию под конец игры, добавив в неё лишь Дракулу, которому настолько насрать на твое присутствие, что слишком лениться мешать тебе жить, умеющий вызывать проблемы только лишь из-за редки переворотов экрана, приём этот глупый если честно. Первый босс слишком медленный, но с другой стороны, очень сильно отличается от других боссов, всё ещё вписываясь в мир игры. Второй босс очень похож на Гримма из Холлоу Найта (люди говорят, что Гримм похож на Дракулу, но как-то всё равно), битва с которым, как мне кажется, слишком не похожа на любого босса, так как этот кусок дерьма постоянно сваливает с арены, из-за чего битва с ним очень сильно растягивается. Есть еще и третий босс, который является второй фазой второго и...она даже неплохая: эпично поставлена, монстр сам по себе довольно внушительный и опасный, атаки разнообразные, саундтрек хороший, но страшнее всего кол-во его здоровья, его слишком много, нужно очень много его бить проклятым мечем последнего уровня с очень хорошей прокачки, чтобы его убить, тем самым придётся даже в самом лучшем случае невероятно долго убивать, битва из-за этого становится надоедливой. Второй и третий босс имеют кривую атаку летучих мышей, из-за которой большая часть забегов на Дракуле и заканчивалась, ещё хуже, когда пытаешься эту атаку пережить без урона, возникающая порой прямо перед твоим лицом, как в таком случае выживать, я не знаю. Музыка из кастлы хорошая, но мне лично кажется, что она не подходит к этой игре, так что про неё говорить толком не буду, это чисто вкусовщина. Режим Рихтера очень кривой, но мне никогда он не был интересен. Каким-то образом ценник этого отвратительного длс практически такой же, как и сама игра. Я из-за обещаний думал, что: ,,Ух, сколько будет интересных боссов, локаций, врагов"", а когда я узнал бешеный ценник, я думал: ,, Ладно, длс стоит практически как сама игра, возможно там будет очень много интересного, почти даже целая игра "". В итоге мои надежды абсолютно не оправдались, для меня это стало разочарованием года, так как длс выходило очень долго, без понятии, что разработчики всё это делали. 

Эта игра неплохая и вполне играбельная, но в последнее время стремительно становится хуже из-за сомнительных решений обновлений, неоднократных обманов, ухудшений баланса.",1635959703,1683475784,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The gameplay is fun, the levels are interesting despite most biomes sharing 50% of enemies, the music is overall really good, the references are fun, and the visuals... goodness, the visuals. I have no idea how a game that looks this good runs this well on my crappy computer that has 4 gigs of ram and shipped with Windows 8. The only notable lag was during one attack of one of the DLC bosses. I thoroughly enjoyed most of this game.

So, why am I giving a negative review?

In a nutshell: This game has no respect for you. This game hates you. It despises you. And there are two reasons for this: Damage output, and time.

First, damage. Normal enemies do way too much damage. Look, getting beaned by an attack because you threw out my parry too early? that's a skill issue. Losing half your health because you threw out your parry too early? That's cruel. Loosing a run because you threw out a parry too early against a normal enemy (NOT a big enemy) and lost half your health or got combo'd to death in a second? That's bull. Losing a 2+ hour run to the previous scenario? That's a call too turn on assist mode and severely reduce the enemy and trap damage output. Which I did eventually, and enemies still did a lot of damage. 20% enemy and trap damage, and the game still didn't feel fair at times.
And before anyone dismisses me with the thought 'git gud scrub' or 'hah, don't let this idiot a real souls game like-' I say:
-The first time I beat this game, I did it with assist mode off. That without any cells, but still.
-I've beaten Bloodborne's true ending, both the true ending and evil ending of Sekiro, and the remake of Demon Souls. And this game has more bull than any of them.
At least with Fromsoft games- or for a Rougelike example, Splunkey -you only lose 5-10 minutes, or like 15-30 in the later example, when you  go from full health to dead in less than 5 seconds. At least when the same thing happens to you in Noita, another brutally difficult Rougelite that's really cool, the main path only takes like 20-40 minutes and if you go for any of the side content that takes dozens of hours, it's a case of ""you know what you were getting into."" But Dead Cell? The most basic ending can take over 2 hours unless you speedrun. 2 whole hours, down the drain, because a basic enemy got a cheep shot at you in the latter half of the game.
...It's worth noting that the obscene damage output mostly has to do with normal enemies. Strangely, bosses do far more reasonable damage than normal enemies. Why is it that the enemies that are designed to be fought 1v1, or at least in closed and predictable environments, do less damage than enemies that can potentially be fought 1-3 at a time, and even more than that on the highest two difficulties? Don't get me wrong, the bosses are still brutal, but it's weirdly reasonable compared to the rest of the game.

The second reason is time. Like I said, runs taken at a casual pace can take over 2 hours. That's already a long time for an action rougelike. But that's not the BS part. The BS part is that, to get the intended experience, beating the game once isn't enough. Now, anyone who goes into a Rougelike/Rougelite with the intention of beating it once and then never touching it again isn't playing Rougelikes correctly. But there's a point where it gets obsessive. Once you beat the game, you unlock a boss cell, and activating it does several things:
* It makes 1-cell doors available, giving you access to more loot and shops, most importantly health item shops, which sell a rare item that refills one of the charges of your health flask.
* It makes extra enemies spawn, including some that I'm pretty sure are excusive to the NG+ runs.
* It decreases the amount of health potion refills that you get.
I actually like part of how the higher diffaculities work, it's a lot more interesting than just ""HAHA YOUR SURVIVABILITY IS SO LOW THAT THE GAME IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE NOW LOL, GOOD LUCK IDIOT."" But considering the damage output issues I said before, less health refills a big deal. Especially once you unlock the second cell, and the third cell, and the fourth, and the fifth. But the worst part is, to get the true ending, which is part of the intended experience, you have to get all 5 boss cells, and go through the Rise of the Giant DLC content, which the developers actually brag about being ""too hard for most people to consider fair"". While I enjoyed Rise of The Giant, I can't say it's ok to lock the true ending behind content that the developers brag about not being fair, and the base game is already unfair. (also the Rise of the Giant DLC is free, and you can just ignore that content if you don't like it and don't care about the true ending, so I don't know why it's DLC) But that's a minimum of six loops, realistically much more, to get the true ending, and the final one is longer. I'm fine with crazy difficulty settings, but locking the true ending behind it is uncool. I'd consider 2 or 3 cells to be the hardest semi-reasonable difficulty. 4 cells has mechanics that are clearly not designed for casual play, and 5... 5 is just nuts. You wanna know a game that does the ""forces you to play at a higher difficulty to get the true ending"" right? Monolith: After The End. That game has two difficulty levels: Normal and Hard, hard mode doesn't decrease your effective health, and the content between starting hard and getting the true ending is actually shorter than starting normal and getting the not-true ending. That's much more reasonable than the nonsense you have to go through to get the true ending in this game. And while I won't spoil the contents of the ending, lore-wise the true ending you get for defeating the true final boss of dead cells isn't worth it.

I don't believe my opinions are popular ones, but soulslike fans tend to be so masochistic that it borders on toxic, and they aren't afraid to let you know. But personally, despite thoroughly enjoying the game, I can't recommend it. If enemy and trap damage output was severely reduced, I'd consider recommending the game, but I don't think the devs would ever consider that. Plus, that's only half the issue, and the other half a fundamental flaw that would require changing part of the game's identity.

For the approximately 0 people who care, I plan on writing reviews for all of the DLC as well. But here's the short version: ""If you must buy Dead Cells, all the DLC is  worth it except 'The Bad Seed' DLC, so get all the DLC except that one if you can""


TL;DR: Dead Cells is the best game that I would not hesitate to say ""Don't play it, ever.""",1683252229,1683252229,False,36,12,0.572495937347412109,0,True,False,False

At first you'll see some in the form of extra healing flask charges and retained money on death, but the rest are mostly alternative weapons and abilities unlocked so they may appear in future runs. If you've played Rogue Legacy 1 or 2, Dead Cells does not take the approach of permanent stat upgrades for future runs.

I like the variety of approaches to combat you're able to utilize; allocating stat upgrades to Brutality, Tactics, and Survival and choosing matching weapons+powers over the course of your run is neat! The ""Metroidvania"" design involves discovering permanent abilities that allow you to reach new locations and alternate stages. I love the branching stage selection and how you can take more paths through the stages as you progress over time. The sense of risk and reward is strong. I take riskier bets and die in dumb ways....

Good things :
- Banger soundtrack, literally every single track is great and this is a feat that few games achieve, it even has a recognizable style compared to other games and even uses motifs here and there. Boss fight themes are also good though compared to newer ones, the older ones definitely feel less great 

- Unique visuals of 3D pixelated stuff next to 2D pixelated backgrounds, works perfectly well for the game and a lot of designs look great, both the world itself and regular enemies, bosses and other characters (though the weapons do look a bit lazy)

- Really good replayability : not only are there several boss options for each part of the game, but there's also different ROUTES you can pick which means entire parts of the run will be different

- Unique layouts : a lot of the levels are generated randomly, but unlike some rogue likes that have pretty forgettable generation, here a lot of levels have unique easy to differentiate layouts : Undying Shores is mostly built on the side and inside of some sort of cliff, Sewers are absolute mazes, Clocktower is split into several extremely tall towers, Fractured Shrines is a bunch of flying islands and so on...

- Gameplay has a LOT of variety. There's 3 main playstyles depending on the type of scrolls you pick along the way, basically being defense, close range offense and ranged (with traps as well). The variety then also comes from the huge number of weapons the game has. Swords, spears, giant swords, a sword that loves you for some reason, a sword that curses you, close range bows, long range bows, a motherfucking cannon, a rapier, another rapier but it tears through space and time or something, a B O N E, daggers, boots or sandals, whips, a torch, a scythe, a crowbar, a bat, a lantern and so on...

- It's extremely cool that this game promotes other indie games through crossovers, I wish more games did that

- It manages to have interesting lore told through minimal dialogue and environment

Oh cmon, you can't hang on a ledge, it pulls you up automatically and you're at the mercy of whatever was up there. 

I don't like the combat with enemies. It's robotic and dry.

The weapons given are hit or miss and the process of learning what is what you learn the devs put lots of useless items. 

I get far, I die, and I don't feel like I deserved half that death. 

I start over, and I stop caring. I love roguelites too, but when I die in dead cells, I don't thing I deserved it like Dark Souls.

Corridors are claustrophobic and dense, forcing you to deal with the samey enemies on difficult terrain, requiring you to sit and wait for them to turn around, or dodge bombs from a place you need to wait to get to. 

Falling doesn't have fall damage, but a stupid stun. In a platforming game? WHY?

I really don't get the hype and the positive reviews. 

I bought the Castlevania DLC, and just getting myself over to the DLC, I was reminded how much I hated the combat. I ran into Richter, and I was just overwhelmed with how corny it all was and lost all interest.",1682858555,1682858555,False,2,0,0.393594324588775635,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is super fun and challenging, but also really rewarding. There are so many different enemies and weapons to try out, and the combat system is just so satisfying. I love how fast-paced and fluid it is - it really keeps you on your toes!

One of the things I dislike about Dead Cells is how the levels are procedurally generated, it's mostly the same. It definitely makes things stale.

I will say that this game is pretty difficult - it's definitely not a walk in the park. But honestly, that's part of what makes it so fun! Every time you die, you just want to try again and do better. And when you finally beat a level or a boss, it's the best feeling ever.

My hours as of review are a little off as I often played offline on a laptop or nowadays, offline on my steamdeck during travel. If I had to roughly estimate, add an extra 400-600 hours as of my time of reviewing to the 316 is currently says I have.

This game is a lovely piece of passion from the developers, though many rocky updates and balancing over the years, but now has found a lovely place in my Library. For those unaware, this is a Hard game, Brutally hard and punishing at certain times but despite that, is one of the most fun experiences I've had playing a metroidvainia in years. It balances just the right amount of movement, timing and combat to accommodate several different play styles, and has had a steady flow of updates for every year I have played. However before I shower this in praise, I must remind you that no game is truly perfect. For those who read this, there are some warnings I would like to administer to you.

1: The true final boss of this game is locked behind the worst difficulty of this game, something even I have only BEAT once in all my hours playing (Granted it should be said that the boss wasn't even in the game for a couple hundred hours of my playtime, and I took an extended break last year and restarted with a fresh file as I came back.)

2: Those looking for a story, you may be disappointed. You get pieces of the story as you play from rooms the CAN spawn, but don't always, meaning bits of information you get is directly determined by the RNG of the games level generation. Even then, a lot of things have to be assumed as you learn them which can lead to either confusion later or when in the instances where the game finally bluntly tells you something to the degree which it smacks you over the head with it's statements, feeling jarred by the sudden exposition vs the earlier vagueness. Now, this isn't a bad thing for those who just want to play a kickass game, just a pet peeve of mine and a few of my friends.

3: The beautiful movement systems in the game are sometimes beautifully jank. With a certain rune which I will not name for the discovery of the player, sometimes the walls can seem sticky despite trying to move away from them, leading to unwanted hits and inconsistent climbs. Similarly, ledge grabbing tend to vacuum you into the ledge as well, which if you were trying to drop from the ledge as you are avoiding an enemy, pulls you right back into the enemy's face, and you can't cancel the animation with the dodge roll in instances like that. There are also instances where I WANT that vacuum yet I fall right past the ledge despite moving up against it and in it's direction.

4: That last point leads to animation canceling as a whole. Hoo boy, the best I can say here is that AC seems inconsistent across the game, there are times which you can AC an attack in any stage of the animation, other times where you seem almost completely locked in despite just beginning the attack and you want to stop before the attack comes out. Same for when you dodge-roll or want to use utilities, There seems to be inconsistencies between what can an can't cancel those animations. It can break the fluidity of combat when you think you know what can and can't be canceled, and then suddenly you learn you have to keep in mind this one weapon or utility in particular that doesn't follow the flow of every other. (Sometimes this is in your favor with certain weapons though, so it's not all bad, more just a frustration at times.)

Now, those are the issues I have with this game, Seems like a lot, but that's because I had to honestly thing and be specific with my own pet pevees and experiences with this game to fine 4 items to talk about, as most are ultimately unimportant to enjoy the game as a whole. 

When it comes to what I love about this game, it has hundreds of weapons and utilities to collect and choose from as you play to spice up each run, and difficulties to unlock as you complete the game for those looking for greater and greater challenges. It has several different biomes across each tier of the game and all sorts of pathways for a person to go down based on what route they enjoy. The visual aesthetic of each area is absolutely stunning at times, the music is wonderful to listen to and each area has all sorts of little secrets you can dive into to find items to aid you. The game also has had several crossovers with other indie games bringing in various outfits, weapons and skills allowing for some nostalgia to peak through for other great games (Not to mention some of those items from the crossovers are absurdly strong.) The movement, while sometimes jank as mentioned earlier, can also be whole worlds of fun when it cooperates with you and you can use the various biome layouts to zip around a kill the enemies with the greatest of ease or speedrun the game for a few interesting items. When a certain unnamed rune was first introduce, it opened up a whole new possibility of enjoyment to this game, and I almost wish they added another movement rune to the game.

Ultimately though, this game runs on a cycle for new players: Go through a stage, try and get a blueprint drop from the various enemies body's, feed a character cells gathered along the way to get the weapon in your weapon pool, move to the next stage or die trying as you learn how an enemy or your own weapons will attack, repeat until you reach the end of the game. As you beat the game (or die after getting permanent runes) you unlock more boimes and items found through that run, the run variety increases and comfort is found as you get better with the weapons. It's not easy to collect everything in the game quickly, but damn if it isn't fun along the way.

The story of the game is like the Souls Born games and is not told directly , and you will discover the story of the game as you progress in the game,[spoiler]but be sure that after finishing the game 5 times, you will be surprised because you will see the original ending.[/spoiler]

Graphics: If you are looking for graphics like RedDead 2, you have taken the wrong path, but if you are looking for Pixel Art graphics, I think it is the best in that genre.


DLC: In addition to having wonderful DLCs (except for castlevania, which I haven't experienced playing it yet), each of them brings a new experience to the game. this game has received many free updates, and is still being updated.

Players must use a wide variety of weapons and abilities to take on hordes of enemies, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.

Another impressive aspect of Dead Cells is its metroidvania-style gameplay. Players must explore a vast interconnected world, unlocking new areas and paths as they progress through the game. The game also features a wide variety of gear and lock items, allowing players to customize their playstyle and tackle challenges in their own way.

The game's graphics are also top-notch, with stunning pixel art and attention to detail that bring the game's world to life. The game's sound design is also impressive, with a fantastic soundtrack and sound effects that add to the overall experience.

Despite its challenging difficulty, the game is incredibly addictive and offers hours of fun. The game also features a Daily Run mode, complete with leaderboards, allowing players to compete with friends and other players for the top spot.

Overall, Dead Cells is a must-play game for anyone who loves fast-paced action and metroidvania-style gameplay.

What stands out the most about this game is how each level is carefully designed around its difficulty to allow you to get acquainted with the build you get, finding the rhythm and balance of each weapon and skill you have. From the following levels, the difficulty ramps up sharply, which can be frustrating for those who are expecting an easy difficulty curve.

Curiously, this game being a Metroidvania, and me not necessarily being a huge fan of it (because of the mindless traversing back and forth that it entails), I found the level structure of this game to be really easy to get into. With enough teleporters and the levels being really clear in their layout, you almost always end up wanting to explore the rest of the level.

Once you git gud at the game, you can start taking some bigger challenges, such as using Boss Cells (basically, increasing the difficulty). At this point, the difficulty curve just goes out the window and it really pushes you to nearly perfect your combos and abilities to their max, which feels very rewarding. If you feel even more suicidal, you can push yourself even further through challenges, cursing yourself (you get an item, but you die in one hit) or picking some incredibly risky builds (like 300% damage, but enemies deal the same amount, pretty fun). 

Throughout all of these monumental difficult jumps, I found a few quirks. Not ... necessarily bad ones, but quirks, mainly with how many enemies are essentially rehashes of a variety of basic enemies you encounter in the first levels. There are exceptions as usual, but you can never shake off that feeling that you are dealing with the same enemy wearing a different skin. That, and some of the bosses are downright annoying to deal with. I won't spoil which ones, but FUCK, they just become an exercise in patience, rather than timing or strategy.

In any case, as I previously stated, this game is worth every penny you may have. If you like roguelite metroidvanias, you can't go wrong with this one, and if you like a challenge, you probably won't find a better one than this one.",1682218807,1682218807,True,17,0,0.665121555328369141,0,True,False,False

-Added notes below on 4/22/23.

Having spent well over 500 additional hours with the game since my original review, I thought it worth revisiting to provide an update on my thoughts.

Dead Cells has proven to be one of the most rich and fulfilling gameplay experiences for me as I traversed its crisp difficulty progression. The expression ""Get good"" or any variation of it is sometimes thrown at people in response to certain questions in Dead Cells; and while from an outside perspective it could be looked at as just being a dick, I've found that in this case, the answer sometimes genuinely is just getting good.

I cannot recommend this game any higher, if you have any interest in action roguelikes at all, this is worth playing.",1594708767,1682178312,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Quite challenging and at first difficult to adapt to, coming from Dark Souls type games. Frequently dying was something I was used to, but having to start (almost) completely over each time was brutal in the beginning (and sometimes still is).

For me the most remarkable thing about the game is the amount of progression you make in your own skills, being able to feel that, but at the same time being challenged by the game like it still is your first run. As a small example: dying in Prisoners Quarters the first time after activating 1 bsc. Sitting there, baffled, asking how on earth I would be able to finnish this difficulty, only to complete a run on that difficulty a day later. In this I also realized the amount of fun these difficulties bring, and how well balanced they are (for me at least, and up till now). 

I usually feel my interest in these types of games drop quite fast after the first succesfull run. It also happened with this one, but only to realize that when I picked it up again and activated the higher difficulty I had really missed out on probably the most fun part of the game. 

Final note: after glancing at the graphics I would have never picked up the game, but since I heard a lot about it I decided to give it a try. But after playing it I am just massively impressed by the visuals. It actually feels like playing something in full resolution.

Getting hit is stupidly punishing which promotes degenerate gameplay and over-emphasizes just [i]ONE[/i] playstyle: pick fast weapons that can kill enemies before they get a chance to do anything.

I would wager that 80% of the game's items and weapons are actively detrimental because they're too slow and you risk getting hit. And past the first or second boss cell, getting hit means you literally might as well restart, because getting hit takes away a lot of health and you get about 4 heals per run.

To my surprise, I immediately went down the rabbit hole with Dead cells, immensely enjoying the swift gameplay style and how polished the game was (diversity in settings, music options). I have to applaud the Dead cells: Return to Castlevania DLC for being a great callback to castlevania in a dead-cells Castlevania mixed style, bringing together elements from both games smoothly. I think this is a great way to advertise Castlevania in 2023, and show younger crowds/generations the series and get people interested. While I initially got hooked as a result of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,  having another game do a collab now amidst the surge of video game releases this year, really helps to promote the series. Overall, one the best games I've played next to the Castlevania games themselves, all topped off with great music. Not only do I get to listen Dead Cells soundtracks in one game, but Castlevania ones too! (What about Heart of Fire though, and Sorrow's distortion? Can't have them all, but Castlevania music is Castlevania music and is very good non the less).

It doesn't pull any punches though and you may end up only ever able to finish half of the game. Still, it's quite a ride. I might jump back into it and I will say that at a glance, it seems, that the best feature of the game is that you can ""pick"" any of the major content launches to play. For example with two boss cells I saw items dropping and had never seen them before so I just ignored them. I didn't want to stop and read the text. There are slow down issues for me with a GTX 960 but usually it's not the cause of death but duh to the number of objects on the screen. I remember it seemed to happen less and less with every major content release so they've worked at it in the past and probably will continue to work on it in the future. 

I played Rogue Legacy and almost finished it but it didn't have as smooth a layout for speed running as this does. That might mean there was actually more level lay out diversity in Rogue Legacy but my experience is that this has been the smoothest experience for moving through the levels as quickly or carefully as you want. I also really appreciate that they broadened the setting without bogging down the game play with cut-scenes or too much text. That might not appeal to everyone as I think it might be fair to say that you get the flavor of the setting and you do take on the evils that have befallen the realm but there's a definite tinge of despair that what has happened can't be undone and there won't be anyone left to rebuild if you do somehow manage to stop what happened from continuing to happen.",1602696912,1681081453,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't come here if you expect to find some deep lore and story. There are both quite interesting (in my opinion) lore and story, but they're overshadowed by the overabundance of collaborations, easter eggs and references. Don't get me wrong - many of items and abilities from these updates are great, but they do water down game's original story and atmosphere.

What you should come here for - is quick and fun roguelike with metroidvania elements. The game looks, sounds and feels gorgeous, has its own sense of humor (though I wish it tried to break 4th wall less) and plays great. It is quite challenging - and there's way more challenging stuff than you can initially imagine. I'm far from completing everything the game has to offer, and I'm not even sure I'll ever will.

The music and sound design are also top-notch, further immersing players in the game's haunting world.

The gameplay in Dead Cells is fast-paced and challenging, with players having to rely on their reflexes and skill to survive. The combat system is smooth and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and abilities at the player's disposal. The game also features a unique permadeath system, meaning that each run is unique and players must start over from the beginning if they die.

The game's level design is also excellent, with each area feeling distinct and filled with secrets and hidden paths to discover. The game features a variety of enemy types, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, making each encounter feel fresh and exciting.

One of the most impressive aspects of Dead Cells is its replayability. The game's permadeath system and randomly generated levels mean that each playthrough is different and players can continue to enjoy the game even after completing it multiple times. The game also features a variety of unlockable weapons and abilities, giving players even more reasons to keep playing.

Overall, Dead Cells is an excellent action-platformer that is sure to please fans of the genre. The game's stunning graphics, smooth combat system, challenging gameplay, and replayability make it a must-play for anyone looking for a fun and exciting game to sink their teeth into.",1680829698,1680829698,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Lots and lots of choices to make and builds to create, with many modifiers, as well as tons of upgrades, to accentuate build types. Strong status effects also help to make the game less about 'highest damage always' and more about potentially more strategic answers to problematic situations and/or enemies. With many unlocks and diverse ways to play the game, in addition to procedurally generated maps, each run feels brand new and engaging. A 'Custom Mode' also exists for those who prefer to play the same levels for practice or preference. The one critique I can give is not necessarily the fault of the developers, but the community mods appear to be lacking somewhat.

* Fortunately, those of us who suck at the game have the 'Assist Mode' which makes it very possible with a lot of practice to reach the highest 'Difficulty Level' (5BSC) and complete the game to experience its 'True Ending'.",1680817321,1680817321,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your stats, equipment etc. reset if you die, and it's got a difficulty leveler, the higher the difficulty goes the variation of monster change, the level bosses change and now with the castlevania DLC they added some of the key weapons of the series and some monster designs i personally really like.

Dead Cells is a very difficult game, it is a very challenging game, and it is not for the feint of heart. You will get frustrated when you die far into a run; it happens to everyone, no matter how much patience you have. However, the reward of moving on to your next Boss Cell (difficulty) is beyond worth it. The satisfaction of beating the final boss for the first time is amazing. You just conquered Dead Cells! ...Or did you? Seeing the amount of active Boss Cells in the spawn area grow inspires you to just keep pushing onwards in order to reach higher difficulties.

The DLCs for Dead Cells offer immense amount of new content to expand your runs as well. I would say that they are very much worth their price tags as well (Return to Castlevania is pricey, but the perfect love letter to this game's inspiration is deserving of such a high price tag.)
-Bad Seed gives early-game content
-Fatal Falls gives mid-game content (and my personally favorite biomes and least favorite boss)
-Queen and The Sea gives end-game content with a new ending
-Return to Castlevania gives both early and late-game content; however, you can only access it once per run

If you're debating whether or not to get this game, you've read this far, so go ahead and buy the game :]
If you do get the game because of this review, my advice to you is to put all of your scrolls into one category, don't maximize your health, maximize your damage! And use shields too, you don't need that extra weapon!

Ingredients
 
    1 lb. 90% lean ground beef
    1 cup dried bread crumbs
    1/2 cup diced yellow onion
    1/2 cup milk
    1 large egg beaten
    2 tbsp. ketchup
    1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
    1 tsp. dried parsley leaves
    3/4 tsp. salt
    1/2 tsp. garlic powder
    1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
    For the Topping:
    1/4 cup ketchup
    2 tbsp. packed light brown sugar
    1 tbsp. red wine vinegar

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit.
    In a large bowl, add the beef, bread crumbs, onion, milk, egg, 2 tablespoons ketchup, worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mush and mix these ingredients together until well combined.*

    Add the meat mixture to a loaf pan. Pat the meat down into an even layer.
    In a small bowl, add ¼ cup ketchup, the brown sugar, and vinegar. Stir to combine. Pour the sauce on top of the meatloaf and spread it into an even layer.

    Bake uncovered for 55 minutes.
    Let the meatloaf rest for 8-10 minutes before serving (or it may fall apart).**

Notes
*Be sure to mix the meat really well.  This is a very moist meatloaf recipe so under mixing can cause the meatloaf to be too soft/mushy.",1679450812,1680568391,True,0,0,0.499684572219848633,0,True,False,False

Gameplay can be fast-paced and hack and slash like, or you can be slow and methodical if need be. The difficulty progression system is executed to perfection. Instead of giving freedom to the player like Hades to pick and choose aspects of the game to increase the difficulty, the game gives you ""Boss Cells"" which limit the amount of healing, and increase the amount of damage you effectively take, but it also gives you better loot with each Boss Cell. Each Boss Cell makes the game exponentially harder especially if you beat the previous Boss Cell through luck instead of skill.

Speaking of luck, the game has a fair share of luck, you have a small chance to get overpowered ""Legendary"" weapons and skills that can almost guarantee the chances of completing a run. This makes the game feel fresh. Making high DPS builds is the core aspect of the game. Dishing out damage and overall being aggressive. 

The progression system relies on collecting blueprints and unlocking them using cells to kill enemies. It starts off extremely quick in the early stages of the game as there are 100s of blueprints to collect (if you have all the DLCs which you should buy). Later on you get less and less blueprints as you already have most of the items unlocked and only the really hard to get blueprints are left. 

The lore behind the game is nice, don't get the endings spoiled. 

Buy all the DLC
Prioritise them in this order
The Bad Seed (Early Game Content) > Fatal Falls (Mid Game Content) > The Queen & The Sea (Late Game Content) > Return to Castlevania (Separate Story-line)  

If you're finding the game extremely difficult, there is an assist mode and custom mode, and no one really frowns on you for using any of them unless you abuse them too much. Especially custom mode, the developers intended for players to use it. Personally, I didn't need any of them. The game is also very accessible in general. Although if you have epilepsy, I'd be careful playing it. 

Here in India, I got the game for an extremely cheap price. The Game + First 3 DLC cost me around 1000 Rs which is about $13. But I'd be willing to pay $30 or more for it. It has way more content than any AAA game I have ever played even rivalling that of God of War. 

Cons - 
1.) A lot of what makes the game fun (variety and replayablity) is hidden behind DLC; the base game will not give you countless hours of gameplay.

2.) The game does a good job of balancing considering how many weapons there are, but that being said not all weapons are created equal. Experiment for yourself and see what you like. 

TL;DR -  ADHD satisfying hack and slash, with a reversely exponential progression system and an exponential difficulty system. Countless hours of fun. Can get tilting. Countless weapons and many of them are unique. Tons of synergies, it's very fun to sit down with the boys and strategise and see which combos are the most effective.

Unfortunately, the game is great only on paper, the gameplay is really inconsistent and I don’t enjoy around 60% of the mechanics and hate all the bosses with exception of Time Keeper.

Examples of those inconsistent mechanics that make the game unenjoyable are boss attacks getting delayed by your attacks after they signalized them and then hitting you out of nowhere, the elite enemy affixes, the lovely boss attacks where you just have to wait and dodge until they are finished, unable to do anything else or the boss damage cap that makes most weapons subpar. (this really shows the bosses are garbage).

The gameplay feels really good when I can play fast and impulsively, but the game massively punishes this type of gameplay and just gets you killed on 5 Cell difficulty.

Personally, I really liked the game in its early stages (That’s also when I played the game the most, and the real reason I have 266 hours on record while I’m currently hating on it).
I’m not gonna waste any more of my time on this cause it’s clearly not for me anymore but you can prolly give it a shot.",1679602898,1680448539,False,7,2,0.510986030101776123,2,True,False,False

588650,135747073,76561198045180749,0,24,389,0,68,1680561907,"I dunno. I want to like the game but I just can't. There's a few problems that just kind've ruin it for me. The biggest one being movement/attacking. In a game like this, the movement and attacks should feel precise and snappy. They don't. Everything feels sluggish and non-responsive. It's like I'm made of jello or something. The dodging feels sluggish, the attacks feel sluggish, the weird ""delay"" (I say delay, but it isn't an actual delay, it's just what it feels like) that plagues every action you perform. Basically every other rogue/metroidvania-esque game got this right. Fucks sake, even the hentai game Scarlet Maiden got the snappiness and precision of movement and attacks right. That's easily 90% of my problem with the game and it just makes it feel awful to play.

The other problem that I have is enemies ignoring walls. Like, I can't throw bombs and have than ignore the very existence of walls, why can the enemies do that? Not really a complaint, just think it's weird and it makes encounters with literally any bomber enemies feel odd. Like, it wouldn't even bother me if it went both ways. Yeah, they can blast me with ranged attacks through walls and floors, but so can I... but you can't, so it's weird.

The last issue I have is that you're facing a default direction depending on where you are on the screen. So if you're currently facing right, to attack something to the left, you have to HOLD left. If you let off, you start attacking to the right. Instead of, I dunno, just letting me change direction and attack in that direction without having to hold a movement key. It's super wack to play around because one pixel is the difference between your default direction changing from right to left. I can't find a way to turn it off so it's whatever I guess.

But yeah, the sluggishness of the movement and combat is a deal breaker for me and it honestly feels like the reason the game is ""difficult"". Didn't feel particularly difficult when I was playing, just felt like I was fighting with my own character to get it to do what I wanted, when I wanted.",1680192070,1680221880,False,5,0,0.499638348817825317,0,True,False,False
