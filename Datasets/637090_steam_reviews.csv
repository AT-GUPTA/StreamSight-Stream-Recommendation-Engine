Love the tabletop game and also love the computer games like Crescent Hawks Revenge and the Mechwarrior series.  This game is the closest thing to the tabletop and is very fun.  It incorporates some unique rules that add more depth to combat tactics.  It also has a great story!  I play it all the time.,1708919542,1708919542,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a sucker for strategy games and really enjoyed this one. Unfortunately my main campaign I didn't take big enough mechs on a story mission and I basically soft locked my game as I can't beat the mission and if I loss all 4 of those mechs and pilots I also basically lose my campaign so riiiiiip. I will comeback at some point and retry it with different techniques I didn't approach my first play through very smartly which is why I got soft-locked.

just like mechwarrior games you'll be spending a lot of time in the mechlad trying to theorize builds
The early game struggle is pretty gripping, you sure do feel like a struggling merc band at first but it does turn into a bit of a grind of contracts that can take awhile due to the turn based combat

though my biggest complaint of the game has to be the UI sounds, they're just so quiet and have hardly any tactile-ness to them. Buttons don't feel clicky, the betty for your commander is pretty subdue and quiet, the impact of some weapons can feel a little too soft.
pressing the repair button in MW5 has that power wrench sound to it that just gives more responsiveness

I found it difficult at first, as I could find the tutorial, but quickly found out that it is in the Career Mode. Asking the Ship Crew, so to speak. From there is was immersive. The game play is a challenge as it takes time to develop a strategy to proceed, so the first half dozen runs were very hit miss.

I am brand new to Battletech, and so far I am extremely happy with it. It's filled with elements that bring to mind aspects found in other games, for example, there is a interstellar scope and a Corporate element, factions, which, on a microscopic level, reminded me of EVE OL but it's not that kind of a game.there is room for deep strategy, which can be relative to many other turn based platforms, but Battletech sit upon it own seat, in that it is definitely unique to itself. While the Learning curve is not as steep as it seems at first, learning to strategize to succeed is where the challenge really is.

I love the fact that it is very laid back and casual, in that I can simply leave it at any moment for whatever reason, and simply come back to where I left off. It simply waits with no complaint. This is important for me.

Lack of mission variety and transparent difficulty just makes the game seem lazily put together. From the start of each mission you can select either more money or more parts for rewards, which is just a difficult slider. The more money you want the more rare and powerful mechs spawn and garbage mechs if you got all parts. The AI gets hacks on shots making your evasion useless and they have a 70% chance that something hits you in the head later in the game. Almost every mission there are so called ""enemy reinforcements"" that are just 10ft from the group you're supposed to take out, so it's 4v8 in just about every mission. 

A special shout out to Escort missions. The units you're supposed to escort spawns in front of you and charges at the enemy, or the enemy spawns on top of them and they get one shot before you get to do anything.

I have to say this is just the most disappointing piece of rubbish. I feel so bad about having to say that of a franchise I've loved for years. Battletech has such rich and deep lore, all ruined by a story that is very cliche and just feels forced. 

That's not even the worst part of it. The worst part is what HBS has created. A horrible, buggy game that looks like it came out of the last decade. It seriously feels like the game was made by a bunch of amateurs. The environments are so barren and boring. The camera swings and sways trying to get you a view of the action, always arriving a second too late or placing your view behind a rock or inside a building so you can't see anything.

There is many glaring design choices I disagree with along with many bugs that should have been fixed long before the game was released.

A) Combat relies very heavily on RNG (especially early on in any mode) so if this is not your cup of tea give this game a pass. Frustration and anger is not worth this games price tag. 

B) Up hill battles should be expected at all times, you can and most likely will fight double your numbers along with base defense turrets and reinforcements thrown into the fight. 

C) There is only one 5 minute in-game tutorial, no encyclopedia nor any ingame resource to explain or teach the player how to play the game. You are fully expected to figure out everything on your own while playing. 

D) Save frequently and in different slots, the game has a very - very nasty habit of conjuring up enemy reinforcement in all manner of magical locations, even spawning them right behind your own units. 

E) This game is very - very time consuming to play, I would strongly recommend you turn all the time-saving options on or lower the camera values down to absolute zero after a few battles, turn based games are already slow enough as it is, there is no point in making it more painful than it has to be. 

F) Do not bother with reading what Skull-rating a particular mission has, the Skull rating is completely untrustworthy. Pay attention to the c-bill and salvage potential for the mission, the larger the reward the harder the mission will be, do not under any circumstance give two fucks what the Skull rating is, it is false. 

G) You can hard-lock yourself out of content in the campaign mode so pay special attention here:
If you decide to spend most of your time fighting the 'Local Pirate' faction early on and thus lowering your reputation with them, you will not be able to earn access to the 'Black Market' store in game later if you decide to change your mind. This is because the lowest difficulty (skull rating) at 'hated' reputation is half a 'skull' but the mission difficulty goes up with each story mission you finish. Need I remind you that the best place to get the rare gear and mechs is the Black Market? 
 

H) There is still bugs in the game which has not and most likely never will be fixed, these are some I've found myself:
- There is a somewhat rare issue with enemies spawning outside the bounds of the map, turning them passive.
- On certain maps there seems to be memory-sinks when viewing your entire lance, dumping the fps down to single digit levels. (Night maps seem to be particularly affected)
- While not a bug there seems to be issues with the game engine handling more than two lances of 'Mechs at the same time with severe frame rate drops as an issue.
- The AI can and will bug out, refusing to use its weapons while still having both ammo and functional weapons.
- The AI cannot traverse simple impediments like impassable cliffs or route to the players location when in close proximity to the player. 
- The AI will stand in detrimental map zones, regardless if its advantageous or not. 
- There is certainly more bugs left out there. 
- The AI cannot navigate around basic obstacles or impassable areas and will blankly refuse to pathfind around said obstacles.
- Bullets/shells, along with lasers and missiles will occasionally target an area above a enemy mech or tank. It looks very stupid but does not interfere with actual game mechanics. 
- Urban maps are massive memory sinks, expect to be in the 10's of FPS regardless of what card you might have. With the lowest settings my own 3060 Gigabyte should be more than able to handle this old game but nope, 12-20 fps.
- Overheating mechs cannot end turn while affected by inferno gel. 

Extra tidbit:
The game has an INCREDIBLY long intro of assorted nonsense I don't care about, don't force the players to watch it, even if it has a ""skip"" button there is still 10-12 seconds of wait time for me, unacceptable.

I thought it was great at first, but the enemy can really test your patience and RNG plays too much of a factor, with the enemy scoring pilot injuries on you within the very first move. I muscled through it for a while, got a good way through the story, but then I fell out of the game and couldn't get back into it, so, I decided to start over.

I got past the first few story missions, but I needed to build up my mechwarriors and arsenal before I was to continue... On the last mission I played, the FIRST hit I took, resulted in head damage to the mech that was hit; one of my ace pilots, doomed to be out of commission in the FIRST attack, by a light mech with a Large Laser; sure they hit hard, but not THAT hard. 
Then, later that same mission, every missile-user the enemy had just ganged up on my lead pilot and cost me a variety of rare mech components that I spent a small fortune (In-game currency of course; no MT's in this game, thank god) amassing parts that were not easy to find, and all of them just gone.
It's like a big middle finger. ""Oh, you spent all these C-bills making your mech the best it can be? Well, we better just WRECK IT and we can because all of us can move before you."" Cue 8 light mechs and missile-carriers just ganging up on them from all sides before you can even move, and there go my rare weapons, one of my legs and most of my armour, pretty much guaranteeing the next attack, I was not going to escape from and would very likely kill my pilot.

On top of that, I encountered a LOT of LRM users in other missions; you can't speed up the animation for those, so you just have to watch as your mechs are pounded by an enemy way out of sight, again, and again and again and again. 

I decided by that point, I didn't want to continue. This game is fun and interesting in concept, but just not worth the annoyance.",1693487560,1707929843,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At first, I struggled with some of the mechanics, given the game's closer ties to its tabletop origins. However, after a few missions, I found my footing and was immersed in the strategic depth it offers. The learning curve might deter some, but for players willing to put in the time, the payoff is worth it.

What stood out to me were the Flashpoint story missions added with the DLC. Unlike the main storyline, these missions offered more player choice, making them the highlight of my experience. The ability to shape events through my decisions added a personal touch that kept me engaged. I also appreciated the contribution of community mods. They not only added to the replayability but also addressed some minor issues I had with the game, making the experience even more enjoyable.

First i find it odd that the graphics for the Mech has them walking ""above"" ground and constantly with their knees bent, just looks odd.  the major flaw is with missions where you have to stop a convoy or escort a convoy.  if you don't stay close to the convoy it won't move and sometimes they wont move at all no matter 
what you do (like i experienced with my last mission).  
Another complaint i have is the extreme cost of items in the black market is way out of proportion i think.

This is a great way to enjoy tactical mecha combat with all* your favorites from the Battletech IP.  The totally OP called shot mechanic can be pretty fun, the vehicles are a bit nerfed, and as usual for computer versions lately (MW4, MWO, MW5) the mech's have some form of hardpoints so you can't make a warhammer on a grasshopper chasis.  And, because it's been out a while now, all those things can be modded away if you don't like them for some reason.  They've tried some new things, wrote some new story, and I like the results.

The map is totally unrecognizable to what anyone would consider natural terrain. Weird mountain peaks everywhere, giant bushes that go to a mech's waist, and roads/paths that circle around and make no sense for the inhabitants of the planets. There is also no fine detail considering how big a mech is supposed to be. They shouldnt have used the Battletech name for this game, it just makes me sad.

Mech customization is a little clunky - fair warning. The default load-outs are OK, but you can get a lot out of them by swapping most things to more focused builds. I enjoy the system a lot as it allows for a lot of customization. YMMV

A couple notes/gripes:
***Keep your rep up with the pirates if you want access to the best gear***
They have an order of magnitude better loot than anything else in the galaxy. They're not so much ""pirates"" as a galactic smuggling syndicate and the black market loot is not balanced. It's WAY better. 

The game is really poorly optimized and runs pretty slow. It's turn based so that doesn't impact it too much except....

The first mission after the tutorial can go wrong pretty fast if you don't stay on the road, and immediately after the tutorial, you are given your ship, mechbay, pilot progression, contracts, etc. which is a lot of info at once.

After the first 3h I had a handle on the mechanics and some basic mech builds. By then, I had run into the technical issues. Audio from the second cutscene wouldn't play. If you have a particularly long session, everything starts getting choppy and calculations take longer and longer (memory leak?). On one mission I kept getting locked into the ""prepping mission"" screen and had to take almost 30 minutes finding a fix (this has not really been addressed by Paradox). etc.

On the upside, the gameplay is pretty satisfying and moving your mechs around and blowing stuff up is cool. Customizing your mech builds is cool and fulfilling once you get the hang of it. It's got that xcom meta progression. The keybindings are also pretty customizable which was pretty nice.

Then, around 25h in, I started to hate it again. The game limits you to 4 mechs, but isn't afraid to throw 12 at you, often all at once, while you need to defend buildings, or catch up to and destoy a convoy, or a VIP, etc. It doesn't feel fair that the player needs to bring the most durable mechs in order to be able to survive the onslaught and achieve anything, while the cpu will (try to) use actual strategy, like distracting with evasive light mechs that spot for the artillery/sniper units in the backline. Those tactics are so fun and useful in the early game, but if you try it later, you will quickly get overwhelmed since your frontline is too weak. :(

TL;DR: Big 'onboarding' obstacles for the player, various frustrating technical issues, very satisfying gameplay, horrendous mission balance in the early-midgame (which is as far as I got).",1704742454,1704742454,False,15,0,0.555096864700317383,1,True,False,False

637090,155108885,76561198164852622,0,14,682,0,682,1704299347,"- Level scaling is BS. Mission difficulty is rated by a skull system, but it doesn't mean anything. You could get a 1 skull difficulty mission that puts your 4 man team up against 2 light mechs, or 8 mechs and 4 turrets. 

- The maps get old quick. You will always start in the worst position possible, and have to go uphill to reach your objective. This sucks because there's rough terrain and elevation penalties and bonuses. So you're trying to take out a turret generator, but while you're crawling there it's raining missiles and lasers. 

The missions are also the same stuff on repeat, and you get set up for failure. I.e., you HAVE to stand in a marked area, even though you know its going to trigger a ambush from the surrounding hills, because it did the same thing the last 10 times. You can't set overwatch or do anything tactical. The gameplay basically boils down to getting dropped into different ambush scenarios. Even knowing the scenario doesn't help, because you'll be faced with 4 mechs and 4 turrets that you have to take out or die, and when part 2 triggers, the other 4 mechs get dropped behind you. You know it's coming. They know it's coming. Your cat knows its coming, but you just have to clinch and smile.

- The evasion system is a**. The way evasion works, the farther you or the enemy moves, the more evasion bonus you get. The problem is, you're limited to 4 mechs on a mission and the enemy isn't. The AI will always send suicide units sprinting straight at you, that you can't hit, or have to waste someone's turn getting a sensor lock. This wouldn't be a problem but for the next 2 points...

- Your mechs are made out of paper. Even if your armor barely gets scratched, your pilot can still get hit and injured by a single shot of any weapon. That means after a mission they're now stuck in med bay for a 20 day minimum, and longer the more they get injured. It also means your heavy mechs can get taken out of combat with full ammo and armor left, by random missiles streaking across the map or a stray laser. In fact the biggest danger isn't the beefier enemy mechs, it's the light suicide mechs, tiny a** tanks with 1 gun and turrets that can shoot across the whole map. 

- Indirect fire is a**. Long range weapons can hit anything that's on sensor, for both you and the enemy. However, you're limited to 4 mechs on a mission, and your 4 mechs are made out of paper. So what happens is, the enemy that's 8 mechs deep sprints 4 suicide mechs straight at you. You can't ignore them, because they can sneeze and kill your pilots by bypassing your armor. You can't hit them, because they sprint and have evasion constantly. So while you're stuck in a melee clown show, the other 4 mechs and 4 turrets can rain missiles from across the map, because as long as you're on sensors, you can be hit. So...why not do the same thing? Sure, sprint 1 of your 4 mechs to get visual on the enemy backline. Now that mech is being targeted by everyone on the map, and unfortunately...

- The turn system is a**. It's not a true turn-based system. Instead, the turns and initiative are done per unit on the map, and apparently recalculated all the time. So that mech you sent to get sensor range...even though it's only facing a 1v8 situation, sometimes enemy units will get a turn before your turn, in between your unit turns, and after your turn. Even though there's a ""round"" counter, enemy units can get multiple turns per round. If you've played XCOM: WoTC, then just imagine the Ruler attack rule, except for every enemy unit on the map.

The idea of this game is cool. The people that like it most have some kind of connection to the tabletop versions, but for me even winning missions just felt frustrating and tedious, and having my legendary merc squad get taken out by a sprinting trash can with 1 arm just felt stupid.",1704246369,1704302654,False,10,4,0.482611089944839478,0,True,False,False

I'm going to say pretty much what has already been said in many other reviews. The game is fantastic, very addictive, with some great elements and mechanics in it, plagued by bad design choices, unoptimised code, some bugs and bias.

Also, I've only played this game with the BTA 3062 mod.

Pros:

-- Designing Mechs. And whilst you are limited by types of weapons that can be mounted on a particular Mech chassis part, it's not much of a detriment.
-- There is a lot in the game to enjoy, aka. the scope. You've got crews, various skills, Mechs and vehicles, a huge map with many factions, reputation, salvage, upgrades and so on. There is a lot to do.
-- Using tactics in combat. I did not find what other reviewers have said, that one strategy works all the time. Perhaps I haven't played long enough. I remember one mission where I was surrounded, that I attempted 4 or 5 times in total. None of my defensive strategies worked, until finally I decided to break through on one side, using terrain to my advantage afterwards. Moments like that make the experience truly great.
-- Music, somber and melancholic. I found it fits the game very well.
-- Combat in general, very enjoyable for the most part.

Cons:

-- My rig is better than the recommended requirements, but even on Low details my PC wants to take off to space. Ridiculous. There is NOTHING going on on the screen and you think your computer is going to melt. Doing what, exactly? Lazy coding.
-- More lazy coding - loading screens have loading screens. This is not a joke. Loading takes ages. Turns take ages. I sowed potatoes one day, and they were ready for harvest before the AI has moved all of its 11 Mechs. Perhaps it's not laziness, but incompetence. Or the game was very rushed. Who knows. All I can think of, when during one of the long loading screens my PC is thinking of reaching low orbit is ""G o .d  d a.m n, Elite 2: Frontier took one 1.44MB floppy disk to fit a whole universe, trade mechanics, space combat, gravitational catapulting, fueling up from stars, mining, bombing, tens of ships and ship upgrades, missions, what else...""
-- Bugs. Loading a saved game always crashes the game on the second attempt, which is the biggest offender. Other small things, like the change lance button no appearing sometimes at the start of combat etc.
-- One specific thing: your autocannon hits once in five times. Regardless of distance. Regardless of accuracy. It is hard-coded into the game. 1 in 5. Forget about the %s. Count which shot you are currently taking, and if it is the 5th, plan around it, knowing you will hit.
-- Other specific thing: you can't directly aim your LRM at Mechs currently not seen (in red). You can fire at the ground where they are though, to give those Mechs a nice outline of missile explosions, as not a single one will ever hit the target. I got you worried for the AI, there? Don't worry, the AI will hit your unseen Mechs halfway across the map with their LRM no problem, turn after turn.
-- It seems that it is true what they say - at higher difficulties (and by that I mean 3 skulls+), the game just throws a lot of enemies at you.

I think that whilst the game is worth the money (bought it at £35), the developers don't deserve it. There is simply no way I can give this a thumbs up, when I'm looking at a static screen and my PC is able to melt steel beams.

EDIT: (after another tens of hours)

Waste of time. Nonsense like getting hit from half across the map when you have just run and have 10 evasion chevrons. Dropping something like 550 tons versus your 6 light Mechs. AI sees you when you don't see them. Dropping vehicles into dense forests and sometimes inside walls. Apparently polar climate is ripe with trees - someone pls tell polar bears. Star systems on opposite sides of the sector have the same Mechs for sale. Amazing achievement - they have made a game that is on the market, without doing any quality control or testing. Tips and hints like ""'Tis but a scratch!"", ""I used to be a mechwarrior like you, then I took an ArrowIV to the lower leg actuator"", references to other 'popular' stuff - please kill me... Game made to make you angry - like putting fennel into your favourite dish.

It's hard to bring something really new to a franchise that revolves around a set format and has been around for 40 years. They still manage to make it quite fresh and show off competence.

Plenty of clever tactical (and strategic) detail:
-Good balance on weapon systems, there is no single meta and you can't fit all the mechs the same
-Heat is a factor but a constant problem only if you ignore it
-Pilot training tree is simple but clever, you can multiclass specialties/talents and excel in just the role that is designed for your mech
-Procedural maps work pretty well and you really need to wrap your head around the tactical situation. You can use terrain much to your lance's advantage
-Weapon ranges (systems) are a real factor and can turn the game around
-Lots of choice in how you spend the money and try and minimize the cost of running your operation. Feels like you're running the merc outfit in a post-apoc setting and a bad mission can spell disaster. Salvage is an interesting subsystem of the game.
-Shoot as much as you can is not the only option in combat. You can go with defensive stances to avoid or minimize damage. You can work the sensors to give the enemy a slight disadvantage and help out the rest of your lance. You can make your mechwarrior shine a little bit extra every now and then if your unit's morale is in good shape.

The story feels a bit cookie cutter and not really anything stellar. More it's the overall atmosphere that gets to shine a little bit here.

Cons:
 - Alot of bugs. PRACTIACLLY EVERYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG WILL GO WRONG.

At first it was just another RTS with mechas, kinda ok, didn't hooked me up, played the campaign a bit and it got forgotten on my library...

THEN i started playing MechWarriors 3, 4 and 5, and got hooked on the mech action, and after binge playing MW5 for 100+ hours i was in need of more Battletech content, and remembered that i had the RTS on my library and after immersing myself on the IP for some time the experience was TOTALLY different.

Building mechs, running my mech company, theorizing, building and trying different mechbuilds on the mechlab, playing with mods (mainly BTA 3062) and i found myself the PERFECT RTS mech game.

There is a built in delay after every turn the ai makes. 

The ""overworld"" UI is one of the worst I've seen for this past decade in a game such as this. And it is deliberately designed to be that way. 

You are forced to fly around in SJW diversity, as you can not customize or replace the bound NPCs that work as your crew. So, there is not a single guy that looks like me or my surroundings for me to talk to on the ship. 
But to anyone who lives in Los Angeles, you are going to feel right at home. 

You can customize the voice, name, and pronoun of your additional mech pilots. 
But not their portraits. That would probably break a Canadian or Californian law or something. 


Then, the entire gameplay is built around a percentage chance to hit/crit/miss system that would make X-COM blush.

For example early game I was running out of heatsinks for repairing Mechs: because the planet I was in orbit of did not have them available. I started requesting scrap heatsinks in lieu of the more valuable mech chassis scrap. After breaking my flamer twice: I also had to replace it with a machine gun that mounts on the same ""support"" weapon hardpoint.
I had some performance problems, but my computer does not really meet the recommended system requirements. My 6 core Phenom II is one generation older than the recommended AMD CPU. Game's mini benchmark estimated the performance at 1.5Ghz and popped up a warning that it was below 2.0Ghz. (as configured (overclocked) my CPU will clock from 0.9 to 3.1Ghz on up to 3 cores; 0.9 to 2.8Ghz with 4 or more cores).
While I DO have 16GiB of RAM: I have my system configured such that I only have about 12GiB available before hitting a compressed in-memory swap (with incompressible data going to disk). This tanks performance, but leaves the system semi-useable so one can fix the problem (going straight to disk after running out of RAM just makes the system freeze up indefinitely). I found closing/killing firefox (with many tabs open) helped avoid this problem. I think I would still recommend a SSD with this game.
The camera angles are sometimes a little tighter than I would like: making it hard to follow what is going on. Occasionally I need to scan the whole map after something ""new"" happened. But it is a minor thing (too zoomed out would also be bad for similar reasons).

-----------------------------------------
I bought this game along with all the DLCs weeks ago on a 50% discount and I regret it because I should have bought it at the full price years ago to support the developer and enjoy this ""master piece"" game earlier. After playing this game for a few hours I asked myself ""What have I been doing the past years? Why I missed this greatness?"". Since then, I literally need to play it every day even I have only 1 or 2 hours of free time per day. And during the day while I am driving or working I enjoy thinking how should I customize my mechs tonight to maximize their performance and how should I play in the battlefield. 

No other games ever made me feel excited and addicted for a decade. Now I am very happy to be addicted to this gem. 
------------------------------------
I came from playing Front Mission in the late 90s which was the first mech game that I got addicted to. If you are a fan of mech games or about to find out that you are, or loved FM before, you will love BT even more because FM is arcadey while BT is realistic << I am not referring to the graphic. I referring to the gameplay mechanics, plus BT is an open universe where you can go anywhere and do any mission you want. BT offers you countless replayability.      
-------------------------------------
BT is what you'd expect from Paradox Interative who is behind the Europa Univeralis, Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, Victoria, and Cities Skylines series that have become legends and unmatched. The name ""Paradox"" automatically guarantees that BT is highly detailed in term of the gameplay mechanics. The UI is very easy to understand and well thought with tool tips everywhere. The battle and lance (squad) management takes only a few hours to learn but weeks or months to master. The story is well executed and keeps the player feel engaging and immersive. 

It has both a campaign mode and career mode (sandbox) so after completed the campaign you can continue to enjoy the sandbox mode where you roam the whole universe freely for years to come.  
---------------------------------------------------------
I usually recommend people to wait for a discount, but for BT you don't need to wait for a discount because it is worth more than the full price. A ""master piece"" like this is extremely rare in the gaming industry. 

If you are a fan of mechs or FM, I am very certain you will say to yourself the same I said to myself after playing BT ""What have I been doing in the past few years?""",1703947193,1703947412,True,7,0,0.578503668308258057,0,True,False,False

As a disclaimer, I'm new to Battletech and the mech genre as a whole. This was the game that pulled me into it, though not without some issue.

On a mechanical level, this was one of the most fun turn-based games I've had the pleasure of playing. This is the kind of game where your strategic preferences are not just catered to; more than that, it's a god damn necessity. Halfmeasures and careless builds will find no place here, which will be obvious enough when you start facing heavy lances. Mech modulation is open for all sorts of major and minor tinkering. Sane devs would not allow you to remove the weapons off a Quickdraw, slap some arm/leg mods on it and have it goomba stomp everything in jumping range. But sanity also has no place here.

Only major issues mechanically is the lack of consistent or significant RPG events. There are a handful of tiny random encounters, but they're inconsequential, usually providing a tiny monthly bonus or penalty. Also, the actual perk trees for pilots are boring and insultingly narrow. All the customization in this game really comes from the mechbay, your pilots are just passive bonuses that you slot in like a console memory card.

On a narrative level however, there are some things I wanna bitch about. The campaign has you play through a coup against our new (super rich) best friend Kamea Arano's family, and then you and her and a team of literally-whos start an insurrection back at them. But due to the structure of the game wanting to give you the option of being your own blank-faced mercenary while also opening the campaign to you, you are essentially regarded as her favorite special forces of her cause while also being a free-lance company on the side. 
It's off-putting to be one of the most valuable assets of a revolution while still not holding any official positions, titles or command but still part of the inner circle, and just hovering from one engagement to the next with some downtime to do some actual mercenary stuff unrelated to her war efforts. 

Otherwise the story itself is tolerably compelling enough. Kamea is pretty much the only character with any depth, and that's not so bad since the rest of the supporting cast is inoffensively bland. But the antagonists were bordering on cringy. I feel as if they would have been more fleshed out if more time had been spent on expanding on Kamea's relationships with her enemies and less time on your self-insert. The campaign really should have been based around her and her immediate generals, civilians and such as opposed to the SWORD OF RESTORATION and her merry band of paid friends for hire.

But overall, it's a very fun game. Definitely worth playing for anyone who loves this sorta stuff, or appreciates customization and pre-battle planning. Just don't expect the gospel of good writing here.",1702641788,1702641788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also find it a little obnoxious that enemies always seem to blow off an arm or something that's not even damaged prior, which severely prolongs the battles as you lose damage output with no chance to mitigate the damage by repositioning.

I might give this some more playtime, but I'm really disappointed so far. It might be fun on the easiest mode where you just crush the enemies.

I'm a big fan of XCOM 1+2 and have completed those games on the hardest difficulties so I was really pleasantly surprised that this game actually presents a challenge. The ai is not dumb, they pose a legitimate threat. The turn based combat is great. There is less of a focus on building a good character (pilot in this game) and more of a focus on building a good mech which I thoroughly enjoy. I'm one of those people who loves tinkering with things like mechs and ships (in the case of Nebulous and Highfleet) to make them exactly how I want them to be and make them as effective as possible. 

The campaign story is fine, and the set piece missions pose an interesting challenge which I love. The general contract missions can be frustrating sometimes since your mechs could be facing off against twice, or three times as many opponents. In those cases, it takes a million years for your turn to start so you can turn the enemy mechs into piles of scrap metal. The game is not without its flaws, but it is still immensely enjoyable if one enjoys turn based games featuring giant mechs punching and shooting other giant mechs.

This time I beat the campaign, but only after looking at Reddit for some builds and tweaking some values to sell lasers for ton of my to avoid grinding too much.  I basically had a Marauder and Warhammer before the mission to find the Argo, then i progressed through the plot until just after the Argo was officially mine. I then just went around until I got the black market invitation and then got a squad of: 3 Outriders and a Vangaurd in a Marauder 2r, Warhammer 7a, Black Knight, and Atlas II (all were the SLDF/lostech/special variants) with double heat sinks, extended range medium lasers and such.

OP (the Marauder could headshot mechs for instant kill with a decent chance) and basically made most of the campaign a breeze... and honestly I was fine with that.  The issue is that I still found the Campaign pretty imbalanced with fights I never would have chosen - there were base defense missions, missions in hot environment, sometimes an ally took place of one mech, and worse was a mission where you not only had her in the squad, but three other random people. They had the same special mech (SLDF), but everything was poorly built - the pilots and mechs. I actually beat the mission with no losses though I don't know how ( two of the mechs had no limbs left and one of those was also crippled in the leg).

I really didn't think the story was worth how annoyed these missions made me. I actually had more fun in the normal missions where i could pick and choose.  I think I see why most people play Career or got one of the total overhaul mods.   I honestly still can't recommend this game unless you are a fan of Battletech/giant mechs.  Without the OP squad, combat was just a slog (and sometimes even with it as I waited for mechs to launch all their stupid missiles).  I ended up just needing to get rid of all animations. I think I would've quit again without the OP squad I got.

-end of update-

Works okay with on Linux, though you need to make sure Proton is enabled for smoother gameplay.

I can't recommend this game unless you really like Battletech.  I've only experienced some of the story, but I don't think Career mode would be that different.

The first problem is that what you see is pretty much what you get in terms of weapons.  You get some variety of short range missiles, long range, laser, and ballistics, but that's pretty much it. You can find better versions (i.e. + or ++) which might add a little more damage, but really the only thing that really improves damage is getting bigger mechs (from light to medium to heavy to assault), but the problem is that you don't just get a Mech unless you have access to a special store like the Black Market and millions of Credit.  No, instead, you need to collect three parts (either from a store or more often from fighting and destroying the Mech and collecting the salvage).  Rarity is an issue as obviously the good stuff is harder to find.

This wouldn't be an issue if the combat wasn't such a slog.  Early on your pilots don't have much skills and you have weak mech so combat takes a long time.  Add to that having to disable weapons or guard for a team because of a heat, it gets to be a problem.  You can speed up combat (at least in Single player), but at that point, I felt like why bother?  Once you get to what people consider top tier mechs (i.e. Marauders with a Pilot that has 9 in Tactics for Called Shot mastery so you can end a mech quickly with a head shot), things go quickly, but again at that point things are pretty much over so what's the point?  At least games like XCOM (or even Shadowrun which is also from HBS) have turn based combat that doesn't feel like a chore.  Just wait until you get to missions with Mechs, vehicles, and turrets.  I never thought some of those would end.

The slowness didn't stop in combat either. Once you start traveling, it gets to be a pain - whether trying to go somewhere for a contract or just to check a store, You can also speed it up with an option and skip some of the scenes, but not enough.

The difficulty is out of whack (and not just how it goes away when you have something like the Marauder).  I knew going in the skulls was a lie - something about it mimicking real life intelligence reports and how they can be wrong.  This is no more evident than like the fourth priority/main mission where you have to capture an ammo base. It's two skulls, but feels way harder.  You have two lances (8 mechs), turrets, and it's a heat planet (your mechs have a hard time cooling off).  Don't even try to get the optional objectives - it's hard enough as is without worrying about destroying the two ammo transports or keeping all ammo crates around (they are better used to damage/destroy an mechs in the blast radius).  I basically had to go to a lake in the right of the starting position away from the turrets and destroy mechs as they came one by one.  I tried a couple times before I took a break and grinded for a few hours for mechs like the Marauder 2-d, Warhammer, and Atlas-II to cheese the fight because it wasn't challenging in a fun and rewarding way. I felt no relief and just wanted to move on.  Unfortunately, there were too many missions left (not even getting into how you need to take a couple of non-priority missions before the next story mission is available) so I only played a couple more before i realized that after 40 hours, I'm not really having fun.",1682725142,1701916762,False,3,2,0.481751799583435059,0,True,False,False

I'm not one to review a game until I have either completed a campaign or if not that type or structure, put a couple hundred hours in.
I bought this soon after release but was going though a break up, the misses was the spitting image of Kamea in some of the images and it was a bit of a distraction.. I mean Kamea is a high lady and my lady was always high, there was a lot. 
But even then could tell it was good so I'd be back at some point, and recently got the chance.

First off this game has the most amazing intro, that I don't think has ever failed to make me stop and give attention.
The music is stunning and for someone who wasn't coming into the game as a fan of the franchise, it was able with almost no words to communicate a huge amount of history and lore to me, while humanizing an enemy that could otherwise be easily construed as drones on a field.

For the gameplay, it's how I always imagined a good games-workshop (warhammer) pc adaptation. It feels like a true to form table top turn based strategy. If that's what you are looking for it feels great to play.

The campaign quests can be a little brutal on first attempts in that information is given a bit late (not in all cases).
You can be locked into selecting mechs when you are given a clue as to the type you will need to field, or two turns into sprinting right before a timed objective is made known far left.
To tackle any mission a second time is considerably easier.

The story is more than serviceable, helped greatly through the music score and artworks. 
In a final moment I felt happy to bring down the bad guy, before remembering why he was so angry and feeling a twinge of compassion. So they landed on the range of emotions and gave a satisfying conclusion.
I sat and watched all the credits where they had pictures of everyone that worked on the game, before seeing a little gem of an achievement pop up for having been one of the few to do so and I love things like that.

You can really tell this is a game crafted with love. With design unhindered by microtransactions or online balancing and security measures.
You are free to mod, you are given lots of options to tweak in career mode, and in my opinion when compared with how things are monetised these days the dlc's (which add missions maps and mechs), feel like fine value.

Stand out:
Optimisation. You can tweak the amounts of armour by fractions of a ton, explore all sorts of load outs that cater to a play style or objective. 
Can really tweak to roll, whether flanker, spotter, tank, sniper etc. Can play like a pirate and go for scrap taking down a mech by the legs, or build for quick kills and collect credits only.
Music/Cinematics, they add so much to an otherwise cold, and largely textual experience.

Could be better:
There's room for improvement in the travel between locations, these can take up a lot of time and outside of the random encounters I was wanting for things to do.
Character models. They are ok, but they are the weakest visual aspect of the game. I know for sure the digital sculpts looked better than that but if you are gonna stretch a texture across 4 polygons what can you do.

tldr;
It's a really well made complete experience, with high replayability and a great example of player first design in the modern era.

If you like turn-based tactics and good writing, you should absolutely play this.

Long review/rant:

This game finds an interesting spot between turn-based tactics games, like a modern XCOM, and a light roleplaying experience that can impact the meta experience (largely with allegiances) while keeping with the focus of the writing and characters. And that's a big part of this game that doesn't get mentioned: the writing here is really fantastic in the campaign.

Now the game itself does something that I've never quite experienced before: it finds a really solid ground where you pretty consistently feel like a mercenary company that is both making grounds as well as having to make hard decisions on how to get paychecks to all your mechwarriors. This is the sort of promise that has been made time and time again to make company management interesting and difficult -- this is the first that really gets that *right* without it being either overly frustrating or too easy.

Okay and finally, the meat of the game: missions and combat. While the hand crafted missions do really feel special here, I think both those and the generated missions both can be very surprising. The handcrafted missions are built to pretty consistently feel grand and challenging, and often they are. I have many stories of having to completely rethink my plans because of either a surprise change or an unlucky hit, which made the change in strategy feel thrilling when they worked out, usually just *barely* in time. And while this is most common in the scripted missions, the generated ones absolutely caused these. Handling a generated missions that seemed like picking off some pirate scraps to suddenly be attacked by Lyran bounty hunters who took a bounty on some these pirates first, turning a difficult mission of trying to down two of the heavier mechs in the game with your ragtag group of mediums and lights, into a three-way conflict where you are trying to balance getting hits in on both sides and not risking getting pummeled by both is so exciting!
Now speaking of the combat, I think this is where the game really does shine: while it's like XCOM where an unlucky shot can really do a number, its far more about attrition. One of those rare head shots will (29 times out of 30) won't blow the head clean off and kill your pilot immediately. Instead those rare instances will be a scare and a reminder that there *is* that risk, and you need to be cognizant of it. Things feel heavier and scarier in a way, without it feeling as punishing as that time you lost your best sniper in XCOM from one unlucky plasma shot. It's a creeping doom rather than a jump scare.

While this has been extremely ranty, this is just the tip of the iceberg of what I love about this game. Even just replaying the campaign recently, it reminded me all over again. It's truly a gem and I really hope more people play it.",1689344573,1701049618,True,3,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

The AI is not great, so it's easy to feel like a tactical genius just for handling things like flanking and high ground.  Campaign mode is fine (I haven't played the whole thing), but it largely separates story from battles.  Nominally, THIS fight might be to rescue prisoners and THAT fight might be to stop a convoy, but 90% of it is simply ""destroy the other side's mechs before they destroy yours.""  Sometimes there's a time limit, that's about it.

The mech customization helps a lot to keep things fresh.  Do you want to try an all-short-weapons team?  Focus on melee?  Emphasize speed, firepower, durability, or accuracy?  I enjoy using a lightning-fast scout to put eyeballs on the enemy and then clobbering them with LRMs from over a hill.

Sadly, the mech PILOTS are much less interesting.  They have different voices, but the level of customization is minute: there are just four tracks they can advance (Gunnery, Piloting, Guts, and Tactics), and each track has just two special abilities.  A skilled gunner WILL get Multishot; take it or leave it.  If you want a bonus on indirect fire, you have to get rank #3 in Tactics.  Pilots get a bonus in melee, even if what you really want is to be evasive.  A more flexible talent tree would have been very nice, and more variation between pilots.  Maybe Alice just doesn't have a steady hand and will never be a great gunner, but she's a natural leader; maybe Bob is courageous as hell but reckless and occasionally disobeys orders under stress.  They could have learned a lot from *Darkest Dungeons* here.

Side note, if you enjoy the game I recommend you check out Tex Talks on YouTube.  He does let's plays of Battletech, and he has videos going into the details of different mechs, houses, or periods of history.

Battletech is a turn-based game where your mercenery company take on missions from factions and fight against factions. This game is originally a game board.

Pros:
It is turn-based! Alot of people don't like turn-based. I get it since battletech is very much a time consuming game.
MODS. This game shines when you apply mods to it. The main mods to choose will be Battletech Advanced 3062 (BTA3062) and Roguetech (RT). 
(I could probably make an entire essay about the mods, but I'm lazy lol)

Cons:
Unfortunately this game is developed on a version of unity where there is this bug, Battletech randomly dumps memory into the pagefile, requiring you to restart the game every few mission espicially with mods. 
Now while I will not consider myself a veteran at vanilla, I find the base game a bit lacking.
Why can't you shoot when you sprint in the base game? Some logic in vanilla doesn't make sense.
Don't expect Harebrained Schemes to fix or update.


Will not be judging champaign as I haven't played it.

[h3]Is Battletech worth it?[/h3]
Absolutely! Would really only get it when on sale as Paradox Interactives games are pretty expensive.
If you are someone willing spend a stupid amount of time staring at a screen at a bunch of pixel mechs shooting at each other to death where literally all the combat is RNG, go for it!",1700601506,1700672152,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I don't how it happened.

There I was. Playing Baldur's Gate 3. Content. Happy. 

One night I thought I would mess around with an older game I bought on sale a year earlier.
The skirmish didn't really teach you the game and, confused, I lost interest.  

So this time I decided to try the campaign . . . 

Everything was going great, met an old mentor, there was peace in our time, then my game world fell apart!

“Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!” - Wash’s Stegosaurus

Holy Moley! I was sucked right into the Battletech universe! I suddenly remembered my Mechwarrior 2 days and Battledome fights on my 486 dx266 PC. 

“Someone ever tries to kill you, you try to kill ’em right back!” — Mal

Then weeks went by.  I fully intended to go back to BG3, but one more mission, just one more . . . 
then another, and another. I have a crew, upgrades, fiscal reports to manage, missions to coordinate, giving out orders like I know what I am doing.

“Yessir, Captain Tight Pants.” — Kaylee

Learning from my mistakes.

“First rule of battle, little one … don’t ever let them know where you are.” — Zoe

Sometimes our fights were costly, but hard earned.

""Any one you walk away from, right? Long as we got the goods, I call this a win."" - Jayne

Always looking for the next job to pay the bills.

""I did a job and had nothing but trouble since I got it, not to mention more than a few unkind words with regard to my character. So let me make this abundantly clear: I do the job and then I get paid. Go run your little world. "" - Mal

I can feel the impact of every shot fired on my mechs.  Every limb and weapon system destroyed was gut-wrenching.  The pain and frustration knowing my main character was going to have to manage both experienced and greenhorn Mechwarriors for the next 84 days from a hospital bed was real and kept me coming back to see him through his convalesce.

Simon: ""You had the Alliance on you, criminals and savages… half the people on this ship have been shot or wounded, including yourself, and you’re harboring known fugitives.""
Mal: ""We’re still flying.""
Simon: ""That’s not much.""
Mal: ""It’s enough."" 

In fact, I spent too much time on this review. I need to get back to my motley crew. We got ourselves in a war and scrap heap of salvage and trouble.  

""Time for some thrilling heroics."" - Jayne.

A lot of Possibilities for different Weapons, especially with the DLCs
High Replay Value

Cons:
Long inGame LoadTimes once more SaveGames accumulate (thought that would be a problem of past decades..?)
Story a bit bland
Despites Story Missions and Flashpoints repetitive after some hours (over 300 in my Case)

If you like to spend time fitting your Mechs and have Fun grinding for better Tech its a must. 
If you just search for a good story without any side tracking its a meh

Firstly if you love mech games, tactic games and light RPG elements, this is DEFINITELY scratches that itch. You complete jobs for various factions across a galaxy, collecting parts and assembling better and better parts to build the best fleet of mechs money can buy. 

Combat is tactical where you have to choose your mech chasis, weapon loadouts and level your pilots. During fights it's about careful choice of positioning, choosing the right target and letting the RNG gods decide what happens. This is where I have real strong gripes with the game, early game the computer straight up feels like it's cheating with ridiculous ""lucky shots"" that break things off your mechs. While later game the combat just turns into slug fests where difficulty progression is about fighting more and more, tanky mechs. Don't be surprised if your squad of four has to kill 8 or more equally or better armed mechs in a mission.

The interface and command centre really need work. The load times are ATROCIOUS and every single switch between pages has a load time, this coupled with stupid layouts really hurts the game. It would've been so much better to have more options on a single screen than be forced to travel between each part of your ship to perform admin work. This sucks because none of the different areas actually has anything interesting going on (just an idle npc and a low interest background) and there's only really one reason for going to each area. It would've been so much have more areas combined for less loading and more interesting too, plus it's ridiculous you can't advance time from the med bay or mech bay because that's where you need it the most.

Overall, I think this game is good... but not great. Xcom does the same game play but feels less RNG, has more tactical gameplay, with more mission variety and polish. I'd give this a 6.5/10, only on special but there's better choices out there.",1641116800,1699307099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a long-time fan of the BattleTech universe, I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that Harebrained Schemes (HBS) was developing a BattleTech video game. Would they manage to capture the essence of this beloved universe while also delivering a compelling gaming experience? The answer is a resounding ""yes."" HBS's BattleTech is not just a worthy addition to the established lore; it's a triumph in its own right.

First and foremost, one of the standout features of BattleTech is its exceptional modding community. From new mechs and weapons to custom missions and even entirely new campaigns, the modding community has expanded and enriched the game in countless ways. The dedication and creativity of these modders have ensured that BattleTech has a lasting and evolving appeal.

In terms of lore and world-building, HBS deserves accolades for their adherence to the established BattleTech canon. They've managed to faithfully capture the gritty and complex nature of the universe, making it accessible to both die-hard fans and newcomers alike. The inclusion of iconic houses, factions, and personalities from the tabletop and novels is a treat for fans, as it instantly immerses you in the familiar yet ever-engaging world of the Inner Sphere.

What truly sets HBS's BattleTech apart, however, is their own twist and flavor added to the universe. The game's campaign, with its compelling narrative and well-crafted characters, offers a fresh perspective on the BattleTech universe while staying true to its core themes. The player's journey as a fledgling mercenary outfit, struggling to survive and thrive in a galaxy torn by war, is filled with challenging decisions. This nuanced storytelling adds layers of depth to the game, making it more than just a tactical battle simulator.

The turn-based combat system is another area where HBS shines. It successfully blends complexity and accessibility, offering a satisfying mix of strategy and action. Managing your lance of mechs, each with unique capabilities and loadouts, becomes an engaging puzzle in every mission. The satisfaction of lining up the perfect shot or executing a well-coordinated attack is unparalleled.",1698680224,1698680224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's very true to the physical game and its rich lore.

However, if you are just looking for a good tactical game and don't have any particular attachment to this game's roots, then I have to admit you probably won't like this game.

This game does not really respect the player's time. There are unskippable cut scenes when you travel between worlds, repairs/refits of mechs and healing of pilots all require the player to spend real time waiting for the projects to be completed. It's a lot less time than what goes into a physical Battletech game, but it's still pretty high for a video game.

As for what you actually get for the cost of your time, the payout of a good tactical puzzle to solve, it's a lot more underwhelming than I thought it would be based on the advertisement. It's one of those games that gives the player a million little fidgety things to adjust, presenting the player with a choice. Either spend an hour or so (including wait time for the refit to go through) modifying the mechs to optimize them for each encounter, or use a generic mech that is kind of bad at everything and hope you can slug it out.

There's a resource management aspect of the game which I feel can be pretty punishing. I feel like the game pushed me into taking a bunch of trivial missions in order to pay for the repairs incurred from one challenging victory, making the whole thing feel even more like a slog.

I don't regret the purchase, but I've got to admit that for someone without a prior connection to the game it's probably not going to be a very rewarding experience.",1698505774,1698505774,False,49,2,0.584738016128540039,0,True,False,False

I didn't buy it for the longest time because I tend to prefer story-driven games to arbitrary combat games, and this is definitely the latter. But it was on sale recently, so I picked up the base edition (no DLC) and turns out the mechanics are pretty great.

My only previous exposure to Battletech is through The Crescent Hawks' Inception, a PC game from the 1980s where you play a cadet whose training is interrupted, and you follow his journey as he deals with being thrust into a war he wasn't prepared for. This game's story has similar elements, but instead of starting out as a know-nothing greenhorn, you're immediately launched into the middle of a conflict between a bunch of mass-murdering nobles whose primary motivations appear to be petty family squabbles and revenge. It's hard to care about any of the characters because they are all rich and selfish, and it's hard to settle into your role as a seasoned veteran because as a player none of the game mechanics are taught to you and as a character all of your colleagues are scrubs who can't (yet) hit the side of a barn.

But if you persevere - and you really have to persevere - it gets good. It took me about 40 hours of grinding around the randomly-generated starting missions till my in-game crew developed half-decent piloting skills and I started to understand how best to tackle the combat. Aside from one story mission, there is no stealth in this game. Once you get a radar ping, the enemies will know exactly where you are and come for you. There is no opportunity fire or overwatch. Everything comes down to who shoots first, how accurately you aim and how much firepower you can bring to bear. You gotta move fast and hit hard. Once you get into the the rhythm, it's actually quite a fun take on turn-based tactics.

So you start to understand how the combat works, and you discover your favorite mechs to pilot, and maybe experiment with a few different loadouts, go back to the story missions and then... the story is over. It's a crying shame that the DLCs just give you a bunch of new mechs and not a new story, because this world is busting with sci-fi potential. You could tell a story like Mass Effect or Halo with these mechanics, and it would rule. But instead you're just cycling through dozens of iterations of 4 giant robots vs the world.

And that's cool as hell, don't get me wrong. The battles are challenging and fun, even though you are often unfairly outnumbered. The cutscenes are great, the music is on point, the way the camera swoops makes everything feel cinematic. It's awesome. But the story is disappointingly shallow when put next to the incredibly deep lore. It feels like a missed opportunity to put together a game that would really hold the hand of a Battletech noob, teach them the mechanics through an extended tutorial arc instead of 40 hours of unscripted grind, get them to care about the characters and feel connected to the story. Alas, this is not a story game. But it's still a pretty good game.

Having your entire lance focus firing down one mech for 3 turns with very little effect while getting your own mechs focused down one at a time by an enemy with more individual turns than you can have is incredibly frustrating.

Managing risk and reward on the strategic level as I pick and choose which jobs I'll take and the money to salvage ratio I want upon completion is a lot of fun as well, always looking for rare 'Mechs and equipment while also trying to fatten my wallet. 
I have loved playing this game and anticipate enjoying it for years to come as the replay value certainly seems to age well. The DLCs are also fantastic, adding some additional story elements that spice up the game a bit more while adding some new 'Mechs and equipment.",1698280269,1698280269,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quite often you spawn inside a kill box and spend the entire mission trying get at least one mech to the evac point.

BATTLETECH is a solid 8/10 and despite it's faults and being 4-5 years old now, is probably still worth $40 if you're a fan of turn-based combat games, 'mecha, and intense customization. 

PROS:
- tons of methods for fighting. While it's true that Battletech tends to lean towards having you work up to assaults, you can absolutely finish the game using 'light mechs, impressive piloting, stacking evasion pips, and abusing the ever living HELL out of the initiative system. The game in fact, tells you to do so!
- The story and setting are wonderful. Somehow, SOMEHOW BATTLETECH added onto the original TRO:3025 seamlessly, making the periphery into this society on the skids, living in the rotten skeleton of past giants. Every world has fluff text, every campaign mission is unique in some distinct way, and even the procedurally-generated missions try to spice things up with varied maps and 'mechs in varying states of readiness.
- Extreme customization, even far further than stock battletech. You can go as far as specific brands of gyroscopes, actuators to improve physical attacks, and even computers.
- To add onto this, there's never a ""best"" method of gameplay; only better ones. Sure it's a good idea to have dedicated SRM carriers, ranged machines, play the knockdown game- but at the end of the day, massive guns like the COIL-L can mean you have less salvage to refit and rebuild other chassis you may want. Things get as tactical as you desire with how you stat your pilots.
- Base story, while simple, is also strong and stable. Though Kamea's side is a little *too* good guy for some tastes, they still come off as genuine with some interesting small discussions- in particular Alex discussing how it's hard to be genuine to people when you were born into wealth or how your villian in the story has a point about needing force in the battletech universe. It's not super deep, but everyone does feel like they have a character.
- To add onto the storyline, you also feel ""small"" in good ways. You start by being leashed to your debtors, then to Kamea and the Canopians, Basically, you always feel like you're being led and don't know the full story, which for early Battletechs ""Fuedalism with giant robots in Mad Max Space"" fits SO WELL.
- Mods. Battletech is close to reaching that vaunted ""It can be whatever game you want"" tier- top mods for many include Mission Control, Bigger Drops, Haydes Rim, and Battletech Extended which (like Rougetech, which I didn't add because it's pretty buggy still) added all the 'mechs in Mechwarrior Online and MW:5, all the clans, factions ect. into a MASSIVE rougelike game.

CONS:
- The game gets easy, and fast. In fact, it rapidly gets easy enough that it needs THREE specific determinates:
1. for starters, as a rougelike it's expected you'll go do other operations while Kamea fires up her rebellion, and in doing so you'll rapidly begin salvaging parts and chassis- but there's no length of time on how long you can spend doing so. You could literally tell her to fuck off for an in-game decade, salvage your way to all assaults, then rock onto the base initial missions and lay waste no problem. My most recent game I salvaged a Cyclops in the first year, which donated it's AC/20 and tactical computer for some serious initative boosts.
 2. To add to that, the expansions (ESPECIALLY Heavy Metal) made it easier with crates. Sometimes a random speech event just gives you a new 'mech. On top of this, it added ultra autocannons to the game which are simply better than the stock ones and lack the constant jam chance.
3. Pirates. If you get on their good side and open up the black market, you WILL see several assault 'mechs, you WILL get multipule ++ weapons, and you WILL get serious high-level shit. 
- While the AI rarely cheats, every once in awhile your opponent will score a trickshot that feels hella cheap. It's apart of Battletech and the experience of it- any tabletop player has the story of a ""Golden BB"" that took out an enemy 'mech within the opening turns of the game.
- The Memory Leak. Leaving BATTLETECH on for long spans eventually devours all your system memory and resources, and while patched heavily still occurs into 2023. It now means you shouldn't leave it running for longer than 10+ hours, but just so you're aware.
- Character creation, while in depth seeming at first, really only affects some of your responses to different story beats. Seems to be more of a failure of time invested into the game from Paradox, like how we were originally supposed to be able to betray Kamea for the Directorate at one point.

In closing- get it. 8/10, solid, genuinely the Catalyst (heh) that has led to Battletechs renaissance of late.",1698165879,1698165879,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I chose BTA3062, and it's not just a mod, in reality: it's effectively a sequel: same look and feel, but the sheer size of the increase in content, be that mechs, maps, systems to visit, weapons to try, wierd new technology... it's a whole new game.

However, only Battletech has truly immersed me within the universe properly. Forgive me if i deviate a bit and talk about the other two first, but as these three games seem to be at the forefront of the franchise, i think its important to at least touch up on them to give everyone a proper idea of what they all have to offer, including battletech.


Firstly, Mechwarrior 5. While it has good graphics, it has a very generic story, that does little to really immerse you into the universe as a whole. Combine that with underdeveloped and frankly unimaginative characters, plot, and development, means you have a story quality and environment that leaves little impression.

Mech5's gameplay and mechanics are good, but missions lack variety, it also lacks any true multiplayer and is limited to Co-Op with people you KNOW, or give an invite code too. You can't join random sessions like other co-op games. Overall, if you want to pilot a mech and shoot stuff in PvE in good graphic quality and solid mechanics, its not bad, but the atrocity that is its story leaves much to be desired.

MWO, is VERY similar to Mechwarrior 5 in gameplay and mechanics, although seems to take a step back or two in graphics, nothing major but you'll notice it. As the name suggest, it makes up for it in multiplayer function, and as of this review, still supports a healthy population. Queue time was rather short and it has a WIDE variety of mechs for you to pilot and LOTS of customization options for said mechs. 

There is no unlocking mechs or components like in WarThunder or WoT, but there is a grind for money to BUY those mechs and new equipment, with a similar subscription system to get boost to help ease the grind. You can also spend RL money to get special mech variants that also give boost. Overall, if you want to pilot a mech, id suggest putting money into MWO over Mech5, but that is just my opinion. 


Now, finally, BATTLETECH. 
It's a turn based game, and while that cant beat the other two with their ability to personally pilot your own mech, it makes up for it in both story quality and its ability to immerse you in the universe of mechwarrior. From the moment i started up the game, the into sequence just to load into the menu was quite incredible. Essentially, it has everything that Mech5 lacks, and as someone who values a high-quality story and immersion above all, Battletech has not disappointed me. 

Additionally, you have quite a few customization options for your character appearance and background that grants you unique interactions during the course of the campaign. 

As for the immersion, the game has a lot of little and moderate details that will serve to give you the impression that you are on a ship of mercenaries flying through the galaxy looking for work. from ambient noise and PA announcements on your ship, to how the characters speak, view, and approach the job. [Primarily amorality, with shades of gray, instead of Mech5's Black and White.] 
While also giving you information about that universe, its history, and current events/politics. All through interactions with your crew. I learned more about the mechwarrior universe from these interactions than i had in nearly 20 hours of gameplay in mech5. 


Now, you can probably tell by now i'm pretty biased against Mech5, while i dont ""Hate"" the game, i found it wanting in many aspects of it, but even i will play it occasionally to enjoy what it DOES have, even if i may not care for its story or enviorment.

That being said, in conclusion, While BATTLETECHs turn-based gameplay can be a let-down for some people, it more than makes up for it in just about every other aspect of the game.
Wither full-price or on discount, i happily recommend it to anyone else with a similar preference for story and immersion. That's all for now, good luck out there mercenaries! Try not to die. ;)",1673713717,1697477447,True,41,0,0.790289342403411865,0,True,False,False

I have changed my mind.
That's not to say the game isn't flawed, but I generally think the good parts outweigh the bad.

The Good:
Well balanced.
Good story and moderately good cinematics.
Faithful to the source material.
DLC packs add to the game significantly,
Challenging.
Fun.
Excellent mods available.

The Bad:
Long load times.
Very few speaking lines are voiced.
Unfair / ridiculous  win conditions (attack & defend, I'm looking at you.)

The ugly:
Highly detailed models and terrain...  Why is this ugly?  Well, in order to, you know, PLAY THE GAME, you need to be zoomed out.  The extra detail mostly just results in more work for my GPU, with little benefit.
""Diversity"".  Does anyone REALLY think people will be wearing hijabs in the 31st goddamn century???  Get a grip.

Generally, I think this was a good purchase.

Its visually appealing, tons of mech variety and dynamic environments keep the game entertaining, theres a good level of customizing you're able to do to your mechs and mechwarriors as well as clearly labled leveling mechanics for them.

Combat is fun but can quickly turn sour due to the RNG nature of things but its what you sign up for tbh so not much to complain about there.
The difficulty scaling is shared with that of the Mechwarrior franchise, I.E. a 2 skull mission can become insanely ugly incredibly quickly and for no percievable reason. Though this is rarer than one might think, out smarting the AI and choosing good positioning is key and will be the difference between a hasty restart and seeing the mission through.

In addition to simply not dying you also get to play accountant and are forced to manage various budgetary constraints and sometimes get involved in crew politics. Both of these sound more annoying than they really are and choosing the right path can lead to some unique rewards to don't go making choices lightly.

Downsides to the game would be its unreliable frame rate, usually not a issue but i'll hit random lag spikes or stuttering and haven't been able to find a proper solution yet.
The interface is kind of bad, the ranges are displayed as cones around your mech when moving but this doesn't give you any hint on what percentages you'll be dealing with post move, there are dozens of variables to keep track of and its more info that would be useful upfront

The controls for menus are also bad. Right click which is usually ""go back"" or ""undo"" in modern games does the same as left click and more than a few times its caused me to commit to a action or attack i didn't intend just due to sheer habit. When tutorial screens pop up they don't pause the game, in fact when you click ""ok"" it actually works as tho you weren't even in the menu. Hope you weren't about to move a mech when it pops up or you'll be in trouble.

A good game, very solid for being on the trash unity engine, highly recommend. The DLC has fun stuff and more is always better but get them when on sale as only 1 of them does anything besides add more mechs and equipment.",1697264994,1697264994,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game-play is simple enough to pick up easily, but plenty of depth to keep you coming back for more. Good customisation, tactics and upgrades fit right into the turn-based RPG mould.

Do the creators actually play the game?

In the games main menu click on an  element and it brings you to the same screen with a menu of  2-4 sub selections that you can not select (THERE IS ONLY ONE SELECTION YOU WILL MAKE)... you have to move your mouse away and then back into the menu to select what you want, NO!  do not move your mouse to the selection you want ( always ONE ) or the new menu dis appeasers  .  Yes, I know, first world problems...

Just such an easy fix...  and so glaring.  

The main screen of the game is gonna mess with you, the top elements on the left don't have any realistic information.  Why would I need to know where I am on the ship?  It makes ZERO difference... why is the element taking up 1/4 or 1/5th of the menu bar...same with the expenses bar...

To actually start a mission you have to click the fourth item down from the left ( JUST LIKE ALL OTHER GAMES? ) and then click the first of 2 tabs... ( Get it right this time|! )

Other than that, its almost impossible to tell what is going on during combat at times due to the great camera action.  If you change the colors of your mechs to something very bright, you might be able to see them on the battlefield....

You have a wide option of different battlemechs you can use and face off against in each battle. Furthermore, each battlemech has a great deal of options for customization with the only limitations being the weapons hard points on the battlemech and the battlemech's maximum tonnage. There are many different maps each with there own challenge to face. The challenge comes from the lay of the land and the biome the map represents. Both the maps and the battlemech models in the game are a treat to look at.

Each type of battlemech and the equipment it brings gives you a different relative advantage depending on the map and mission you are doing. Are you doing an extraction mission in a cold forested mountain range? Bring a light battlemech with jump jets and high heat generating weapons to get in and out before the lumbering defenders can get you in their sights. Maybe your doing a straight up battle in a relatively flat lunar map? I'd suggest bringing a heavier battlemech with a weapons load out featuring as little heat generation as possible. 

There are three main modes of play Campaign, Career, and Skirmish. Campaign mode has the tutorial built into its first couple of missions. It also has many fun story missions to play that are great from both a game play  aspect and a story telling aspect. Said story arc is very enjoyable. Career mode drops the tutorial and story missions from Campaign and focuses on just you building up the best mercenary company in a span of 4 years. Both Campaign and Career modes let you play on after you've 'finished' them which is great. Skirmish lets you do a quick customized battle and test out potential battlemech builds. I cannot comment on the multiplayer aspect of the game as that is not something I do myself. 

 The only downside to Battletech for me is that the game limits you to exactly 4 battlemechs you control for a mission. There are a few missions in campaign and career that will give you allied battlemechs. However, those allies are not under your control and those missions are very limited. The reason for this limitation in game is explained wonderfully without breaking the suspension of disbelief. Your mercenary company in the story starts operating out of a Leopard which can only deploy 4 battlemechs. The main 'dropship' you use in campagin and throughout the career mode isn't actually a dropship in the sense that it lands on a planet leaving you to rely on that Leopard to get down to the planet. Best narrative explanation for a game limitation I have ever seen used. I don't like this choice because it cuts me off from trying swarm tactics with lighter battlemechs and the harder difficulty for most missions generally guides you into using ever heavier battlemechs. 

Overall, this is a game that any mechwarrior/battletech franchise fan must have in their collection. Any tactical or strategic combat fan will want to get it when they can regardless if it is on sale or not. Anyone who just wants to play a good computer game should consider getting Battletech on regular days and should make it the top of their priority on a game sales day. I bought this game when it was on sale and after playing it would have bought it at full price if I had known how much fun I would get out of it.",1696170382,1696170382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Why is there an entire mission where I have to spend it destroying extremely well-armored APCs that deal 0 damage, because if they reach my base, the mission fails, while also having to ignore enemies who can mysteriously one shot my heavy mechs?

This game doesn't encourage creative thinking in any way.  There's one way to win every battle, and it typically depends on luck and cheese.  You can't farm for resources to improve your pilots and mechs in a meaningful manner...the whole game is a race to balance your checkbook as your crew hemorrhages money while doing nothing more than basic maintenance, healing, and repairs.

I think it is very intriguing, it has a nice set of rules and all, but the way everything is snowballing on you with too much realism is just too much for me. I thought it was one of the classic games that you can just play. But here you need to commit, make research (which I did) and even after that you might end up with a strange taste in your mouth. 

The most problems I have is with nice mechanics that are simply not working when you are outnumbered 1 to 2 most of the time and when you beat the odds then another set of enemies appears, fresh and you have to beat them, then another ones, and so on. All the while your armor is going down, you receive structural dmg or the pilots get injured. That is ok if it wouldn't cost so much time to heal and repair. All the while time is ticking away on loans, contracts, salaries and you start to feel the unfunny part of being a fair play mercenary boss. So we are playing on realism and yet we are thrown against such odds that no mercs will be willing to risk their hides. Not for such measly payment. This is taking all the fun from it. I even liked the reputation system and was willing to trade plus rep for minus earnings.

I like the rules from the original table top game and how they are implemented on PC. You get evasion ticks as you move. It is nice how it represents the reality of movement in turn based strategy.  Apart from missing info about the amount, I am ok with it. But if another 4 new mechs arrive after you just dispatched the previous company, you get bored. Again you need to run around until you get upper hand. Why? When mech moves then he receives 2-3 evasion ticks. So either sensor target to remove 2 and disrupt their targeting, or with one attack punch out one evasion. They get 2 evasions. You have 4 mechs max per mission. Half of the attacks are going there. With some luck you can take out a mech without concentrated fire. It is not annoying on its own, but when you need to overcome it again and again, then it becomes not funny. So why should I spend more time on this? I think when you get really further away and you can get to have spare pilots, mechs and can wait for 30 days to cure one injury per mechwarrior. But then you get a lot of mechs with LRM where you get 30 rockets from one mech, that can pound the hell out of you and it starts to become stressful. Will they be lucky or not? And you can reload only to a certain level, after you get uncomfortable even with that. 

And One more thing that is a big minus is - you do not see in game the range of your weapons, so you need to guess if you are going to be in optimal range of this or that weapon. After some time you get better at equipping your mech with weaponry that works together better then others. All the while I really enjoyed how the mechs and mechbay is done and easy to navigate.

I thought this game would be more fun, but it is more a war of attrition. Many nice premises though. It takes too much play time for the enjoyment it gives you. ",1696094454,1696095125,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Enemies are terminators with no self preservation at all, their ONLY goal - deal you as much damage as possible.

I tried to find tactics etc - and what I understood.

Combine that with a ridiculous level of difficulty and it really sucks the enjoyment out the game.

So heres my review.

+ Story (although almost no voicelines its very good), unfortunately i like the clan era much more :)
+ Very very deep game about Mech, even different version of mechs, VERY COOL
+ Combat kinda feels amazing, attacking from different angles etc.
+ Pre-Combat you can upgrade ship cruise around, there are not many events but its fine

- This is like the worst programmed/optimized game in years like everything produces fps shutters EVERYWHERE, even quitting the game to desktop takes like 30 seconds WTF...
- Progression to Assault lock -> you start mostly with medium and ligh mecks and progress to assault mechs later on and thats NOT GOOD, i mean maybe ppl like playing light mechs/medium/heavies ? But after a couple of missions there is ABSOLUTELY NO WINDOW for medium or light mechts because the enemie swarms you with like 12 targets consisting of at least 5-8 Assault/Heavy targets. So basicly each mission is like 4 assaults....
- Absolute Rogue difficult - The difficult is insane, i fully understand that you have to consider loses but being obliterated almost each game hmmm dunno

As conclusion as for me this game has very good roots and once they fix the shutters and fps drops it will become more fluent. But yeah there is still the problem with the assault lock unless you like playing big guys only you will get frustrated :>

Edit: After more then a year i tried this game after grabbing all dlcs with 75% off. The Optimization  Problems seem to have been fixed. However this game is still absolutely frustrating. You still can only deploy like 4 mechs and fight like against 10 Mechs + 1-5 vehicles + 3-4 towers against you. There is basicly no real Battletech feeling, i mean who would go to war (into straight combat) knowing you are completely outgunned and outmanned in every mission.....I am sorry but this game is a design flaw from A to Z.

It's a ""buy during massive"" sale, but even then only if you don't mind any of the below-listed nonsense.

For the record, I played an loved the Shadowrun trilogy, so I know this studio can make great turn-based tactical games. I kind of like this game too but it has too much frustrating nonsense for me to recommend it.

- The main problem is the 4 units/mission limit. This does not make any sense whatsoever in a game where the AI can use the exact same units and abilites while almost always outnumbering the player's forces.

- Optional enemies are hardly ever optional, for example because the only way to the evac zone is right through them.

- The enemy ALWAYS gets reinforcements, even when they already outnumbered me. I win a mission easily, but take a few hits, so I lose everything because then comes another group of mostly unavoidable mechs, so in the end the full number of enemies is way beyond even my fully intact strenght, and what the mission rewards or the difficulty indicator predicted.

- The mission difficulty indicator is almost completely unreliable.

- Outside of battle I should be able to move my entire team all at once and in real time.

- Somehow a game from 2017 can eat all the memory of a computer from 2021. After a while reloading just takes too long and I have to restart the game. This in a game where one needs to realod frequently.

- If I fail a mission I have to click through at least 4 slowly-loading screens before I can reload!

- The AI uses modern war logic, ruining the impractical fantasy of fighting with giant robots. Far too often it has a bunch of expendable turrets and/or armored vehicles, which decimate me from afar while his mechs keep me away. Even if I get close fast, the little things still hit hard, so I just trap myself in a deadly crossfire. This all makes perfect sense: it is better to have a lot of expendable units that still hit hard and reach far. What pisses me off is that I don't have acces to them and they are too good at countering the unrealistic but fun mechs the game is supposed to be about.",1693840390,1695141346,False,3,1,0.499793559312820435,0,True,False,False

Upon actually completing the campaign, I'll say the story is pretty ok. Nothing amazing but kept me playing for waaaaaaay too long because of this game's downright addicting gameplay loop. Even though the battles sometimes take ages, and at a certain point, are just dropping the same mechs and pilots over and over again with the same strategy of drown them in missiles and lasers and pray for a lucky headshot with an AC20, I could not get enough of them. I cannot overstate this: the battles are straight up fun, especially when things don't go to plan and you come out of fights sighing and audibly saying ""thank fuck"". The ""mechlab"" (as I've heard it being called) is pretty alright for a shitter like me, and I haven't done much beyond that my 400 hour first playthrough.

When I heard that it was going to be turn-based, however, my enthusiasm was tempered. I've always maintained that while the tabletop game was turn-based because it is simply not feasible to represent real-time strategy on the tabletop. MechCommander (1 and 2) made the decision to move the game to real time for a VERY good reason, and it bore out in greater tactical depth, more meaningful choices, and the feeling of actually commanding a BATTLE.

Unfortunately, while this may or may not be a faithful or clever adaption of the tabletop game, it is a disappointingly mediocre, under-designed experience by the standards set by a 20-year old entry into the franchise. The devs clearly did not actually consider the implications of most of the mechanics that went into combat, with the end result being needlessly stiff, janky, and poorly-balanced. I've heard plenty of griping about how the late game is a miserable slog of over-beefed doomstacks of enemy units blasting your lance apart, but even my experience in the early game has been extremely disappointing.

In a word, combat fucking sucks. The existing evasion system (mechs build up stacks of ""evasion"" by moving, and evasion is used up point-by-point dodging incoming fire) MASSIVELY privileges the AI's swarms of shitty light mechs, which nevertheless will effortlessly dance past the outgoing fire from your own lance (even comprised of EXACTLY the sorts of mechs that would qualify as ""light mech hunters"" in the lore and other games), while inflicting disproportionate damage on your own units. Because again, every incoming attack consumes one stack of evasion, and with all of the AI's light mechs acting on one turn (since initiative is set in blocks based on chassis weight and pilot skill), they can rush in and focus down ONE of your  own mechs by stripping away all of your evasion stacks and hitting it over. And over. And over.

Lacking any sort of ""glancing hit"" system (i.e., a die roll that's almost-but-not-quite a hit still does some damage), fights in the early game as an agonizing process of systematically wasting turn after turn stripping down a single target's evasion, only to watch it just BARELY survive, and use its own turn to run away and regain all of the evasion stacks you JUST got rid of.

Also lacking any sort of ""overwatch"" system to allow a mech to forego its attack and instead try to open fire off-turn means that anything that if your lance gets scattered due to terrain and one of your mechs loses line of sight, you can't position it to, say, provide a faceful of hurt to the Jenner that you KNOW is about to round that corner. Instead you just have to passively sit still and let it run past you to get a bunch of free shots on your rear armor. 

Landing hits at long range is also an exercise in futility. It feels like anything more mobile than a fixed turret WILL dodge your fire, forcing you to turn every mech into a close-ranged brawler just so that when the computer's aforementioned swarms of shitty light mechs rush up to you, you at least aren't suffering from the massive ""minimum distance"" penalties for using a long ranged weapon. 

Also, while you are guaranteed to face absolute swarms of light mechs from all but the earliest game onwards, you are restricted to your own meagre four-man lance. You know what MechCommander gave us over two decades ago? That's right-- deployments based on drop weight! Being able to customize your forces to meet different threats in different ways. Instead, BATTLETECH contents itself with a lazy my-rules-are-not-your-rules system that completely stacks the difficulty on the side of the fight that has more units in play.

In short, as much as I tried to like this game, the design problems are so fundamental and so obvious I'm shocked that this product has such a positive rating. Maybe people just don't remember that we've solved these problems, whether by transitioning to real-time combat, integrating a hybrid ""real time with pause"" or ""action points"" turn-based, or even just by having more options available within the turn-based structure. But I remember, and it makes me deeply saddened that this project could have been MechCommander 3 instead of Fire Emblem: Robots.

EDIT: Having now completed the campaign, I understand a bit more of why people that complete the game have a sunnier opinion of it.

No, the game does not get better-- it's still strategically shallow and the design flaws mentioned above are still slammed into your face every single turn you take, and every single time that your attempt to do something clever is laughed off by the game engine.

Nope, the reason the game gets better is because at endgame, light mechs stop being in the spawn pools for missions.

Having completed the campaign, and started a new Career (No ability to import your save over? No New Game+ capabilities? Nothing?), I was curious if my experience with the early game would be any better now that I had a completed campaign under my belt. Nope, no chance in hell. The early game is absolute garbage, and I do NOT mean that in the sense that a Mech* game should have a rough early game. You are not making hard decisions on a shoestring budget, making tough decisions about future loyalty, or any of that other stuff that seems like an obvious genre staple. 

No, instead, what you're dealing with is FUCKING LIGHT MECHS getting spammed on you again. And the more that you play, the MORE obvious it is how absolutely awful the balance and design around light mech combat is. The AI will gladly rush multiple light mechs out of cover and into the crosshairs of your much deadlier mediums PURELY for the sake of ganging up on and focusing down one of your damaged lights. Why? Because the AI has *no* self-preservation instinct. Every single vehicle driver or Mechwarrior that the AI has is a literally fearless death-seeker outside of pre-scripted ""I got damaged so now I'm running away to extraction"" segments. The sole surviving Jenner with its arms blown off and ammo depleted by an explosion will LITERALLY opt to rush into melee just to deliver a spite melee to increase the repair cost on one of your mechs instead of opting to eject. 

If the AI had to deal with a reverse morale system from your own-- starts at full, ticks down as stuff goes wrong-- decisions and strategic depth could be reintroduced. Do you risk going for the early killing blow on the heavier ""lance leader"" mech, to demoralize the lighter lance-members? Or do you focus on systematically picking the lance apart from the bottom up, to better secure your flanks and deny them indirect fire bonuses, etc? 

Also, other points of contention arise as you encounter them more and more. Not just matters or ""This cool, obvious feature is missing"" but even things like ""This extremely obvious design choice was ignored to make an inferior, stupid design choice"". A perfect example is how rear shots work. Rear shots (obviously) target the rear armor, which is UNIVERSALLY thinner than front armor. This alone is a huge benefit that makes some risky maneuvering worth it. In addition, however, rear shots also.... Ignore cover bonuses? The much, MUCH more obvious ""Rear shots ignore EVASION bonuses"" was overlooked, despite the fact that it intuitively makes more sense that shooting someone in the back has a better chance of hitting them since they CAN'T SEE THE SHOT COMING. 

The final nail in this negative review is the genuinely AWFUL optimization. There are story missions-- not emergent procedurally-generated missions, but actual fully scripted NON-OPTIONAL, MAIN STORY missions that drop a modern PC to 10 fps. We have games from ten years ago more graphically intensive than this that had better performance.

In the pros column; the game is a good representation of  most of the aspects of the original tabletop game, the strategy that's there is solid and it's fun stomping around with your mechs blowing things up. Additionally there's a good amount of attention to detail with certain things and there's technically a good amount of variety and customisation.

However, the reason why i wouldn't recommend Battletech is a combination of minor points that eventually just wore me down.
The battles all feel exactly the same, despite the various permutations (base defence/attack, convoy defence/attack, battle, assasination etc).
The balance is weighed towards your opponent who almost always outnumbers you which leads to the same tactic becoming more necessary: kite the enemy and focus fire them down (slowly) one by one.
Some of the weapons feel very lacklustre (PPCs being my main gripe) and only feel viable in very specific situations which you don't really get because as above all battles are basically the same.
The story campaign is bland and although it might get better in the second half really isn't exciting.
Almost all battles follow the same formula especially with reinforcements coming in half way through the mission, you can set your watch by them.
There is variety but the grind to get that variety and the restrictions on trying things out in battle with the small mech-pool (Starts at 6 but does eventually get up to 18) combined with how easy it is to fall into routine means experimentation is almost punished.
The game does a really bad job of teaching you how to play, which in the story campaign is fine because there's no time limit other than keeping your merc company afloat. Learning is half the fun but when you realise a dozen hours in that you've given your main team a wonky selection of skills or put a load of money and time into a mech that looks good on paper but in the world of the game under-performs...yeah that's a bit crap.

Honestly i think my enjoyment of the game would be enhanced by two main things:
1. Actual variety in the missions forcing me to use various team compositions and tactics other than all battles becoming the same old same old. Also more potentially mechs on your team as time goes on.
2. A virtual testing ground where you can build and try out a squad or individual mech against adjustable opponents before committing to throwing money at the thing before you put it in battle and realise it either doesn't perform like you though it would or doesn't fit into your team.

I understand there are some very good overhaul mods for this game that may/not make the game more for me but that for a future me that's not currently bored with Battletech.

It his a sweet spot for me combining well-designed, squad-based tactical game play with a strategic layer that has enough complexity to keep it from feeling like more than just a hoop to jump through.  

I am a big fan of the X-Com games, especially the original from way back.  The modern versions are excellent, but their percentage-based to-hit mechanics drive me insane.  This game uses the same kind of mechanics, but they feel much more manageable because, where one to three shots will take an agent out in X-Com, Battletech is more a game of attrition.  Mechs can still die from a single attack, but only in very specialized circumstances where a meh is either way outside of its weight class.  This balance allows for more fluidity in the tactical game play, and I also think it contributes a great deal to making all of the ways you can customize your mechs much more interesting.  All this, and I have yet to touch the mods, which sound like they will expand on this exponentially.

The lore here is also tough to beat, given how long the Battletech world has been around, and I very much appreciate the complexity of the backstory behind the campaign and the universe as a whole.

Personally I could not get over several things:

1) You have to move. Stop. Shoot. It is two actions and if you screw up your movement or find out your chance to hit is too low, then too bad you have already moved. I much prefer the XCom style where you can take back the movement/shooting both. Since it is a strategic game I deeply miss this feature.
2) Cover in this game is not very well indicated.
3) It is still grid system as is usual in these types of games, but the grid is hidden by default (not sure if you can enable it) and since they tried to add z axis and do some vertical stuff, it just feels weird.

Since my old review I've completely changed my PC (Ryzen 5 3600, Radeon RX 6800 XT, Samsung PRO 980 NVMe SSD) and yet this game [u][b]still[/b][/u] manages to stutter and take ages to load... and let's not consider the fact that the DLCs are piss poor if you consider their price and what they offer.

Your money is better spent elsewhere.

My original review follows (for historical reasons only).

-------------------------------------------------------------

I usually do not pre-order games as I've been bitten back multiple times by such a decision in the past. Luckily, this is not one of those occasions. I've been playing BATTLETECH since launch and I've been enamoured with it since the first moment.

Let's go first with the bad bits of this game: so far the code optimization has been pretty poor unfortunately, with loading lags even when the game is installed on an SSD drive and with graphics stuttering on higher-end cards -- which you wouldn't even need given the game isn't especially rich in eye candy... but if you like strategic and tactical games like me, you know that these are kind of secondary in the genre.
Secondly, the GPU seems to go at 100% at all times... I believe this is more related to a driver problem which will be hopefully fixed soon -- [b]as far as it goes for now, avoid playing this game on a laptop unless you want to risk overheating.[/b]

Now, onto the good stuff.

The game is divided into two big phases, strategic and tactical. The strategic phase is where you plan your next moves in the BATTLETECH universe: fixing up, re-fitting and purchasing new BattleMechs and their weapons, training MechWarriors who pilot them and assign them to missions, and where you decide to go to.

I think of Mech refitting as a game within a game, as I absolutely love coming up with different ""recipes"" for my war machines given the limitations of their chassis -- a model may carry only a limited number of weapon types split between energy, ballistic, missiles and support, all with their strengths and weaknesses -- and to adapt them to the different biomes you are going to face in the tactical part of the game.

Speaking of which, once you drop on a planet with your Mech lance you find yourself in a quite faithful recreation of the original BattleTech tabletop game. Unlike other games, what you decide in the strategic layer is very much critical to the success of tactical combat -- you are going to need lighter Mechs if you have to chase down fast movers, and you will have to avoid bringing in a lot of heat-generating weaponry like laser guns if you are going to fight in a desertic or otherwise warm region, lest your machines overheat, shutdown and inflict damage to their own systems.
 
Last but not least, you have to take into consideration that both major damage to your Mechs and injuries to your pilots will put them in an unoperable state for several days, and in the case of Mechs repairs will cost you -- even more if robotic limbs have been torn apart and you therefore need to replace also the equipment that was stored there.

Concluding, It's so, so good to be back commanding 'Mechs, and I'm still feeling like I haven't finished to scratch the surface.

* The storyline is well-written and engaging and well-acted by a believable and appealing cast of characters. 
* The music is very good. 
* The graphics are strong enough to be appealing and satisfying. The effects and lighting in particular are really nice, I love how the spotlights work on dark maps, and how the missiles light up the terrain as they fly over and explosions light up the area around a 'mech when they hit. 
* The selection of mechs and equipment available in the base game is decent (mods for this title are great if you want more)

The problems:
* Performance is awful. It's not a framerate issue, anytime some calculations need to be made the game stutters, basically constantly during play. If it's your turn and you're not issuing orders it's silky smooth. It's not the end of the earth for me but it will probably turn some folks off. 
* Animations are very repetitive. It would have made the game so much better to allow mechs to ragdoll when they take a big hit like losing a leg. Very immersion breaking to watch the same ""fall down"" animation for a Griffin for the hundredth time, tipping forward into the void at the edge of a cliff and lying on nothing. 
* Difficultly is handled poorly. As the missions ramp up in difficulty rating (a 5-point scale) the payments do not increase. This means there's a sweet spot for minimising repairs while maximising profits around 3.5 stars. Doing harder missions is more fun, but the difficulty varies wildly on 4 stars and up. The mission director can sometimes send 3 full lances of mechs at you, with varying tonnages. Without save scumming some missions are just not doable. I'm happy to abort a mission and accept the consequences because in the real world you can't win every time, but it just feels like easy missions are too easy and the rest are only difficult by weight of numbers and tonnage. There's no in-between.

In this game your in charge of a small mercenary group. Your goal is to gain cash to acquire new mechs, upgrade your ship, and improve your team's skills through payed combat on various planets. The game can be played as a campaign, career (a kind of time-limited open world sandbox), or individual battles.

Game play:
You play the game in two levels: . a ""command"" level (for lack of a better word) on your dropship -- this is where you perform a number of tasks including: purchasing mechs, equipment and hiring pilots; search for contracts; store, modify, repair and sell mechs; oversee the stat progress of your men; upgrade your ship; and navigate a star map which allows you to travel between planets. The second is the tactical combat level where, obviously, you fight your battles.

The tactical level battles are done quite well having an intuitive UI and good graphics. These are small engagements with a maximum size limit to your attack group of four mechs. The enemy forces are typically composed of around six to twelve mechs or attack vehicles. Combat plays out in a simple but nuanced way. It's not quite as detailed as a the table top game but it does include all the features you'd expect in a Battletech game (specific damage, heat levels, ammo use, pilot injuries, etc). 

Complaints:
However, there are a few weak points in Battletech. One is the limited terrain for battles. These primarily consist of three types (desert hills, temperate forest hills, and arctic forest hills). There is no flat terrain or urban fighting nor are there even any buildings other than military/ research facilities. Another problem is the game's fairly unimaginative battle scenarios in the career mode. With few exceptions they can be categorized into three types: destroy a group of mechs, attack or defend a facility, attack or defend a convoy. This is the games biggest flaw in my opinion and can make the career portion feel repetitive. Another problem is the difficulty level. The campaign can be extremely challenging to get through. Similarly, on normal settings, you'll likely go bankrupt and lose within a short time playing the career mode due insufficient cash payouts. Fortunately, maxing out you settings fixes these problems. So overall, it's not a terrible problem. 

A few additional minor criticisms, The game makes it very difficult to acquire any of the more classic notable mechs particularly when you reach the Heavy & Assault types (like the Atlas & Awesome). The other complaint is that the game has a very non-intuitive way of building mechs from salvage. It's not explained how to rebuild salvaged mechs anywhere I could find either (btw: it's simply by collecting the proper number of chassis of a specific Mech type).

In summery, despite my list of weaknesses, the game has a lot to offer. I highly recommend Battletech.",1691834033,1691924346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are a fair number of other things which are different than the board game (surprise?), but that's the only truly bothersome thing, IMO.  I'm a hair away from putting mods on here to get some of the classics / unseen mechs.  But so far things are really pretty nice.
Once in a while this crashes without warning - save often - and some tweaking of settings is necessary to put some speed into the battles and travel place to place.  There are still some things which, oddly and mildly annoyingly cannot be further sped or skipped entirely.  But having some of this stuff especially at first is nice for looks.  The artwork and such for the cinematics is somewhat novel and nice.  Audio quality's good on all of the voice actors so far.  Holy moly once in a while there are enemy mechs which just WILL. NOT. DIE. against all odds; but then, that's how the board game went sometimes, too.  Once in a while (and I'm on a rig which way more than passes for running this) Battletech will run inexplicably slowly - lag at the start of a pan and drag too far; that's odd, and I had one scenario where I was sure the game would crash because allied AI turn was taking REALLY long to decide to move, but that all panned-out and only happened on one level so far.  /shrug
So this review's reading like it was written by a coconut.  I'll just close by saying that (1) this is fun and I like it a lot (2) The bad press this got from people upset by being able to pick ""they"" as a gender back when this came out is beyond absurd because it plays exactly 0 part in the game past that one pick, and (3)  I'd recommend this to anyone; just be aware that it's much more like the boardgame than the mech warrior series or even the battletech pc games were in the 90s.

This game was mostly perfect, as far as Anna was concerned. But only just.
Technically there's a lot of polish to adore. A lot more than you'd expect in a MechWarrior game.
And Anna really enjoyed to play the campaine the first time through, also for story (which is standard as far as MW goes but its still pretty good writing). And even the free career can be fun even if there's no story to enjoy.
There's sadly two things that kept Anna from playing this game more. For one, even on a good playthrough, you only play half of the time. As most or all round based games have the issue, there's a lot of waiting and watching your team getting hurt, which drags missions out to an hour easily, even for smaller missions.
And secondly; On her first playthrough, Anna took good care of her pilots and reloaded missions that went south to save dying pilots or broken gear that was important to her. The game expects you to make use of the safe files.
Since on her 2nd playthrough, Anna tried to nuzlock the campaine, and it does not work. When you lost pilots and move on to replace them, the replacement pilots will be recruits and be shitty pilots which most likely die pretty quick too. So you keep replacing pilots, maybe train them with simpler missions, which takes a lot of time, and at some point the missions are too hard for a full squad of recruits and you keep failing missions simply because you lack experienced pilots.
So nuzlocking it doesn't work on the long run. And saving pilots by replaying missions takes a lot of time. We're talking about one hour mission that went wrong, and then another hour to try again. All while half the mission is waiting for enemy turns.

It's sadly not as much fun as it should be. And surely not as much fun the second time around.
However, this game had a place in Anna's heart and she remembered it fondly in her time remaining.",1619567709,1691445604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Though it is obviously geared towards the storyline and themes borrowed from the BattleTech tabletop universe, I believe it to be a great play even for those who are not familiar. For those who are, it does a fantastic job breathing life into an otherwise awesome, armored-combat tabletop. 

There is plenty of fun to be had here, different levels of challenge in Career mode, and an engrossing campaign that is a great introduction for newcomers to the franchise, and those returning to it in a different way. 

With mod support, there are also plenty of ways to add more to an already great base-game. There are quite a few mod communities that continue to support the game, and it makes for an even fresher experience. Especially for those who want a bigger challenge, utilizing the game's simulation mode. 

Customize-able pilots make for an even more immersive experience, (I base mine off of friends), and provide fun little ways of involving others. Making decisions, and role-playing through the experience as the commander of your own mercenary unit. Another fun little thing is that the game offers remote play, enabling you to involve other potential players with real-time decision-making. Splitting up a lance or however you want to imagine it!

In the years since, I have heard very few games, with a saundtrack as good as the intro of the main campaign.

""You know this of course, you were there"".

Punt.

Updated after completing campaign and also adding the DLC:

1) The game mechanics work quite well, though some of the user interface interactions could be more intuitive. This is especially true in the mech repair / refit pages but is generally a problem all over. (update) Generally this improved since then, also the load times when navigating between the various pages seems to have improved

2) Graphics generally OK though not outstanding

3) It really is a mercenary game. Each battle is not about winning, but about minimising the amount of damage (hence cost) you take while winning. (Updated): This is especially true if trying for max score in the career mode. You really have to pick your fights carefully. A massive payout is rubbish if it leaves all your warriors in hospital for a month, or even worse if it costs you some LosTech parts from your mechs.

4) The sountrack (included in the deluxe content) is really beautiful. Very very good. Strong orchestral / synth mix, reminds me a bit of the Deus Ex 3 games, and of similar quality. (""I am not a Hero"" is very nuanced, ""The cost of war"" at the opposite end of the spectrum is really industrial cyberpunk), 

(Updated). Amazing strings. Some of the associated cut scenes really make this stand out, even with their quite simple cartoon style . ""But I am not a hero, no matter what the stories say.... A hero would have sacrificed more... compromised less... A hero would have done better. You know this, of course... You were there."". All perfectly choreographed to the music. Pitch perfect and clear as ethanol. And many with the conflict of the honourable cause or the displaced fanaticism against the cynical mercenary spirit.

But - word to the developers - I wish you had populated the metadata for the mp3 files, which would have made import into a player easier.

5) It's Battletech ! What's not to like ?

So all in all, 8 hours in I am still enjoying this, and I'm pretty sure I'll make it past the 1 hour per euro mark :). (updated) a thousand (!) hours later, will play again at some point.

What the hell is wrong with the missions in this game? Aside from the fact that the difficulty indicator is completely unreliable (I've had 2.5 skull missions that were a literal cakewalk and done in 5 minutes, and 1 skull missions that kicked my teeth in after a 20 minute slugfest), the enemy generation is a complete joke.

Apparently the enemy composition you get when starting any mission for the very first time will NEVER return if you restart the mission or load a previous save. I had a 2 skull ""trap sprung"" contract where the target was a catapult. Due to some bad luck one of my mechwarriors gets killed, so I restart the mission. But instead of the catapult I now only see a griffin as the target. No matter which save from that system I loaded or how often I restarted (50+ attempts!), I never saw the catapult again.

For enemy generation there are exactly two valid options:

1. every time you start the mission you get a new random enemy composition
2. the enemy composition is fixed once the mission is generated in the contract list and doesn't change on reload/restart

Whatever this game does is bullshit.

I have mostly enjoyed my time with this game. However it is difficult to recommend. The game has a great many systems running 'under the hood' and  it makes it difficult to know if you're doing well or not. You can find mechs getting blown apart because you don't know how difficulty is scaled, for example or how cover works.

It's also possible to have sub-optimal builds on your mechs and they struggle in combat. There is very much a compelling core here. It can be fun to play.  The music is excellent and the story is appropriately space-opera-esque.

But, this is a game for either the hardcore, or someone who wants to do their homework. If that's you, have fun. If not, you're best off avoiding Battletech.",1534119349,1688846291,False,3,0,0.477462053298950195,0,True,False,False

The turn based element was a real selling point as I detest real time logistics and you can customise your mech fittings - though not the internals. There's a lot of longevity in the game, both the campaign then career modes.

Now back to - ""WHEN IT WORKS""... That is the problem. In all my days I don't think i've encountered a game so full of bugs, conflicts and memory leaks - even those in beta. The feel of this is like a beta game where the kinks havent all been ironed out yet. Some people will be able to run it perfectly, but others will find it will hard or soft crash several times in a single game, or even on the main ship screen, or just loading. 

There are definite conflict issues with some drivers, and notably some Nvidia graphics cards and sound cards. There are apparent memory leak issues too which even if you can get away with a perfect couple of games will still mean you need to restart your PC at some stage as it eats up your resources. Upgrading from windows 8 to 10 helped somewhat - but mostly I suspect thats only as newer drivers for hardware become available with the newer update. It still resulted in me crashing between 1 to 5 turns into a new game or a re-loaded game (after crashing already).

The DLC's add a few nice post campaign features to the game but also add to the instability in general with new terrain - urban especially - seeming to crash quite quickly.

I'd still recommend buying at least the vanilla game if on sale at 75% off, or if you really love Battletech. Be prepared to spend a good percentage of your logged hours having to re-do matches when you crash out after a few turns. Save often, both in-match and after doing mech upgrades.

EDIT: So all the above is still true, though have now upgraded to a Graphics cards 3 times the required size and this game is considerably more stable.

This game got me into Battletech. One of the finest turn-based tactical battle setups out there. The mechanics are pretty similar to the tabletop with some more computer-y aspects that are streamlined on the table (they both work equally well). 

The downside to the PC version is that there seems to be a bug that will DEVOUR your GPU resources, and that devs are not interested in fixing it, so make sure you bring a fan to the party (or some eggs to scramble on your desktop). 

The other big downside is the creepy uncle Paradox data collection policy. This is pretty standard nowadays (not only for the games themselves, Unreal and Unity do their share of data collection on their own), but as Paradox swallows up strategy game studio after studio I find myself having to reread their privacy policy every time I buy a game to look for slippery additions (or a Klei/Epic-style sale to Fivecent).

It feels very restrictive and barebones.

You just go from planet to planet, kill robots, make money, buy stuff, feel confused every time you attempt to refit a mech, repeat.

The fact that some missions are twice as hard as others of the same difficulty rating also detracts from the experience.

You're not warned of this up front, you have to either find the information yourself (which you don't even know you need to do) or just get your shit pushed in for an hour straight, which still means you have to admit defeat, and then ideally stay as far away from those missions as possible for the rest of your life.

I'd just think of javelin missiles and remember this is the future and no they shouldn't fly through terrain but the idea is they go straight up and come down on their target... petty stuff really. I personally liked the difficulty and the out numbered fights as I didn't find it that difficult at all. I loved how you can customise your mechs with extra armour, different weapons or just moving the ammo away from sensitive areas. I haven't added the dlc yet as it does seem a bit expensive and the new mechs don't seem all that appealing, when you've got a lance of highlanders.

This game is not an amazing Turn-based tactics game, or at least it isn't quite the equal of XCOM. It's not a [i]bad[/i] turn-based tactics game, mind you, but if that is your [i]primary[/i] interest in this game, then you'll probably beat the campaign, not regret buying it, but not like it enough for it to be worth it for you to buy the DLCs or try to get more out of it. I know, because that's exactly what I did when I first played it a few years back.

But I came back to it recently, and I don't know why precisely I came at it differently this time to get what it's better at, but I did, and do you want to know what this game [i]is[/i] that is absolutely worth your money if that's what you're looking for?

A big stompy robot game [i]par excellence[/i], without equal. They are huge. They are chunky and mechanical and they move like monsters the size of buildings. And they are gorgeous and terrible to behold. There is no better big stompy robot game I've ever seen, and the selection (and uses) for them only increases with the DLCs.

As for storytelling: The story it has is fine. Enjoyable. It isn't the morally grey tale that the trailers got my hopes up for- ""If Honor will not sway your mercenary heart, then Let's. Talk. Money."" is beautiful marketing, but not really the vibe the game actually strikes- it works hard to give you personal reasons to choose your side in this conflict, and makes the ethics of it all pretty damn clear-cut, even if the characters involved all feel compellingly flawed.

It's not a must-buy, IMO, I didn't even write a review my first time through because I was pretty middling on it, but now that I came back and [i]got it[/i], it's a delight.",1686434933,1686434933,True,49,0,0.796754837036132813,0,True,False,False

It´s a great game - with some caveats:

- No Endgame - once the campaign is over you can grind for more assault mechs, more lostech weapons, get more 10/10/10/10 pilots. That´s it. The DLCs don´t do much to fix that sadly. Even though they only really come into play AFTER the campaign is over.
- Campaign pacing - if you try to go in unprepared you´ll suffer, like me
- You´re practically required to farm up in the first third of the campaign, get your pilots leveled up, get a bunch of heavy mecs and the last few missions require you to have a full lance of thick assault mechs with a lot of special weapons - so yes it get´s grindy
- Pilot specializations are mostly useless I ended up getting 4 pilots with the extra damage reduction and plus 1 initiative, because all other options are extremely lackluster

BEX, BTA 2062 and RogueTech are all excellent additions to the base game, and include mods that arguably enhance the game's performance (although, they add so much content that it does degrade just a touch as well).  Importantly, they add stuff that is beloved by those who play them.  This is one of only a handful of games I would ever say the mods are what make it worth getting in 2023.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Battletech is a turn-based tactics game that originated in 1984 as a table-top wargame and sparked multiple titles to follow, such as the MechWarrior and MechCommander series. In Battletech, you command a mercenary company and lead a contingent of mechs across the galaxy in the search for answers and glory. Do you have what it takes to stand against the tides of war and prove you are the best company in the universe?

Only time will tell.

    [th][b]🟥 Negatives[/b][/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
    [td]🟩 A well-thought-out gameplay loop that provides limitless fun and experimentation to those willing to seek it out. You manage your company, repair/prepare your mechs and then take them out on contracts for profits, which lets you improve your arsenal.

🟩 Battletech doesn't have the most extensive repertoire of mechs of the franchise, but with all of the DLCs installed, you will have around 50 mechs to own and fight against. These range in the classic styles of light, medium, heavy and assault variants and each chassis provides a vastly different gameplay style from the last.

🟩 A decent quantity of weaponry will allow you to wage your war however you see fit. From short and long-range missiles to energy and ballistic weaponry, that will ensure you are never short on options.

🟩 Gorgeous visuals ensure the gameplay is incredibly immersive as you trudge through snow, sand and jungle on your path to glory. Although not cutting-edge, it is a beautiful experience that will captivate your senses.

🟩 The audio has also been impeccably designed in all its formats here, from voice-acting to the overall atmosphere and even the soundtrack, which is compelling and sombre when required.[/td]
    [td]🟥 The difficulty can be offputting for many players as it does increase rapidly early into the game. This increase gives you very little time to prepare, and if you're not ready for it, it can end your campaign prematurely. [/td]

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as a self-named mech commander who, during a series of unfortunate events, was forced to leave their homeworld while stealing away their ancestral Blackjack and seeking a story of their own amongst the stars. An old mentor from your childhood, Raju ""Mastiff"" Montgomery, discovers you upon his travels and takes you under his wing once again back to his contracted world of Coromodir. And that is where you meet the ruling family, House Arano, and the soon-to-be ruling, Kamea, who is on her way to her coronation.

But things turn to chaos in the blink of an eye. The capital where the coronation was to take place is under attack by Kamea's treacherous uncle, Santiago Espinosa, who has rallied an army against you, Mastiff and Kamea, led by the ruthless and another former student to Raju, who trained beside Kamea, Victoria Espinosa.

It is now years later. You are again left in the wreckage of your life, running a broken and beaten mercenary company, heavily in debt, and with few options left. You must fight hard, win battles and discover some hard truths on the way to proving to the galaxy you are not to be messed with.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[b]Reactor online, sensors online, weapons online. All systems: nominal.[/b]
Most of your time in Battletech will be spent on the battlefield, surrounded by hundreds of tonnes of steel and munitions. So with this in mind, I believe it's necessary to cover combat and movement below.

Combat consists of turn-based actions between you, your allies and the enemy. You use your turns to traverse the expansive battlegrounds or to rain fire upon your foes. Dots on the ground denote where you can move depending on your traversal option, walk, sprint or jump, and the terrain bonuses the location provides.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2975622890

If you find yourself within the range of enemy mech, you can also choose to attack. You have total control over what weapon systems you wish to activate, with heavier weapon attacks building significantly more heat that could result in a shutdown if pushed too far.

[b]Fire and Steel![/b]
Each mech you pilot will differ considerably from the next, and each chassis has different hardpoints for weaponry and accessories that must be taken into account when fitting a mech for war. Some mechs might be better suited to becoming a missile boat and hoarding a lot of short and long-range missile launchers. While other mechs might have more ballistic and energy weapon hardpoints, making them better snipers or in-your-face assault units and many additional variants for specialty tasks.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2975624419

You will also have to take note of your mech's size and capabilities. Some mechs, like the Spider, is considered light mech, capable of faster speed and more traversal options across the field of war but less firepower overall, as opposed to the Atlas, which is an assault class mech, less capable of speed and traversal but packs a lot more armour and weapons to make up for it.

[b]Information is ammunition.[/b]
Lastly, and probably the most prominent aspect of the game, is managing your ship and company. You will spend plenty of time upgrading your ship through various means, dealing with travel events that can occur periodically and that can vastly change your story, and choosing what contracts to take and where best to spend your limited resources.

It is not on the battlefield that most players will discover the difficulty curve. It is here in the administration, determining where and what to spend money on. As you stride into warfare, the bills will continue to rise against you, and if every battle costs you more than you're earning, you can very quickly suffocate beneath it all.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2975622557

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
I want to preface this all by saying that this game is far from cutting-edge, and it isn't going to blow your mind with realistic visuals or physics. It is, however, still captivating despite its decent age and will continue to enthral you as you traverse its expansive and detailed maps for hours on end.

The audio is of a much higher standard than the visuals. The voice acting is impeccable, the atmospheric whir of engines and the environmental ambience still give me pause occasionally, and the overall combat audio is remarkable. So much so that missile impacts sound like they hurt to the point where I was gritting my teeth with each hit.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
I played Battletech with settings as high as they go at a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and had little to no issues during my entire campaign.
RAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 33%)
CPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 14.3%)
GPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 31%)

[h1]Final Thoughts - Very Good[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
While Battletech is probably not the best turn-based strategy game on the market, or even the best of the franchise available, it still provides a very complete and thoroughly enjoyable experience for both new and veteran players. It will take some time to overcome the steep difficulty curves and learn the large amounts of details required to perform adequately on the field. But when you understand it, it will captivate you wholeheartedly. Battletech is a fantastic game that should be with or without a sale.

second, you cannot use ""GUN"" and you will not find ""GUN"" or ""missile pod"" on regular modification. so its feel wrong... everything has a template

third, you cannot have better advantage on close combat shooting, even if you have only 2 tiles far than enemy, you still miss when shooting, even a child can shoot a man from 2 tiles without a miss

The story is a standard political/betrayal then war but done quite well, with interesting characters. Gameplay and battles are absolutely fun. There are story scenarios that you can do when available, at your leisure, and random contracts for different factions. There is occasional repeat in the random missions but more than enough variety to keep boredom at bay if you choose to grind hard.

The story missions shine. They are unique, challenging and fun even when I fail and have to repeat. 

The mechs... ahhhhh the sweet sweet mechs. Tons of options and variety with some absolute big beefy boys to pilot. Can genuinely have multiple unique mechs with unique pilots (although they can max all skills with very little grinding, which was nice) but the mech structures and equipment options make the game.

I can easily recommend this at full price.

It showed promise. I was hoping it would be at least as good as MechCommander or MechCommander 2.
I suppose the devs are too young to have played those two older games. Much less Crescent Hawk's Revenge.
Invariably, your work will be compared to its predecessors. And those who paid for your game do expect a better game compared to products of 90s technology. 
The graphics are definitely better, as they should be. Sadly, that's just about the only positive.
I can overlook the long loading times, the unbalanced scenarios, the essentially uninspiring main storyline. 
The deal breaker is the single lance limit. There really is no point in playing beyond the first few scenarios if you are forced to just use the heaviest mechs you can get. Absolutely no fun in it. A large part of enjoying the Battletech universe is the variety of the mechs, made even more diverse by customization and specialization. A combined arms approach allows for experimentation in strategies. And success is much more deeply satsfying.
Maybe I can get back into this and even cough up more dough for the other DLCs if you could rework this to allow at least two more lances.
As it stands, I totally regret spending money on this. I should have just invested in those guys trying to make the old MechCommander games work on the newer operating systems.

I have come back to the game. Thanks to the modding community, Battletech is now, actually, a good game to play.

[b]TLDR:[/b] Great entry into BattleTech/MechWarrior universe, but as a game its extremely niche and slow paced. There are games that do turn-based tactics better and a lot faster, but if you really want your giant mech fixings, its probably the best intro into the franchise and a good starter for anyone interested in the universe. I would recommend.

I have only recently gotten into BattleTech and MechWarrior. I was not prepared for the dense amount of lore this series has. Honestly, BattleTech as a franchise checks a lot of boxes. Giant scrappy mechs duking it out on the field of battle, in a grimdark future of space where mankind has conquered the stars (no xenos for you 40kers out there). Noble Houses and intrigue equivalent to GoT? Lost technology in an age of technological stagnation? A long history of wars and eras to play in? Yeah, BattleTech hits hard. It isn’t totally unfriendly for casuals in the way 40k can be, but it’s the perfect entry for people who want to get into tabletop wargames. 

If you aren’t familiar with anything BattleTech or MechWarrior related, you pilot the clunkiest tanks on legs in a densely written universe. Each pilotable Mech is divided into different weight classes in tonnage, from lights to the heaviest of heavies, each with their own variants. Lighter mechs are typical scouts while anything bigger is the equivalent of a Metal Gear and mobile suits with more guns. Okay enough of the tabletop. How’s the game?

There are two parts to BattleTech game: the overworld and the combat missions. The overworld is the base management, traversal portion of the game where the combat missions are where you play most of the game.

The combat missions play like your typical turn-based tactics game. You take simultaneous turns with enemies and initiative is rolled depending on the weight of your mechs. Lighter mechs go faster than heavier ones (who knew?). You could go dead last with a group of heavies and get pummelled by the lighter mechs only to one shot the weaker light mechs when your turn rolls over. Where light mechs have speed, if you field a Lance (the term for a group of 4 mechs) of Mediums to Assaults, you’ll win often. In this game, bigger means better. You can individually target parts of mechs, from legs to arms and torsos. If either the head, center torso or both legs are destroyed, your mechs go down.

If you want to grasp the game’s mechanics fast the campaign serves as the main tutorial. Once you play it, everything else becomes relatively easy to pick up. The base building/management portion of this game is also interesting and super easy to understand. You hire MechWarriors to pilot your mechs. Each MechWarrior can be levelled up to give them positive abilities in game. Pilots can be injured in battle and be killed if the cockpit is hit. There is permadeath so be careful. You can also upgrade your mobile mercenary base, upgrade your mechs with better weapons or give them more armor, or bigger badder mechs, and become the best mercenary company in the Periphery. Its pretty simple and fun. Now this would be a glowing review, but I do have a few gripes.

The biggest complaints I have are:
[u]You can only field 1 lance, and that’s such a shame.[/u] By the time you hit the late game you’ll be swimming in mechs, but you’ll only ever have 4 on the field. Though I understand why (in universe), but having a 5th mech or something would really help a lot. Some of the campaign missions where you’re getting jumped by +2 Lances at the same time as your mission objectives, could have used an extra mech to make the campaign or career mode feel less sluggish. Either that or I’m trash and I don’t mind admitting that.

[u]Pacing is very slow.[/u] The game feels [i]slow[/i], and I mean that. I don’t mind a lot of the overworld star chart navigation and upgrading your mobile base, but combat takes it sweet time. It will really feel slow when you start doing the harder missions. On average missions take at least 10 turns. I know, you’re using big bulky mechs and slamming into clunkier mechs, but the turn fatigue might get to you mid mission and make you want to quit altogether.

[u]RNG can be painful.[/u] Sometimes you’re not hitting on 95% accuracy (thems the breaks), on a lucky shot sometimes ammo explodes in your mech killing your pilot. The game gets hard and if your dice rolls aren’t doing well, you’ll lose everyone and lose the paycheck. It’s not for everyone so if you rage quit, its understandable. This review is running a little long, so I’ll wrap it up.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
BattleTech is great, but it does have some flaws. The flaws being its slow, quite difficult to pick up at first, and sometimes a slog. If you can look past it and give BattleTech a try, its hard, but its fun. It’s a competent mech tactics/management game. [b] I fully recommend it. [/b]

Though I haven’t tried, I hear the modding scene for this game adds more and ups the quality of the game by miles. You’ll be replaying it for a long time after you’ve finished it.",1683295675,1683457134,True,43,2,0.80542147159576416,0,True,False,False

Too Much Grind for solo game. 
You need WEEKS of real time of boring grind to achieve anything and scrape resources for upgrade. Get bored very fast of repetitive missions and dump the game. 
Such basis works for multiplayer online FTP game with friends (yes like MWO), but not working for solo game, ain't have months to spend here.
(+) 
got universe (pretty much pointless like in MWO)
got mechs, LOTS of them.
can build each one as you want like in MWO (except swap engines)
rts/tabletop elements works 80% of time (good already)
(-)
Mediocre repetitive side missions (like 6-8 types of them)
Mediocre main story
LOOOOOTS of grind 

Your life here like:
Spend min 20m real time to complete mission. Receive average 1 mil CBL's for mission (+/-). If lucky spend at least 300+ for repairing damaged arms/legs/torsos. If not lucky spend 600+ for replacing blown off arms/legs/torsos/destroyed weapons. Aaaaaand average heavy mech price around 9-14 millions CBL's. You can calculate your time you'll have to spent here.  

Yes I've played old battletech games. Yes I've played MWO for Years. This game clearly has the influence of developer - transfer lots from MWO, good fun with building mechs, but also lot of boring repetitive grind and mindless missions. Love mechs but for building them and grinding for new parts and new Mechs I can go in MWO. At least playing with real people there is fun. 
Good basis but way too much elements forced into this game that are not working well together. Please - solid story, based of fraction or two, focus on few mechs and hero pilots stories.

Worse than fighting a frakkin Jade Falcon Assault Star. ALL the time. Locusts that kill Shadowhawks. JENNERS that can survive 2 PPCs to the face.

Most battles and the combats within are absurdly drawn-out attrition skirmishes, whittling away at enemy armor to be able to damage components inside. You have to do this with the same handful of ranged weapon types. There aren't really any weapons that feel designed to directly disable or one-hit mechs. You can melee attack, but don't have any actual specific melee weapons. So expect most battles to be drawn out battle porn, for no reason other than to maintain (as I understand it) a parity with the canon of the Battletech tabletop game. You'd think that because the game is heavily based around salvaging defeated mechs and refitting them for your own use, there would be melee combat options, some sort of weapon designed specifically to kill an enemy pilot and leaving the mech around them relatively intact.  Or ways to disable a mech, like an electrical weapon, or an entanglement for the legs. Or some sort of netting to screw with accuracy. These options, if they exist in the tabletop game, don't exist here. It requires, IMO, too much suspension of disbelief.

Edit: I dunno. Original review was pretty bad. Definitely still annoyed that the developers are so focused on a specific methodology of play.

Well worth the money 

A unique  turn based experience rather then a large group of units to agonize over Battletech gets you 
in the setup choosing how best to optimize your 4 person lance and giving you the intrusive thoughts 
How many missile's can i cram in a single mech? do i  [i] really [/i] need all those heatsinks? and letting your 
creations play out in challenging missions. speaking of challenge the full campaign gives a solid ebb and flow 
outside of a few choice missions you should have no issues as in between missions you are set free to go wherever 
until a new story mission is ready and then you can tackle it whenever you choose letting you build up gear.
Missions last anywhere from 10-30 minutes depending on engagements with a good stock of side objectives 
and overall variance combined with differing atmospheres makeing every mission enjoyable.


The rough bits 
==> Performance is a bit slow the game can take forever to load at times due to a
unfixed memory leak  for me it only becomes a issue after a few hours and rarely had the game outright 
crash because of it [b] however your mileage may vary [/b]
 urban biome's are the worst for it noticeably increasing the AI decision delay. 

==>On the topic of AI decision delay on large missions with multiple aggro'ed lances 
the delay can become quite annoying ranging from 15-40 seconds often i find myself 
with a quick short input thing to do on the side to alleviate it 

======BONUS======= 
This game includes Mod support! 
Often greatly increasing the replay-ability of a game it fits here quite well [b] however [/b]
>most good mods are not on steam its not a deal breaker but workshop integration is by far and away the most convenient 
and safest feeling option. Of note you have 3 major overhauls in the form of Rougetech, BTA 3062 and BE;X in order of most 
to least complex ( I've only done BTA 3062 highly recommended)
=>This does bring performance back into the limelight often times doubling the waits but if your patient and/or have something 
in the background it becomes a minor (yet still annoying) point. 

_____________________________________________________________________
    Bottom line 
Solid tactics style game worth its asking price with enough content to last multiple playthrough's 
if possible get the DLC's on sale they add a somewhat decent bit of game play however are 
arguably steep  at regular pricing for what they add. Mod support overhauls and greatly expands 
for those who really enjoy it.

Lets not forget also a Spider that was able to get behind me and land two critical hits in the back as well on another one of my mechs, crippling me from the get-go. But I somehow miss nearly every attack I try throwing at the shadowhawk when it has zero evasion. But, when my Spider has nearly max evasion with a full sprint, a scorpion tank was able to land a perfect back shot. Not to mention, when I doubled back to the drop point (as the mission requires), the ambush from your employers was just as bullshit, where the turrets and tanks were landing nonstop hits, and I somehow couldn't land so much as five shots.

Still hate this game. Unbelievably unfair where the hit percentages are totally stacked against you.

Not a 1:1 adaptation of the Battletech tabletop game, but the darn closest I've ever seen done in a video game! The only two complaints I have are: 1) that the missions are always restricted to a single lance, and I'm not sure why, since the game engine can clearly support much more than that. It makes the strategic and tactical choices quite limited and narrows the play experience considerably from what would otherwise be possible, as a single lance mission has a different feel from a full company deployment. and 2) The escort mission AIs are frikkin retarded, and sometimes (though rarely) seem to get stuck and refuse to move even when there is a viable path.

EDIT: Complaint 3, which is an addendum to 1, is that the later missions ramp up the difficulty primarily by throwing more and more enemies at you, rather than smarter enemies. At a certain point you are outnumbered and out-gunned by 3:1 at times, which just becomes silly when you KNOW there will be 8 to 12 enemy mechs/tanks fielded but you can still only bring... 4.

MY LIKES
- Character creation, reading the brief lore of the centuries of history

DISLIKES
- Tutorial is unfinished, and no attempt was made to actually explain game features - you know, the whole purpose of a tutorial. There is NO MANUAL. 
- Characters introduced were so bland and generic I was shaking my head in irritation. 
- Artwork was very cartoon like, like something you could draw in 2 minutes with watercolors, it looks very cheap. Anytime I see a painted picture instead of a cut scene for a game's intro, I instantly know the game is cheap and get disappointed. At least make it a good picture! Instead, it looks like something a child can draw.
- Movement of mechs is painfully slow. You must wait while everyone moves at a snail's pace, and no viable way to speed up movement, only to cut down on ""cut scenes"" - but that doesn't seem to reduce time spent in game.
- The artificial time sinks added to make your game play last longer. Everything you do takes forever and a day. Every time you fire your weapons, the game loses focus on your mech, so you have to tab/click on your mech every time. Every movement or fire there's a bunch of beeps and..""guess what, its the end of a turn!"" card is announced.
- There is still no mini map. 
- I played MechWarrior 2 for Win (1995) and recall it fondly and the original tabletop BT/MW in early 1990s, I IMMEDIATELY LOVED those games, within minutes of playing them. For this BT I got the exact opposite feeling from the moment the first images and cheesy voices appeared: I groaned inwardly and said ""not again"". 

And all this in 2 (update: 11) hours of play. I see no way it gets better (it won't!).

What a waste of money and time. I've got better things to do than play this. It's like they didn't play test their own game or (more than likely, because I have to think they loved the game they made) they just ran out of money.

UPDATE 2023: I tried the game again, and put a few more hours into it. The game's graphics are much better, at least I had no frame rate issues using a SSD w/latest graphics card. However, nothing else was changed. You have to play multiple missions during the story mode, with no chance at repairing your mechs between said battles; I got to the drop ship after fighting for many hours in real time, only to spend my entire million credits on repairs. Then I get hit with a 300,000 credit/month bill while I'm waiting for my repairs to finish, i.e. I'm broke before I get to do anything. So, I started a new campaign, had to sit through the annoyingly slow introduction - only for Mastiff's mech to be completely open with the first shot, making his mech useless for all future combats so I had to start over...again.

Character portraits are, for the most part, passable, but, not great.
Mech choices are egregiously horrible.   I have fought more than one battle, mind you this is in the Southern portion of the Inner Sphere/Periphery, and Spiders are common.  2-3 per battle.  What the heck?   No.  Spiders should be VERY rare in this area.
Variant Mechs are just ridiculous in their numbers.   I don't mind running into Locust Ms, as Marik space is right here, but, it gets downrigh silly when you are running into Steiner, and Kurita, versions of Mechs.
The limit of one lance to command is, at this point, just annoying.
The trope, which seems to be the starting point of EVERY Battletech game, is ""poor pitiful you, your house was overthrown.  Get a bunch of Mechs and get it back.""   Good lord, there are so many possible origins to work from.   Down on your luck Merc Unit, aka Wilson's Hussars.   Regular Merc Unit that has survived on gravy security missions, perhaps with Mechs in passable, but, not so great shape.   Regular Merc unit that has just been rotated off a front line.   Similar to above, but, perhaps with empty Lance slots.   A House Unit.  An Elite Unit.   A Unit that has had a run of good luck, perhaps with better than average pilots, and plenty of gear/spares.    All sorts of things, but, noooooooooooooooo....Every bloody game.   Sorry, but, that just gets old, the same way the ""Chosen One"" trope seems to be the common thread in Fantasy.
As for the rest...
I quite like the Contract system.   Again, not sure why Kurita is a factor in Taurian space, but, I think that goes back to the Mechs that populate the game inappropriately commonly.  The ability to sacrifice Money, or Salvage, in order to boost the other is quite fun, and allows one to tip the Payment to what you need at that time.
Not sure about the Argo.  The same thing could have been achieved with a Union, or Overlord, Dropship.  But, it doesn't completely destroy immersion.
The general mechanics of the game have flaws, but, not so devastating that they break the enjoyment of playing.

Overall, I would say that this game has a LOT of rough edges, that a little bit of extra effort on the part of the Devs could have been ironed out without changing the overall approach to the game.   Those rough edges, however, are not so great as to cause me to cast this game off to the rubbish, like another Mech title I could name.    The play is fun, and challenging.   The Modding Community isn't as robust as some other games I have played, but, it is still pretty strong, and creative.

+ It is turn-based.
+ It has mechs.
+ Sound and music are quite decent.

- Dated graphics.
- No overwatch system.
- Terrible economy mechanic. You gotta pay 300+K for expenses and salaries every month. If you don't have the money, you go bankrupt (game over). Missions pay 100-500K. Serious damage (based on RNG) on a mech can cost you upto 300K. The repair time for the mech is a month. New mechs cost 750K-3+Mil. Pilot injury can put a pilot in recovery for 2-3 months. Hiring another pilot is 25k-35k plus their monthly salary of 25-35K every month. Shops buy stuff from you at almost 1/10th the market value. I mean if I were to actually run a mercenary business in that kind of an economy, I would seriously consider another line of work where I can actually make a decent profit.
- Bugs that often force you to Alt+F4 and redo missions.
- Absurd difficulty spikes because of the RNG.

Make no mistake, it's fun up to a point, but beyond the ways this bends the general Battletech ruleset to keep things streamlined, the typical pace of both Campaign and Career mode is an absolute slogfest that will see you shackled to the same handful of Lights and Mediums for in-game years before you can move up in weight class.

This normally might not be such a problem if it weren't for the fact that the way the game bends the Battletech ruleset tends to heavily favor weight class and tonnage over something like BV (Battle Value, the way unit point costs are tallied up in tabletop).  This too might get a pass if it weren't for the absolutely baffling profile of some of the equipment and specifically the entire suite of Autocannons which are woefully lacking on their damage per ton compared their fearsome output in both the Mechwarrior (FPS) games, and the tabletop. 
 Autocannons instead are given extra ""stability"" damage which can knock a mech over - great if it weren't for the fact you can get far more stability damage from the typical LRM rack at vastly superior ranges while staying safe from direct fire.

The tonnage problem just gets worse as the typical campaign or career slogs on, as lights on higher level missions are all but useless due to the amount of armor you need to chew through (even hitting rear armor), or the fact that objectives do not typically reward fast-movers or pure hit-and-run objectives where a fast-moving light can stack up loads of evasion while capping.  There may be some objectives like this - but oftentimes the volume and firepower of the units on the board (a half dozen turrets, easily 4-5 Heavies, and a few Assaults just for good measure) just make it borderline suicidal to pack lights when you can bring Archers, Stalkers, an Atlas, or even better: something like a Battlemaster loaded with nothing but lasers - which again, this game seems to heavily favor over most other builds.

Generally unless you really like the Battletech universe or you enjoy XCOM-type play, I wouldn't get this.

Additionally you can go through the process of trying to get RogueTech running, which is nearly a total conversion mod that drastically alters the game and in a way brings it closer to something like the tabletop - or at least it immensely expands the units you'll see to include aircraft and whatnot.",1682281785,1682281785,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Buy it on a discount.
The game provides you a meditative gameplay, with some nicely written campaign.
Difficulty is adjustable, yet the only thing it actually changes is amount of grind you have to go through to finish the campaign.

Pros:
- those are BATTLE MECHS! How don't you want to play with them
- there is a playground of making new loadouts, trying new mechs and so forth
- the plot is not bad, and you are even finding interesting following it

Cons:
- variety of missions is small, as well as the sizes of the maps. All the missions could be described as 2 types:
a) kill 8 enemy mechs
b) kill 8 enemy mechs before they do something (base capture, escape, e.t.c.)
- there is a variety of mech units, though you will find out very fast that most of them are useless and all the same shit, while some of them are incredibly effective (which kinda kills your sandbox vibe)
- gameplay becomes boring very fast (you repeat the same actions from a fight to a fight on the same mech loadout)
- a lot of balance problems (basically coming from a tabletop system. It was never perfect)
- all the DLCs are garbage never buy them

Still, despite all the the drawbacks the game is nice way to chill on evenings through a week, and there are not many battlemech system games nowadays, so if you are a fan, you should check it out.
Game does not worth the full price, but on a discount it is okay to buy it and play it.

Main downside are bugs which force you to restart a mission. This was also the reason I eventually uninstalled the game. A mission wanted me to download data in as specific location, but I couldn't get to that spot because apparently in an earlier version of the game there was a rock, not a small base located which still blocks the way. This led to me failing the mission. This is just one example, had a few other bugs before that.

I also had that weird sound bug that didn't play any voice audio during the whole game. I mean at least they could have fixed that bug? I checked forums for a fix, but apparently they never bothered to fix that problem.

It is good. After you tire of the vanilla get BTA3062 ( a lot of people also recommend Rouge Tech)

Game-play- This is what keeps me coming back. Plays a lot like XCOM but uses a hex system instead of squares. There is a  reasonable amount of customization in the base game to play with but you will want mods to really get them the way you want them. You have to manage your pilots and mechs to keep them in good shape. Also your company finances. Do not go bankrupt.

Story- A good war tale nothing insane but not bland. A decent cast of characters that don't feel to flat given how much of the game doesn't involve them at all. 

DLC- If you put over 30-40 hours in this the DLC is worth it. Especially FLashpoint. It adds several ""mini-campaigns"" where the decisions you make will matter. Both in that series of missions and during events later.

Graphics/sound- This was never a big deal for me so... I did mute the music after a while and listed to something else.

The most people you can ever field is 4, every mission you get make you fight at least 8, sometime 12.
So you are always outnumber & outgunned. Battlefield is small, there is a bug that make enemy reinforcement appear with enemy force so enemy gang up on you together. 

it seem the game like to put you in a disadvantage location in each mission so if you go straight toward the mission objectives you always get surrounded and get pepper by missile all side.

For these reason there are no reason to use anything other than your heaviest mech. You HAVE to build you lance for maximum defense in order to survive what the game throw at you. Annnnnd this greatly restrict how you play your game.

Maybe I prefer this game, because I'm a geriatric grognard who started playing the tabletop game in the late 80s? But me being an old fart who lost his reflexes some time during the turn of the millenium can't be the answer, because MW5 comes with an aiming aid ...

For those who don't know, both games take place in the same universe, which started its life as a tabletop game with miniatures, which has existed for the last 40 or something years. And it's perfect. Don't believe me? What if I told you that the rules haven't changed all that much in that time (when we disregard WhizKid's attempt at changing the 'Mechs fusion with steam-powered engines or something like that – hey, I never said I played the game for all this years, and I prefer to remain ignorant about most of that era). Sitting down today in front of a hex map with four 'Mechs and a paper print-out for each of them is pretty much the same experience it has been all those decades ago. The 'Mechs are lumbering behemoths that constantly overheat, because you insist of firing your eight medium lasers on auto. Or they're paper thin race cars with inadequate weaponry, being only a nuisance to their larger cousins.

I'm only half kidding with that last part. See, the tabletop has room for all 'Mechs, big and small. The smaller ones are nimble and hard to hit, easily outmaneuvering their larger opponents and striking them in the far lighter armored rear. This is not really possible in this here game, and that's my first criticism. I'll always take the four heaviest 'Mechs I can get my greasy fingers on and park them in some woods. On the tabletop, that'd make me harder to hit, a poor but comparable substitute to running around like a headless chicken, which you'd prefer if only your 100 ton 'Mech wasn't as slow as a one-legged WW2 veteran who died three decades ago; in this game, it simply reduces the enemy's attack power – bundle that with one of the skills your MechWarriors can aquire, and the enemy's rockets merely sting you like already sated mosquitos.

Speaking of which, this game adds stability, which sounds fine on paper: you hit the opponent with something of substance (lasers need not apply), and sooner or later their 'Mech will topple over. Sounds reasonable enough. Coupled with the fact that a downed 'Mech is an easy target you can precisely circumcise from a distance (something that actually is part of the tabletop game), this can be easily exploitable: with a certain amount of missiles strapped to your 'Mechs, you're able to reliably down at least one enemy 'Mech per turn. That poor sucker also loses a step on their initiative, more or less guaranteeing you a free round of shooting at that now helpless sucker.

So the game's not perfect. But is it fun? My 600+ hours scream YES, YOU IDIOT. And I guess I deserve that, rambling for like half an hour for no other reason than to flex my geek cred, thanks for coming to my performance.

If you like big robots (and I know you do) and are not averse to turn-based games, get it, you know you want to. If your fingers are itching to burn some fools with your PPC, by all means, get MechWarrior 5 instead. But if you want to know what it's like to command a 'Mech mercenary company, this here game is way better at that. For the full experience, give the tabletop game a try. Not only is that game lacking the aforementioned flaws, it can, if you're so inclined, go way, way (way!) deeper. And broader. It's truly glorious. But only if you want it to be, it can also be simpler. This here game is a satisfying approach to that mindboggling monstrosity.

Final note: The expansions are more or less optional. The one thing that might meaningfully enhance your experience are the Flashpoints, story-based collections of missions (being introduced by the expansion of the same name, but all expansions include more of them).

that being said, i myself typically have a disdain for topdown turnbased games. but of the few hours ive sunk into this game its already made me fall in love with it, the mechs feel rewarding and the combat awe inspiring, while time skipping is arguably a pain in the ass, the lack of need to repair non destroyed mechs between missions is quite nice to enjoy coming from MW5.

WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?
short answer? no. the learning curve is horridly steep, the tutorial fails to teach you many of the games mechanics.

SHOULD YOU PLAY THIS YEARS LATER?
short answer? yes. i whole heartedly believe this game is still worth its price tag, and the graphics and engine still hold up to todays standards. (mostly) 

BEGINNER FRIENDLY?
No. this is certainly a game that unless you have some idea of what youre getting into you should probably go play MechWarrior 5 or MechWarrior Online S7 first, to get more comfortable with the mechanics and core values of this game.

LORE?
yeah the lore is great so far. 

DIFFICULTY?
7/10
missions can very quickly turn from an easy curbstomping and cake walk to, ""oh holy shit where the hell?"" and your entire lance of mechs being pieced apart in only 3 or 4 turns.

If you ever enjoyed the board game Battletech, this game is for you. It is a fairly faithful rendition of the board game, minus all the physical dice rolls. That being said, the ""randomness"" of the board game is still here, such as doing a jump-jet drop on an enemy mech and blowing out both your mech's legs by accident. A hilarious and expensive error. 

The game is slow and extremely tactical (Much like the board game version!) 

This game is not for someone expecting a fast paced Mechwarrior or MechCommander game of old, this is Battletech. Not Mechcommander. This IS NOT AN RTS. 

Game is great, I have not encountered any of the performance issues or glitches others have encountered. I recommend installing the game on an SSD as well, loading times can be a bit long otherwise.  

This game is absolutely everything I wanted it to be when I saw ""Battletech"" on the title. As someone who played a lot of the board game once upon a time, this is a great sit down and enjoy game.

Major issue i have with it is that they stick so close to the Lance rules. During the whole game you will never be able to deploy more than 4 mechs at once, which to me gets old and boring. I own so many cool mechs that i wanna send and i can only choose 4 per mission? We should be allowed a second lance late in the game. 

When you only get 4, you have to bring the toughest. You cant bring any more light medium mechs cuz they get crushed too fast. Heavy and Assault only and that gets boring. 

Still fun though for the 40 hours i gave it. Worth the money. The non-combat parts of the game are pretty amazing actually.

I love turn-based strategy RPGs, and Harebrained Schemes made one of my favourite turn-based games of all time (Crimson Steam Pirates). I also got hooked on Front Mission recently, which made me even more excited to play this other take on mech-based warfare.

So why the negative review? Well, as someone who usually enjoys complex games with deep mechanics, I found this one to be completely inaccessible. The in-game tutorials are woefully inadequate, either not explaining important things or waiting until after you needed the information to explain it (ie. not explaining 'called shots' or 'heat' until after you've played multiple missions where you would have encountered these mechanics multiple times).

I thought that such a complex game must have some sort of instruction manual. After all, the aforementioned Front Mission included a 47 page manual (for Nintendo DS) so I could jump straight into the game feeling like I had full control over every action I took in battle and/or while customing my squad. However, there were no manuals for Battletech on Paradox's website or on the Steam library page. I Googled it and found a ""Beta Backers' Manual"" that explained some things, but I was told by another user that it was extremely out-of-date. Another guide that was recommended in the forums (and written by one of the devs) was also called out-of-date by at least one user, and I also found that it didn't explain everything that I wanted to know. Some Steam users recommend checking the 'Guides' section of the Community Hub, but there are 59 guides just for 'Gameplay Basics' with no way of knowing which ones are the most up-to-date and definitive ones for new players. There' no official, definitive document that's been written and curated by the developers themselves that I'm aware of.

You may think that I'm just complaining about a problem that only affects me, but if you look into this you'll see a large number of topics on Steam, Reddit, GameFAQs etc of people asking if this game has a manual. So clearly this is something that affects a lot of people.

From the stuff I've seen, it seems like a lot of the people who enjoy this game either have some knowledge of the tabletop game's rules or have been involved with this game's development for a really long time (in the sense that they got the Beta Backer's Manual and then got to read patch notes about all the new or altered features as they were added), and that's perfectly fine. But for a brand new player in 2023 who doesn't have that prior knowledge, I have no idea how you're supposed to overcome this game's learning curve and develop the kind of skill level that comes from knowing all the mechanics and intricacies inside-out.

Let me be clear: deep, complex games with tons of menus and numbers and HUD bars are great, and I've played many games like this in the past. But they're only great if there's a reliable way of learning how they work and how to play them at a high skill level. When I play games like this, I need to feel like I'm 'in control of my fate' instead of just guessing what I'm supposed to be doing, or which stats I'm supposed to be upgrading, or who I'm supposed to be recruiting, or which parts I'm supposed to be buying, etc. Fumbling around in the dark in the hope of stumbling across the required information (on Google and in-game) is frustrating, not fun.

And the most frustrating thing about all this is that the game itself is not that bad. The graphics and sound are great, the story is interesting, and the bits and pieces of gameplay that I could figure out are genuinely intriguing. But the sheer lack of explanation ruins the whole experience, especially when (as I mentioned before) I already have a similar mech RPG that explains literally every detail in advance.

If you think this looks like the game for you, then by all means give it a go. But before you do, be aware that the barrier to entry for new players is mind-boggling, and it will take you a hell of a lot longer than two hours (if ever) to figure out exactly how it all works.",1679164547,1679164547,False,8,4,0.479306399822235107,0,True,False,False

BATTLETECH is a series with a long history that had largely passed me by. I've never played the TT version which has been going strong since the 1980s; I'd only briefly played one of the Mechwarrior series which has been drawing rave reviews since the 1990s. I wasn't the core audience for this game when it came out and I was a bit surprised by its steep learning curve and the complexity of its background.

I persevered with the game, and I'm glad I did. It presents a beautifully-made take on the merc-management genre. You take charge of a small-time mercenary outfit specialising in the huge battlemechs which characterise the warfare of the 31st century, operating from a transport spacecraft which you direct around a starmap whose systems provide marketplaces, recruits and lists of jobs to choose from. Jobs involve one or more mech scraps where you'll field a lance (four mechs) against one or more enemy lances, sometimes with vehicular support. The game begins with a campaign intro that gives the chance to learn, rather than teaches, the game's tactics and control system. Subsequent campaign missions appear at intervals on the starmap and in the early game offer important upgrades to area of operations and craft; later pursuit of the campaign is up to the player, though it's sufficiently well-written to make it worthwhile.

It's got an excellent aesthetic for a Kickstarter game. Art and sound design is tasteful and effective. There are several welcome-earworm pieces in the soundtrack besides well-chosen and well-mixed sound effects and voice clips for the mech pilots. Campaign plot is delivered in a mixture of subtitled stills and lightly-animated talking-head sessions which manage to avoid feeling hokey or forced. As usual, the writers had to backflip through some logical hoops to explain the game's context (the debt bit never really made sense) and they mostly do it well, at least well enough that none of it really jars. Some of the dialogues between the political figures driving the campaign are genuinely well-written; there are moments of high drama. No Oscars, but it's satisfying.

Management of crew and mechs is slick and intuitive. The ship is your interface. Its various sections act as panes of options, each with their own section chief to consult and have chats with. Development of pilots and mechs is an involving subgame enhanced by the broadening of your ship's options over time. You can spend hours fiddling with potential loadouts for mechs as the balance between armour, weapons, enhancements, weight limit and heat generation is a fine one. The system's modelled closely on the TT version and feels well-built. It also allows for idiosyncratic ideas which can be made to work, like melee-only mechs or indirect-fire snipers.

The game's battlespaces are genuinely nice places to be. Generally well-lit, the maps are large and rolling with naturalistic hills, ridges and peaks dropping to lakeshores and coastlines in the lowlands. The different biomes (highland, desert, moonscapes, Martian wastes, and so on) are characterful, each presenting its own environmental challenge. You can get a hillwalker's high from some of the alpine forest maps, they look that good. POV is adjustable, though you're usually looking down at an isometric angle, and the map's elements are easy to read. Mech models are as cool as they should be, very detailed and fun to watch in action. The combined effect of visuals and sound effects is punchy - crits will make you wince.

Action system is move and/or fire, with the option of using any or all of a mech's weapons  (providing it has ammo and can handle the heat buildup). Though simplistic, this mechanic is well-implemented; some pilot skills affect the way mechs act, others confer bonuses, all will make a difference on the pitch. It's a game of fine balance which rewards traditional tactical thinking, i.e. concentration of force, usage of cover and concealment, superior positioning. There are no superpower skills, nor really any super-dominant weapons; the game remains gritty throughout. Fistfights between mechs are great fun, and stomping on vehicles is one of the most satisfying things you'll do this week.

The game has its flaws: graphical interactions can make scenery and mechs look toylike; there's not a lot of unit variety beyond the mechs themselves (no aircraft); the campaign's plot overstretches the limits of the tactical game. These are minor issues which shouldn't detract from a great core experience in a very well-considered package. The base game feels complete as it is - DLCs add a decent amount of detail and depth for players who've already spent a lot of hours in there, which is as it should be.

I'd honestly recommend this to anyone who plays games in turns. Get the DLC add-ons to boost the variety a bit and have a great time.",1678813335,1678813335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have not played tabletop myself, but after doing some reading online, it looks _incredibly_ similar. This means, YES, the game does include dice rolls and percentages. If such a thing deters you from playing games this game will not impress. This isn't Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries in other words, the focus is utterly on strategy, careful planning, and resource management. 

What this game does offer is a challenging campaign that will push you, especially if you're not having the best run with salvage. I think the game almost unanimously favors larger tonnage over lighter tonnage, which is a slight bit upsetting for me and my mobility-focused mindset. Long Range Missiles (LRMs) dominate this game pretty heavily due to there being a noticeable lack of Anti-Missile System (AMS) support items. In one mission, I kited a much more powerful kill-team in circles while pelting them with LRMs granted sight at all times thanks to a scout's Sensor Lock. By the time I actually engaged the enemy, they were utterly crippled with barely any frontal armor, and a few alpha strikes blew apart components like flinging rocks at a wet paper towel. This is why I love Griffins.

The battle animations take some time but honestly, I kinda like it. The one thing I had to fix was removing the constant dynamic zoom effects.

There are some interesting tactical and management choices to be made in Battletech. I quite enjoy the level of mech (for missions) and spaceship customisation (for travel and crew development).

Battletech is one of those games that is a bit quirky though. Don't expect a perfectly polished product: you'll have to learn to love the weaknesses that sometimes crop up in the game design. The biggest one being that mission difficulty is essentially scaled through the quantity of opponents you'll face in a mission. That can feel both frustrating and excessively ""cheesy"".

There are 6 individual armor points on each mech (7 if you include the head which I do not). These point have an external armor lifepool and an internal systems life pool. When you attack units or units attack you they can only hit the armor that is facing them. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but typically a unit flanking from a side will only be able to hit your arm or leg on said side. This system adds a deep tactical layer in which the play must not only take into account where you place your units, but which direction they are facing. Taking advantage of the armor system will allow you to greatly extend the life expectancy of your mechs, while letting you focus fire down enemy mech.

The armor system aside, its still a great game that I would strongly recommend to all fans of the TRPG genre. The main story is kinda meh, but the resource management and battles are top notch. The game gives you a way to farm mechs in a non tedious way. There is a nice variety of missions and maps. I would recommend career mode over the story, as it lets you play as an actual merc unit, while still letting you unlock all items that the main story will drag out.

This game actually got me excited about the universe's storytelling potential.

The game made some smart story decisions: setting it in an era before the Clan invasion (let alone the Word of Blake silliness), focusing on a human-scale civil war within a Periphery state rather than on the great houses of the Inner Sphere, and including a few story beats designed to get the player to actually *care* about said civil war. Nihilist/grimdark settings have their place, but I'm glad this game stayed firmly humanist.

This game is certainly not perfect. There's various UI quirks that I found frustrating, and UI responsiveness (let alone framerate) really suffers on certain maps. One of the later story missions (with heavy rain, though I don't know if that effect was the cause) required me to drop all graphics settings to minimum, and even then, simple actions like dialogue boxes and toggling weapons on/off took several seconds longer than on other maps. If it wasn't a turn-based game, that mission would be unplayable.

Dialogue trees with the crew aren't as deep as NPC dialogue trees in Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and aside from their quirky commentaries on various ship upgrade options, I rarely got a sense of their personality. Mechwarriors have even less personality, beyond whatever set of in-combat voice lines they happen to be assigned. Their biographies are usually a fun read though.

While the story missions do a good job presenting varied challenges and incentivising different loadouts, the same can't be said for the randomly-generated non-story missions. They quickly get repetitive and generally aren't flavoured to suit the faction offering them. In the lategame, low-difficulty contracts dry up and tonnage limits are rare, so there's little incentive to keep more than a couple of light/medium mechs readied.

However, that all said, I enjoyed the tactical gameplay far more than Shadowrun: Dragonfall (which has its own annoying UI quirks despite its much lighter hardware requirements), and I developed nearly as strong an emotional attachment to my dropship crew as I did to the Dragonfall's odd little anarchist Berlin neighbourhood. If you're a fan of turn-based tactics, hard (ish) SF settings, or stompy robots, this is definitely worth playing.

Found a fix for the crash - its essentially a broken OpenSSL implementation shipped with the game that the devs never bothered to update, seems same issue affected MWO. To fix it insert this to your Launch Options:
cmd /c ""set OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x20000000 && %command%""

While actual info from Intel states only 10th and 11th gen processors are affected it fixed my 8th gen woes too), official Intel reference:

The good: the combat is fun and I liked trying to own all the different mechs, like a pokemon collection. The art and music are fantastic. The story was pretty good, but I never finished it.

The bad: The main reason I stopped playing and never finished the story is the battles get repetitive. There's not near as many options in combat like XCOM 2, which is a very similar game.

There are also several little things in this game that irked me. The freakishly long cutscene you have to skip everytime you boot up the game. The meaningless dialogue options. Sometimes general numbers are used instead of percentages, with no explanation of what they mean (eg. +2 defense). How you have to sift through all the mech parts to find the full mechs you own in storage. There are filters by tonnage, but there's not a way filter by completed mech.

One big one for me, is the ballistic weapons (AC/2, AC/5, AC/10, AC/20) are well known in the community for being so unbalanced, none of them are ever worth equipping. In any scenario. They're way too heavy and the damage per ton is terrible. That's a whole 1/4 weapon category wiped out, 1/3 of any weapons with standard+ range. I ended up editing the JSON files with a text editor and dropping the tonnage to 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 respectively, making them much more viable. I find it hard to believe the developers haven't fixed this after almost 5 years.

Again, the game was good, I did play for 90 hours. But I would've put in another 90 if there were more options in combat and the minor issues were addressed.",1676894811,1676894811,True,5,0,0.591240882873535156,1,True,False,False

But surviving even on normal is a grind. You have to do tons of easier missions while you build your rep in order to get the better paying missions which takes a long time as well. Even after getting your hands on some heavy mechs, you can still get jumped in a mission that is supposed to be easy and end up losing a pilot because the AI smartly will target one mech and fire everything they have at them just like you do to them.

I've only been playing around 50 hrs and I've focused almost entirely on the story missions which are even more difficult than non-story missions. I found the best tactics are take one mech of your lancer team and configure them to scout by putting upgrades for visibility. Use long range attacks to soften or just annihilate your enemy before they can make contact with you.

Story missions can screw that tactic up because they will shoehorn you into pinch points that you can't flank or give you unrealistic goals that don't seem attainable. Luckily, you can drop the difficulty rating down to help with this. Or you can make the game unwinnable, at least in my eyes anyway.

Maps and missions do repeat if they aren't the main story in campaign, just be aware of that going in. If you don't have time or don't like grinding, this isn't the game for you. But it is a great mechwarrior type game and all the classic mechs are here. 

Tip: make certain you gain access to the black market, because you can purchase complete mechs there instead of mech parts to assemble a complete mech. You pay an inflated price for them, like an atlas costs 30 million and parts of an atlas cost a fraction of that. When you are only making 2million for a top tier mission max and most of the time you only bring in about 300-500k for a good mission plus whatever you get from the scrap on the battlefield. 

It is fun, but it is one of the more hardcore tactical turn based games I've ever played.  Just be aware and you'll have fun. If you find yourself getting frustrated, its time to take a break and play something more forgiving.",1676680245,1676680245,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Losing pilots to unlucky explosions, slogging through the early game in little mechs, twisting and turning as you run from an enemy so they can't hit your vital wounded areas, etc. It all feels worth it as you build out bigger and better mechs, fitting them with armor shredding weapons, and having your stable of pilots growing and upgrading as you go. The campaign is a lot of fun and a good way to learn the game and challenge yourself even more on your future career runs after that. There are random events that you may find yourself chasing in the hopes of finding rare weapons or mech salvage. The time to travel between planets and systems requires you to think critically about where you should be fighting within the time constraints of a career run. Do you make a shorter trip to a higher star rated planet and risk having your butt handed to you? Or do you take the longer trip to a more sure thing, a lower star rated system that you know you are equipped to handle and farm out, and risk wasting precious time you might wish you had in the end game in reaching it when it's further away? This isn't a perfect game, but it might be a perfect game for you. Do you enjoy XCOM style turn based games? What about with an added layer of difficulty with some building mechanics in tow? Have you ever wanted to smash around in a Gundam? Well, this is probably your game right here.",1676068147,1676068147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's a strategy and tactics layer, where you control your overall merc company in the strategy layer, choosing what missions to take and what planets to visit, and fighting enemy mechs with your lance in the tactics layer.

You can outfit your mechs how you please, so a versatile mech such as the Centurion can be a long range artillery piece, raining down missiles on enemies across the battlefield, or it could be an in-your-face brawler, slugging it out in close range with other 'mechs. 

There's 4 classes of mechs, with plenty in each class. 
Light mechs are fast and agile, but go down easily and mount few weapons
Mediums are a bit slower but carry more arms and armor, and some mediums can match lights in speed.
Heavies have plenty of armor, allowing for extended fights (assuming you brought enough ammo)
Assault class mechs are the big bois. Guns and armor for days, but they're slow as hell. Positioning these guys matters, since if they're poorly supported they'll be outflanked and destroyed.

Each mech within a class has upsides and downsides. A light urban mech is slow and lightly armed, designed for close range ambush attacks in cities. 

An assault-class stalker mech however has plenty of guns and enough armor to survive, but is prone to overheating with sustained fire. 

Each mech has upsides and downsides. Some are slow but mount long range weapons, others are fast but poorly armored. And to be honest, some just suck.


edit: I should also mention the ""big 3"" modpacks. Battletech Extended (BEX) is the most ""Basic"" of them. If you like the base game but want more mechs, more factions, and more planets  then this is for you.

Battletech Advanced (BTA) is a systematic upgrade from the vanilla game in almost every way. You can now change out almost every part of a mech. I stuffed an oversized engine, jump jets, ECM pod, and stealth tech into a flea (20 ton light mech) and just run it around as  a scout.

Oh, yeah, scouts matter. In vanilla assault-class brawlers are the meta. Not in BTA. Evasion was reworked so now you don't lose it from being shot at, as well as making it so that larger mechs have a harder time hitting small mechs.

Roguetech (RT) is the third mod. If you're coming from battletech tabletop, then this is for you. It tries its best to implement tabletop rules into the base game. It's hard, real hard. But if you're a battletech vet then you'll be right at home",1623134044,1675847230,True,1,0,0.51327437162399292,0,True,False,False

The art is terrific, voice acting limited but on point, with a well-written linear storyline and broad variety of mission templates. The 'Mech tinkering is especially satisfying.

Unfortunately, like many other games built with Unity, it is marred by poor performance leading to stuttering, lag and long loading times. It's hard to enjoy kills when the game consistently pauses for up to a second, catching up afterwards so you miss the animation. The game process grows over time (adding roughly 2GB per hour for me), making it even slower unless you restart it regularly.

Camera control in the map view seems poorly thought out; it often steals control to zoom in or move the camera around even after turning off the corresponding settings, so you spend a lot of time fighting it as part of the core gameplay.

I'm still giving this a cautious thumbs up because it's mainly just technical issues holding it back. Recommend getting it on sale, preferably with expansions included.

 you shoot and miss you lose, you shoot and get a critical hit you win

mostly its down the playing the percentages, eg if you in trees you take less damage but are more likely to fall over, if your on top of a hill your slightly more likely to hit, but get shot at but literally everything

tailoring your units would be useful if changes to weapons and equipment didn't take several weeks game time to effect
so instead you have to tailor mechs to roles and then put that mech in your team, however this is hampered by inititally only having room for 2 spare mechs though later you get to upgrade, though still happered byt the lack of mechs you have to kill and salvage3 of the same make and mode mechs before you can repair it this means that 9/10 the mechs you take into a mission at least in the early mid game are the only mechs you have working until you have accomplished MMO levels of grinding  to get more mechs

EDIT: I'm pleased to say that once you hit the late game, your mechs get enough armour and your mech warriors enough buffs and abilities that there is some skill to play, it becomes vital to target sub components to remove weapons, use sensor locks to target out of range troops, and once you have the fortify finding cover actually works",1672678421,1675730450,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Prior to playing, the only things I knew about it were that it had giant robots and that it seemed turn-based. Today, after almost two-hundread hours of gameplay, I can say it was a nice gamble. The in-game lore and universe is quite expansive, and althought not as bleak as something like 40k can be, it dosen't shy away from being quite grimm when it can. It also has a immense lore, that, to be honest I wasn't quite as invested as other franchises, I turned to be quite appreciative, even if at some newby level at times.
The gameplay is quite simple in the surface, but it actually hides a deep and complex system of unit positioning and financial managment. I learned quite by my mistakes of the best use of travel time and mech moving-and-shooting from getting my pilots blasted into oblivion by playing recklessly. There are moments in the game where you really need to have some cold blood and hope for the best because, even after you made everything perfectly, you still can have a bad outcome, since the hit-chance is percentage based, and this game will sometimes have XCOM levels of unfairness: I am talking about missing 95% chance shots or even three 70% shoots in a row. Is it frustrating? Yeah, not gonna lie, it is. But those are more the exception not the norm, after all, 5% miss chances still a chance right?
Anyhow, the game can be slow at times, specially if you dont thinker a little with the battle-camera options and other more flavourfull stuff. Thankfully you have a easy buttom to make combat faster if you are dreading this much, tho I warn I dont find that option enabled as compelling as just thinkering with the settings. I would also strongly recommend a machine with can run this game with some efficiency. Mine ain't the best and by the time I am writing this, ain't recommended to run this game by some sites. I was able to play it, yes, it runned smoothly at the lowest graphics possible most of the time, yes, but my loading times were quite long. I am talking up to two minutes or more for majority of the loading time, so I strongly recommend you have a better pc than mine. At least something acceptable for this game.
That said I think is more proof of how I enjoyed this game. I entered this game knowing nothing about Battletech and after playing this not only it revived my once dead interest in mechas, but also made me quite fond of the game universe and even tabletop.
I would say to wait for a sale tho, as I did. But, if you have a buck to spare, or simply is too curious to play, well, give it a try! You might as well as myself find yourself losing control of your life to moving little robots and making mercenary contrats on a screen. Completely recommend it.

BUYER BEWARE. Your mileage may vary.

There's a lot to love here, but there's also a lot to hate. Please allow me to explain.

Firstly, there's been rampant complaints about game stability. Personally however, I haven't ran into anything of crash-caliber and the closest I've come is the game stopping to think during a melee attack cinematic, where my mech stood next to the target for a good 40 seconds to contemplate whether it wanted to f*** it instead or not. What I can tell you however is that the load times are something out of a Greek myth, even when playing from an SSD, and even when loading a save file of the same mission that you're currently playing. I feel like slagging the game on that basis alone is pretty unjust, when a patch is likely right around the corner to address these issues. What I find most annoying is that turns take forever due to abundant pausing between AI actions, and there's no option to tweak it.

Secondly, let's get into what makes my blood actually boil. The AI is a c*nt. I don't mean the lovable bloke that's putting a wet finger in your ear, I mean the mother****er that's keying your car in a parking garage and standing nearby to watch you discover it. This piece of s**t is trying to harm you in every way it possibly can, and I don't mean in any believable way, such as a determined foe trying to defeat you that makes you think ""oh yeah, I'd do that too"". I mean that after you've completed 90% of an objective, this mother****er will overheat its mechs to the point of shutting down one mech, then overheats another directly after... [i]to the point of having its own PPC actually blow its arm off.[/i]

""No problem,"" You think. ""After I've blown off one leg and both of a mech's arms that pilot would surely eject."" No. Stumpy is going to run straight f***ing for you on its one good leg and give you a love tap with those stubs. I'm not joking. There is no ""eject"" button for the AI. In fact, there is no survival instinct or even a sense of preservation for the AI at all. None. It has its instructions and it knows exactly what you're there for. It wants to ****ing kamikaze your a** to stop you, its life (lives) be damned, and if it can't stop you then it wants to hurt you. It wants to cause damage to your mechs to drive the mission cost up, it wants to kill your pilots; it wants to ruin your day in literally any lasting way that it can. 

This piece of s**t is [i][b]so[/b][/i] determined to p*ss in your garden, that it actually did the following for me during one mission. The mission was to defend an allied base; ain't no thang, bring your worst. At the mission onset, one of my bonus objectives was to ""Defeat the enemy vanguard""... alright. I managed to blow up 3 out of 4 of the vanguard, the last tank of which pulled back just as I got a notification that enemy reinforcements were arriving. I held my lance back and watched the radar blips gather, waiting for the wave to come crashing down... but they were moving strangely and they weren't attacking. They were congregating around the last remaining ""vanguard"" vehicle, heedless of the fact that the mission timer was counting away with 7 turns until my victory. Nope. This f***ing AI was so determined to spite me, so desperate to lure me away, that it actually f***ing actively denied me the bonus objective... and sat there surrounding the tank until the map ended. That's your foe. That is what you are dealing with.

Lastly, vehicles can f*** off. Nothing takes me out of it like raining LRMs onto a tank that just got hit with a 120mm round and two medium lasers and having said tank just sit there looking at me while still standing, like an awkward boner during the slow dance at prom. It's typically more effective if you melee attack the vehicles, for some f***ing reason, but that's not always feasible when you have Loaded Diaper the 75 Ton 'Mech bearing down on your lance from the other direction.

So if you're still with me, to address the elephant in the room; no, I am not a hardcore fan of Battletech. I am not one of those people who can quote the last 300 years of clan history to you. I just like big robots and making them fight. For me researching the lore at this point is like getting into all 800+ episodes of One Piece at current day; there's simply not enough hours in the day for that s**t. So it goes without saying that a lot of the dialogue can go sailing right over my head. But to the game's credit, despite my lack of lore knowledge it has engaged me with the characters and the story enough to keep me pretty invested in what happens. Except Kamea can shut the ***k up. Listen, I'm ****ing this chicken; you're just holding the wings. Shut up Arano.

You become invested in the mechwarriors you hire, you become invested in your ship. It's hard not to; the game really sells itself on customizing your lance to the point that I've named mine ""Justice Fistings Inc."" You're given a pretty free run of where you'd like to go and what you'd like to do, although there is a bit of a gap in difficulty progression and if you don't manage your salvage well, you can end up falling behind on tonnage recommendations for missions.

It's chess. Chess with 4 large fighting robots (your lance) as your pieces. And there's a lot of modulation to change up the game: how the pieces work, how they interact with each other and the enemy, how the board works, what it does to your pieces, and what you need to do to checkmate.  There are autocannons and missles and lasers that zap.

Play this game. Play it. But don't play it for the story. It's trite and unimaginative. It is every 90s war story you've ever heard. Don't play it for the characters, your Main is whoever you want it to be, your Lance-mates are whoever you want them to be, and the few supporting NPCs that aren't changeable don't have a lot in the way of personality. Don't play it for the environments. You don't really get to explore the ship you're on, and the planets...Every desert is just like every other desert; every jungle like every other; every ice world, every city, every blasted lunar landscape - identical.

I'm a big fan of games like XCOM and XCOM2, as well as games like Divinity, and this game scratches that itch.

Collecting different chassis and designing your platforms is engaging and allows for a lot of customization, and the combat mechanics are deep enough to make those choices matter without being so complicated it becomes a sim.

Throw in some environmental effects and cover mechanics and it's really quite a blast.

Biggest downside is that the graphics, while not terrible, are also not the greatest. Scale is lost a bit without a lot of customization of the camera and quick-time settings, but even then I really felt like the scale was off or at least not very consistent.

the gameplay itself is, fine, its your usual turnbased affair, and pretty much a straight up copy of the tabletop rules, i just wish sensorlock worked for fore than 1 face ( face being 1/4 of a turn ), and that it was easier to figure out what factors do and dont effect accuracy
also for some reason, large lasers specifically, has this weird delay in damage, causing you to think it didnt do anything, before watching half the enemy limbs fall off 3 sec later

i think my biggest gripe with the game is just how expensive things are compared to your income, unless you upgrade your engines to max, going anywhere can take a month, costing you a full payment of wages and maintenance, so by the time you arrived, especially in early game, that might be up to 1/3 of your money gone, salvage parts cost up to 300k, but most you get only sell for 70k, finished mechs cost up to 14 mil, but once you finish trough salvage only sell for about 300k
( for comparison, most difficulty 2/5 missions, can earn you up to 1 mil, but only if you do 0 salvage )

the black market can be hell to get into, if you werent aware of the feature and faction relations from the start, and you already annoyed the pirates too much, it could cost you all your money to get in, and the invites to the black market appears to be entirely random, would be nice if you could either just ask every X weeks, or if there was a known factor for getting in
it would also be nice if system shops had a semi preview before traveling there, maybe not showing us every single item, but saying maybe: this shop has 1 full mech, 3 salvage, and 2 ++ weapons
just to avoid spending a month + wages + maintenance pay, on going to a shop that turns out only has a locust and 20 standard autocannons

the mechbay doesnt appear to have access to lostech, ++ weapons or DLC tech?
which i can someone understand from a PvP skirmish balance point, but its annoying not being able to test configure different loadouts, to see if you want to do it in the campaign
maybe if skirmish had rulesets for different degrees of tech and DLC?
it would just be nice to see what i can achieve with a griffin 1N, with lostech, without first paying for it in campaign

Gameplay Tips: [spoiler]Field the heaviest mechs you have. Medium lasers and SRMs shred.  Max their armor and stay in the trees.  Use vigilance for 60% damage reduction on your front mech to tank.  Battles and Destroy Base are the easiest missions.  Go just far enough forward for enemy contact, but let them come to you.  Hide in trees, behind hills and use sensor ability to spot for LRM shots. Focus fire enemies with the scariest weapons.  Do missions for pirates for access (random event) to Black Market.

If you're thinking of purchasing DLCs, it is better to purchase the season pass and save few bucks. Otherwise, don't waste your money buying DLCs individually.


**UPDATE**

Came back to this game for the long overdue update and playing through the campaign again. Already beaten the game once, playing again just to play the DLC portion, I must say the game feels complete. It's still challenging as ever (in the beginning). The game seems a bit more better on my second play-through.

Getting this game on sale is definitely a worth; especially DLCs. The base game alone, I would say it is worth the full price. DLCs should be on sale only as I stated before the contents could be better. One DLC i think that should've been free was the Shadowhawk skin. I paid $2 for it anyway (sale) and it did made my play-through in the beginning more fun just for the skin.

I do wish the devs continuously added more skins and unique variants. Seeing how the game is now completed, I suppose it is obvious that they moved on.

TL;DR

Came back to play again just for the DLC release. Base game is worth full price, DLC is NOT - recommended at sale. I'd still give this game 9/10.


Sidenote:

I hope to see this type of game or continuous series or saga of this game. I enjoy it THAT much. Honestly, one of the best strategy game I've ever played. Customization, combat, storyline/random events, it's decent. Customization could be more better, but it is nice that it reflect MechWarrior Online (from what I remember years ago, idk if they're lot more in-depth now).",1560850700,1674383305,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend getting this game if you like tactical turn-based games. It's a lot like X-COM. Better in some ways, and worse in others.",1673856716,1673856716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

10/10

I really enjoy collecting salvage/buying parts to customise my mechs. Oddly enough, the funnest part of the game is finding creative ways to squeeze in as much firepower as possible while balancing against armor, speed, heat and tonnage. Very satisfying when I put my shiny new mech to test on the battlefield.  

Pros
-Good story, solid main cast, voice acting. Really liked Ostegard voice acting.
-Very fun gameplay
-gameplay never ends after story concluded

Cons
-Performance (frame rate drops, long load time)
-The cinematic camera angles suck - I turn them off

Battletech is a decent game faithful to BT universe lore. Lots of mechs, lots of weapons, lots of customization options, interesting pilot advancement trees, good campaign story. I've waited for a long time for Battletech franchise to reappear on the games scene, and this game was worth the wait, especially because I'm a fan of TBS games too. Sure, the graphics is not spectacular, given the game is made on Unity engine, and in-game physics leave much to be desired (bulding debris flying high into orbit after mech stomp on the ground - I look at you).
As I've put so many hours in the game I can say it was quite entertaining for me. But I'll point some of the disadvantages for those who aren't ready to look at enemy mechs exploding for tens of hours just for the sake of it - the gameplay is quite repetitive and in most cases destroying all opposition is the best way to complete the mission, both financially and result-wise. This leads to another flaw - the easiest and safest way to complete any mission is to take the heaviest mechs in your arsenal to mission, even if it's one star mission and your mechs will beat the enemy to the pulp in two turns. Having higher values of armor guarantees less risks of damaging the internal structure of your mechs and thus saves you the cost and time of repair. There's rarely a reason to take something else than your best heavy hitters into the mission. It gets a bit better with Flashpoints (special missions and mini-campaigns in DLC integrated in Career Mode) where you have tonnage restrictions either for mech slot or for the total mech tonnage.
Another thing - you start the game with 4 mech slots and you end the game with 4 mech slots. No more slots and lances (4-mech squads) for you. No hardcore missions that would require 2 or 3 mech lances. This means that most of your mech park (18 slots) would be gathering dust in the mech bay, once 4-6 heavy hitters will do all the work. Kinda sad.
In the end, what I meant to say is this game is good one, but it could have been so much better. I'd give it an 8\10 (+1 for being Battletech fan counted in).
P.S. They say that fan-made mods make the game better in many aspects but I'm quite cautious of fan-made content so haven't tried anything yet. My review is relevant for the game as it is.",1672584886,1672584886,True,4,0,0.57419353723526001,0,True,False,False

The campaign story is alright, and provides some interesting (if frustrating) missions, but the real draw is the free-form career mode which allows you to forge your own destiny as a mercenary in the Inner Sphere sometime after the Succession Wars and before the Clan Invasions.  

If you are new to the BattleTech setting and none of those statements makes any sense, allow me to summarise: in the future mankind has explored the stars, created a great civilisation, and then destroyed it in war.  The pinnacle instrument of war in this universe is the BattleMech.  The game revolves around you managing a mercenary company, acquiring and outfitting different kinds of BattleMechs, and engaging in tactical battles using them.  That's all you really need to know going in.  There's plenty more lore out there, though, and the intro cinematic of this game gives the best, most succinct, and poignant history of the BattleTech universe I've seen.

I'm not sure what to say about the game other than the 'Mech customization, management, and tactical battles are all satisfying and present interesting decisions and dilemmas.  The members of your crew and mercenary company are given decent characterization, and the story of the main campaign is decently interesting.  

The campaign and vanilla game, however, is really just the turorial, though.  The real value of this game is in the modding scene, where excellent mods really bring this game to new heights.  I highly recommend playing the campaign with no mods to understand the basic mechanics, then try installing BattleTech Extended CE or BattleTech Advanced 3062 for a lot more excellent content and mechanics.

The animations are extremely long causing most of the game to be sitting there watching your mechs walk over, slowly get back into an upright position, turn to the left and right, and then end turn
It at no point explains why my people keep trying to melee other mechs and i feel stupid for not knowing
I also really dont like how any and all damage you deal to enemy mechs, is completely RNG, it doesnt matter what you do, you fire your gun, it rolls a virtual dice, bad roll? you miss everything.

The amount of hours I have played this game is not accurate, but I think that is because it only effectively tracks time when I play it non modded? Beat me, but that is okay :D I have been playing this game for years now and enjoy playing it with mods thanks to the great BT community. For those who are on the fence of getting it, hopefully this helps. If you have played other games in the BT universe (Mechwarrior) then you already have a great idea about the atmosphere of the game. If you have not, then don't fret, it is easy to get into the stories :D If you have played other RTS games like XCOM or Tactics and like them, but want to have the characters be piloting 20-100 Ton mechs with lasers, missiles, or all the dakka of artillery, then this may be the game for you.

Main story: Not bad. Not the greatest, but not bad. It does a decent job of getting you into the thick of things pretty quickly. The campaign itself is not that mandatory and you can do other side missions to get mechs and funds, but the campaign sure does help to get you big boosts to funding and some decent mechs. Characters are a bit flat, decisions have minimal consequences that affect the rewards only (if that much even), and the combat is ""eh"", but the purpose of the story is really just lore and world setting so that's cool.

DLC: Mostly required for modding, but also affects base game. Adds a decent amount of content and resources/assets to the base game that make it more enjoyable, and help with modding the game. If you get the game, I recommend just getting the whole thing with base game and all DLCs.

Side stories: There are additional missions you can take that are not part of the main story, or even side stories (flashpoints), and these help to fund your wallet, train your mechs, and get you that sweet heavy metal loot. Some of the stories refer to events that happened in the BT universe lore during or before the events you are playing through which is kind of cool for lore junkies.

World size: Since you are a merc outfit that jumps between systems to fight on different planets, there are a lot of places to go, but you don't really walk around or do anything fancy to fly to a destination. The game is about the mech combat and keeping the company funded, not about hitting up each planet and talking to people. With that said, some maps are well designed, and others are just a pain.

Combat: If you played any of the Mechwarrior games and expect it to be like that, don't. You don't have fine controls of the mech in combat, you are the commander issuing commands to your party (lance). Doesn't take away from the fun at all imo and is great for a bit more of a casual play while watching youtube, dealing with a crying kid, or trying to eat a taco while also blowing up that Steiner scout lance that decided to join the fight out of nowhere.

Customization: You can customize your outfits name, the colors of the mechs, the mech components, pilot skill trees, and more. This is great with being able to tailor it to how you want it to be. Doesn't really affect the story, but does change the content of a few messages that appear in some missions.

Modding: This is probably the best part of the game in my opinion. I highly recommend BTA3062 (link at the very bottom)  as it expands the number of pilots, skill trees, grossly increases the number of mechs and equipment, adds new factions and events that are mostly lore friendly, increases the map size by about 400% (I'm spit balling here, its big), and more. It is updated often and has a great community behind it that helps to keep the game enjoyable even years after its release. Before adding BTA3062 to the base BT game, play the base game, do the story, get a feel for it, then when you feel like you have done it all install BTA3062 and enjoy starting off in Clan space where the battles are tough, or fighting gladiator style in arenas, and more. 

Can't recommend the game enough. Get it and try it.

The community saw the base game for what it was and decided that they wanted to introduce others that play this game and want more of what Battletech brings to the table and have made 3 absolutely wonderful overhaul mods to extend the playtime for the game each with their own purpose and brought to you for any level of love and knowledge of battletech. 

The AI cheats like a mug and you are given the tools to build your lance and cheese the game. Its honestly war and you are a mercenary. You are gonna be lied to by your employer. Capellan's will never pay enough for what hell they are throwing you in and are just as likely to stab you in the back. Davion is just too nice and deals with too much and pays you like a ""friend."" Kurita is a bunch of crazies expect to be bait or deniable assets. House Marik is alright enough just a large dumb beast of a political machine so expect to not matter. Lastly, Steiner believes a scout lance is a lance of assault mechs with a heavy support lance. The inner sphere is a dangerous place Merc.

On the prospect of the mods there are actually more than 3 overhaul mods! The big main 3 for career mode and digging deeper and deeper into what Battletech is in and of its self as a game translated from the tabletop you have  Battletech Extended, Battletech 3062 Advanced, and Roguetech. Each has their own charm and reason for why. I personally play bex which is really just a Vanilla + kind of overhaul but it adheres very closely to the lore timeline adding in active wars and the inner sphere map for the timeline. Factions change and grow as time passes and new ones come in or invade. Battletech 3062 advanced is a much larger overhaul tweaking the basegame more and getting closer to the tabletop and adds in the mechengineer system so you can customize the core systems of your mech's down to the engines. Finally we come to roguetech. This is the closest to the tabletop it is unrelentingly hard with the rewards to match. The missions are long, the enemies are intelligent, the tactics matter. 

Its a game with flaws and its a game that has a learning curve and I love it. I recommend it to any tactics game enthusiast, and I'd recommend it to any mech junky.

But it's got a pretty solid modding community, the career mode is where the meat of the game lies, the flashpoints DLC adds some variety, and you can really break the balance in your favor, leading to an extremely fun steamroll squad. Also, you can trick out an entire lance of Marauders in Snub PPCs and UACs that are way more effective and weigh far less than they should.

To be quite honest, I could ramble on for several hours about all the problems this game has---and I've done so before---, but I'll do all that while playing the game in a 12-hour marathon, knocking out mission after mission, assembling an entire lance of Marauders and two King Crabs in a single session.

It might not be a perfect Battletech simulator, but it's a really darn good strategy game with an excellent Battletech presentation. Just wish it would get more official support to add in more fun stuff like much deeper mech customization (engine size and type, armor and structure types, and even removing the per-part hardpoint limitations and just making it a global per-mech limitation), technology and an updated map from later in the timeline (like Clan-tech), and of course, more mechs.

It is turn based and as such a true strategy game. It is NOT a 1-for-1 translation of the board game, however, it clearly has very strong roots there and was obviously used as a basis. The amazing thing is: All the changes they did make sense! It plays differently and if you played the board game for 30+ years it will take a while to get accustomed, however, at no point I was thinking ""ugh, why did they do that?"". Instead, every little and big change is more like ""yeah, you could do that, why not, it's an interesting twist"". 

Additionally, there is no other game I am aware of (and I know MANY) that does the whole ""manage-a-mercenary-unit"" thing better than this game! There is always something to do, you can decide yourself how fast you are progressing and how challenging the missions should be, injured pilots and mechs in repair allow for varied drops so that you don't always use the same team, you are constantly working on new mechs and loadouts, always need more cash, have to manage a lot ... it'll take a loooong time until it gets routine. 

Difficulty level is a bit high for someone that hasn't played any Battletech game so far but I am glad they didn't water this down. Just do more low key missions before advancing the main plot and get used to everything. And you can always abuse save games, so don't worry. Blasting giant robots has never been so much fun before.
On a personal note: I also like the fact that you are starting out with 3025 era technology including most of the classic ""Unseen"" mechs and that this game doesn't involve clans (which have ruined every BT game for me so far).

There are a few downsides. Long Range Missiles and their capability of indirect fire are bit overpowered and the more you progress, the more this will become the defining strategy. The other thing is that there is no tonnage limit, you can always drop with your heaviest mechs, rendering the lighter ones almost useless once you have enough heavies and assaults. There are a few mechanics that favour lighter mechs but that's frankly not enough. 
Now it's up to you and your gaming style, if you can restrain yourself from using cheese strategies, this will be no problem. And it will take you many hours until you get to that point.

It should also be mentioned that even though this game is considered finished it has an active modding scene so you can tweak the game further and add countless hours of more content.

And man do the turn take too long. But, I completed the campaign with a really awefull last fight against a fully deckout kingcrab that I could not get myself, which is also headshot protected. It died in 2 rounds when I decided, nah, alpha that CT.
So a sorry lance of a cataphract, jagermech and awesome? Just, could be 4 of those decked kingcrabs and it would actually have been fun tbh. Or steiner scout squad.
Last fight just left me frustrated that I didn't bother the cutscene or talks afterwards.

Played a little bit afterwards, and actually got challenging quests. 
And I had a Guass+5PPC atlas with dualheatsinks, so that was no challenge anymore.

Anyway, the game got INSANELY easy when you had a pilot with max stragetic, on a Centurion with a AC20. Pop headshot, ok my mech now.
And that is how I FINALLY got out of medium mech HELL for over 30 hours ingame.
Buyable mechs were just bad. Maybe the awesome or stalker? but Only 1 part per system so you had top hop.
Should have done that since the game is so SLOWWW, it take 20-30 minutes to finish a mission.
Untill:

So I finally found a Marauder-3R after 36 hours in the game?
Pop, Got
Slapped 3x AC5's with ACC+3 on there, Ballistics TC as well.
38% headshot calls across the map. 
2 turn guaranteed new mech.
Easy Win.

A Highlander with Gauss? Now with 3 PPC's.
Slap a 9 Strategic pilot in:
A free mech each round!!!
And the fights took a lot less time since I just POP Atlas gone.

Still had to rely on LRM's just to down enemies and get the spirit gauge up.
But just, the game went from HELL, where I had 2 Shadowhawks and 2 Centurion duking it out against 2-3 lances of HEAVIES. quickdraws, orions, cataphracts, hunchbacks with AC20.
And then, get a strat 9 pilot, headshot call with  AC20, get MAD-3R, 
boom, game too easy?

Or just, slapping enemies with wet paper and splashing damage everywhere is not a good idea. Just takes a very long time to ramp up the pilots, moral for the spirit gauge and understanding which skills are absolute GARBAGE AND YOU SHOULD NEVER GET THEM. (aka the all of them, but bullwark, multitarget and sensor, to you know, not DIE, and HIT STUFF to complete the game)

ALso saves. The game LAGGS BALLS when you have over 20 saves. So the solution? Delete your old saves, DISABLE STEAM CLOUD SAVES or it will just re-download it.

Game is still slow. Basically chance time. But hey, It was cool seeing mechs pop and building 20 niches, and realising only 3 work.
Sniper: Guass, PPC, AC5++
Brawler: AC20 TO THE FACEEEE
LRMLord: LURMS (15++ deal 6x15 = 90 damage, also tonnage efficient since 7, as with all mech games)

Everything else IS GARBAGE

Srat? 
2 LURMSSSS (3x15+1x10 or 3xLRM20) Use targting computers, 
with BULWARK and MULTITARGET (so 4-1-4-10 Pilot skills) 
2 SNIPERS, 3xPPC Guass, or 2xAC20+ML+++ or 3xAC5++ (use targeting computers!) 
wIth BULWARK and SENSOR Pilot skills (so 4-1-1-10 skills)

Why max Tactician for both? Because indirect fire bonus + callshot mastery.
Callshot head, get that gamer bread.
Yes a LRMlord can CT an assault if it's not in bulwark+defense, if so the second LRMLord WILL knock it down easy free callshot head.

That's it. Imma play MWO again or something. Or MW4mercs with mods. 
This game is not worth the MODing time with this outrageously bad and slow game that kills FPS constantly on a rtx2070. Why? No idea. Maybe because Unity? 
Eh.
Still negative after 58 hours.
--- Review below as on march 6th 2022? When I had 13.7 hours in the game. The review had 5 upvotes----
Game works and such but forgots to tell most mechanics in true BattleTech fashion.
It's a slow time sucking game where the turns just take too long, a mission can bore you for 30 minutes.
I have no idea who thought it would be good, as well as the constant zooming in and out of the camera after each move.

It just a meh game, don't waste your time on it. Play something more fun or RTS like.
Also it's always your 4 guys vs 12 other guys, even if their armor is stripped, ya better off resetting a mission, bring specific mechs for the job and know exactly where they are comming from. Or else it's a constant pyrus victory of enemy mechs bashing your mechs.

You WILL get frustrated why your AI doesn't just shoot the legs or CT whilst being point blank or in optimal range. And when you get randomly one heat shot in a fresh mech with full head armor.

Your guys are just farming damage, whilst the enemies are surgeons. (even with gunnery and piloting 9)",1646573511,1670690252,False,5,0,0.531272411346435547,0,True,False,False

The game decided it would no longer run in the middle of a mission.  After multiple restarts, reloads, whatevers it still won't load in a playable form.  Don't buy the game, it doesn't work.  I'm really sorry to report that, but for now, you just can't trust it.  The campaign was fun, so if you want buy it for that first 100 hrs, but don't count on it loading on any given day....   and that no-load might be the end of the game.

Edit: I've submitted a support request to Paradox Games and Harebrain Schemes and have received no reply over the last 12 days.  I have been able to install on a second computer.  So net net, is that the game (for me) is not working on Win7 I7-6700K / GTX 980Ti but it is working on Win10 i7-8750H / 1070.  I can't recommend based on the game not working on all my available platforms.

Gameplay review: I didn't really get to this in my original review...The game itself is a fun turnbased game which is fairly true to the Battletech tabletop experience.  The major differences are the armor / damage / heat values are modified and some customization is different (no half ton ammo is the major one).  Game play is fun.  Fun means there is good customizability to the mechs and tactics.  The graphics are fairly entertaining.  Their is a decent amount of replayability through multiple career modes (set timeframe to run a merc unit from a light lance up).  There are also flavor events as move through the systems as your pilots interact with eachother (small part of the game).  The only major complaint in the game play area is that the combat resolution is unmoored from basic statistics.  Many times you will see several (like 4 to 6) misses when you had an 85% hit rate, which should be about a 0.05% likelihood or 1 in 2000 exchanges (to miss all 4 of 4 shots w/ 85% hit chance).  Not a killer, but annoying for math types especially.  As you advance you will also see that you constantly lose initiative too (no explanation is given, although it is a pilot skill so maybe the game mechanism is the enemy pilots have that skill?).  

Bottomline: My experience says don't buy it unless you've got at least Win10 OS w/ a 1000 series+ graphics card (no experience w/ AMD cards, sorry).  I wouldn't recommend full price, but it's fun as long as it plays.  Don't expect any help if you run into issues, it seems support is non-existent.  Hope this helps. 

Edit Dec '2022:  So 3 years later and I have NEVER been contacted by either Hairbrained games or steam on the lack of loading issue.  The game STILL doesn't run on my windows 7 machine.  I have gone ahead and purchased the add-ons, but it's important to note that they don't function during the campaign portion of the game, only after you complete it.  In general, this game is STILL a work in progress and they have NEVER addressed several early stage fundamental issues.  Buy knowing the significant gaps in what you'd previously think of as a complete game purchase.  This game and their Devs benefit from an amazingly loyal playerbase, but they have done little to bolster that loyalty.

This game runs well on almost any hardware; it runs almost perfectly on my SteamDeck!  You do need to get a good community control set, or make your own.  It is a mouse/keyboard game (no native gamepad support), I've managed to get everything I need on the SteamDeck controls though.  I'll share my customized control set soon.  The controls work well enough on the Deck that I miss the controls a bit when I'm playing on my PC, although I do like the PC controls as well for their differences.

The Steam cloud save works extremely well (my main reason for purchasing the Steam version), just make sure you've saved and quit out of the game before switching between your PC and SteamDeck.  I'm pretty sure this is true for all games anyway.

Picked this game a while ago, started going through the prologue/tutorial and dropped it. Poorly optimized, long loading times (on ssd), dated looking animations and obscure gameplay mechanisms, too many concepts to grasp right from the get go. Obviously if you're familiar with the table top then some issues will probably be alleviated. 

I gave this game another shot recently and it does get a lot better. Provided you patiently learn and understand the different systems. Fair amount of trial and error involved.

So basically you're running a mechwarriors (mech pilots) mercenary company. You can expect a strategy map (a la XCOM2) where you pick contracts, manage your mechwarriors, customize your mechs, do some shopping, customize your ship (quite limited though). 
And the mission themselves that are turn based battles.  Aside from campaign scripted missions or unless something goes wrong (getting ambushed) most battles are small skirmishes. Since you'll be doing a lot of them I feel like it's better that way. The flow of the game has been well designed imo.

I really enjoy the mech customization aspect of the game. You can really turn unassuming mechs into amazing killing machine. Fair amount of freedom as well when you start unlocking heavier mechs, lighter mech customization is, in most cases, quite limited because of the available tonnage (space) though.

As I said earlier, when you understand how combat works and go past some dated animations the experience can be quite satisfying. 

Difficulty wise you'll either be really struggling or having a walk in the park. As soon as you'll figure out what works you'll be going through enemy mechs like they are nothing. But as long as you haven't, you can have a bad time since performing badly in battle has expensive consequences (mech repairs).

There are two game modes, campaign mode (with gorgeous artwork but little story) and career mode which is the true sandbox experience. The experiences are quite similar though, campaign adds some scripted missions and handle a few things differently but that's about it.

Lastly the game will get repetitive after a while. Nature of the genre really, so best played in short bursts. Nevertheless still a very enjoyable experience for me and I know that I'll be coming back for more eventually!",1670324941,1670324975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Brings me back to the 90's when I was playing the TT game. A lot of nostalgia and paired up with fun gameplay and so far, hasn't gotten stale or repetitive yet. Put in an official Robotech skins DLC and I am pretty sure I will choke on all those 'memberberries from my youth.

I guess everything isn't all sunshine and roses - I am a little disappointed that there is not very much Mechwarrior content. I was hoping for more of that. When I read there were custom Mechwarriors that you can train, I was thinking more on character builds, but no, just pilot skills from battle. After having said that, please don't interpret that as a gripe or a negative; the game still delivers on many levels without it. 

To sum it up, this is quintessential BattleTech, and if that is what you are looking for, that is what you are going to get.

It is accurate to the actual Battletech tabletop game, which I play weekly with friends.

BTA 3062 - More accurate to table top game, tougher OpFor, more missions, full starmap, literally thousands of planets, more tech, more mechs/vehicles/battle armor.
RogueTech -  Exceptionally hard, full starmap, Online Mode (play as a faction vs other players on an ever changing starmap), more tech, more equipment, more mechs/vehicles/battle armor. This is for highly experienced players that have a deep understanding of the game.

Ever since I powered up a mech for the first time in MW 3, the Battletech universe has always been a pleasant side hobby, from the tabletop wargame to the MMO (I've even been lucky enough to use the 4D mechwarrior arcade game)! This game fits into that corpus and expands it in a nearly perfect combination, and it makes the fiscal operation of a mechwarrior detachement an exciting adventure! Between turning Lyan pilots into chunky marina sauce by way of PPC you have to actually maintain the pilots, machines, and company's dropship. This is all fantastic, with wonderful little roleplay elements that bring the whole thing together. In a similar vein to XCOM, you even have a memorial wall for fallen mechwarriors, and over time they really do develop character. This, coupled with the excellent tactical wargaming at Battletech's core makes for an excellent game. Just like in the TTWG you have to manage heat, use your location to your advantage, and properly juggle initiative to your best advantage. 

Pros:
-A faithful recreation of the table-top wargame with little missing. 
-An excellent campaign mode that leaves the player dreaming of a BT Grand Strategy game 
-A solid campaign that fits right into the BT universe, and pretty authentically depicts the scale of the mechs themselves. Repairs are measured in weeks, and potentially months.  
-Nails the scale of the BT universe, and is an excellent introduction to it for any player, especially with its excellent informational tooltips on everything from PPCs to the Federated Suns. 
- 

Cons:
-It would be nice if the voiceovers included all in battle messages, or all entries, especially because some of the voice acting is great!
-The DLCs are more expensive than they're worth (except FP), and there was a lot of room for growth. 
-This game deserved more time to develop, and we know the dev wanted to expand the timeline and map, but had publisher pushback (Clans, more Inner Sphere stuff, mannnnn)
Sometimes battles can feel a bit same-y 
-Can't field infantry or armor, and there is no infantry depicted.  

If you like tactical wargames, it's worth it. If you're a Battletech fan of any stripe this is a must-buy. If you're new to Battletech this is an excellent entry point. There is nothing quite like ordering a DFA and watching your 45 ton battlemech crash down legs first to obliterate a Jenner, miss, fall down itself after breaking its own leg, and then hear the pilot scream as the Jenner fills the cockpit with laserfire. 10/10 don't fight space At&T.",1669699219,1669699219,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Story was alright, kinda neglected the priority missions and did my own thing. Luckily the game accounts for that and will scale to your current capacity; (evaluates your units/tonnage on the last priority mission and projects the next mission's difficulty based on that)
In the base game, precise shots are completely broken. Field a couple Marauders and you can easily headcap anything you may damn well please. Don't feel bad about fielding the biggest units and the biggest guns you got, light mechs are practically worthless in the base game. 
When you finish the base game, take a short break and download BTA 3062. I say take a short break because 3062 is a whole new monster you will need to learn from the ground, up. Incoming fire will no longer strip evasion points, you will need sensor lockers for that (or destabilize them with a kick). Instead of the absolute pushovers of that you saw from light mechs in the base game, they will rip you a new asshole if you don't respect them. 
Additionally, you will be presented with a completely revamped mech bay that will provide you with the option to change out anything and everything on your mechs.
Core size dictates your speed based on your chassis's tonnage. [Core Size] ÷ [Mech Tonnage] = [Walking Speed]
[list]
[*]20T Mech with a Core 100 = 5 Walk Speed
[*]100T Mech with a Core 400 = 4 Walk Speed
[/list]
In actually applying this to your mech lab ventures, the best way is to multiply your mech's tonnage by your desired walking speed and that's the core you need. 

[i]""I want a 100 Ton Atlas with a walking speed of 4: I need a Core 400.""[/i] 

Walking speed is the basis of your motive ability because that is how this game (and the tabletop game) calculates your running speed and jump jet capacity. With standard jump jets, you can only install up to equal to your walking speed. Improved jump jets allow you to install up to equal your running speed.

There is plenty more to BTA 3062, I won't spoil any more of its plentiful surprises. Watch out for those clanner bastards and their battle armor, don't store ammo in your center torso or head (it happens. there are plenty of lore-based designs that go against this advice). Everything comes at a cost, there is no true meta in this universe other than clan tech which is severely nerfed in this format. Clan tech is pretty much supreme in tabletop.

*** Change the salvage required to make a BattleMech from 5 to 3 in the custom settings.  This is a huge game changer.

*** Destroying a BattleMech's center torso only gives you 1 salvage part from that Mech.  Destroying the legs only will give you two 2 salvage parts. Precision Strike ability is very important to have for your Pilots.  You will be going up against large amount of enemy Mech's in some scenarios.  Taking out their legs can certainly save you.  Or, you can perform Precision Strike on a weak part of an Enemy Mech, and take them out entirely.

*** Do A LOT of low difficulty missions, earn the C-Bills, sell the salvage parts from the BattleMechs you don't want.  It's all money sitting there.  Sell the equipment you don't plan on using at all.  You will have to grind a bit, but it will pay off in the long run when you start having the money for Heavy/Assault class BattleMechs.  

*** Learn from my mistake, try not to piss off the Aurigan Pirates - the Black Market is VERY BENEFICIAL.  Unfortunately, I didn't.  I would take contracts to destroy them all the time.  They hate me so much, they marked up 100% on everything.  A Highlander would have cost me 147 MILLION C-BILLS.


*** Customize your BattleMech's too, change out the weapons and ADD ARMOR POINTS, highly encourage this.  At the same time, UPGRADE YOUR PILOTS! 

*** UPGRADE YOUR ARGO when you get it - trust me.

Initiative is important, using the Reserve option is important, Heat Management is important, and Brace is important.  You have to think through what you are going to do, because if you don't, it could certainly turn the tides against you.  I have had to restart missions because of mistakes I made.

Why? because a lot of things wont make sense untll you go outside of the game and learn the rpg mechanics behind it.

you dont get detailed explanations of what weapons do best, for example, that is up to you to google it.
you're told a basic sales pitch about every mech in a positive light (and half of them are f***ing lies, if they say you that it runs hot, it means it'll overheat after one/two full power attack(s)... which for some mechs really isnt much.)
f**k you jenner D. you s**k. to the storage you go, for the 300K you're worth on an allied planet.

example of the lack of explanation: each weapon has a flat stat and a dice roll. they dont say that. if you have 60% to hit on screen, it doesnt mean that 4/10 hits will miss. it's a 60% chance to get a hit, that is then influenced by both mechs stability, mobility, angle, structural integrity, both pilot's skills and the environment... and b**** moves like recoil and heat. that means that some guns are just BAD unless played with one specific pilot and mech type. or just plain and simply bad and should not used at all.

Boy there's nothing i hate more than a 20:4 fights where everyone on the map can already missile spam you, cover is rare and everyone who isnt already hitting you, is rushing you and/or escaping at the same time. 
you almost ALWAYS go in blind with a vague idea of what's going to be there (like a convoy, a raiding party, a base with defences to cap/explode, and the nation of the target which can give you a hint of what to expect). you are only told one reliable feature: how long the mission will be (which means some compromises will have to be made between firepower, armor and ammo..)
and what environmental stats will impact your performances.
the map can and will be a corridor if the game wants to and the ai will focus to the point of suicide on the first mech spotted, so f**k your light mechs.

TL: DR;

if you like lore heavy robot stuff, googling to understand strats and weapons, minmaxing and things like that, it might be enjoyable.
it gets repetitive very quick, till you reach 40+ hours in and the /good stuff®/ starts flowing in.. 

i did run this game before buying it. it has casual elements that did hook me up... 
But would i recommend it as a casual, fun game? f*** no.

- And well finaly some gameplay. You move, you shoot...
- For some reason even with all the options to speed the game up it takes every enemy 3 sec to do their move and attack, and than you wait for 5 secs before the game selects the next enemy and repeats all of this. This gets really tedious with 10 enemies on the board.
- After the mission you wait for the mechs to be repaired and for the crew to heal, hopefully while traveling to another job.
- Jump to the first animation and repeat, that is basically it.",1667324825,1667324825,False,0,1,0.473145782947540283,0,True,False,False

The accuracy percentages in the game, aren't really accurate themselves, 95% chance to hit with all 3 PPC's and two still miss the target...

The Good:  So, my playthrough was only in campaign mode.  There is also career and free mode as well as multiplayer.  There are also lots of mods as well.  It can’t be said that there isn’t enough to do in this game.  The visuals and sound are decent and kept me well immersed in the game.  Controls are pretty simple and there are lots of options to customize things how you’d like it.  The most fun I had was in the early game; listening to my pilots’ banter, exploring new worlds, getting surprised at the site of a new mech and finding a new upgrade for my mechs.  The story was ok and kept me around till the end.  Most of the characters you meet stand out enough to be remembered.

The Bad:  Two big issues with the game.  First, you are limited to taking only one squad of four mechs into every battle.  I was hoping this would be like other MechCommander games where you can grow your fielded squad over time, but it never happened.  Perhaps there is a mod that could help with this?  I just wish that component was part of the game.  Second, by mid to late game, you start to see the same terrain and get the same missions over and over.  This becomes an issue as you need to upgrade your team/mechs as you progress in the campaign, but all you have are the same missions again and again.  Made the endgame painful.  Minor gripes with the little to no importance of clan ally and with the default ability to lock yourself out of the Black Market if your pirate rep is too low.

Overall: I would recommend this game to anyone that likes Mechwarrior/Battletech tactics games.  That being said, there is a bit of a learning curve with several systems you must learn/manage.  Once you’re past that, the game becomes quite fun and could probably be made even better with mods out there.",1666229527,1666229527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good: How can you not enjoy stompy, smashy, shooty mechs in a turn based setting? I shot things. I smashed naughty mechs. I stomped on lots of tracked vehicles. Winning!
Bad: Towards the end of the game, if you don't run assault or heavy, you simply enjoy frustration and annoyance. This includes after main campaign completion when you are running your company free of constraints. The addition of tonnage limited missions helped to mitigate the issue. This was not as much an issue while playing a merc company in career mode.
Ugly: Don't forget to save as the game begins to lag heavily after playing for a few hours. I'm not a programmer in any way shape or form and I could feel the game struggling to do the stuff and and things. The traditional shut off the game after a couple hours , stretch your legs, get a drink, touch the grass, and then turn it back on, usually settled the issues for a few more go rounds.

What I got was to WAIT. Half of the game is waiting:
- Wait for load screens
- Wait for turn animations (even when you select to ""speed them up"" in the settings, there's still a lot of waiting)
- Wait for travelling from planet to planet
- Wait for mechs to be repaired
- Wait for warriors to come back from injury

Frankly, the game mechanics are sooooooooo incredibly bad this game just sucked up all the joy of the turn-based, already slow-paced games, to an even unbearable snail crawl.

I find myself alt tabbing all the time just to switch the youtube podcasts, I mean... it's BAD.

When it comes to missions, they're all the same.
When it comes to storyline, frankly I'm not even reading, I just want to finally play.
When it comes to advancing the storyline, forget about it. You will have to grind and farm on 1* noob missions, otherwise you'll get obliterated.

I'm unsure on where I am on the campaign, I just need to get some good mechs, or I'll have a bad time WAITING for all the repairing/travelling/loading/cutscene/whatever... and then fail a mission... then have to load (god no, more loading screens!!) just to try again.

Exhausting.

over all I would rate it a 6/10 everything is great about it EXCEPT for the enemy AI and Skull/difficulty rating on missions.

Its been talked about before but unless im missing something the AI straight up cheats, they seem to get core destructions on long ranges a bit more then the player and at times will have ungodly amount of turns in their favor, one story mission has you attacking a munitions depot against 8 enemy mechs (excluding turrets). Unlike most engagments up to this point you will be fighting against a fairy well evened out enemy group consisting of more mediums then light/scout mechs. Not a bad thing but heres the kicker, unless im missing some kind of mechanic they have way more turns then you, for every attack you do they do up to 6 in this engagement  EVERY SINGLE TIME. ""oh you just attacked that firestarter? that means the enemy gets 6 attacks plus movements in and dont forget about the other objectives!""

the skull/difficulty rating is useless at times, anything 2 and above is gonna be a flip of the coin. Either its gonna be a cake walk or you will be retreating your last mech cause the enemy consisted of over half a dozen medium and heavy mechs that made popping your core seem like shooting the broad side of a barn.

All would be forgiven with the occasionally fun gameplay, if the game wasn't SLOW AS MOLASSES. It is distinctively unfun to only have 4 mechs every game, but often have to go up against 8-16(!) enemy units per battle. So for every move you make, you may have to sit through 4 enemy attacks.

The story is quite nice, albeit not very original for the most part, but it still feels good and adds to the lore of the universe, and Flashpoint adds some shorter stories even to the Career mode.

The Career mode is the true mercenary experience, with added difficulty if you turn it all the way to 100 %. Your role is to be true professional. You aren't the idealist that takes an impossible fight to save their faction. You are the merc that takes the fights they can handle, does the job and takes the money and salvage to feed their crew and to grow stronger.

The tactical battles are the core of what I rate so highly about the game. And while you can build them up in the strategy part and train the pilots, once you land, it's just your four mechs, no production, no reinforcements, no repairs. If anyone gets reinforcements, it's your opponent. Mechs generally operate in lances of four, both yours and theirs, and then you can also encounter ground vehicles and turrets. You dish out destruction on the battlefield and you do your best to avoid structural damage of your mechs or injury of your pilots.

The strategy is also nice, you're a leader of the mercs, you have your spaceship and you are upgrading and restoring it. You also train your pilots using their experience from battles, buy mechs and their weaponry, and you can customize the mechs in the workshop, to change where their strenths and weaknesses lie.

I recommend this game. It is well worth the asking price, and when on a discount I'd even consider the DLCs that go with it. They add some extra variety, albeit they don't make a huge difference. If you keep your budget down, the base game when discounted by 75 % is a great deal, in a game with pretty good replayability (although the missions repeat themselves) and even a good potential to skirmish your friends in a fair fight where both sides have the same budget limitations.",1665306787,1665306787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You go into a match and have 95% chance to hit you think omg there is almost 0 way i can miss this shot... Miss 9times out or 10. However, you enemy is point blank with a PPC or out of eye sight with the ppc and gets a direct hit every single time. Getting 2 to 3 head shots on you every time you land for a mission... This game is insane with how it completely ignores it's own combat system and just say FUCK YOU to the player. I have played 4 skull missions with my current setup and i cant even pass a 2 skull mission in some instances because the RNG is so trash that they hit every single time regardless of their positioning and i cant hit even a melee attack that has a 95% chance to hit.............

FIX THIS TRASH and it might be a decent game.

*Update*
Decided to give this game another chance after a few years... 

Still one of the worst tactics games I have ever played... Enemies get the ability to move and attack whenever they want. Only requirement is that 1 of your units attacks first. The Skulls LITERALLY don't matter. I went into a 1.5 Skull match and had to fight 2 wolverines, 2 hunchbacks, 3 spiders, and 5 tank/missle boats. The insane amount of enemy mixed with the fact that the whole enemy team gets the chance to move after each individual on your side does anything is impossible to play. 

Every attack is crazy too. You use missles and you will miss 9/10 missles and the 1 that connects only does 2 damage. While the enemy will hit EVERY missle and they all do 6+ damage a piece. It seems the game also perfectly balances your damage on the enemy units. I have most kills i obtain on this game has the enemy all systems capable with tiny slivers left of health and armor. The final hit destroys everyone component..... Not sure how that works when if they hit me with 2 LRM shots im losing both arms and falling over.

Pros: You've got awesome mech combat, blowing up individual components and mediocre mech customization. 

Cons: Most missions feel the same and require the same strategies; sometimes you have to destroy buildings but usually you're just killing all enemy units. There doesn't seem to be a lot of tactical flexibility available in the game; focusing one target at a time and avoiding getting focused yourself is what you'll spend most of your time doing. Fairly often missions will throw unexpected and unfair surprises at you, forcing you to either restart the mission (to plan for the surprise that you know is coming) or pay more in repairs than you earned for mission completion. 

The Cons paragraph is a lot bigger than the Pros but I still recommend the game. It's fun blasting things despite the flaws in the game. It's nice to not have just one health bar on a unit; it feels a bit more ""real."" Tip: always field the heaviest mechs that you have.",1664574248,1664574248,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played the tabletop version for over 20 years, and have always loved the technology, world building, and sheer enjoyability of the game.  I only wish some of that pleasure had transferred to this game.
There is nothing enjoyable, nothing fun about this game.  Playing in campaign mode, my only memories of the hours I have spent on this game are unpleasant, even violent ones.  I realize this is set in a war.  I realize that it is brutal combat, lives on the line.  But I am the Hero of this story, aren't I?  Shouldn't i have moments of victory, of actual pleasure?  Forget it, this game says.  From now on you're Batman.  Without any of the skill, weapons, and of course you're always 2 seconds from complete bankruptcy.  
The game is about as pleasant as playing with the worst, most arrogant, most hateful GM imaginable, one who will crawl 200 miles uphill over broken glass to ensure that your play is a miserable, aggravating, and above all NO FUN as humanly possible.  Your readout says a 95% chance to hit, and your character bonus adds another 20%?  That's a miss.  Sorry, RNG.  50% chance?  Forget it. never.  Not gonna happen.
Convoys?  Better bring Locusts.  Anything else just outruns you with ease as their escorts shoot you in the back, and if one makes it to the pickup site, forget it.  Failed.  Defending a base?  Better make sure you're spread as thin as possible--because that mech on a hill out of your visual range might just start knocking down the buildings you're supposed to protect.  
Navigation is practically impossible; the landscape will fight you every inch of the way.  Don't worry, the pros will make sure that you are always dropped in the worst possible locations, and when they tell you to hang back, since your opponents are more that one group and might attack each other?  Nope.  They will head straight as an arrow towards you.  EVERY TIME.
Movement is nightmarish--you can very easily find yourself stuck, having to backtrack around. 
Oh, and the modification of mechs?  Sure. within strict guidelines.  See, this mech only mounts this many lasers.  Wanna add more?  Oh, you can't.  Sorry.  That 30 tonner with full speed?  Oh, only mounts cannon.  No room?  What a shame.  Want to get a cannon?  Oh sorry, not on this planet.  Maybe the next one, after the bathroom-break long trip animation that you must watch.  EVERY. SINGLE. TRIP.  ""But you can skip some of it"" you'll say.  Yeah...  Some of it.  I see jumpship dockings in my sleep.
Oh, don't forget your crew's morale.  They'll give you plenty of chances to F--- that up, too.  There are plenty of scenarios they throw at you--and again, it seems the mighty RNG controls the outcome, regardless of your choices or input.  Again, the troll GM will make sure that you lose both money and morale, consistently.
Oh, and don't ever think that the difficulty settings at all refer to your actual experience.  That one pays better?  Better believe that the opposition will be 2-3 lances  more than you expected, at the same level that gave you popcorn in the last mission.  Oh, and that troll GM will make sure that your best equipped mechs are the sole target.  Of every single opponent.  Oh gosh, that arm and your brand new shiny weapon just got blown to hell?  Don't worry, you can't repair the weapon--it's just gone.  Forever.
Positives?  The animation and graphics are good.  The fights look real, and are exciting in general.  Storylines and history are very well done, and show a lot of research went into them.  What's missing here is any actual FUN.  Sorry, but I don't play a game to be aggravated.  I definitely don't play to be miserable.  And sorry i played.  If that sounds like I want to be the Mary Sue, if I want to be the winner, yeah.  Exactly.  I paid for the game.  If I want stress, I'll deal with my real life.  

I'm sure a lot of you are thinking that I just don't know the game, or that i'm whining after some bad luck.  I've had 170.8 HOURS of bad luck in this game.  You don't want to take my word, please.  It's only $40.  See for yourself.

After an additional 500 hours, SOME of my feelings about this game has changed.  It is still, in my opinion, a little too difficult and some things are too random (I'm looking at YOU, Black Market) but it is the Battletech game I keep coming back to.  One other major complaint--I would like a lot more flexability in mech creation--I HATE being locked into what type of weapon is allowed, and everything else is not.  It shuts down a lot of creativity, and that has always been a big part of battletech for me.",1603576974,1664545545,True,0,0,0.559663116931915283,0,True,False,False

I swam eventually, and it became a thoroughly enjoyable game for a bit. Now, I'm putting off conducting the final missions in order to explore a bit. Seeking out better 'mechs and equipment (which is nearly impossible). 

The game gets repetitive really quickly. Jump in, smash what you can and run as fast as you can to start with. Maybe make a few C-bills profit unless you take some damage. Then you lose C-bills. 
After you upgrade your mechs and find your play style, you make a few more C-bills, but not many. Poor decisions can bankrupt you very quickly. Good decisions will see a small profit. Then the financial report comes in and in order to play competitively on the battlefield you have to pay exorbitant fees to your mercenary pilots. You don't pay, they don't fight at capacity. They earn experience painfully slow. 

You also have to balance your faction popularity. I'm loathed by several factions, so the missions in areas dry up pretty quickly. You've basically got to fight for one faction in one sitting, and against them immediately after that, siding with the faction you just fought against. Otherwise, if your reputation gets too low, there's no coming back from it. The ""Black Market"" for parts etc is ridiculously expensive to be a member of ($2.5Million C-bills regularly), and the parts and weapons are stupidly priced for battlefield fodder. 

I've got space for 3 lances, pilots for 3 lances, and can only ever field one lance of 4 mechs at a time. I'd love to field everything I've got as a show of force in a giant battlefield mission, but no. I'm left paying for mechs and pilots that never get used, so I sacked the pilots and stored the mechs. Some you HAVE to sell, because you never get ahead financially. Some you keep. All the pilots bar 6 you sack, and just wait it out until your favourite pilots are healed from dangerous missions

The DLC is fun for about 5 minutes, and then becomes the same game grind fest. Get contract, jump in, smash some stuff, jump out fast, try and save a few C-bills whilst not finding new mechs or weapons. 

It's fun to start with, but then becomes the same grind mission after mission. I've started again twice to play differently and try to be a millionaire quickly. Doesn't happen each time.

No new changes announced and the last major update was years ago. HBS has left the game in the hands of mod-makers. Who are sadly, doing a bit better of a job with features..

However, the best BT mod isn't on Nexus. You have to look up Mods In Exile(discourse). This is where BTA can be found.

Still, this game has and will forever have massive delays in game with the AI taking its turn.

That being said, I wanted to just go nuts with altering the game. The ways you can mod this game(and break it) are pretty amazing.

BACKUP YOUR WHOLE ASS GAME BEFORE YOU MOD

If you don't back up the whole directory, at least backup folders you're editing.

If you've ever been a fan of the original tabletop game, you'll be thrilled to learn that this is a lovingly crafted PC recreation, helmed by Jordan Weisman and other members of the original design team themselves.  If you've never heard of the original Table-top game, just know that 30+ years of rich worldbuilding and masterful gameplay mechanics by award-winning designers have been brought vividly to life in this game. 

60% of the game takes place on a lush hex map, as your ""Lance"" of 4 giant 'roided battlebots leap into action against enemy mechs, tanks, and turrets.  The turn-based gameplay is strategic, exciting, and hasn't gotten old after 96 hours. There's something deeply satisfying about watching your swarm of 40 long-range missiles blow the laser-cannon arm off of your opponent. The tactical game is rich, and nuanced. There are a plethora of successful strategies, it all depends on your execution, and adaptability.

The other 40% of the gameplay takes place on your dropship, where you can customize your mechs with a dizzying, deadly array of legitimate and black-market weapons and upgrades. You may spend as much time in the Mech Bay, tweaking your load-outs and armor positioning, as you do on the battlefield. Sound tedious? OMG it ISN'T, and there's a giddy thrill involved when you discover some new and ""totally broken"" combo of armaments that turn your killing machine into a SUPER killing machine.

Or if you're just in in for the 'splosions, you can play the whole game using the standard loadouts and never know you're missing anything. 

The world is rich, and feels ""lived-in."" From the title cinematic onward, the depiction of the game world - the rise and fall of Human empire beyond the stars - is deeply moving, like a saga or tragic epic. That preps you for the plot you'll be embarking on, thick with imperial politics, backstabbing, and intrigue. Once you finish the plot, you're free to roam the galaxy and ""Merc"" to your heart's content. 

This is a gorgous game, Harebrained Schemes. It's obsession-worthy. Now do another one just the same for Crimson Skies!

Haven't seen that many bugs in the game but the game does like to run how on even higher end gaming rigs.
Some people have mixed reactions to the stability mechanic. I find it refreshing and adds another layer of considerations when engaging enemies.
The scale is a bit off between Mechs, terrain (buildings) and vehicles but from what I understand the tabletop game has some of the same issues. At least you get a good sense of scale in the mech bays.
It would be nice if you could field vehicles or use different lace configurations, but its not really that much of a flaw.
Cinematics are great. Love the painted brush yet crisp art style.
You do get a sense of loss when one of your pilots dies...you miss their antics in the random events system. They are not just gaming pieces, the game gives them a sense of identity and purpose and their loss can be felt on and off the battlefield

In this game, you take command of your own Mercenary Company working in the Periphery. You have a roster of Mechwarriors and Support Crew at your command, the former for the before-mentioned turn-based combat missions and the others for maintaining your Battlemechs and Dropship. There is a story mode, which has you and your merc band assisting a deposed monarch reclaim their stolen throne, complete with story missions with unique maps, victory conditions and challenges. The game also has a Career mode if you want to just go blow stuff up and live out your own Mercenary fantasies.
If you are confused by my terminology, do not fret: this is possibly the best game for you. Battletech has a built-in lore function, with major events brought up being highlighted. You can mouse over these for more context. These will give short, easily digested lore tidbits about stuff like the Mercenary Board, Star League, the Great Houses and other such things, which is greatly appreciated by people who are either newcomers to the setting or (like me) just have not experienced the true depth of its history.
On the management side, your real concern is something all too familiar: money. You will spend much of the game either losing or making money, making it through the wide variety of mission types, losing it because you got a few components of your favorite Mech blown off. Battletech is a corporate universe, and you need to maximize profit through unavoidable combat. You have access to a unique, one-of-a-kind Star League era transport ship that you can upgrade, but be careful with it, as each upgrade increases upkeep cost, and it can be a trap for the inexperienced, regardless of the benefits. There is a Mechlab that allows you to retrofit your assortment of Battlemechs, though, unfortunately, it is not perfect. Veteran Mechwarriors will glare balefully at the fixed engine ratings and armor types, though I personally do not mind the limitation. There are mods that further expand on such possibilities, though I have no experience with such and cannot attest to their quality.
In the field, you will usually have a full lance of Mech’s at your disposal. To the noobs out there (Welcome!), that’s four big stompy death machines sporting your custom loadout of guns, lasers, missiles, artillery, fists, and a variety of equipment, all geared to your own personal flavor of carnage. Laugh manically as you curb stomp cute little tanks into the dirt, vaporize tons of metal with disco laser vomit, send entire components of mechs flying with ballistics, or knock the biggest and scariest war machines off their feet with concentrated swarms of missiles from obscene range! Be warned that some story missions will have uncontrolled allies, or controlled allies in literal walking garbage cans with guns. 
On a more serious note, combat has many nuances. Mech orientation, range, terrain modifiers, stability and heat buildup, to name just a few. You will need to learn how to spread damage, mitigate incoming armor loss and maximize your lances effectiveness. Losing a mech mid combat is a devastating blow, and has a high likelihood of killing your pilot (except your OC). The cost of repairing a destroyed mech is high, and some of your mechwarriros are not expendable (many are unique and do not respawn if killed). As such, there is a high incentive to keep who you have alive.
There is a learning curve. This is a hard game. But there is fun to be had here, if you have the mettle. Pay your bills, ‘Die Clanners’, and, above all, have a blast!

The core gameplay mechanics are fun.  I enjoy tactical RPGs, and those elements in this game are fleshed-out and engaging.  

That said, I've been playing the campaign and I haven't been enjoying it.  The writing and characters are engaging, and I want to see where this story goes.  But the campaign-specific mechanics can be really tedious.  Even early on, and on lowered difficulty settings, the missions you undertake are less of a test of your skills as a player and more just a circus of random and expensive penalties.

I would object to this less if these penalties were consistently a result of player error.  Some of them are, but many (most, even) of them are just sheer bad luck.  It's frustrating to have an otherwise good mission end in weeks of downtime because enemy 'mechs just get one or two lucky shots in and take your 'mechs or pilots (or both!) out of commission.  This is compounded by the way missions routinely have you outnumbered 1.5:1 or 2:1.  Just by sheer volume of fire, the enemy AI is given ample chance to get those lucky shots and impose those penalties.

This extends to 'mech loadouts as well.  While undeniably realistic, the significant delays of refitting a mech's weapons and equipment, especially in the early game when you only have the capacity to refit one mech at a time, means that any experimentation with different loadouts is locked behind costly time and CBill delays.

None of this is to say the game is strictly bad.  All of the above choices are deliberate, none of it is the result of what feels like unfinished, broken or buggy game design.  There are folks who are going to play this game and engage with these mechanics and have a lot of fun with them, and I wish them nothing but a good time.  But for my own sake, I find the systems of the campaign mode to be incredibly tedious, and the more I play the more frustrated I become with them.",1661719599,1661719599,False,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The problem is game content very small, according to the BattleTech universe, with very small weapons and mech variety, just one Atlas type. You may disagree with me bc of the timeline of the concept. True is True. 
Missions are simple even flash points (FP) being formatted just randomly generated simple missions. And most of FP reward completely trash, rare mech isn’t rare.

Got this on sale as a gift from a friend and it turned out to be a really fantastic game, it has a strategy layer as well as a turn based mech fighting layer, so it's kind of like x-com. You have a ship, kind of like x-com. Anyway, this is basically x-com but with light grand strategy elements wrapped up in a turn based rpg combat game based on a table top PnPRPG. Shadowrun was great. aside from the terrible combat, so it was a shock to find the combat in this pretty interesting, if a bit needlessly complex.

 Also everything is done with dice rolls, so if you hate that you will not like this game at all. Some of my favorite moments have come from getting a low chance headshot on a mech pilot, or missing it, losing my own mech.

You can customize your mech color, name, and flag in the captains quarters which I thought was a nice touch. The mech bays all look great too.

I played tabletop Battletech quite a bit in the 90's.  Don't remember all the rules but it is at least very familiar and seems mostly accurate.  A shame I keep reading that a second one isn't under development.  Hopefully if another one is done it is a bit less buggy.

Worst bug I found so far is a specific urban city map won't load, game will just sit in the loading screen indefinitely.  Tried to watch a movie while it loaded and even waiting 2 hours doesn't help haha.

The game doesn't seem to have efficient code.  There is a lot of FPS issues that a turn based game probably shouldn't have.  But at least it isn't a real time FPS where FPS really matters.

There is some bugs with battles and it removes you from combat when an event such as a convoy your escorting finishes extracting and it jumps out of combat.  The enemy can move.  Then you go back into combat so they get like 2 moves to your 1.  And top that off, your mechs sometimes don't cool down during that out of combat phase where they got to move but you didn't because I think you only cool down if your unit is given orders.

Instead of giving you free reign after the campaign, with Battle-, Scout- or Stealthmissions, requiring different Mechs and Loadouts, the Missions are all the same and the Enemy Forces are just growing. Pretty soon your Lance of 4 Mechs will face a full company of 12 Enemy Mechs, all Assault class, maybe even all of them at 100 Tons.

There are some other strange design choices. 
Like multiplying Armor AND Damage by five, firing the one guy who knows basic math after he converted some of the energy weapons and going completely haywire after that.
Guys, the AC2 is called so for a reason. 2x5 is 10, not 25. If you need more help, let me know. Google knows who i am.

Also, the game is very SJW´y.
The pronouns are completely superfluous and are only in the game so you can use ""he"" for a female profile pic, or ""they"".
Also, since the SJW version of inclusion means exclusion of anything they dont approve of, there are no attactive people in the entire game. Well, there could be made an argument for two of them, but basically everyone ran into the ugly-tree on their way to the game. The two engineers even did so multiple times. With force.

Consider this: Humanity colonized about 3000 Worlds in 600 years.
50 Planets each year on average. That necessitates billions, maybe even trillions of people. If the future was populated by SJW´s, and their approved gender-alphabet, who would produce them? Cloning will only get you so far...

Dull gameplay can be balanced out somewhat by art style, feel, and story the game looks and feels terrible to play, and has a barebones and predictable story. The story can be forgiven, but having a mech game where the mechs feel terrible to move and attack with is just pathetic. I'm not sure how the devs managed to make mechs feel lame, but they have. The mechs look like toys, and attacking with them feels like they're firing nerf pellets and pocket lasers. Units will take a full rocket to the face and not even flinch to indicate that the attack had any weight at all.

To make a long story short, this game is RUINED by RNG.  This is not an exaggeration, as every single mission, apart from story missions, is randomly generated.  From the rewards, to the missions themselves.  That doesn't sound all that bad, you may be thinking.  I assure you that's because you're not thinking about it on a ""effects the entire game"" level.

Quick example -    Start a 1 out of 5 skull mission (difficulty rating per mission)  Mission should be killing 2-4 mechs on par with what you have.  Not a cakewalk, but not much chance of getting one of your mechs  damaged.  Which is ideal (as anything beyond normal armor damage requires mech to be in repairs for X number of days and cost money, pilots can also be injured as well)  After getting a visual on your enemy, the mechs are actually a full weight class above yours.  Ok that's bad, but should be able to finish mission, with one or more mechs heavily damaged.  One single turn later reinforcements arrive dropping 4-8 mechs on par with your weight class.  This in itself would be serious, then you remember about the upper classed mechs. 

This happens every 4 missions or so, without fail.  I've read that the game bugs out on reinforcements on missions sometimes and simply sends them in with the normal forces all at once.  I've had the above example play out except the reinforcements were there from the start.  

I've had a mission start and the by the second turn have a mech be fully crippled due to the RNG nature of the %to hit system

I've begun story missions marked as 2 skulls, only to find heavily entrenched forces with 3-4 times the firepower and numbers of my force.  You can only take 4 mechs into a mission, and almost all missions has that number or more in enemy forces.

The real kicker to ALL of that is?  These situations happen with the easiest difficulty selected, with all optional difficulty enhancements tuned to benefit the player.  You can't even buy better mechs becuase the shop only has RANDOM stuff in it, and mechs can only be purchased in pieces.  With the better tiers being insanely expensive  , being 2-4 missions of pay for a single piece.


I restarted this game 4 or more times thinking maybe it was just me , that i needed to try harder.  It isn't.  This game would be legendary if the RNG was removed and actual balance, timing, and difficulty scaling was used.  Sadly it isn't

Already existing tags probably don't fit this style.  In one cycle of play (called a round) equal characteristics of both forces play in turn.  In phase 4, you move and fire your light mechs, the OpFor moves and fires.  Next phase is medium mechs, you move and fire, they move and fire.  This is not a turn-based in that all of your mechs can dominate, then all of theirs dominate.

For the gameplay, it's classic MechWarrior style play.  I see nothing abnormal or different about this play.  I have no issues with buying this when it's on sale.  I got it for about 60% off.  It'll keep me entertained!

Rips you enough out of gameplay that I wish it can be better.  Keyboard/mouse key binds/controls could be improved.  I've skipped turns in mid-battle more times that I want to admit because I'm rambo clicking and then a popup is..well, under the cursor.

Without mods, this is an outstanding game for the kind of player who loves to constantly tinker with his resources.  If you are the kind of gamer who loves nothing more than getting lost in concentric layers of complex systems, then this is a shining example of what that looks like when it is done right.  As for mods, caveat emptor.

On the other hand I hate the way the game implements non-mech vehicles.  And that's about it for the negatives.  Mech vs mech combat is a deep chess-like game.  Vehicles are like checkers.  They don't add anything interesting.  (Nothing against checkers.  I spent years playing it as a kid and never was able to even come close to beating my great grandmother.)

The rage in the rage quit was directed at my own self after forgetting to add my new tricked out Phoenix Hawk to my lance for the second time in a row.  I LOVE Phoenix Hawks and their playstyle and I don't want to miss a mission with one of them.",1659467952,1659467952,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I compare this to chess.  There is quite a bit more strategy to be played.  I only wish HairBrained would expand it to the clans.  Possible PvP .  THAT would be a blast!!
In my opinion it's an easier game to play than Mechwarror 5, just because there is more time to think and move.  At least this old guy appreciates it:)

Not changing my rating but.. I wouldn't buy it now. Proper snorefest.


March 2019, game runs well, review changed from negative.
The game is a great interpretation of the Battletech game.

Personal feeling is that they shouldn't have messed around with lights so much - the evasion removal per shot means that a heavier mech is always a better mech - lights, and even mediums have no place on the later game battlefield. The limit of one lance maximum reinforces this - you cannot have enough force to make a light lance viable.
You'll find therefore that your lance evolves over time to be heavier and heavier, and so does the enemy - leading to slugging matches which lose a lot of the tactics.

I'm not sure how much of the game I've played through so far but some of the campaign is definitely odd - why do i need 24 mechwarriors and 12 mechs when I can only field 4 at a time? It doesn't make much sense.
Battles now tend to be my lance versus 2 enemy lances, or perhaps more if lighter enemies are fielded.

I also find the mechwarriors themselves to be very generic. The abilities are okay but nothing to get excited about, with the odd exception - the shoot before moving one being a good exception. The problem though, as with tabletop is that your best warriors can be killed in one shot - a lucky head hit took two of my best in my current campaign, after which I pretty much stopped caring about the mechwarrors themselves

1) Still being sold at full price , yeah i know it's not that old.....however....
2) it is built on a shockingly bad version of the Unity engine which causes all kinds of problems that can't be fixed without access to the source code.....which has been denied....multiple times
3) the season pass costs more than the damn game and the content is nice , but not really needed (alot of mods use the dlc though) Also some of the dlc content actually makes the Engine issues worse.

ASIDE from the aforementioned issues however. This game is great , 403 hours at the time of review really should say it all.
it's satisfying , it's challenging , it's addictive......and if it's not enough? Download some mods or modpacks...Try some RougeTech , BTA 3062 or BTE 3026 commanders edition. you might just get hit with the same spark of addiction that i did an after 400+ hours...

I've been playing the PC version of these games ever since Mechwarrior 2 in the 90s.  I was surprised that I totally missed this release.  The only exposure to the tabletop version of this game I've had was the disappointing MechCommander which punished me by making easy mode impossible.   Perhaps I was too young to understand it?  

As always the elements of turn based strategy are present, similar to the Banner Saga or Fire Emblem. 
 I'd say the biggest difference is damage being meaningful.  Mechs lose effectiveness the more they get hit.  This can result in varying strategies on how to approach a battle.  As usual the ability to fine tune your loadouts is a big draw for this franchise.  The addition of weapons slots has finally forced me to put weapons in the easily destroyed arms!  Also, this is the first time I've made a loadout specific to inflicting melee damage.  

Anyway.  I'm finally getting my mechwarrior fix after a decade of no new releases.  So I'm happy.",1658539962,1658539962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An absolute abomination in game design. 

Edit: Played further into this unbalanced dreck of a game because i was bored and i was sorely dissapointed your 4 man battlelance will have to face more and more mechs per match to the point of impossibility. 11 v 4 is an unbalanced as hell mission now add the fact that 4 of the 11 are bigger better equipped mechs than your own and you have a purely depressing encounter. And what do you get for this super balanced encounter you may ask? 400,000 $ the equivilent of a canned pepsi in this games economy, you will lose more than 400,000 $ worth of equipment in this encounter easily and you get NOTHING in return. The only way to make this game even partially playable is when you mod the absolute shizz out of it to make encounters more balanced.

Quite sad that the campaign is a bit short and lacks some variety. Perhaps it's because the systems are there for the story but it's not that deep. 
The story is what I call borderline epic--XCOM2 level of storytelling. The game could really use more voice acting and adds some more story-related elements. 
The gameplay is deep and tactical, normal difficulty is pretty hardcore. I did find fun in breaking the game by using many tools and mods to create the most powerful mech as possible. 
Now for the mechs, they are cool, they are awesome, man I LOVE Atlas 2 (the skull face mech on the coverart). 
I genuinely had fun when my cheat version of Atlas 2, armed with two gauss canons, 2 LRM missile pods, 16+ jump jets and 4 ER PPCs rains hellfire on an enemy. 
Sometimes story forces your team to take in a mech pilot by a story character, which has no upgrades. Since every time I can only bring 4 mechs to battle, my elite pilots would have to sit with an Atlas 2 piloted by a story character that has no upgrades and is incredibly slow and sluggish. Cant, they just allow the story character to be the 5th member of the team?
Genuinely a good experience. Had me addicted for a while. 8/10

You equip your mechs with weapons that will make them good at fighting enemies at a certain range. If you can get to that range, you'll do really well especially if the enemy doesn't have mechs that are designed to fight at that specific range. But this sort of comes down to chance. Map design is also a factor to consider, but I don't really feel like it changes things too much, and it's hard to prepare for an encounter when maps are procedurally generated when you enter them anyway. Perhaps the game gains more depth and becomes less deterministic the farther you get into the campaign, but when you're stuck using the same mechs in the earlier parts of the game, it's definitely deterministic and straight-forward.

But that's not to say that the game doesn't do some things really well. I think that the base management for the game is REALLY well done.

The music is one of the high points of the experience- the orchestral score really underscores the size and scope of these massive machines. I had a good time playing it.


Some recommendations:
Turn the Quick Animations option on. It shortens long walks but keeps all the actual attack animations, which are the interesting bits.

SRM carriers are your worst nightmare. Kill on sight.

Leveling up Tactics and using a Called Shot to deliver an entire battery of weapon fire at the Center Torso is a surefire way to get kills, though it makes mech retrieval harder. Guess what, though- you can buy most mechs (in pieces, anyway). I prefer making things simple.

An enemy must be Unsteady before they can be knocked down. One massive volley won't be able to do it. One of my favorite tactics is using a fast, heavy mech with a lot of melee stability damage mods to deliver a wallop, and then use multitarget to hit them with one missile barrage while focusing all other fire on someone else.

(my original review below)

I have to say the start of this game is not very inspiring. It's linear and doesn't give you options initially - I imagine this is designed not to overwhelm and intimidate new players. 
There is also a lot of dialogue where I'd have expected some voice overs and generally this game is text heavy...however, having played through the first couple of hours the game does of course open up and you can customise your mechs, buy new gear, choose how to handle new contracts and so on.

So yeah the game does get a lot better than the limited start and is quite fun once things get going. I think this game probably just didn't get the budget it deserves because full voice acting and more cinematics would have really helped.

Anyhow If you're expecting turn-based mech warfare over varied terrain, customizable mechs, ""base"" upgrades, merc contracts with squad tactics and skill progression etc this is a cool game.",1656748605,1657811749,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have played the game a lot more as you can see, it's very fun. i can see why you need those extra mech bays now as you need to have a light lance along with your heavies later in the game, and who doesnt like to collect their faverite mechs along the way, the story is pretty good, Lady Arano is a good character and by the end of her story it gives you a good idea of what kind of universe the battletech series is about, and the flashpoint missions are fun, 



***OLD REVIEW**The game is very good. It feels like this is just a teaser of what could be a more complete experince though.
At the moment the option to do a career is lack luster. You still have the argo and the same characters as before on it. Which is odd. I'd prefer to be able to just be on a leopard ship or something, without the campaign characters there so i feel like i can make my own story. But its a minor complaint. The only real issue with the game is a glaring one. It takes so much time. To do anything. Reparing, Healing pilots, traveling to the next planet takes anywhere from 5-20minutes just to get to the next mission. It kinda is a time sink. 

Combat can be challenging and is engaging. It's addictive if you enjoy turn based strategy combat. The only issue with it is that it you can only deploy one lance. They really made those extra mech bays useless and its a shame. Being able to deplot even just 2 lances would be awesome but i can see why they didnt do it as your turn would just be a long slog of commanding 8 units.  Other than those two things i can recomend this game to those who enjoy turn based strategy and are a fan of batteltech games. It's good fun when you are doing a mission and not just staring at the ship screen. I did one mission with my lance verus 12 light mechs. It was a fun brawl. The game has many moments like that.  8/10",1609565976,1657612543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

BattleTech, I mean come on...Basic 3025 rules...Graphics...Story...Progression of difficulty/progression of mechs... difficulty, can make it as hard or easy as you like... Very similar feel to table top

Cons :
Time, after about 30 hours you don't see new mechs... Replay value... Size of your company, limit is 4 and so it is ultimately a race to the assault Mechs

I cannot say anything toward online since I have not played it.

I have played this game a lot and continue to come back regardless of lack of new Mechs or new content. I have loved Battletech since my dad introduced table top and the novels to me. I am hopefully for a sequel or new game like this. Ideally if they were to look back on MechCommander 2 and implement more elements of that and essentially combine the two games it would be excellent.

Battletech universe is also very fun world to explore. Plenty of interesting books to read about it.

I play career, it's fun, but there are of course, some elements that are bad. Like you go and do 1.5 skull mission, should be fair since your tonnage is the same, but you can encounter 8 mechs at same time, and one will be heavy... because I chose more cash? Seems like sometimes mission difficulty is not properly displayed.

Also, not big choice of starting mechs. Since I play on hardest, I failed a few times, it was enjoyable and I started again. I had to change game file to add more different mechs, so that random starting mechs will be more interesting, and starting again would be a new experience.

To change starting mechs you need to go to:
F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\BATTLETECH\BattleTech_Data\StreamingAssets\data\itemCollections and open files ""itemCollection_Mechs_Starting_0"" 1,2,3 and 4 and add mechs you want there. List of mechs you can get in nearby folder /Mechs, you shall see things like ""mechdef_urbanmech_UM-R90"" there, that's what you need to add in line.

First 4 hours are terrific. Everything after you hit ""Liberate Smithon"" is un-fun, un-fair and downright impossible to ""tactics"" your way around. Unless you got super lucky with lootpools/stores, every mission that you unlock after ""Liberate Panzyr"" becomes a big pile of asscheeks. 

I could understand if you had the ability to field more than 4 mechs at a time. The fact that an enemy group outnumbers you anywhere from 2-3:1 while having no maluses to their damage/armor/whatever and they just BUMRUSH you makes the game un-enjoyable. 

The AI always seems to randomly pick out a mech on your side and just pummel it until it no longer exists. And because there are so many more of them than you, losing 1 mech means you have to kill at least 3 of theirs just to stay even. Except that's goddamn impossible because once you reach ""Liberate Smithon"" they start fielding heavies en mass. I didn't even have 1 heavy and they're fielding 5 heavies and 3 mediums on a 2-skull difficulty mission. Who the actual hell designed this difficulty spike? I tried REALLY damn hard to enjoy this game. I started over so many times trying to have better luck with acquiring better mechs. Managed to get past Smithson my third time through. Then the difficulty got worse after that. To top it all off, even if you have 10 gunnery on a mechwarrior, you will still miss more than 50% of your shots. I've tried every single strategy I can think of.

Try to draw them out? They clump up and destroy you. Try to blitzkrieg the big damage guys? They survive and obliterate your mechs one at a time. Sit behind a mountain and hit them with LRM's? You run out of ammo and they walk their happy ass around the mountain and kill you. 

I've tried more gun less armor. I've tried less gun MORE armor. I've tried melee. I've tried long range. I've tried diversifying. I've even tried to make light mechs useful.

The game can feel abit tedious at times, but I liked the story/campaign and I beefed up my team first with side missions before tackling the near-end campaigns.

There are alot of talks about the Mods which practically changes the gameplay but as mentioned haven't tried and don't think i'll have the time to do so.

Campaign (I have not messed with the multiplayer at all)
You end up joing then leading a merc company during what ammounts to a civilwar between the true heir and a usurper of small nation located a corner of the innershere of known space, I have yet to finish but so far so good. 

Ultmately this game has too many proboblems (even when not compared to its predisecors) for ME to really enjoy it, and I only keep playing out of stubborness to finish it. below is a list of some of the more major issues for you tojudge for your selves

Complaints 
1. WAY too much micro managing of things that don't really matter and not enough managing of things that do. 
2. Equipment is too hard to come by, you can have all the money in the game and the store has nothing you want to buy, also mechs are virtually nonexistant in stores.
3. Lighter mechs have no purpose. You never use them again after you get a full lance of mediums.
4. Combat takes WAY too long even for a stragity game, here are three primary reasons why.
you can speed up (2x) your movement but not the enemy's, ""Bullet"" travel time takes way too long and cannot be speed up at all, and after most every action friendly or enemy you have to listen to your lancemates make some stupid quip of one kind or another ""I'm taking a pounding commander"" no @#$% I just saw it (if this can be turned off I have no idea how).
5. Not enough information on mission briefings, not much more to say other than how to improve the issue.
6. Mech repair and modification takes WAYYYYYYYYY too long (in game months or more), and only one mech can be serviced at a time making them take even longer. Also you cannot modify a mech's engine power to increase or decrease its movement speed or in this case distance per round.
7. Called shots are WAY too inaccurate even when the pilot has maxed out stats.
8. The rate of pilot exp gain is way too slow forceing you to restart the mission rather than lose a pilot, defeating the purpose of the hireing mechanic in the game, and slowing down your rate of progression exponentally.
9. Mission payment SUCKS GIANT ELEPHANT BALLS, You get three things for payment Money, Salvage, and Reputation which would be great if they did not make you choose between them (execpt for story missions). either you get one of them, or a CRAPPY balance of two, or a literally unsustainable balance of all three.
You need money to pay your crew and for ship up keep no money = game over.
Due to #3 salvage is pretty much the ONLY option to increase your strength, especially early on.
Reputation is how you get better missions thus better money and salvage, it also gives a discount for the store.

So yeah I can see how this could be a fun game for some people and is even kind of fun for me, but personally it needs a lot of work and is not my thing. But because everything is so slow, I played too many hours before I could relise it, and Steam would not let me return it. My advice if you just want to kind of mess around with it from time to time feel free, but if you want a serious battletech/mechwarrior or even just strategy game experiance DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!",1540935073,1656999473,False,7,0,0.476813256740570068,0,True,False,False

 Careful how you manage your funds in the career game as it could lead to you heading for bankrupsy for your mercenary company.  This game also has a lot of mod support so that is another big +.

Ended up installing Roguetech and felt it was the definitive version. After awhile though I had to change my opinion. While Roguetech offers a vast array of content, the devs cannot seem to help but make the game aggressively obnoxious. Your mechs to hit ratio plummets while the enemy will pick you a mile off. The worst part is the enemy dropships. Every damn mission seems to need to drop 4 lances on you, and in such a fashion that just strips your understanding of how long a mission is going to actually take. What gets defined as ""Difficult"", just becomes a painful practice of having to fit through a pinhole of success. I did not mind this on occasion but it's just too damn consistent. For whatever reason you can't save mid mission, which would fix a lot of this, though I'm def not a fan of a 30 minute mission becoming hours long because they would rather drop a bunch of shit mechs against you, forcing chess more than a fun experience. If you cant add a save feature for the love of fuck drop bigger mechs instead constantly filling the damn map with over 20 mechs. again fun on occasion, a goddamn chore when it's literally every fucking mission. It stopped being difficult several lances ago, Now it's just a perpetual practice in being abused until you magically figure out the dick hole sized hoop you have to jump through to finish ANY mission. It's like every mech warrior in the universe is the exact same skill level and it makes the mod extremely boring. It's absurd they even imply playing this hardcore, maybe the devs have their entire lives to waste playing this game, but most of us have jobs, families, friends, ambitions, you know, a life. 

On top of this their discord was highly toxic. Hard to get straight answers out of the most common to respond, due to sideways responses and backhanded answers, making me feel a lot of them are using the group just to abuse power and act bigoted towards other people. While there are those who seemed to give straight answers on occasion, for the most part it's the abusive ones responding, and no one seems to keep them in check or call them out on it. Creating an abusive norm that many seem to simply defend for privileges of the group members. 

Battletech is still epic, but until roguetech devs address the interests of more people it will be a niche concept only those with literally the most available extra time will have access to.

Does it run well? No. Long load in screens, lots of lag, and it uses far more ram than most turn based strategy games. For every 20 min mission you will have 10 min of loading before and after.

Does the game respond to player imputs well? No, however this seems to be a reoccurring issue with many turn based strategy games. Some (like Crown of the Magister) are better at this than others (like this or xcom 2).

Does the game properly explain mechanics? No. This seems to be a reoccurring theme with Paradox games, and while not as bad as Crusader Kings (the joke about that series being that you need to watch several hours of youtube to even begin to understand the mechanics), it leaves much to be desired.

Is this game difficult? Yes. Is this game challenging? No. The difference here being ""challenging"" being fair with difficulty and what the player will come up against, and the ability of the player to conquer with the tools they have available, while ""difficult"" being given sisyphian tasks you are doomed to fail with catastrophic consequences.

Is this game fun? No. You do not feel a sense of accomplishment upon completing a difficult mission; rather, you feel a sense of relief when you are done, akin to being able to get away from an abusive relative or job.

Try to anticipate the direction of reinforcements' arrival, and plan your attack accordingly. When they show up, move away from their line of approach while continuing to engage the original force.

Overall, this game captures the setting and feel of the southern periphery during 3060, but the actual game itself is a bold money grab, and nothing more. The actual mechanics of the game are wonderful, but are completely buried under the ridiculously overbearing AI. I mean, even at normal, you will struggle vehemently against the AI and you will find that you get handicapped horrifically even at basic levels of difficulty. Expect to miss atleast 60% of all the shots you take at normal, and 95% of the shots for all difficulties above. At normal though, the AI will easily smash 80-95% of all the shots it takes. Even having run for miles and only equipped with medium lasers, you will be absolutely bracketed by the AI in this game while  your AC20s miss all game and your large lasers glance harmlessly off light mechs that should be turned to scrap. Only the PPCs are worth taking on any mech, and you eventually grow tired of watching your character die and have to replay the mission endlessly till you suceed or create a new save file. Id suggest never putting your character into your heaviest mech, as the AI is obviously trained to focus on the heaviest mech first, whittle it down to scrap, and work its way down as though its a talented Mechwarrior Major who has 20 years of expierence in combat, at NORMAL level difficulty. DO NOT take this game to hard unless you have balls of steel and the ability to mind read computers. Its unreal, and Ive played a LOT of hard campaigns.

The combat system is perfectly suited to giant stompy towers of scrap and guns beating the crap out of each other. It's appropriately slower paced than XCOM and many other turn based strategy games, and the risk management of deciding which sides of your mechwarrior's mechs to expose to incoming fire is tense and anxiety-inducing in the best ways. Losing a mechwarrior that you've built up from green recruit to a customized professional hurts just as much as it should. The strategic layer is just complex enough to make it interesting, with little narrative flourishes and vignettes that work surprisingly well to invest you in the management of your mercenary company.

I also need to mention the campaign's narrative as a particularly standout aspect of this. Mechwarrior games tend to have barely-there narratives that just serve to move you from one nameless battle site to the next. And this game's campaign is actually a pretty simple story: a noble loses their house in a betrayal and you fight a series of battles to get it back for them.

I wanted to like the game but it's just too frustrating of an experience to get a recommend vote. Performance and technical issues set the stage that even after significant tweaking where I was finally able to get it to run somewhat smoothly it is still often a gamble whether it will  be able to load a save. There's not really anything with the graphics that should be bogging the engine down like that nor can the map size or the number of units on the field at any one time be called anything but small scale.

Creating, managing your merc outfit and of course upgrading the mechs is great and all...

...but then you get to the actual fighting where like so many games before it the subpar performing AI is supplemented by simply throwing more enemies at the player. Too many of the battles are just your one small lance fighting through X number of enemy reinforcement waves one after the other or even better just filling the map with enemy LRM carriers and turrets. Slowly paging through enemy turns praying that the RNG gods are in your favor every time you get get spammed by  waves of missiles from across the map that your tiny lance can't even begin to address until you take out the fresh enemy mechs that keep dropping on your flanks.

 Despite all that you win and now you get to wait staring at the ship screen even longer for your injured pilots and mechs run through the wringer to recover and be repaired. All the well designed mechanics requiring careful mech movement and placement, considering terrain advantages and disadvantages and with one of the DLCs utilizing stealth is just ruined by the constant and repetitive cheesing of the AI OpFor.

Winning requires you to invest attention to detail. How can I build a 'Mech that works well with a certain set of Mechwarrior skills? How can I position my units on the field to take advantage of the terrain? Where is my opponent going to be in X-many turns and how can I turn that to my advantage? When should I reserve pilots for the next action phase?

Throughout playtime I've not experienced any bugs or performance issues. The game plays smoothly and looks great. Story mode is pretty solid, there's a decent amount of voice-acted cutscenes which help although I'd like to see more!

Gameplay is great. Most missions require you to adapt your tactics to changing circumstances, whether that is enemy reinforcements dropping in to flank you, or pushing into an capture-objective and finding yourself surrounded. Frustrating in the short term if you're taking fire from all sides - but extremely rewarding when you manage to outmaneuver your enemies and dakka them into tiny pieces. That said, don't expect to come out of levels unscathed. You're going to lose body parts, entire mechs and pilots. There is rarely a level where you are not outnumbered, so tactics are key. Random events in transit between systems keep you invested in your crew and results in rarely a dull moment - even outside of combat, you're faced with no shortage of difficult decisions.

I've soaked 53 hours into this and expect to soak plenty more. Highly recommend if you're either a fan of the Battletech universe or a complete newcomer. Next step is to grab the DLC!",1654990361,1654990361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game game with the DLCs is good but not great. As others have mentioned a couple more passes to work out the remaining kinks would be great. However, if you want a true Battletech experience head over to Mods-in-exile and download Roguetech.

This mod brings the Battletech universe to life. There are three maps to choose from. An online map for those who like playing against others and two offline maps. One, the Inner Sphere at the time of the 4th Succession War and the other the Inner Sphere in 3080. The maps include Clan space.

The features in this Mod are nothing but extraordinary
-Thousands of mechs, vehicles and battlearmor, including Superheavies up to 200 tonnes
-A living map where factions attack each other with planets changing owners
-Battlearmor that ride Omnimech or vehicles and can use swarm attacks.
-Areospace strafing runs
-Custom pilots
-Custom missions
-820 ton drop limit, but three lances (one of which is for BA only)
-Custom game settings where you can add and subtract what elements you want to play with
-And so many others.

Every weapon serves a purpose and there aren't any that are useless.  The mercenary company management could have been explored more and the missions are very samey after a while.  My biggest nit pick is the voice acting.  Its pretty random, some text boxes are voice acted when a character talks, but not others by the same character in the same scene.  There's multiple such scenes where they only voice act every other text box by the character, and its weird and lazy and stupid and bugs me.

The missions are repetitive, the maps the same and the campaing too short. That procedural garbage they have sell us is that, garbage. The only thing that change in the missions is the objetive and the type and quantity of mech you have to face. After doing the four or five different objetives you are going to be doing the same time and again. Not even the opfor is varied at all. You are going to find 2 enemy lances or one and armored units. 

The campaing are a few missions only but at least they are actually designed and offer some challenge.

The graphics are good but feel a little outdated but that dont bother me in the least. Is the really outdated game mechanics who kill the game for me. Deploy, go kill the enemy lance, do objetive, kill second enemy lance. Rinse and repeat.

Thats all the game as to offer.

One of the most stupid things in the game is, despite you can fight in a thousand worlds, all the terrain is the same! It can be snow, forest or desert is always in mountains! Theres no even one map of plains! Forgot about plains and savana, for they have been forgoten, never to be seen again. Forgot about jungle and plateaus, in the grim dark future of battletechs theres only mountains. There is no plains amongst the stars, only an eternity of mountains and bad terrain, and the laughter of stupid developers.

I love battletech and its lore, the gameplay is solid and the mechs are fun, but... the game cheats, it cheats to no end. 

I'll likely come back to it again, but at this point, much of the joy is gone, and I have just wasted my time with it. Some of the missions are bugged, and unless you're scumming, you're going to fail all the damn time.

Big problem, you're always the underdog, always. unless you drop a Stiner Lance, you're going to get outnumbered, and lose a mech, if not a pilot. Going into a fight with a lance of matching level will see you outnumbered, which is fine, accepted the reinforcements often show up as soon as the battle starts, not three turns later with a countdown, no right away, and they always have LMR. thuse you start almost every fight against 2 lances, with missiles raining on you. Sometimes the reinforcements appear right next to you, so your fighting a battle on two fronts. On top of theat, they often just target one mech to the point of ignoring bigger threats.

One time I had a three way battle, and one enemy could only shoot at me as four mech were punding it in the back… and I had not shot at it once. It died, then the other enemies focused solely on me… I lost that one because my heavy hitter lost it’s main gun three rounds into the fight…

Also, I don’t know why, but the repair time for mech are never as it tells me when I start them. One time I had a mech go straight back to the repair bay after finishing, effectively putting it 40 days until I could use it when I was told it would take 15. Another time I got a game over when I still had a month left of C-bills, and deleted the save…

Another problem is that call shots are almost useless, your mechs almost never hit what you're telling them to, so it’s only worth the 10% bonus to hit the mech. Need to take out their legs, they only hit the one arm that has no damage. Need to core them right there, they shoot the undamaged legs. Need to take out their guns, they shoot only the parts with no guns. Oh and they never hit the head when you tell them to, unless you're super mega lucky. You’re almost never guaranteed to not core out a mech you want to salvage unless you save scum it, which is not fun.

Worst of all, my favorite mech, the Big Steel Claw, has such a broken Flashpoint that I had to restart the game several times to get it, and every time something goes wrong. One time the mission disappeared as I was doing it, finished part one of three, and then nothing else. Two times it just vanished from the map when I went to do it. Two other times it never shows up, ever! This game takes days to get to a point where you're good enough to tackle it, to a point you have good mechs to rely on… having to restart time and time again and it is just frustrating, and I’m done.

It’s a good game, and the main story is fun, but career mode is just not. I want to play steelman mode, and I try, but the game cheats so damn much that it’s not worth it. A lot of their problems have simple fixes, but Paradox never cared enough to fix them and make a smoother game. The worst part, it takes a lot of time to figure this out, and by then you have wasted so much time getting there.",1524622268,1653377079,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are afew things that keep this from being a good game however. First the game has an annoying way of making the missions difficult. Instead of making the AI slowly get harder and harder their idea of ""difficult"" is just to double the enemies to give the player a harder time. This makes the game tedious and whenever a completed the mission I felt relieved it was finally over instead of joy that I completed a difficult mission. Second the weapons rely too much on RNG. There are many times that the weapons would be set at 30% accuracy and would miss even when pointed at a 90 ton mech at point blank range. I understand there are different ranges on weapons but logically this is just stupid. Finally you can't actually buy new mechs. You can purchase a third of a mech but you have to pray that you get to fight the mech you want in a future mission to collect the other two thirds. There are alot of interesting mechs in the game but I never got to use them because the devs decided you can't save up money to purchase a mech. Mechs should just be sold at a higher mark up price.

Good game if you like Battletech or ever played the Mechcommander games, or just enjoy turned based games in general. Lots of roughness around the edges which is typical for Harebrained Schemes, but just like their Shadowrun offerings you get a feel for the world and the combat is pretty good as well.

Story is okay, servicable. Keep in mind most of the game consist of short mercenary missions and you will never command more than four mechs at a time with limited mission scope. Customization, while maybe shallower than it could've been, is actually pretty satisfying. You can beat the game with normal mechs, but spending some time in the mechlab will result in some very rewarding and powerful configurations. Replay value is fairly high, the campaign plus the flashpoints gives many hours on each playthrough. That being said, don't expect a campaign with a lot of scripted setpieces or else. Most of the story is dialogue trees and static cutscenes, although they are fairly well done.
Gameplay rules and systems are actually pretty simple, but the tutorial is not great. I would suggest looking up a video or two. Initiative is king and waiting is actually very important. Much of the difficulty in the early game revolves around building up a stable of well-trained pilots and getting larger mechs. Fans of the Battletech universe might be upset that the endgame revolves around lances comprising exclusively of Assault Mechs duking it out. 
Music is awesome, sound is very good, art design is great. Gameplay visuals are meh, but the mechs look good.

The game has enough depth in its stock configuration, but mods help a lot. I would caution against installing Roguetech or BTA3062 right away as they are best played after having a good grasp on normal game mechanics, have considerably higher difficulty, and should likely be played alongside their wikis and manuals.
Mods I think would be good for a first playthrough are:
PanicSystem - Makes pilot AI more real, enemies will eject instead of fighting hopeless battles
FasterTurn - speeds up turn phases
Arano Flashpoint and Travel Unlock - gives you more access to worlds during campaign
Flashpoints worthwhile rewards - when paired with the previous mod, will incentivize flashpoints (only useful if you have DLC) 

I would also highly suggest that you use the menu options to speed up combat and play the game more as a top-down RTS. After a while the pauses in gameplay for camera changes really start to add up.

The DLC is good, but way too expensive and should really be part of the basegame. Get it on sale or if you really like the game.",1653199277,1653250812,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is a very nice introduction into the greater Battletech universe. Focussed on the periphery and the challenges these smaller nations face adds a certain vibe that I enjoy tremendously. 
All of the fun bits of Battletech are introduced at digestable levels. Be it refitting mechs, tactical combat, the joy and sorrow of critical hits, management of your company, and trying to keep faction happy enough to offer jobs for you. Add in a very interesting story and another interesting story in the dlc - great. And if you want to have even more intricate control, more mechs, etc there are a ton of mods, that are extremely enjoyable (namely you BTA3062 and RogueTech, there are more, but those are only ones I played).
Considering I spent over 1600 hours with Battletech to this date, I am confident in saying, this game is a bargain for what you can get out of it.

The combat can be fun, there is a lot of replay value, and the lore is great in this game.

I purchased this game, and all the expansions, last year. I put a couple hundred hours into it and intended to come back after I played through some other games I had waiting. Well this year, I upgraded my gaming rig. With that came a new Windows 11 OS. Apparently there is a bug that makes it so that the Steam Overlay, and Big Picture, support no longer works with this game with Windows 11. With that, I also lost controller support for the game. 

 Now I have long term back injuries that prevent me from sitting up at a computer desk for long hours at a time. I play 90% of my games with a controller and controller support is something important to me when I make a game purchase. When I filed a support ticket with Paradox to try to get this addressed I was told that they would not be fixing this. Windows 11 came out after they stopped making content for this game so they can not be bothered.

They certainly can be bothered to take your money though for this game though.. they just wont fix anything if it goes wrong.

Amazing campaign, career mode is also nice.

What I see as disadvantages:
- some animations in space that need to be watched hundreds of times cannot be interrupted (if someone from the developers read this I would be obliged if it was fixed)
- light and medium mechs at a certain stage of the game become useless and the whole goal of the game, especially in the career mode, is to collect the largest mechs and smash and grind easier missions, which makes the game a little losing its flavor after a few hours of returning to it, when you already have solid team, it gets boring.

1. Make repairs parallel (currently only 1 mech can be repaired at a time)
2. Give contracts in batches: like the one story mission, almost every mission could have several engagements so that you need to immediately replace broken mechs.
3. More missions with do not end with ""kill all"" (currently even if there is some ""run away"" task in the end, it is generally faster to just kill the last few baddies)
4. Tonnage limit to missions to incentivize usage of smaller mechs
5. very different opponent configuration (long range vs melee for example) and info about it beforehand

Even though I´m not a big fan of turn-based strategy games, I can safely say that BATTLETECH is the best one I´ve played 
so far. 
There´s a ton of different 'Mechs to choose from, some of them even having multiple variants. Finding the right one for a specific use-case and playstyle is time-consuming but nevertheless fun. The huge assortment of weapons and upgrades give you an quite a lot of options for customization, though you are a limited by what hardpoints your chosen 'Mech is equipped with. You´re also able to customize your pilots in both looks and skills, so that they truly feel like your pilots.However, the skill tree is fairly limited, so that most pilots will either have very similar or identical abilities, with
some of them being being almost OP (Bulwark) and should be on every character.
The tactical depth of the game was way deeper than they initially seemed. Factors like positioning, biome effects, terrain, what weapon to use and when to use it, heat management and module damage influence the result of the battle quite a bit. Entire battles can be decided just by who has positioned their 'Mechs better.
The story is, although predictable and nothing new, still fairly enjoyable. It had a couple too many ""we barely made it"" situations for my taste, but it was still interesting enough to make me finish the story. The characters of the story that I called my crew were all likable and quite believable ones. Them acting throughout the story rather than dumping a whole lot of exposition on me contributed positively to how I viewed them. They are Mercs, not lecturers. It´s their job to act and not to recite the Wikipedia pages about the Succession Wars to me.

[h1]Pro[/h1]
- 'Mechs: There´s so many of them. Ranging from small bipedal 'Mechs to gigantic 100 tonne crabs. There´s at least one for
every kind of scenario or play style. They not only look fantastic in regards to how much detail they added to every one of them, you can also fell their weight by how they move, attack and being hit. Them toppling over after being destroyed never gets old.
- Weapons: With 4 weapon categories and multiple different weapons per category, you have more that enough to choose from. No weapon (apart from maybe the DLC ones) is truly the best one. They all come with their strengths and weaknesses. Most weapons are made with a specific purpose in mind, while some are for a more general usage. Finding out a weapons best use-case is a big part of the fun.
- Tactics: The basics are easy to understand, but quickly run into quite a bit of depth. Your goals is to maximize your damage at any given time with the tools your have, but  getting there is not always easy. What´s the position for my 'Mech to deal a good amount of damage but also not be too vulnerable myself? Which target to I shoot first? What part of that 'Mech do I prioritize destroying? Do I risk overheating and deal a bit more damage or do I play it more safe? Is it worth it for me to change positons or should I entrench? There´s more to consider than that and an ideal outcome is rarely achievable.
- Rules apply to all: As far as I could tell, both side have access to the same 'Mechs, weapons, upgrades, skills and mechanics. Their 'Mechs have the same hardpoints and limitations as yours. They are subject to the same dice rolls you are and do not get a NPC-muliplier to give them an unfair advantage. On the battlefield, we all are equal.
- Grind: The grind was fun throughout and only lost I interest after assembling my dream lance, making every salvaged piece of equipment after that point a bit pointless. It was a nice design decision to reward me for destroying the enemy 'Mechs more intelligently. Rather than destroying most of the 'Mech and only get a single piece of it as salvage, you can destroy only it´s legs to gain 2 parts or only destroy its head to gain all 3. It is obviously harder to achieve these kind of result, but it´s more than worth it. Money is only a problem in the early stages of the game, especially when are not shying away from taking every job and destroying your reputation with everyone in the process.
- Map variety: There´s a good amount of variety of maps for your 'Mech-on-'Mech battles. Not only in layout, but also in status effects. Some maps have long roads, that increase your 'Mechs movement speed. Others feature a Desert biome that decreases your 'Mechs ability to cool down.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Animation duration: Everything takes so damn long. Long animation when they walk, long animation when they shooting and a long animation when they die. Why can´t I skip the walking animation? Why does the skip-function, triggered by the space bar, not skip the walking animation but accelerate only 2/3 of it?
- Loading times: They do can be quite bad at times no matter your specs, but luckily are not happening all too often. Most actions´ loading times range from minor to acceptable, but there are a few that are somewhat long and annoying: Opening the store for the first time (After loading AND after entering a new system), loading the map for the upcoming battle, restarting the mission, repairing 'Mechs (rare), transition from battle summary screen to your main menu
- Enemy numbers: Why do I have to sometimes fight 8+ enemy 'Mechs at the same time, while I am only allowed to bring 4 'Mechs with me? I get that they wanted to make the game challenging, but there´s better ways to do that. Apply the rules to both sides equally, it makes for a better experience.
- Black Market: All the good weapons (and some 'Mechs?) are only found on the Black Market. The event that gives you the option is completely random, so you may envouter it in your first 100 in-game weeks or maybe never. The price you have to pay, as well as the prices of the Black Market products depend on your reputation with the Pirates. If you damaged your reputation with them too much by fighting them one too many times, you cannot regain said reputation as they simply refuse to give you any missions. If you´re loathed by the Pirates, you´ll have to pay a markup of +100%, which makes some 'Mechs cost 100Mill+ C-Bills.
- Product availability: Depending on the planet attribute, different systems stock different kinds of weapons. However, it is never guaranteed that an item will be available, even if all conditions have been met. This is also true for the Black Market.
This makes it so that if you look for a specific weapon, you have to jump to multiple systems in succession, only to be out of luck every time because the game´s dice said so. Because of this, acquiring the desired item gets frustrating and quite time consuming incredible fast.
- Max size of lance: You can ready up to 18 'Mechs at once, yet you´re only able to use 4 of them at the same time. Every 'Mech that is ready for service increases your monthly bill, no matter if you actively use them or are gathering dust. The same thing applies to your pilots.

With all that said, I enjoyed my time with BATTLETECH. Using your 'Mechs to wreck havoc onto the non-believers is both fun and rewarding. The weapon effects and sound beautiful and awesome. There´s also enough tactical depth to the game to make even later battles feel like a puzzle.
After taking a bit of time off of BATTLETECH, I can´t wait to dive back in again and play the DLC´s.

It has a rough and unfinished feel to it in places, but the overall experience is satisfying enough to be worth playing for the dozens of hours required to complete its Campaign and Career modes.

What's good about this game:
* The combat engine is visually appealing, with zooms and pans of the mechs (and their distinctive profiles) during attacks. Everyone once in a while there's a battle in one of the urban areas from the DLC, and you'll be reminded of just how massive and destructive they really are, as skyscrapers crash to the ground around them.
* The weapon choices, while not implemented exactly as in the tabletop rules, do a good job of replicating the hard choices between burst and sustained damage output, and between damage and durability.
* The writing for the campaign is solid and well-edited, and gives a good introduction to the Battletech universe for someone encountering it for the first time. This is ""Battletech 101"" in terms of narrative complexity, which is probably better for beginners than for veterans, but I never felt overwhelmed by lore-dump.
* Difficulty is very easily adjusted to match playstyle. I ended up creating an ""easy ironman"" game that forced me to live with the consequences of mistakes, but still didn't seem overwhelming hard for a first time play-through. All games should work like this.
* The music and (mostly non-animated) cutscenes have a classy retro feel that calls back to the 80s-era origins of the Battletech universe. The campaign plot itself is nothing remarkable, but the writing and voiceovers really sell you on the idea of late-medieval post-feudalism politics in space, where the era of noble star knights has collapsed into a broken world of mercenaries and pirates.

What I wish were different:
* The handful of scripted missions (of 8 or so types) quickly become repetitive. The best improvement to this game would be to triple the number of mission types, in particular by providing more missions that are well-suited to a mixture of different size classes. For example, the obvious idea of having a mission that requires a separate scout lance and assault lance is never implemented. In fact, all the missions are single-lance, and all but a couple will be best completed by the largest number of assault mechs you can field. There's rarely any reason to split up your mechs either. Just cluster them together and focus-fire down new targets as they appear. The AI isn't good enough to deal with brute force, although it would probably be adequate for more highly scripted missions that force hard player decisions. (Indeed, the Campaign story missions are often more fun than the procedural Career missions for this reason, at least the first time through.) 
* The campaign/career structure encourages risk-averse behavior. A harder mission may pay better, but the risk of losing a valuable pilot is high enough that the optimal strategy is usually to do two milk runs instead of a single challenging mission. Combined with the repetitiveness, this makes the game feel like its punishing me for trying to play it in a more interesting way. (At least the scoring system in Career creates incentives to find some kind of optimum in time efficiency.)
* The strategic overlay on the game (engineering and budget management) creates relatively few interesting choices. Maintaining a huge mech isn't really any more expensive than a tiny one, so you quickly learn not to waste money on special-purpose light mechs you'll rarely lose. The engineering bays allow you have up to 18 mechs readied and available, but I never really bothered to use even the 12 slots I got after the first ship upgrade. Other ship upgrades have minimal or uninteresting effects, and hardly seem worth the money.

Note that this is a very modable game and some of its problems have been addressed by work in its extensive mod community. I haven't tried playing the overhaul mods yet, but I can already see how they could improve the quality of the game substantially.",1650727263,1650727263,True,1,0,0.514784932136535645,0,True,False,False

I highly recommend this game even moreso if you want to mod it.

==========================================
This game is very accurate to the mech warrior universe. It is turn based not RTS but it plays very well. All weapon styles are viable with a bit of a lean toward lasers (ballistic weigh a lot for what they are and are more prone to being shot off since you can mount 3 LG lasers in separate places for 1 AC20 and still have room for additional armor) Missiles are fairly powerful and useful. Pilots are vitally important and have key skills that will mean make the difference between life or death.

The unit customization is extensive and so far my favorite build for skirmishs is a full lance of Catapult C-4's using 4 SRM6's each (it is quite powerful!) The key bit of advice i would give to new players is weapon fire is calculated per projectile not per volley of fire (meaning if i fire 20 missiles with a 25% hit rate then around 5 missiles will hit give or take vs a 90% hit rate in which virtually all will hit) The reason i point this out is that slow firing heavy hitting weapons tend to be very bad at killing fast moving targets but smaller weapons that fire many shots excel at inflicting at least light damage for each volley fired though. 

Overall gameplay
Great, high replayability, and fair to high challenge in campaign due to the economic factors.

Story
Limited rather standard strategy game story but can be fixed with mods via the nexus.

Tactics/strategy skill level
Fair to high depending on play. Lights are much more punishing to poor strat and tactics than an assault for example in most situations (though if you dont take care of your assault it can get stuck in bad situations and be unable to flee.)

RNG bullshit
compared to other titles the RNG here is actually nice. Hits tend to hit consistently with their % chances and definately NEVER lost a mech to a 1% headshot instakill though it is supposedly always possible if you get hit with a big gun like an AC20 in the cockpit. Missiles tend to get lots of random headshots but only a very small number actually inflict pilot injury. They also do too little damage and hit too inconsistantly to breach the armor of the cockpit by sheer chance alone. (SRM's do 8 damage a shot and cockpits have 45 armor plus 45 health meaning it will take 12 lucky 1% shots to the head to actually fully destroy it with missile spam alone. your mech would almost certainly be dead long before you are THAT unlucky. If you get hit by enough missiles for that to be a factor your doing something way wrong lol.)

Pilots:
This is not the first game to have crew members with experience but, this game pulls it off well without making rookies too underpowered or long run vets too overpowered. As pilots gain experience they can put skill into gunnery, piloting, guts, and tactics. Gunnery enhances base accuracy and negates many penalties when firing. Piloting makes you harder to knock down, harder to hit, more effective in melee (yeah mechs can punch and tackle.) and in general all around more agile. Guts increases health and allows you to use dangerously powerful high risk skills such as coolant vent which drains your heat to 0 to let you alpha much longer BUT, you take a heat penalty for the following turns which is severe so if you fail to win it may cost you in the end. Tactics allows you to be more effective at firing with intent (targeting specific things rather than just shooting in general) and indirect fire. One of the most OP abilities, Sensor lock, can reveal an opponent within sensor range but out of LOS. For example if they are behind a mountain you can spot them as well as reduce their ability to dodge. This allows you to use indirect fire without LOS and punishes camping severely. It also makes for very impressive tactical plays as you can dance around the terrain and use this ability to essentially whittle away a far superior foe until it is wounded enough to kill easily.

Economy:
depends largely on difficulty but can be extremely unforgiving. Mech purchace price is high and sell cost is about 10%ish. Generally better to just use credits for operating cost and repairs or the occasional improved techs and get your weapons and components from salvage. One misstep with your most important mech can cripple your team and put you out for a month in which time you may go bankrupt. This is easy to do early game at higher difficulties and yes sometimes you just get unlucky. I have been there where my heaviest mech lost its most important gun in the openning turns of a mission and resulted in a lot of long term financial woes to repair and replace. Try to use salvage to preemptively replace parts before they get blown off. it will happen. its life. embrace and prepare and you shall succeed.

Gameplay twists:
An extra element in this game which is vitally important but, not present anywhere else is the salvage mechanic. So as mentioned before you grab stuff off of blown up mechs BUT, it depends largely on how you boom them out of existence. If you unleash the whole of WW3 on their face expect nothing more than a busted up frame and scrap. Should you be smart, fast, and yes a little lucky you may snipe the head or destroy both legs preserving (hopefully) most of the armament in the torso and arms. This rewards players who play with tactical superiority and have the time to pick and chose how to pick apart their targets like a scalpel rather than rushing and alpha striking everything to a smoldering crater like some brute. IMO this adds a reward and at higher difficulties, almost a requirement, to play better and get more opportunities to snag some sick salvage to both lower your repair bill and get awesome upgrades and new mechs for your arsenal. Ignore this mechanic and you WILL have a bad time in the long run as badly wrecked mechs provide almost no weapons (all the weapons are in the torso and arms which generally tend to fail together as the arms take many of the missed torso hits and have less armor) leaving you with just the heatsinks and jumpjets in the legs which have virtually no worth and believe me you WILL have plenty of. 

DLC:
Generally overpriced bullshit. Get on discount it is important. Many mechs are however offered on the nexus as mods so if you dont care about the devs wallet much you can always just get the modded in versions.",1579550587,1650663026,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The day this game launched I had no idea it was even in the works. I was reminiscing about my days playing old Mechwarrior games and stumbled upon Battletech. I immediately downloaded it and nothing could prepare me for the enjoyment and nostalgia trip I was about to have. Even after the main story I keep returning to Battletech for the career mode.

[b]Cinematics[/b]
The opening cinematic still gives me goosebumps. The art style is really cool and the storytelling is very effective.

[b]Graphics[/b]
The game's UI is very user friendly and well designed. The game's graphics are aesthetically pleasing. The animations are great, seeing the arm of mech getting blown off is always epic.

[b]Music[/b]
The music is a perfect fit for the pacing of gameplay. Not too distracting, but amps up in those epic story moments when you feel every decision counts. They did a tremendous job capturing the atmosphere. It felt like a modern interpretation of the classic Mechwarrior 2 soundtrack.

[b]Story[/b]
I really enjoyed the story. Mechwarrior tends to recycle the same storyline again and again (don't get me started about Mechwarrior 5, what a bland and uninspired mess), but Battletech has great writing. The story felt akin to Firefly in the way it fleshed out a diverse crew with believable strengths and flaws. I thought they were all compelling and memorable characters. There were some truely epic scenes that played out incredibly through gameplay, and I enjoyed the written sections.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
I played the game at launch when one of the main critiques was the slow gameplay, but it hardly bothered me. The developers were quick to add more options to speed up gameplay so that's less of an issue. You can see how faithful and how much attention to detail was placed into bringing the table top board game to life. There are lots of enjoyable mechanics in the way the mechs operate that increase in complexity with each tier of mech and the skills of the mechwarrior operating them. Customising mechs is fun, and trying out different builds is rewarding. Salvaging parts on the battlefield is a fun challenge that always feels satisfying when you incapacitate the mechwarrior without damaging the mech for full salvage. Most of my hours have been spent playing the career mode and creating my own band of mechwarriors, I can honestly say I felt a deep shock and sadness when a long term pilot was killed in the battlefield on permadeath difficulty. The game continues to provide a strong challenge even after maxing out your mechs.",1650644414,1650647026,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I write this review having played a substantial amount of hours, and having seen it go through some adjustments.  I also own the additional content for it.

This is my perspective, taking into account it is based on a pen-and-paper role playing game and in many ways probably delivers on the computerization of that experience.

On one hand, the game can be very satisfying and fun, especially once you learn how things operate in terms of the dynamics of movement, turn-taking, and things that maximize your survival or effectiveness of your weapons.  The graphics are great, but more importantly, the game does seem to be very authentic in terms of the base game it represents and the rule set.  When things go well, you feel very good, and the game play between battles is done in a way that is an easily navigated but potentially deep simulation of running a mercenary company in space in the context of a larger adventure.

So why the negative review?  Because those same constraints can make a game session feel like a waste of time or less open-ended and open-world than one would want.  This is where a mediocre player like me, who wants to play this more like a military mercenary simulation, and less like a puzzle game, finds a lot of dissatisfaction.  I expect to get a lot of pushback around this from better players who relish puzzles where ""the one true solution"" gets them through what seem to me artificial constraints.

Example:  The ratings system is essentially broken in terms of difficulty.  There is a major mismatch between how your lance (group) of mech is rated vs. the competition on a map.  Because of apparent weaknesses in how the AI or ruleset operate (or both), the game throws quantity at your quality.  The enemy gets reinforcements -- you don't.  So while you may have done a great job of defeating your exact equal number in both quantity and strength, they are soon followed up by one or even two waves of similar mechs, which, if you don't have the right mix of units or right trick up your sleeve, ends up with you either losing entirely or at least major characters you had invested a lot of time and effort into.

Now, this is where there seems to be a major disagreement about what this game is.  The ""I love puzzles"" crowd will say this is the whole point of the game, to overcome those hurtles, and for them, it is usually an easier challenge than it is for those of us who do not enjoy puzzles as much as we want something that is closer to a military simulation.

I'm the latter -- I don't find it realistic that a group of mercenaries would be that much better than their competition with the same equipment or who would sign on to fight and probably die outnumbered if they don't figure out some kind of miracle save.  I would much rather have the option to have reinforcements and thus have a balanced battle where I have a true idea on the front end of the risk.  As it is, instead I end up having to play against lower-tier or lower-quality lances and missions vs. my own lances rating to get that effect.  I don't know that this is what the game designers intended, and it may be that what I like is not what Battletech was made for, either pencil-and-pen game or this version of it.

In that case, maybe this game is doing exactly what it should be doing for the majority of players, but from my perspective, this then becomes a puzzle game, not a military simulator.  Game, not ""reality,"" and the fourth wall is broken.  I personally resent having just one way (or one general way) to solve a mission, so from that perspective, too many times I have walked away after 2+ hours of trying to pass the same mission or set of missions, unhappy and feeling like I wasted my time.  From that perspective, I can't recommend this game to those who feel like I do.

If, on the other hand, you are a puzzle game person, who is patient, likes to try multiple approaches to the same problem without it feeling stale, and is more into beating the game than simulating fictional reality, this may well be the game for you.  If you loved the pen-and-pencil version, which probably didn't have reinforcements, this probably is an easy purchase to justify.",1578260566,1649663980,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

3, the story of the campaign is mediocre at best it is a cool story but does not really captivate and and draw the player in...

I am a long time fan of Battletech - MW2, MW4, MechCommander, Mech Assault, Mechwarrior: Dark Age Collectible Game, and Battletech itself.  

This game does not reflect anything about the Battletech universe.  The only similarity is in name and universe.  This game is not fun, the gameplay is boring, it takes the 35 year old ruleset of Battletech using simultaneous combat (such as you would see on today's battlefields or in any combat engagement) and reverts it to the 1700s for gentleman's warfare.  

The only reason they chose the slow and clunky gameplay style was for multiplayer which has been empty and dead since a month after release.  It forces you to move units by weight class (unless you just choose not to move), so you either wait until 6 mechs and tanks combine fire on one of your units or activate one of your units before the AI does it to you.  Light mechs are in even more jeopardy and time after time I find my units getting hosed down by entire lances before being able to shoot back, and that's if the game hasn't already blown off weapons.  

Four skull missions require at least two assault mechs.  The game becomes incredibly tedious and nonsensical once you really get the feeling of a massive dropship holding 12+ Battlemechs and you can never field more than four.  MW4 Mercs allowed us to pilot a mech, command two lances of four, and could still run dozens of AI friendlies and enemies - in the year 2000.  But don't worry, its not just irritating because you cant use your own units.  You will find missions where you face down 10, 15, or 20+ enemy Battlemechs, vehicles, and turrets.  The game will focus fire your heaviest mech and/or lance commander many times and no matter where you put them in the initiative, they will be shot, many times, by five or more units before they can do anything themselves.  This is not how Battletech works.

The Campaign is lazy and short.  You don't even participate in the final assault, or other major planetary campaign battles, and the lazy 2D motion art constantly uses repeats from the game intro, campaign intro, and in game scenes in the epilogue.  Flashpoints is separate from your actual campaign you have to do a separate playthrough.  

At some point it appears they have begun to make political statements.  One mission I just found out about was where a government was complaining about a heavily armed civilian population.  You could take on the mission and kill off the ""smugglers"" who were ensuring the population could defend itself from government overreach.  A real shame seeing how the game flopped entire on mechanics and over time they have sneaked in a political agenda.  Nothing ever went wrong by a government disarming a civilian population has it?

This game is an attrocious attempt at a video game, even worse so that it  embarasses the fiction.  This is a classic case of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""",1525075635,1649039458,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked the mw universe but never played another battletech game after that until now. I've only tried vanilla so far but I have had a ton of fun with it and about to do another run with mods.

The gameplay loop is pretty straightforward and rpg-like; you start with crap, make money and find salvage to build better mechs, and buy better weapons while working your way through the story or career. The missions stay fresh for awhile due to the variety of maps, opponents and landing zones even dong multiple assassination missions in a row. The combat is entertaining and fun, as there are multiple ways to bring a mech down whether through sheer damage, destabilizing them, melee attacks or just blowing their top off. I think most of my hours spent were tinkering with mechs in the bays between missions because I love the min/maxing and specializing units. One thing I didn't like about vanilla is that the smaller mechs are pretty useless as the game goes on. Yeah the smaller the mech, the harder it is to hit, but at a certain point there is 0 reason to use one over a fully kitted assault mech. Even for scouting, just sprint your assault mech forward and unleash hell because it can more than handle the hits and will also dish out heaps of damage. Flanking means less and less too when your assault mech can do so much alpha damage that the front armor may as well be paper. I have sniper mechs that can reliably headshot almost every turn but I digress.

Once you realize which mechs and weapons are the best, you don't really use anything else. I gave myself challenges aside from the mission difficulty by trying to use different sets of mechs or tonnage limits to keep it interesting too. 

Career mode is kind of bland for my taste, it leaves me wanting for more content or direction. Just playing for score on a time limit doesn't really do it for me, I was more or less expecting system take overs or some kind of territory wars. Nope, just open ended sandbox. Nothing is perfect I suppose.

[h2]RPG & campaign[/h2]
The RPG elements are really well introduced : you begin by choosing a background for your battlemech pilot.  The first campaign missions do a very good job at making you feel part of the story.  Afterwards, dialogue choices offer to either see your character as more of a loyal hero, more of a mercenary (not a bad thing), or a mix of both.  You lead a mercenary crew all in all.  You choose were you travel in a rather open-world galactic map, that is rather true to the original Mechwarrior lore!  You can even choose to ally yourself to some of the Houses (factions), pirates, or not. 

I just finished the campaign, but I took the time to do 96 mercenary contracts beforehand (over 160 hours), so you can imagine I enjoyed this game.

[h2]After the campaign[/h2]
Once you finish the campaign, you can choose to continue.  Logically you will want to add one or many DLCs (notably Flashpoints missions), maybe some of overhaul mods (or not), play multiplayer battles, etc.  Or you can be satisfied with the official campaign. 

[h2]How long to play the campaign[/h2]
I played 165 hours during that campaign :P  [b]My time is abnormal by the way: most players spend between 35 and 80 hours in the campaign[/b].  The norm being about 40 hours for those focusing on the campaign missions and not wanting to ""farm"" a lot.

[h2]Some flaws[/h2]
- The turn-based system they implemented does have annoyances, like enemies who drop in the area from space, move out-of-combat and have the Initiative (attack) before you can react (!!!).  That annoyed me the entire time I played. 

- Scouting is almost useless, except for rare situations where you might get a line of sight just outside radar range.  Your own scout triggers combat every time and initiative is fixed to mech size.  In practice, in 165 hours, I very rarely surprised my enemies, even though I tried every single mission.   Worst, sometimes by moving out of radar range, I would trigger the combat phase a second time, giving my enemies a free move!

- Light mechs quickly become useless, as you cannot really do hit and runs, though you *almost* can with a particular skill.  If you try that, at some point they will hit your light mech and your low damage just weakens your lance big time.  I quickly realized my recon mechwarrior should use very long ranged weapons (missiles notably) and a fast Heavy or Assault mech (I used a [i]Victor[/i] Assault mech with LRMs).

- Although the tactical system is very decent, they did not implement any penalty for moving/jumping before shooting.  If you shoot without moving... you get no advantage either.  Those points should be vanilla in my opinion, so I modded the game a bit to make it more like the tabletop game, without screwing up the game balance either.

- Each ""great House"" (main factions) are enemy to *everyone* else, so making an alliance is to lose all reputation with everyone else.  This hampers that RPG aspect.  You can still make the radical decision to serve *only* one House after the campaign, but only for the RP, because it is really not beneficial!

[h2]Quicktip for battlemech building[/h2]
Many mechs seem different, but have the same loadout capacity and speed for example.  To avoid wasting time and in-game money, just check the battlemech [b]loadout[/b] tonnage (the maximal armor, weapon and equipment tonnage) on the wiki fandom site:
https://battletech.fandom.com/wiki/Battlemechs

[h2]Recommended improvements players can make when playing the campaign[/h2]
i.e. they do not screw game balance. 
HOW TO : the developers have made it simpler to install mods, but you still need to know how... See note below**

a) [b]Walking before shooting = -1 aim[/b]. The impact is mild, but it also indirectly gives a small advantage if you do not move before shooting! 
How: changed all instances of ToHitSelfWalk = -1 in  file CombatGameConstants.json*

b) [b]Jumping before shooting = -2 aim[/b].
Jumping incurs a bit of [b]instability also[/b]. This makes jumping all the time more difficult.  It also affects enemies of course.  Note that this mod makes the ""Death from above"" manoeuver generate 4 instability bars instead of 3 (you can adjust StabilityDumpDFA in the file*). 
Mod - [i]Demanding Jumps[/i] : https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/527

c) [b]Injuries decrease a pilot's stats[/b] (Gunnery, Piloting, Tactics, NOT guts) temporarily until they are healed.  This is simple logic, not dramatic and improves the combat in my experience. 
Mod - [i]Injuries Hurt[/i] : https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/204
 
d) [b]UI now shows enemy pilot health[/b]. Very practical to know and fun.
Mod - [i]Pilot Health Popup[/i] : https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/209

e) When an enemy mech is destroyed with a melee hit, your pilot will not waste energy and ammo shooting it also with support weapons! 
Mod - [i]Don't Shoot The Dead[/i] : https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/549

f) Display real hit chances : displays more exact percentage chance to hit (ex.: 92%), rather than the vanilla rounded numbers (ex.: 90%).
Mod** - [i]Real Hit Chance[/i] : https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/90

e) [b]Initiative per mech speed instead of mech class[/b]. Only a few rare mechs have their initiative modified by this mod, so it is not a game changer, but feels more coherent. For example, the ultra fast [i]Cicada[/i] gets a fast Initiative even though it is a Medium mech.  The quicker Assault mechs, like the [i]Victor[/i], have Initiative 2 instead of 1.
Mod - [i]The Engine Initiative[/i] : https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/526

* You can tweak by hand many other aspects of the combat in CombatGameConstants.json* and other files.  The developers left those files unlocked on purpose, for freedom to mod. 

CombatGameConstants.json is located in : ...\Steam\steamapps\common\BATTLETECH\BattleTech_Data\StreamingAssets\data\constants

** [b]How to install mods[/b] :
a) In your game folder, you will see a folder called Mods 
b) In that Mods folder, [b]each mod must have its own folder[/b] 
c) Each mod folder *must* have a [i]mod.json[/i] file.
d) You will see in the game an official mod manager button, where you turn on/off any mods listed there. 

How to fix old mods : some older mods on the Nexus site were made before this system: you only need to apply points B and C (and D of course) to make them work.

[b]In the list above, only the mod [i]Display Real Hit Chances[/i] is missing the file mod.json[/b]. Just create a simple text file called mod.json [remove .txt of course] and use the text indicated below.

But I mostly just play skirmishes to kill time and give my brain a little workout. As someone who has played most of the MechWarrior and MechCommander games I highly recommend this. It's a bit smaller scale than MechCommander as you only command a single lance (4 mechs) and no vehicles the entire game but I don't think that's a bad thing. This emphasizes better tactical thinking and actually taking advantage of different kinds of weapons. For example, if you want to make one mech a missile boat and kill mechs from beyond that mechs visual range you can if you have another mech spotting. There's also knockdown of mechs that cause extra damage.

So far I've really enjoyed the tactical mechanics and the different maps. Build your own little mercenary army, blow up other mechs n'stuff. I especially like the aspect where I can choose to take cash, or salvage. The salvage ends up being more of a gamble, but on the right missions can make the deal way sweeter, so you get a little longerterm strategy dotted around, with what i consider really great tacticale gameplay.  

I wish there were more opportunity to command more mechs, I find the predominate single lance a bit boring.

In a way it is very much like playing the good old team17 worms but with a lot more definition and graphic rendition. The hub and game mechanics outside the rts map, where u quest and upgrade mechs and pilots etc, is simple enough to learn and fun, not overly complicated.

Just another game that focused more on graphics than gameplay. Very little replay value, it was painful to even finish the campaign. Relatively small maps means it's difficult to have an actual strategy, which some might argue is important in a turn based *strategy* game. The pre-battle hints given to you by Darius are rarely helpful, and sometimes the OPPOSITE of what you should do. ""Take a light lance that can move quick Commander!""- Mission turns out to be a lot of water (that slows down your mechs, removing the speed advantage) and the enemy is between you and your objective, so it's easier to simply destroy them with a heavier lance than spend 3 - 5 turns in their weapons range as you try to get past them in lightly armored mechs. In fact, I don't think I've played a single mission where taking anything other than your best Assault Mechs is a good idea. Even in a mission where an enemy APC needed to be stopped before it reached an allied hospital, an Assault Mech could have stopped the APC in time. Meanwhile I took one of the fastest mechs, like Darius recommended, and it had trouble destroying the APC because they had the same speed so I couldn't close in for a melee strike and didn't have enough firepower on the tiny mech to get through the armor.

Two of the biggest problems are related: Battlefeild/map knowledge and information on Mech specs. For some reason you are not allowed to view a map before launching. Sometimes when there is a lot of water you can take Mechs that sacrifice heat efficiency for firepower since standing in water gives you a large boost to heat sinking. As for Mechs, it would be nice if you could see which mechs have special modules without having to collect and build every single one. In maybe 200 hours of playtime I've found two that are definitely equipped with modules that boost damage with laser weapons, chance to hit with a called shot, and a lancewide defense bonus. At least one mech has double the base heat sinking ability, naturally sinking 60 heat instead of 30. None of them give you any indication that they are special in any way. Also, there is no indication of how much armor/weapons/equipment can be loaded on a mech. There's at least one Assault class mech at 90-95 tons that, when you strip the equipment and armor, only has 20-some tons available to work with. Meanwhile an Urbanmech is a light 30t that has 21t available to work with. So at 1/3 the weight it can equip just as much weapons/armor while having a much smaller profile which the game mechanics mean it is 15% harder to hit. PLUS the jump jets for a light mech weigh less, so you can have a jump capable 30t mech with all the same weapons and armor as a 90t Assault Mech. SMH.

At least they added a lot of graphics so they could jack up the price on a boring game, and included the option to choose your pronoun of he/she/they for pointless virtue signaling *eye roll*.

If this game gets you mad, giving it a chance was worth it for me and it probably helps to be a fan of the genre. I didn't start with the campaign. START WITH THE CAMPAIGN/STORY - I think think this is how you learn how to play.

Personally, I don't love Battletech for the Space Opera dramatics. I got straight to the shooting, and am currently loving the career mode - after a lot of brutal experimentation. Did I mention, the campaign apparently has the tutorial? I don't know for sure, because I'm having fun with the career mode. 
There's also help on the various dropship tabs - look for a blue '?' I haven't tried either yet. 

And so a 'quick' story
The game was hard, didn't feel balanced, and I struggled through a few near bankruptcy months where I had to sell mechs, fire wounded pilots and scrap until I figured things out. Pilots eventually gained experience, mechs get refitted while you re-attach limbs, things start coming together. My mechs got a little bigger - and I learned how to use 'initiative', terrain, evasion, range, heat and environment to my advantage. Mostly.

And today I saw a contract on another planet, 15 days out. 
Time for repairs. After a fight (in barracks) that I didn't mediate well two of my guys could cool off on the trip. During the trip, a mech pilot comes to me and wants to tinker with a laser. I say, ok. He doesn't blow us up but I lose a laser. I count this as a win. This kind of thing happens during the long weeks of dropship travel.
It's I nice role playing part of the game and something a combat video doesn't show. Worth mentioning. It can really change the mood. 

So on to the mission - I had seen this before, but this time an Assault Mech was on patrol and about to get jumped by another lance - so having done a mission like this before I saw the opportunity...

The Highlander came over a hill, chasing my 'firestarter' which sprints back to cover, meanwhile the other lance's Banshee climbs up behind him and nails him (a few times) for me. I ignore the little guys and go for this Banshee - which is now hot, gain initiative with my firestarter and overheat the big mech before it can fire another shot - and get in 5 or so called shots on his face while this banshee restarts.

Post mission, I have one piece of a Highlander - and a whole Banshee - because I knew what I needed out of this wasn't money, it was all salvage.

I wonder what I can do with a Banshee....

Its a perfect videogame version of a boardgame for me, not that I knew it was based on a boardgame. Therefore I like to pretend as if my mechs are chess pieces don't really care about weird camera angles at times but its fun to see the action rockets flying laser beams and melee action. I understand people have complaints about bugs so far 11 hours in I have yet to come across one right now I am just playing the campaign maybe the game functions differently on certain hardware configuration. If the game is too slow, in the options you can speed up the action and movement. Of-course comparisons will be drawn to other games like XCOM but for someone who has played quite a lot from turn based genre I say it's a fresh new start. There are mechanics like morale or resolve, your crews payroll and your relations with other factions. There's a campaign and career mode where you can fly around on a map doing missions or contracts on diverse range of maps which sometimes are huge. You can balance payment and salvage at the start of the mission for some important loot like ammo, weapons and mech parts. The story is interesting although haven't played much to give it a full review, I like it so far where its going but there are cut-scenes, some reading and some voice lines here and there you do have choices in the dialogues which I have yet to learn whether if they impact the story overall. You can also choose your faction, customize your banner, and colors of your mechs. My only complaint is the lack of in-depth tutorial the tutorial will get you familiarized with absolute basic stuff but I recommend Youtube videos regarding other aspects of the game. In my humble opinion its a great game something unique on its own right where you have company management, turn based tactics and mechs combined! But if you want to give it a spin buy it but play the career mode instead of campaign which is basically everything without the story so you can evaluate all the functions of the game.

I love the game.

However, the official game pales in comparison to the official game + the BTA 3062 mod.  Yes, like most mods it adds a lot to the game.  It adds a whole shipload of new mechs.  It adds tanks as possible squad options, as well as battle armor.  It adds the clan factions, and several others such as the Word of Blake.  All of that is well implemented and just plain awesome.  But wait, there's more.  The real genius of the mod is that it wraps of dozens (maybe hundreds) of little improvements to the gameplay.  After playing BTA 3062, I tried going back to the official game and the expansion packs just to compare.  Holy heatsinks Batman the original game feels clunky.  I can't go back. The only caveat is that I would recommend the official game first, as the BTA mod has a bit of a learning curve.  For a mod however, it is as polished as I have ever seen.

While that is a bit annoying, the worst part in my opinion is the enemy difficulty level. I have played a few missions where the computer somehow brings mechs and vehicles that are specifically designed to destroy yours. if you think that isn't possible...try it.
One mission throws heavy mechs against you, and by this point you've probably only have medium mechs!

the missions are very easy in the beginning but become extremly difficult very fast untill the point you cant actually win them. hence you end up reloading and travel do an easier location. where there are no missions for you and then you run out of money. then you reload a way older save game and the last hours you played are gone. if you just want to relax after a work day, dont play this game.

restrictive to the user as to options.
unrealistic math. no one would take a job for 100k to fight that for the monthly costs to be 400k

obviously no one played through this game or even thought it through as it is out done in gameplay by the 1987 title crescent hawks revenge that these developers tried to copyright. they failed at it too.
you can only play with 4 mechs and 4 pilots, but you can hire 16 and... well eventually find parts to make 16 mechs.
for what i dnt know as you can only play with 4 at a time in a small map like an arena or something with overly gordeous foilage and such but will run very slow even with 64gig ram and 4 gig vram because its the software not your pc.
yes the software. the people who made it.

I also miss the really odd variants of certain mechs like the jump capable trebechet (which I have yet to try and make) or the LRM hunchback (which always tended to be a nasty surprise for those not familiar).    

I have seen rumors of expanding out the universe and updates for expanding out the timeline.

Notes:
You have giant robots that you use to run missions that involve blowing up other robots.  You ick and train your people, your mechs, their loadouts, what missions to take, and what to do during the missions.  Afterwards, however, you rebuild and heal and hope you don’t go broke.  You are almost always outnumbered, and if you aren’t careful, outgunned.  The enemy AI isn’t very good, but that’s ok, since they all attack the same mech, causing massive damage to your team.  They also get first strike when you detect them, meaning with a lucky shot they can really hurt you before you get your first salvo off.

Even so, it’s not a bad game.  Yes, it is difficult, and long, and frustrating, but...you get to pilot a giant mech and blow stuff up.  Just pick easier missions until you get the experience and the mechs you need to go up in difficulty.  There is a significant amount of luck involved, but you still have to play smart.  Don’t rush into things, and always keep spare mechs and mechwarriors rotating in and out for experience.  Oh, and there is a good chance Decker will die.

I say play it through once vanilla, and then start tinkering with the files.  You can add new mechs, new weapons, adjust some skills, things like that...want to add a mech that can shoot mini nukes?  Boring, but ok.  Just remember to back up your files before you start...most of the mods and file editing is NOT supported by the creators of the game, and you can really mess up your game.

From the design of each mechs weapons suite/heating systems/armor (which is such a pleasure) to testing them in the field (slight learning curve from tradition turn based strategy games), I have enjoyed it so much it felt like a form of therapy. On top of interacting with the mech's, you run a mercenary company; meaning there is a balance to growth between your mech's and missions. 

Playing the campaign, i was a game master. Every component lost, every mechwarrior wounded, every mission failed felt like a hard hit. I wanted to play for perfection, and i could tell that the game didnt like me restarting missions.
 The career showed me the actual difficulties of operating a mercenary company as i played the game honestly. Every loss was something that had to be worked around, mechwarrior deaths had to be mitigated by careful tactics. As the loses grew the harder the return to power became. 

The base game was a treat to get for under $15, but as i passed through the Assault mech threshold of difficulty I found the terrain, mech diversity, and missions getting a little stale (100-150 hours of gameplay in). So i bought the dlc. The game feels much more rounded with the introduction of specialized equipment to dlc mechs, the added scenario maps (jungle/urban), and mission types.  I will continue to come back to this game to bring my company to completion, and then i will continue to come back to this game for timed careers, and then i will come back to this game just to make more mechs. 

The only reason im not playing battletech as regularly right now is because i found Mech Warrior Online. Wait, not only can i operate an entire lance in turn based strategy, but i can can actually pilot my mechs in first person too? wwwhhhEEW im gunna spend so much time trying to replicate my company from Battletech.

Such a cool universe. Such a great time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy!

The game is.... in its core, a cheap, bare-boned MechWarrior themed game.
That I can put up with, however, the final mission broke me. because it doesn't work at all.
This is a broken game, and the devs are long gone, just enable debug mode and force complete.

Long Version:
Everything is there but everything is lackluster:
The customization: The basic is there but gives you very little information. You also can barely make the mech your way as each mech tends to have its optimal role. If you deviate from the path even normal difficulties can give you a hard time.

The mech: The heavier the better is always the rules, there's no reason to use the smaller mechs once you got the big ones. The mission have little to no variety so there's no reason to change them anyways.

The missions: normal mission consist of a destination, you go to that destination a reinforcement arrives, and perhaps another reinforcement after, rinse and repeat. In reality if this is a TD game the experience will probably be similar. The story mission are a series of contrivances and sudden disadvantages that felt cheap and forced. That combine with the escort AI and enemy AI make the game very dull.

The system: The mercenary system provides very little branch out, even if it branch out it's just the same mission with a different flag. There's no unique path or dialogue like Armored Core, in fact look to Armored Core 4 you'll realize how bare-bone this game actually is even with its ""limitless missions.""

The World: Each special phrase are highlighted with a explanation which is nice. But to actually gather the Lance you want to build the game will fight you for it. For there's no information on what is available besides the system next to you. Thus getting what you want becomes a game of chance, very little chance I might add.

The dev: This being such an old game, you'd think everything is at the very least viable at this point. But from I gathered solution to any problem is simply open debug mode and fix it yourself, or retry the mission until it works which is a lot of wasted time with possibility of no payoff.

So overall not recommended. If anything, some of the 18+ game on the front page might have more polish. All in all another lesson about kickstarter game. Don't buy it.",1645362912,1645372746,False,1,0,0.440642803907394409,0,True,False,False

For spending $40 in 2018, I felt like I was playing some limited maze thing from 1990. Save your money. Find an old copy of Mechwarrior Mercanaries. The prettier graphics in this game aren't worth all the hassles.

I wrote that and more some years ago. Fortunately, most of that stuff was largely addressed. The game's a lot more fun now (obviously- I've put 160+ more hours into it). I've got a great lance and my guys kick a$$. 

There are still a couple of problems in the DLC. One is with Ravens. If you're fully cloaked and an impossible distance from the enemy, they will still trigger on and move towards THE SUPPOSEDLY INVISIBLE RAVEN. In a combat with visible units that have been shooting at them, they will chase the fully cloaked Raven. They won't shoot at it, but they'll know exactly where that mech is, even if they can't see it due to terrain. Odd how that works innit?
And then there's the sudden, mysterious nerf. Ocaisionally the game will decide that 90% chance means 90% chance to miss with every shot. It doesn't happen as often as it used to, but it's still there. I just played a game where a medium mech was untargetable from medium range... he had no ECM, no terrain cover just 'nope, you can't see him because'. Then there's the 'oh, you did 160 points to his center torso, well he's got one internal left...' and then you miss that one point with the following two mechs on the field. My favorite was tonight's nerf; suddenly my guys can't sprint, can't target, can't gain inspiration, but we CAN be outnumbered three to one. Suddenly my elite warriors shoot and move like rookies. Nice one. Would you also like me to wear boxing gloves, so I can't work the mouse? (I also like it when the goal is don't let X be destroyed then they spawn enemy mechs on top of X, so it gets destroyed before you get the chance to do anything).

Oh, and Darius is useless and annoying: I take some fire from off in la-la land, Darius - ""We're detecting enemy reinforcements."" Oh, so you mean all that fire that just pasted me wasn't a hallucination. Thanks dude. No distance and bearing BEFORE they're in range... I mean, you are just up there in orbit, in a totally restored starship...  Then there's the noise AFTER I've blown up a couple of enemy turrets; Darius - ""Hey, watch out there could be enemy defences..."" Or after destroying a building he goes on about how the building is damaged, keep it up. Oi, Captain Obvious, shut up.

That said, when I finally got to build the Assault Lance, I can generally take on three enemy lances without losing components, but I'm rigged for long range ouchies. Two mechs with ultra AC 5s will really put a damper on the other guy. I love it.",1525137509,1644896439,True,0,0,0.467227548360824585,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is challenging and rewarding. The graphics are good and bad - the terrain and mech graphics create some truly stunning visuals. On the other hand, you often see Roblox-like glitches between the mechs and the terrain during the zoomed-in animated movements. But overall, I'm pulled into the experience, so that's good.

I did not understand the turn/phase system at first, and it doesn't seem to be explained in the game, so I was glad to read explanations written by the Steam community. The user interface is complicated - which is cool - it's hard to keep track of what every indicator means, but that's what the game's about -  understanding the implications of every type of mech, weapon, terrain, and positioning. 

I started with skirmishes, then went on to the campaign (should probably  have reversed that because the campaign is a tutorial), but found the story a little boring and moved right to career mode.

Planning out missions, customizing mechs and developing pilots over time is satisfying, I just wish there were more pilot skills than the 8 total currently in-game. Campaigning and traversing through the inner sphere is fun, and requires good planning to make sure your mechs are outfitted appropriately, AND in time, for the environment you are visiting (dont bring a laser boat to the desert).

Minor Negatives: Some of the DLC weapons seem a bit bonkers in terms of power spikes, but are rare enough to not absolutely break the game. Some of the interfaces are VERY clunky, moving between parts of the ship is arduous and not being able to visit stores in-transit, or even buy mech parts if you are in your mech bay (only weapons for some reason), makes the inter mission interface a bit of a barrier in-between blowing stuff up like mercs are supposed to do.",1644678287,1644678287,True,4,1,0.559050261974334717,0,True,False,False

The AI is broken and will likely never be fixed. Because of the way it is done, you always lose initiative, no matter the mission type. The enemy mechs are static until you bump into them, which gives them a free turn to fire on you, every single fight. Their ""reinforcements"" are so close to the main lance that you are always at a 2 vs 1 disadvantage (sometimes 3 vs 1), every single fight. The AI is so bad some mission types (like escort missions) are unplayable because the AI controlled units will move randomly, often charging into enemy fire, without waiting for your mechs to escort them. The defend base missions are even worse because of the bad AI coding and the fact the enemy mechs always moves after yours (giving them a free turn to fire on the buildings you need to protect. There's absolutely nothing you can do about it and it will lead you to failing objectives). 

The difficulty is extremely inconsistent. Some 2 star missions are more difficult that 4-5 star missions because the devs can't figure out how to balance missions.  

Light mechs have no utility in this game. There's a point where you just need to go heavy/assault or go home. Because of all the points above, armor seems way more important than mobility, which renders light mechs practically useless early in the game. 

Some DLCs are only accessible after you beat the main campaign, which means you wont be able to play them right away. 

This game is poorly optimized and will start lagging after only a few missions (even on a high end PC). There are many memory leaks and too many save games will slow your computer to a crawl. 

Almost half of the Steam achievements are for PvP (skirmish mode), although Battletech is mainly a single player game. This is such a big oversight, as most players don't bother with skirmish mode.",1644292803,1644292803,False,3,0,0.484740972518920898,0,True,False,False

It's probably less tactical than the XCom or Shadowrun series, but I feel like the tactics OUTSIDE the battlefield in terms of how you outfit your Mechs is probably the best part.

Strategy and tactics-wise, the game is easy enough to pick up and play (all those years of playing Front Mission 3 on the PlayStation 1 certainly helped) but there are a lot of features to learn about and remember. You can get by with the move, click, & shoot method, but being a BattleTech veteran and knowing which units to prioritize targeting over others will help you survive battles a lot easier; something that I am still learning about. While I enjoy tactics and strategy games like this, the dice-rolling tropes can still be frustrating, like when you are right in front of an enemy and go to attack them, and your shots miss from like 20 feet away for no apparent reason but that the game dice didn't like you during that turn. Also the game has a frustrating knack of calling in reinforcements against you that can move and fire during the same turn as their deployment, meaning that while you have already committed to a move and which direction you are facing, the game can send a unit in behind you after you've moved and fire at your exposed rear where your armor is weakest before you even had a chance to take your next turn yet. This is a cheap shot and very frustrating because I highly doubt that this sort of thing happens in the tabletop game.

Also, the rolling dice thing can make some of your enemies seemingly invincible or extremely difficult to kill. I had a mission where the last enemy seemed to be no different than the other enemy mechs that I had previously dispatched, but it took 3 of my mechs to take him down after almost 10 minutes of hitting him with repeated barrages of missiles and beams. I don't know why that particular mech seemed so impervious to major damage, but such is the way of these types of dice-rolling games that try to emulate the tabletop versions a little too much at times. Yes, I'm still pretty new to BattleTech, but I've played countless D&D, JRPG, RPG, RTS, strategy games in the past to know a cheap shot when I see it. 

Other than that, the game is very pretty in the graphics department, and the music and audio quality are excellent. The campaign game is okay, but the career mode seems to be where the most entertainment is at. I have yet to go online and get my @$$ handed to me in multiplayer yet, but the offline game is still remarkably entertaining despite a few shortcomings.

Also:
I played and liked all the 'good' Mechwarrior games (1-4) as well as the two Mechcommander titles. I read some battletech novels covering the clan invasion and the years after (mostly Michael A. Stackpoles' works). I never played the 'board game' (or whatever warhammer-like games are called) and I have no clue about the actual game rules. I don't consider myself a hardcore fan but I generally like the battletech universe as I know it.

So, if you don't know anything about the battletech universe at all my review may not help you much either. I'll try to be as objective as possible but that's all I can do.

Let's start with the lore and setting. The game's campaign is set in a non-canon (?) minor rimward periphery state called the Aurigan Reach. Apparantly there are multiple trademark and license holders for the Battletech universe so we may never know if the Aurigan Reach will officially be considered canon or not. At least that is my take on the situation. However, based on my limited knowledge the developers made sure the existense of the Aurigan Reach doesn't clash with canon lore and could be added without a problem. Again this is my take as a mild fan of the series after some minor research. Correct me if I am wrong. I'm not too familiar with the state of the universe during and after the third succession war as in the time period this game is set in. I still think this game overall feels right in that regard. [b]In terms of lore and setting this is a battletech game that feels battletech.[/b]

The story isn't overly special but does it's job. The presentation is quite immersive though. There aren't any great AAA-style animated cutscenes. Instead you get slideshows of drawn images with voice overs. I don't mind that. I liked them. Good animations are expensive af and obviously this wasn't a title with a AAA budget. Unfortunately the game lacks a lot in terms of voice acting. I know it is a double edged sword since bad voice acting can ruin a game but I find they generally picked pretty good voice actors. They simply don't have much to say. I have no clue how much voice actors cost but is it really that much compared to the overall budget of a game like this?

As for the gameplay there are many positives and many negatives. The game plays very differently compared to other turn based tactical games like XCOM or maybe Divinity:OS if you want to go that far. It's kinda hard to rate a system if there is nothing to compare it to. The one thing that is similar though is the learning curve. It suffers from the same problem most other turn based tactical games do: you have a steep learning curve in the beginning but once you mastered the mechanics the game gets too easy. Generally I find unexperienced pilots are just 'too bad' compared to highly experienced ones. Light mechs are a bit too fragile as well. Since you start out with both... well, the game is a bit unforgiving when you start off. In the lategame on the other hand you will be decked out with super heavy assault mechs equipped with ultra rare high dmg weapons and maxed out pilots that can alpha strike kill any assault mech opponent making most mission a cakewalk. I think the latest patches and dlcs addressed this problem a bit but it is still a problem. The ai is kinda stupid as well and can be tricked easily in certain mission types or settings (especially urban enviroments). Generally it does it's job though. Another problem is the general speed of the game. It is slow even for this genre. For comparison if you think XCOM is too slow for you... don't even think about this game. This problem is amplified by load times increasing drastically the longer you play. I don't know if it is a memory leak thing or whatever but I have to restart the game every 2-3 hours to not have to wait 2-3 minutes for a random filler contract mission to load and 'unload'. Here is the part where I can't objectively review this game. With all it's problems I still enjoy this game and it's mechanics. It's fun to try different weapon compositions. It's fun to play another battletech game in general. It's fun to manage a mercenary company again years after MW2:Mercs and MW4:Mercs. I can't tell if a battletech newbie would feel the same.

In the end I can highly recommend this game for people with a battletech background who are looking for a new battletech experience. As for people without a battletech background I'd say this is not ideal introduction into the battletech universe. If you like turn based tactical games enough that you don't mind a lot of minor and maybe one or two major flaws give it a try. Otherwise this may not be what you are looking for.",1643159313,1643159313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Original Review[square brackets from when I changed to recommended and looked back on experience with game]:

Not Xcom or Xcom2. No tension.[it feels epic, don't get me wrong but I spent 144 hours before heading for the end of the campaign] Story is as 2d as the picture stills, which make for good wallpaper (a positive). I want to like the game and get hyped up in the Arano revolution. No tactics, nothing that works. Flanking-no. Refitting Mechs for long or short range-No.  And this is at 2.5 of 5 difficulty. What do I have to do, stay at low level difficulty 37 hours in? I will change my review should things get better, if things get better.

Makes me want to savescum, which is just as good as you non-savescummers, I have no time for an extra 40 or so hours so I can lose or withdraw. I'm rather gonna spend that time reading the community guides, again, if things get better.

On a side note music is just right[no electronic but epic enough].",1538981896,1642915080,True,0,0,0.465873509645462036,0,True,False,False

Interesting models for a game I never saw anyone play.  I figured like most Warhammer games it would be a passable TBS but not great. I was then shocked by the stompy murder robot glory that is Battletech. Call me ignorant but I didn't even realize Mechwarrior and Battletech where in the same universe. This game's core game-play sucked me in and I put it up there with Xcom in TBS games I actually play constantly. The campaign's story is interesting and drew me into the lore.

Obtain 3 torsos from a different mech and you can operate it.  You're able to change weapons and the amount of armor your mech has.  You train your pilots with XP from missions.  The game starts like real life,  living with a mountain of debt and you need to pay your pilots, mechs and all that.  You have more money going out the door than coming in.  There is a boat load of pay from missions, so great and you can negotiate with your employer what that pay is by sliders.  The sliders control more money for less salvage parts or more parts and less pay.  I also like that you're a freelancer and can decide what jobs you take. You can customize you mech's colors and company name and logo.

Battles are fun.  Once you get past the opening part of the game, they are pretty easy, There are 4 of your mechs to about 1 or 2 not well trained enemy.  You can use forest and terrain as cover so you mech takes less damage.  There can be strategy in play as well.

But I decided to hang on just a bit and give it a second chance and I am very glad I did.  The game has a sort of XCOM feel since it is turn based but obviously, the combat is all in Mechs and it is a lot of fun.  I wish the game had some more balance between the different types of Mechs though.  There really doesn't seem to be very much variation with how you should set up your team of Mechs: basically the bigger, more armored, more heavily armed Mechs are better... just put your biggest, toughest Mechs out there.  It would have been cool to have certain missions where it just isn't viable to bring big Mechs or to give lighter, faster mechs more options to be useful.  As it is, lighter Mechs are able to dodge attacks a bit better but it still isn't very hard to bring them down with a big fatty and they are not able to really put out any significant damage.  But that said, I have only played the game for ~30 hours so maybe there are strats that I don't know that make lighter mechs more viable.

Anyway, even with some balance issues, the game is pretty fun and definitely challenging early on.  After a while, once you get some really strong Mechs, the game is a lot easier but it is still enjoyable to come out and stomp your enemies.

The game also has pretty enjoyable Career management and Mech customization.  It is a lot of fun to try out different loadouts on your mechs and kit them out with cool weapons while trying to balance firepower with armor and heat dissipation, ammo, etc.  Again, this gets a lot easier with bigger Mechs which are able to carry more firepower without sacrificing much armor but it still requires some thought.  

Combat is fun with some interesting tactics and decision making required although sometimes the AI seems to make some dumb choices about how to engage.  Overall, I would give the game a 4/5... A lot of fun, pretty deep gameplay, pretty long story with plenty of replay value, and fun strategy and planning elements.",1642529817,1642529817,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's been 30 years since I played the board game but I recognize everything I remember. The mechs are highly customizable, it's all there.

More importantly the career game mode has exactly the features I like and you almost never see these characteristics:

-No story as such, you just take contracts that you like and go after them to earn money.

-Mech pilots who gain experience but if an experienced one gets killed it's not the end of the world.

-No level scaling or constantly increasing difficulty which can derail you if you don't keep up. You pick a mission that is rated from 1/2 to 5 skulls. The more skulls, the harder the mission and the more you get paid. If you want to grind, you can. If you want to push yourself, you can.

-Procedurally generated missions. Play forever.

The only other game I've seen which works like this is Door Kickers. I love it, although I accept that not everyone is into that and they need a story or time limits or something.

I didn't play the campaign any longer than I needed to in order to learn the game. It's great as a tutorial but I can't speak on if the overall campaign is worth buying the game over. The mods are supposedly great, too, but I haven't played them either.

I'm not going to say this is worth $40 but this is on sale a lot. On big sales a lot. In fact as I write this right now it is 75% off and I bought the game on some ridiculous sale like that too. Worth about $15 I'd say and a good deal for anything less.

Edit: It wouldn't be fair to any readers if I didn't add one thing. The RNG in this game is worse than XCOM. You WILL see things, at least once every session of play, which will make you want to throw your PC out of the window.

Now with the positives:
- Combat is fantastic, if a bit slow. 
- Reimagined mech designs are fantastic, I was like... MARAUDER OMG I WANT THAT. Hell, even just a bloody locust brings me down memory lane to funtimes in mechwarrior 1.
- I found the mech customization very realistic, exactly what I'd expect from IS mechs.
- While travelling, its possible for events to appear, for example, a mechwarrior is approached by a rival company to join them. You are then given choices which can affect the overarching gameplay. I let my mechwarrior decide on that, and they left. Which is sad as they were one of my best shots, but you know - If they wanna fly, let them fly. Let the tigers roam free.
- Some cutscenes are reminiscence of homeworld style cutscenes.
- I love the voice acting! You get accents from all over the world. I think this is the first time I've encountered a female welsh (or irish?) mechwarrior. She kicked butt with her urbie too XD

Things about the game I'd like to nitpick:
- Load times suprisingly long, even with pcie ssds. 
- Non combat UI could be slightly improved. For example, clicking on the mechbay brings you to a new location that apparently does... nothing. You can click on Yang or the terminal besides him to either chat to Yang or visit the actual mech bays but it's not apparent. In addition, if you choose to click on the Mechbay button then click on Yang or the Terminal, that requires lots of mouse movement - hovering over the Mechbay button then clicking on the pop ups is far more efficient.
- Characters are pretty bland. 
- No werewolves, vampires or zombies. Or plants fighting zombies.

It's a big step up from the mechcommander series, but if you get a chance, play the old crescent hawk's revenge. Modern games have much better game loops, ui and graphics, but storywise, I think the old games still have an edge.",1642067669,1642326874,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story and the world:
----------------------
Let's start of with the story (without too much spoilers). The creators of this game have done a great job with the universe. There are factions, politics, pirates, good tech and some shady but Op tech, and when there's so much going on, there's always a place for warmongers and mercenaries alike. While the game has a lot of elements to it, but the creators have tried their best to also keep it simple and straightforward, given that this is a turn-based game (when it comes to fighting/missions) and also a more of a text-based game (when it comes to the story parts). That said, if you are someone who prefers a lot of NPC interactions, animated cut scenes and all the societal stuff, then I am afraid that you might be a little disappointed. This game has a very straightforward approach when it comes to character interactions, although if you do hire unique mechwarriors to pilot your machines, then they have some random story events (with consequences) which can spice it up for you. 

Design:
---------
I love giant robots, spaceships, and military vehicles in general, and this game has all that and more. Each mech is a giant killing machine built for a specific role (but you can customise them). There are several types and sizes of mechs (which you will have to collect and rebuild or buy for a pretty penny), and a lot of equipment and weapons to go with them. You also have some control over the colors and patterns on your mechs. I personally love the design of each and every mech that I have collected so far (which is above 25). Some of these hulks may not be pretty, but they will absolutely intimidate your enemies and get the job done. You also get a mech refit lab of sorts where you can try different weapon and equipment combos and see what works the best for each type of mission or play style. 

Gameplay:
-----------
Combat is turn-based and each mission can take anywhere between 20 to 40 minutes depending on your lance of mechs (4 mechs that you deploy), and the enemies/objectives that you have to overcome. I personally enjoy this part a lot as you never know what can happen during any battle. Your pilots/mechwarriors can die, and your mechs can be destroyed permanently if you are not careful, even on Easy mode (although there is a setting that you can disable to prevent permanent destruction of your mechs. Still repairs are pricey). So stay sharp, don't get surrounded, and don't unload all your ammo every single time like a two pump chump (your mech will overheat or you might get blown to bits by focus fire from your enemies). Patience is key to the survival of your outfit. And most IMPORTANTLY, SAVE BEFORE EVERY MISSION. 

Music:
-------
They have done a phenomenal job with the music tracks and all the combat sounds. Kudos to all musicians who worked on it, and to the game creators for choosing the right type of music for each situation. 

Verdict: 
--------
If you love giant mechs, space politics, and a mercenary style of life (with numerous but similar missions with varying challenges and environments), and if you have the patience to play it using a turn-based mechanism, then this game is absolutely recommended to you. The creators have put in a lot of effort into making this game, plus there's a whole bunch of mods out there (but use mods after you have experienced the game in stock form atleast once. This way, you will know what you want to spice things up), so it is definitely worth a try. I personally hope we get more mech based games like this one in the future. 

Tips to beginners (from another beginner :P):
-------------------
- Check the steam community before you begin the campaign. There are some awesome guides which will save you a ton of heartache and help you enjoy the game better (since this game is both rewarding and punishing depending on how well you plan). 
- Save frequently
- Stock configurations of most mechs can be underwhelming, so try to get better weapons and equipment (especially those with a + at the end of their names. Grab them whenever you get the chance). 
- Read mission description (and difficulty) to sort of predict how much salvage you might win from the fight. The more missions you do, the more you can figure this out. If not, there are some wonderful guides and videos online. 
- Bigger is not always better (although larger mechs are stronger and pack a brutal punch when compared to lighter ones, but there are ways to get around it if you are observant and have the right loadout). Try to strike a synergy between the four mechs you deploy during each mission. 
- Pay attention to mission type and environment. 
- Don't forget to go wild and enjoy the game as you see fit once you get a hang of it. There's more than one right answer to each situation in battletech.

Likes:
- Mech Customisation.
- Story driven campaign with the ability to deviate from it in a sandbox-style fashion.
- Familiar units, factions, characters and story from the Mech Warrior universe.
- Enjoyable combat.
- Easy controls and a fairly decent UI.


Dislikes:
- The RNG has WAY too much randomness in it.
- Missions have too many ""surprise"" event in them which can't be accounted for during the planning phase.
- Some objectives are unclear: e.g. ""stop the convoy before it escapes"". So you sacrifice mechs and pilots in a mad rush to prevent the convoy from reaching the ""Denial Zone"", only to realise that it's not Game Over when they automatically get there.
- Campaign difficulty scales up way faster than you can. When that happens, you suddenly find yourself with a lot of expenses and no way to pay them off. So then you have to seek out low-paying easy contracts (so as not to damage mechs and crew), while trying to pay for all the monthly ship upgrade costs you now have, as well as your fleet of mechs and pilots. Sure, you can streamline the mechs and pilots to save cash, but things do get a bit ridiculous and bankruptcy becomes a very real possibility.
- The cinematic camera is the absolute pits. You literally miss half the action thanks to it. Also, you need to be able to zoom out further when looking at the battlefield.

Don't get me wrong, while the dislikes are more detailed than the likes, the good still outweighs the bad - for sure - and the game is worth playing if you are a fan of the genre.",1641996925,1641996925,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even with the changes that they've made to mission payouts, nearly every mission is severely imbalanced in terms of terrain and numbers. The terrain on your half of the map is mostly open, flat and rough. Their half of the map has ample cover, high ground, and little rough terrain.
In addition you are always outnumbered. The enemy ""reinforcements"" are often right behind/right next to the primary target, making them not really reinforcements, but just a larger force. It would be nice if the enemy ""reinforcements"" would at least be a couple of turns behind the main force, but usually it's about one turn; as soon as you engage the enemy, you'll start getting hit by their ""reinforcements"", sometimes from the side.

its a pretty solid turnbased strategy game and hase some rp elements (only singelplayer) wich gives the game some spice. here and there some minor problems like: ""why the heck do i have to pick a 80t lance to catch up with a convoy? because the map is desined to just being an asshole"" or ""why is the dlc content only after the campain (or in carriere mode (wich is basikly the game without the campain missions)) and most of the mech stuff usless cuz just 2 of the dlc mechs are even close to the wheight class in wich u find urself at the end of a campain"" or ""why cant i get 2 or 3 lances into battle? i got 12 mechs stored up and 12 pilots so why no 3 lances?"" or ""why are light mechs usless when u get to ur heavys (60t)""

and then there is the op called shoot wich is way to stronk when u maxed pilotskills, mechs and equippment

the game also needs (for me) long to load and i use 12gb ddr4 ram, gtx 960 nividia and an intel i7 6700 (hdd, i dont have room on ma ssd)

so thats all the bad stuf i could find in 250h play time

all but the asshole convoy hunt can be fixed with mods from mod nexus, but (pay atentione) they make the game way bigger (90gb small mod and i think up to 120gb the realy big one) and the loading time more than dubbles (id recomend 32gb ram if u run the biggest mod, or a realy pation mind cuz i need to load with 12gb ddr4 up to 15min to get from my contracts into the mission)

There are a ton of mechs you can play with, a multitude of different upgrades / gear / weapons which allow you to completely customize every mech and even a bit of base building, once you unlock the Argo ship. Also the art style is rather nice, same thing with the ambient and combat music. I love the mech bay OST.

This game is all about managing your costs, since if you're stuck repairing your mechs every time or spend to much money in parts, it might result in you losing the game. Winning a fight is not just about destroying your enemy, but also ensuring that you take the least amount of damage possible. This means that while fighting, you always want to be the one in control of LoS, allowing you to burst down single mechs with your entire lance, while remaining out of reach from other enemy mechs. This is especially important while fighting multiple enemy lances, which in the beginning have heavier and bigger mechs when compared to you. In addition to that, knowing which part of an enemy mech to target, in order to cripple or destroy the enemy mech is also vital.

There are also different level attributes, which can affect how you approach a fight. For example in a desert level or vacuum  heat builds up much faster, so performing an alpha strike becomes a lot more costly for both you and the enemy. In a forest environment, there is a lot more cover which heavily reduces the damage you and the enemy takes. Finally in an artic / frigged environment alpha strike will be far easier to pull off, since you can dissipate heat more efficiently.

This all makes the combat pretty enjoyable and pretty addictive at times.

That said, the game suffers from the all to common xcom aim, which  can cause you to miss an shot with 95% accuracy. Also the game has some rather annoying memory leak, which causes some terrible FPS drops among other things. Also ultra wide while supported, is pretty annoying to get working.

Sadly, even after playing for a few hours, then taking a break from it for a year and restarting, I could not. One of the first things that bothers me about this game is the UI. The text size is TINY. Granted, I play a sofa/TV setup, so I am not as close as the usual computer desk player. That said, there have been many complaints about this issue, and this game has been out for almost four years.

The other big issue I have is the part of the game that is between combat missions. You are running a mercenary company, so you have to pay your mercs, pay for Mech upkeep, pay bills to banks, pay for travel costs between jobs, and so on. It may be realistic and some people may like it, but for me this was some of the most tedious f*cking sh*t ever. It is NOT intuitive either; you have to read through paragraphs of the VERY TINY text to figure out all that crap.

The nail in the coffin is the gameplay; it's frustrating! Everything is fiddly. Positioning is difficult because you can't always clearly tell which terrain is traversable and which isn't. Shooting your weapons is difficult because the hit percentages seem to be off, and they are hard to read because of the TINY EFFING TEXT. The enemy regularly destroys your Mech's weapons and equipment, even with the difficulty turned down. Wouldn't be a big deal, except every focking piece of your Mech has to be repaired or replaced, which means you have to wait (in-game) days or even weeks for it to be fixed, or you have to fly to a place where you can buy a replacement part, which means you might not have enough funds to fix all your Mechs, or vice versa.

To recap, this game does not perform one of it's purposes (turn-based tactics) particularly well, and it rubs salt in the wound with the ungodly amount of micromanagement.

I mean once paradox took over nothing happened any longer just DLCs to milk the game as much as possible... but fixing, balancing it... lol forget about it!

Let me make this perfectly clear I am a huge mech franchise fan and did enjoy the game to some extent... 

BUT

- the story is soooo boring, predictable and it doesn't make you care about any of the characters, the drama is just ridiculously badly written, and honestly that's the most simple part of this game and it's trash.
- the missions fall into a few categories and they are repetitive to no end and you need to do them because you run out of cash every few months.
- loading times are atrocious even on my pcie gen 3 4x nvme drive
- There is no voice acting or animation for anything, the characters just stare into the void while you sit there and read a mountain of useless text that doesn't mean anything in the game. There are some random cutscenes that are 2d drawn and the art is ok but again nothing really impressive.
- The choices are of no real significance you can just blindly click through them nothing of note ever happens, the story is prety much on a track and you just click through it.
- The mechs and their differences are quite useless you can change the role of each mech by changing its loadout so basically it's just a frame and its stock role is just for kicks and giggles. I'd expect each class of mechs to have specialized actions they can take... but nah you can make a brawler jump and you can tank up a scout and put a lrm on it and call it a day. you'll not sacrifice if anything at all. 
- There are no different types of armor, armor is just a number that goes down.
- weapon systems are all over the place and the damage they do is quite random. You can get yourself an arm blown to pieces with one shot or you can have an entire lance empty their weapons in your mech's side and you still walk away, difference being luck - I guess. At least that happens to the enemies too so I guess fair is fair, even if a bit stupid.
- Controls are ok-ish if a bit unintuitive at times.
- maps and level design could be better but all in all it's quite good.
- Side objectives are virtually nonexistent, some do have them but you don't need to trigger them or explore or anything.
- The order in which the mechs do stuff is just bonkers, especially at tag teams you sit around waiting forever for stuff to happen. The camera enters some type of glamour shot (why?? don't!!) when you issue the last command or when the ally does it. Normally I would expect the enemy to have a turn for each of its mechs then I have a turn for each of mine... but nah there is some bs mechanic behind it making it totally unpredictable what happens next.
- Stuff like morale and the likes have no meaning you can just skip everything and just ignore it, it won't affect anything really.
- high ground low ground has no relevance, you can shoot through rocks and hit you can have clear line of sight and miss. - 
- The different terrain types are nice and as I said the level design is done quite decently.
- The 3d graphics are good the 2d graphics are ok - but they don't fit one bit 
- Also original mech franchise and all of them really have the pilot eject on critical failure, there is no way you can even trigger the eject, if a pilot is injured his maximum injuries he's dead for good.
- the heat mechanics and the jump mechanics are nicely done and useful
- ux is poor, over complicated and without clear indications of what is what and where. I feel it is reminiscent of the original series... seems 20 years have past for naught and we did not learn anything.

and the worst part? the BUGS!! oh ffs the bugs. They still did not fix the damn tag team missions. They either don't give you an exit point or they hang... yaay after being soon 4 years old... there is no excuse for that! sorry!

And yes I call it a pile of garbage because it is clear that this game has not had any decent QA done to it or if it did the dev did not care about it... 

10$ - that's a fair price for this thing - I feel it is a MASSIVE missed opportunity to make an instant classic, for which it does have the bones for!! such a shame!!

I really really really really tried to like this game, and I could have done away with everything but after so much time not fixing such a basic functionality like EXITING A DARNED MISSION?? are you kidding me???",1641332518,1641332518,False,3,0,0.484361171722412109,0,True,False,False

Melee is still enjoyable, and so is unleashing the alpha strike from hell - patches and dlc's have enhanced the Ai so it doesn't lurk in tree lines so much and actually tries to fight you for cover instead of standing still.

The Battletech franchise has been a classic of tabletop gaming for over thirty years, and this game takes place against the rich backdrop of lore that's been built up over that period. But don't let that intimidate you; the campaign mode tells you what you need to know for *this* story, and tells it well with attractive motion-paintings and good voice acting.

But you're not here for the story, are you? No, you're here for Big Stompy Robots.

You will get your BSR fix in a long series of combat missions where you control a team of up to four Battlemechs. Customize your team by selecting a combination of 'Mechs that suits your play style, and then further customize by tinkering with their weapons loadouts and directing the training of their pilots.

Don't think that winning fights is all about having the most tons and the biggest guns, though. Tactics matter in this game and the same mission with the same 'Mechs can be a disaster if you're sloppy or a rousing victory if you fight smart. There's some substance behind the big stompy robot flashy surface.

Fans of the tabletop game will quickly observe that this game doesn't follow those rules exactly. Most of the broad strokes are there: for example, faster moving targets are harder to hit, weapon ranges drive tactical choices, and heat management is an ever-present concern. However, many of the details are different, since this is a different medium.

Overall, I would say that this game is a very good choice for people who are either fans of the tabletop Battletech game, and/or are fans of turn-based tactics in general. If you fall into either of those categories and you see this game on sale, grab it. You won't be disappointed.",1641212028,1641212028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Typical paradox design model, where alot of the stuff that makes the game better is locked behind DLC. In this game its mission types, more weapon and mech types, a couple of extra rng stuff to keep the game interesting. 
Theres a campaign and an RNG sandbox career. Of which the sandbox career is just a better game mode as the campaign is extremely railroady and of only moderate interest story wise.  

The leveling system/xp system is boring and uninspired. Complete a couple of missions, pick which semi-mandatory perk you want. And thats it. Everything else is just scaling stats on a linear line. 
The weapon loadout system is where the game starts to shine. The game has around 3-7 weapon types for each weapon ""range""(short, medium, long, extreme). And it has indirect (think: missles), direct(autocannons), and support weapons(flamethrowers, recoilless rifles) for each category as well. This means that once you get the mech models with the right mounting slots you have a ton of loadout and customization options and you can generally play any encounter how you want. 
It takes a minute to both unlock them though and pacing overall is a fault of the game, but generally it only takes a couple of hours to really get your ""lance"" going. The main limitation here is you cant use your favorite mech models with any loadout. Youre locked behind mounting slots. 

Combat is a little more complex then first impressions imply, but its relatively straight forward. Generally you want to hit an enemy from the same side with as much as possible, burning through the armor until the mech core is destroyed. Constantly moving gives you evasion 'coins' per round which increase the chance to dodge an attack, scaling on distance traveled. Knocking down enemy mechs makes them insta-killable via melee, and things like flamethrowers can push mechs over the 'redline' and make them overheat, skipping their turn. Heat management is also a thing, which limits how useful alpha striking, jump jets, and laser weapons are. 
Its simplistic, but in general a rewarding system once you understand it. 

A completely unrelated critique of this game is the sheer amount of effort that went into the cinematic camera and overall camera-ology of the game, and just how -bad- it all is at the end of the day. Character models dont move out of their ""idle"" animations, mechs dont have 'true' firing animations for each mech model, models when theyre damaged are very low poly and uninteresting, yet the game takes the effort to zoom in on the models to show it. The look of the game is very drab, which is typical for mechwarrior games. Overall the art assets within the game combined with the action camera completely detract from the pacing of the game, looks bad, and makes combat both slow and tedious. It is however, toggleable, giving it its only saving grace. 

Game gets a passing score, but the game falls short of the true mechwarrior fantasy of massive customization and build options combined with fast and explosive combat. If you like RNG systems similar to the xcom series, this game can be interesting. Only recommend getting it on a sale though.",1641137408,1641138218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tactical battlefield are too small and often we begginning in closed corner when we have no other option than intense fire exchange with enemies. Enemies have very often reinforcements, we have never. Enemy reinforcements can drop at your team position and in suprised close distance you will be heavy damaged or you will die if you choose sniper team.
Tactical strategy should have more flexible, bigger maps if we take the game seriously. Here we have often only one way to target, we will see map around, but its out of border and not possible to travel beyond the small boundaries.

I have a new complaint.  Maybe it's petty, but i have to wonder why EVERY.  SINGLE.  LAST story mission HAS to be a gimmicky stress-soaked slog that's heavily stacked against you.  You will find yourself perpetually outnumbered, usually out massed, and having to complete some arbitrary task(s) while almost always under the pressure of a strict and very unfriendly time limit.

Yes, yes, i understand the exhilaration of overcoming impossible odds, usually after a dozen frustrating retries.  We've all played Dark Souls.  ""Git guud"" blah blah blah.

It's important to note, however, that when you play chess you play against an opponent who starts with the same number of the same pieces that can perform the same moves under the same rules.  
Unless you are doing a specific scenario, you generally don't play a game of chess where you only have four pieces against the enemy's whole board, you can't let them get any pawns to your back row or you lose, and you also have a mere 14 turns to clear all the enemy pieces from the board or you still lose.

These missions just aren't FUN.  I haven't enjoyed them.  Not a single solitary one.  They are just there, something stressful to do between the procedural missions, like a disgusting chore on the list that i know i'll have to do at SOME point but all i want to do is pretend that it doesn't exist.  
If i'm not enjoying this, why even do it?  I'm not getting paid to play these games.  I'm supposed to be enjoying myself.

The story campaign is worthless garbage with a basic plot, cliche writing, and terrible mission design, and i will not be continuing it past this point.

Fortunately, they have a career mode that eschews the useless, frustrating story and lets you focus on living your best Merc life.  So i'll grudgingly let this title keep that thumb it pried from my fist, for now.  
Can't wait to see how they screw up next.


<<<UPDATE>>>
OK, so, it's been a good long while since this title came out, meanwhile three expansions and a plethora of updates have come out.  I picked up a couple of light QOL mods from Nexus as well so i decided to give this game another shot, and i loaded up my old save.

While it's still nowhere near where it should be (A markdown for high demand assets on a market should never drop below 20% of the going rate, and THAT is only if you need to sell quickly and are willing to do so at a potential loss), the disparities between the buying and selling prices for functional battlemechs and battlemech components are no longer QUITE so bad as they once were and are now significantly more tolerable.  

While my merc group was never in any financial danger, the sensation that i was being outrageously cheated every time i sold a mech had been a serious immersion breaking issue for me, and the idea of adjusting the campaign finance and salvage rewards to a lower difficulty setting as compensation had been abhorrent to me.  It became an issue of ""Really, what's the point then?""

As this has now been adjusted somewhat, to a LESS outrageously obnoxious level, i feel that this game deserves an upgrade to a ""thumbs up"".  But only the one thumb.  The other thumb is reserved for if the game really wows me from here on out.


<<<ORIGINAL REVIEW>>>
Ugh.  I have adored the Battletech universe since i was a kid, but there is something seriously wrong with this game.

For one:  In order to build ""new"" Mechs you have to collect 3 sets of ""Parts"" for that specific mech, each of which can cost upwards of 3 MILLION C-Bills for some of the earliest light Mechs.  You can also salvage a unit of parts or two from destroyed Mechs after most missions.  Once you have enough parts they automatically combine into a functional Battlemech chassis which you can then sell for a whopping 300 Thousand C-bills, IF you are lucky!!!  Buying that early garbage Mech outright fully built on the market can cost you 15 Million C-Bills.

You may or may not have read that correctly.  

The game lore goes OUT OF ITS WAY to remind you, several times in fact, that functional battlemechs are hard to maintain and build, and that the Skills and facilities to make them are increasingly rare and precious, so how awesome is it that you have access to both!  It then ensures that you cannot SELL a Mech without taking a 90% LOSS on its price.  

If i'm selling a fully functional Mech chassis i should be able to sell it at fair market value, the SAME price as copies of that EXACT Mech already on the market.  Anything else is complete BS, which means that this game has no functional economy.

It is super heavy on PC resources yet, it is just a dumdum hack'n'shoot game on small maps... no idea where the resources are used. Very poor coding, requires a major overhaul of the code to improve performance by alot. It is the only game that I have that demands alot to my octo 4,1 ghz (5,1 turbo) yet there is nothing in this game. My cpu goes crazy even when I am just browsing my stuff on the ship!

After the 10th battle you are really getting tired of the same things over and over again, even in campaign mode. You always do the same three type of missions over and over, most of the time is a go kill foozle kind of mission.

not only that, but you have the usual game limitations but no in-character reasons for them. Like you can have a horde of mechwarriors and 18 active mechs, but you can only deploy 4... hey man! I am the boss here, if I want to deploy 18 mechs and pay for those it is my choice as the boss of this merc band. Silly! Of course, the enemy can have 60 mechs if they want to but no not you, oh no, just 4, even though you have 18 mechs available and twice as many mechwarriors...

Major clipping issues.

Mechs can go through other mechs which is ludicrous considering the bulk and size of these things.

Light mechs are useless. They have no stealth, no enhanced sensors, night vision, or anything else, no ECM or ECCM, no anything worth having light mechs in your squad. They get killed super quickly, even against other light mechs. lol With my medium mechs, a light mech lasts like one round of combat two if he is lucky.

Being a mindcontrolling god that controlls all mechwarriors on your squad is a bit boring and long in this already tedious game. I would have like my mech and mechwarrior to have thrice as many options, techs and abilities but you can only control directly your own mech, the others are controlled by the AI following your orders (attack, defend point A, withdraw, retreat, charge, destroy buildings & static defenses in and around objective, etc.)

Initiative is kind of dump. Most of the time all my mechs play their turn, and all the enemy mechs play theirs. There should be a greater variety in initiative depending on mech's upgrades & electronics and the pilot's skill. I feel like I am in a Flinstone wrestling match with their big clubs each hitting the other successively until one falls. Pretty lame actually.

Shallow game on all fronts. Fortunate there is a campaign otherwise it would be a horrible one. Speaking of which, the story is okay. Typical cliché of restore the dude on throne, like a mechwarrior game that I know of, so not really creative on the writer's part.

Gameplay sucks on several levels. The most horrible one is that you have to wait for everything. There is absolutely no fluidity in the battles. You need to wait for each weapon to fire (they cannot fire all at once), you need to wait for the weapons to impact, after all this is done, then you have to wait for the mech to fall down or your mechwarrior to add a comment... as if all of this could not be done at the same time. Like when the mech will fall, it should fall with the impact of the weapons, not several seconds later.

Another annoying thing is you are forced to watch the same cinematics over and over and over again. Considering you will probably visit dozens of planets, watching the same unskippable cinematics is very time consuming and totally useless. Poor game design.

On top of that, you must press spacebar to accellerate the animations of movement... come on man! You are so darn lazy, put a x2 / x5 / x10 animation speed slider in the option menu. Same goes for comments since your game is made in an amateurish way where everything is a chunk and needs to finish so that the next chunk can go. Totally unrefined game design.

Mech Commander 2 is a much better game and it is what? 20 years old?

Do not buy unless you are miniature fan of the universe and see it à 5$ all included. nnote that you need a good computer to run this unoptimized game.

1.  There is no game manual or documentation.  In-game tooltips are confusing.  The tutorial is woefully inadequate.  To play this game, you must spend a lot of time scouring forums, guides, and websites picking up scraps of information about the basic game mechanics.

2.  Save this game to buy later if you do not meet all of the recommended system requirements; the minimum requirements are insufficient.

Beyond that, it is a fun game.  The game plays a lot like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but with a bit more complexity in the battle mechanics and a somewhat better AI for enemy units.  Visually, the mechs and battlefield look good in a gritty way, even running on my older video card with medium graphics settings.

Once you have overcome the problems in the game's documentation/tooltips/tutorial, the battle GUI is very complete and provides almost everything you need to manage a battle, without being too intrusive on the screen.

If you like tinkering, then you can spend endless time modifying and tweaking your mechs to build your perfect battle lance.

The Campaign is easy and forgiving, once you have figured out the game basics.  As of yet, I have not played the other games modes.  (There is a Career Mode, which seems to essentially be a campaign, but for points instead of story completion; there is a Skirmish Mode, which seems to be sandbox battles vs. the AI; and there is a Multiplayer Mode to battle other players.)

I actually got this game AFTER playing all the way through Mechwarrior Merc 5 because I still needed to modify the crap out of giant robo tanks apparently. This scratched that itch and let me do it in a tactical way. The FPS-ish mechwarriror was great. Sending a lone teammate to stand behind a hill and launch barrages of LRMs at enemies was doable, but difficult. In battletech i've got an Atlas up front with a cyclops, a king crab laying direct fire gauss rifle support, and a Stalker waaaaaaay back lobbing streams of missiles at people. 

What does all that mean? It means my 100 ton Atlas mech punches stuff and shoots stuff with bullets the size of cars, the cyclops ""commands"" the battlefield and boosts everyone's initiative while giving sensor locks to mechs that are out of range all while laser vomiting at anyone who survives the Atlas. Mr King Crab snipes anybody anywhere by either coring the torso of their mech, or striping off a particularly well armed... arm.... of a mech... (that sentence feels weird but i promise, it makes sense) But while all that's happening my Stalker mech is in the back, behind a hill, pretty much a frame with no armor and missiles packed so thick the pilot has to watch their orifices when the techs are loading the thing. And it is just knocking over enemy mechs left and right for the rest of em to finish off. Oh no! an enemy Atlas! eat 70 long range missiles to the face, followed by a handful of short range from my own Atlas as it closes to fisticuffs range, fall on your ass and lay there like a punk while my cyclops vomits green light at your face and my King Crab shoots your crotch over and over till you decide to give up from embarrassment from the similarity between this beating and playground memories as a child.

So yeah, do ya like turn based tactical combat where you have 4 mechs and they have 20? Do ya like customizing heat sinks, armor by area, equipment, weapons, weapon grades and ammo?

But WOW this is a truly SLOW PACED tactics game.  I have zero problems with tactics turned based games.  But this one...how SLOW can you get?  I actually got bored by the second mission.  By the time the third mission happened I was done...

Here is what is frustrating.  One of my mechs had a damaged leg.  In order to finish the mission, after defeating ALL of the bad guys, I STILL had to move...ever so slowly...inch by miserable inch the damaged mech...turn by turn...telling my other mechs to do NOTHING...while slowly...SLOWLY....S-L-O-W-L-Y...moving the mech towards the indicated area.

1990 - Read my first BT novel, Decision at Thunder Rift, with no other than Grayson Carlyle as the main character
2020 - Bought BattleTech by Harebrained Schemes
2021 - Finally finished the BT campaign after numerous restarts and finally deciding on ironman for my eventual finish

To say that my 30-year journey to relive the BT and MechWarrior novels, that I read for close to 15 years, within a video game is not only a dream come true but also a bittersweet remembering of the countless timelines the novels covered.  The time before the BT year 3025, to the years when Carlyle's Gray Death Legion was in the novels, to the numerous Technical Readout Manuals, to the arrival of the Clans, and the defeat of the Clans, are all very bittersweet to remember.

Thank you for indulging my reminiscing, so now, about the BattleTech 2018 video game.  My 3000+ hours of playing the game is because I truly love it.  No game is perfect, which includes this one, but for me, all its positives greatly outweigh its negatives.

Spoiler Alert: The review below contains hints that may make the game boring for you.  But since this is my first-ever Steam game review, I am not sophisticated enough to know how to hide my hints so do not read my hints if you do not want to make your game more predictable and enjoyable.  Otherwise, please enjoy my overzealous explanation of the game.

Positives:
-I did not encounter any game-crashing bugs, with only two game lock-ups over the thousands of hours I played (but probably my fault for leaving the game unattended while ALT-tabbed)
-The campaign mode's story is solid -- it is the classic family drama, in the likes of Darth Vader and Luke
-The career mode is open-ended and has a score when the countdown of 1200 days ends
-There is a skirmish mode in which pvp could be done against your friend/family or soon-to-be ex-friend or ex-family after you beat them repeatedly with my hints (just need to register an email but no other personal info is needed..don't think Battle Pass is needed)
-The sound effects and music are amazing, including the background/ambient music
-The voice acting is outstanding.  I think Commodore Samuel Ostergaard's voice acting is the best -- it conveys the pain, anguish, desperation, anger, and desire for revenge of someone who lost a loved one and has the means to carry out such revenge
-The concept of having one's own dropship, the Argo, in being able to upgrade it and having it affect the battle performance of one's lance is a great concept, similar to how XCOM used its base to boost battle performance (hint: max out your pay at the early stage of the game when your costs are lower)
-Lots of 'Mechs, even if one just gets the basic game with no DLCs
-This is a turn-based tactics game, in the same breath as Final Fantasy Tactics and XCOM, where facing and getting behind enemies matter
-The damage is straightforward -- the weapon damage is the damage dealt when there are no damage reduction factors like cover, guard, or bulwark is in effect -- and those damage reductions stack
-The ""percentage hit chance"" adds some chance that we do not always get what we want even if there is a 95% chance to hit a 'Mech's body part
-With careful positioning, an eagle eye towards weapon damage, consideration of damage reduction factors (cover, guard, bulwark), it is very doable to get three 'Mech salvage parts each time (hint: look at the enemy pilot's title's since a recruit has three health -- knockdown is one health point damage; a leg destruction is a knockdown; a shoulder destroyed is one health damage -- so two destroyed shoulders and one destroyed leg is usually enough for three 'Mech parts; also, even an elite pilot who could have 5-6 health could be incapacitated -- knockdown, destroy one shoulder, destroy a leg, another knockdown, destroy the other shoulder, and if needed, use a machine gun against the head) but do the health damage one at a time since sometimes, I noticed that simultaneous damage to both shoulders and head does not count the head health damage or both shoulders destroyed at the same time sometimes count as one
-The varied ways to customize a 'Mech's weapon loadout is totally up to the player -- an Annihilator (need one of the DLCs for this one) with 505 damage is possible.  Drop the heat sinks and a player can even get more if shutting down is not a problem for that player
-It is possible to create a super-sniper 'Mech (hints: 75-ton 'Mech plus 'Mech body part with least amount of armor and structure points, plus regular Gauss rifle with Large Lasers, but a Gauss rifle and an ER PPC is even deadlier...yup...heat is still a problem but figuring that out is part of the fun of the game)
-Just like with other strategy/tactical games, a player gets to level pilots -- yes, ironman means a dead pilot upon mission completion is permanently dead (hint: do not complete the mission if you do not want to lose your favorite or not-so-favorite pilot...just simply do ALT + F4)

Negatives:
-The campaign mission AI seems to be better than non-campaign mission AI but that is why there is a difficulty setting in the options
-The basic game has a limited set of biomes and location settings -- tundra (cold), martian, desert, and forests.  The DLCs adds jungles and urban city
-The types of vehicles are very limited so it could be repetitive and boring to see the same vehicles over and over again, with the exception of Shrek PPC Carriers (hint: try saying hello to any Shrek carrier and see how long you last -- just kidding -- no, keep out of line of sight and do not even be seen by any of the Shrek's lance mates)
-The maps could get repetitive when playing in mercenary mode or doing non-campaign missions
-The Pirate missions could especially be harder than the difficulty rating indicated
-Some maps feel really claustrophobic, especially when your lance is being chased down by three lances of enemy heavy 'Mechs because you picked ""an easy Pirate mission"" with great salvage terms
-There are some jittery animations at times, like when a Marauder walks, it looks like its image is shaking.  However, there is nothing game-breaking
-The missions could get repetitive, especially when just doing difficulty levels of three skulls and below
-The missions could be very long, with the shortest I ever played lasting two rounds for less than five minutes, but with an average length of 15-30 minutes for missions that have 2.5 and higher skull difficulty.  Then again, I try to salvage as many 'Mech parts per 'Mech, so I enjoy the time trying to calculate each hit (hint: excess damage to an arm transfers to the shoulder; excess damage to a shoulder transfers to the central torso; excess damage to a leg transfers to the shoulder)
-The dialogues could be a little too long, especially when one does the ALT + F4 and has to redo an ironman mission all over.  The ironman (and non-ironman) save should occur after the dialogue

Conclusion:
-Again, my 3000+ hours of gameplay is my personal testament to this dream-come-true of this tactical lance-based combat
-I highly recommend this to any diehard BattleTech/MechWarrior novel fan
-I highly recommend this to any turn-based tactical/strategy game fan
-I highly recommend this to any robot fan
-I do not recommend this to anyone who wants a fast-moving game
-I do not recommend this to anyone who does not like counting damage against damage reduction factors
-Finally, I do not recommend this to anyone who does not have Alexa/Google Assistant/Siri/a calculator/or anyone who cannot do math and complains that the enemy 'Mech keeps getting central-torso destroyed because of being too lazy to count

Generic same feeling missions. Go here, kill thing. Go there, kill thing before it kill other thing.
Horribly uncreative mech, map, weapon, and character designs. (copyish WH40k's style, its way better)
Severe lack of customization: mechs, main character, pilots, ship.
Sloggy unsatisfying combat with little to no variation in combat loop.(Where are all the cool abilities!?)
Unremarkable and bland characters that don't stand out and beg to be forgotten.
Pushover AI that plays with kiddie gloves on. (Could have killed me 3 times but always picks the worst shots)
A plot that's supposed to feel MASSIVE, but ends up feeling like a chore you have to keep doing.
The terrible voice acting kinda becomes charming, but it takes a bit of time.
DLC is bad. It isn't satisfying at all, it's overpriced, and feels more like content held back from release.

NO MOD SUPPORT!!!!! This could've and still can (fingers crossed) fix a lot of these problems.

This however, has a couple of blaring failures though. First is a lore issue, but that can be skipped. The next issue that absolutely cripples the game and ruins the ability to continue with it, is that it artificially caps the deployable force to a single lance. This scope failure, means that it bottlenecks the gameplay style to assault mechs and nothing else. If you could deploy multiple lances literally every mechs function could be pressed into play. But the bottleneck that killed the game is the limit to a single lance. Once you hit the all assault mech point, that's it. There's nothing left to the game. Like you'll still have the ever changing types of games but it gets painfully stale from that point on. The dev's have stopped supporting the game near as I can tell, so fixing this seemingly simple issue is out of the question. Hopefully they get it right next time someone makes a battletech game.

TL;DR deep down, it's ****.  No minimaps, no friendly fire, no clip. And it burns GPUs, read about it in the official forums. Make no mistake, half of my play time is in load screens.

It should be titled ""Lance Commander"".

You're in charge of someone else's Merc Company, you don't get to choose or change your dropship pilot, XO, Engineer or Mech Engineer. You get to select where to go in a very small area and adjust pay for your MechWarriors.

They sold out to Paradox. Nothing was learned from the Microsoft buyout.

The longer the game runs, the slower it gets. Painfuly slow.

Please wait while we load the loading screen.

Pretty racist, the only black guy that has a role, he's completely useless. Gives bad intel, acts like your boss, takes command of your company, doesn't know finances before or after your new ship, doesn't go into battle, but everyone else does, his comms interrupt on-giong missions and animations, so he can say whatever useless inforamtion he can. 

""Another enemy incoming!"" That would be great intel, if I hadn't known about it before he told me. When I'm getting fired at from a new off-radar enemy, I know it's a new enemy, long before he even announces it.

https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/batteltech-100-gpu-utilization.1091398/&sdpDevPosts=0

MechWarriors are completely random with their traits, so random that you can get MechWarriors that have convict listed twice, or be a Mercenary Recruit AND Mercenary Corporal. You get the point, it goes for all traits.

Sometimes the game engine has problems with the random ship events, causing things such as ERROR does what ERROR does. Good thing ERROR wasn't an ERROR and was an ERROR. ERROR. (screenshot unavailable due to me butthurting HBS with a dick caught in blender joke).

You have a rare chance for a MechWarrior that you customized to look just like your main character, changing that bugged Mechwarrior's appearance or your main character's appearance will result in your main character looking like that MechWarrior. Only work around to this bug is to delete the bugged MechWarrior.

'Scout the Depot' objective results in the same outcome, 100% of the time. Darius says ""What the hell? There's no garrison. ... Wait, we're getting something"" with the same camera grab. It's annoying after the first three times, but the next 50 times is even more annoying and not skippable.

Some enemy turrets have a view range far exceeding what is possible for your mechs.

Some missions yield 22 enemies vs your 4 mechs. ""It's about tactics"", nope, it's about fielding mechs with max armor and the heaviest hitting weapons for alpha strikes. Any light mech you have that has max evasion will get destroyed within one round, because when 22 things shoot at it, it runs out of evasion after being shot at 4 - 6 times.

After the campaign all missions consist of your 4 mechs vs 8 to 12 enemy vehicles/asasault mechs that can randomly headshot any of your mechs and instantly kill them. It's less of a tactical thing, and more of a being able to field the hardest hitting weapons available to be able to kill in one shot. Because the enemy rarely misses.

Called shot for the head in a nutshell: I'LL SHOOT THE LEG INSTEAD!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1370655316 

The first Mech combat game from the BattleTech universe in a very long time and they chose Unity... Me being a fan of BattleTech/MechWarrior is not going to blind me to this abomination.

It's turn based... and we have to sit through every slow moving mech and vehicle from point A to Point B with no way to speed it up. (Hey, they fixed this, sort of... mechs sometimes take baby steps STILL, for a few seconds when they arrive at their destination.)

Firing two lasers from the side torsos can have a cross eyed effect, not going straight from the mech, but up to 45 degrees to the side. Why? The lense moves when you move?

Once you spot and identify a mech and it goes out of visual range, it automatically becomes unknown. Really? I saw that it was a Locust, but my guys get amnesia right away and see the radar blimp ""Uhhhh... I don't know what that is"".

Zoom in on the wheeled vehicles and find out... the wheels don't even rotate, it's just a block, the entire vehicle is just a moving block.

Enemy vehicles will drive into rocks, literally, they clip right into them.

Mech customization is severely limited due to not being able to swap out the engine.

Never thought I'd see the day when a game would run worse and have more bugs than Stellaris.

It was rushed, badly. It's a rough Beta, core features are done, no optimization or bug fixes in the game. Expect to spend up to a minute in black loading screens which run at 1 FPS. Expect jerky lag up to two seconds when moving, selecting mechs, firing or moving.

Pathing.... the game lays out a path your mech will travel. But sometimes, it does it's own thing, running in circles or tripping over itself, starts moving left, then jukes to the right. Weird... the line was STRAIGHT in the move preview, with no obstacles.

This game sexually assaults you with all of that camera grabbing it does, even if you have all the options for such grabbing turned off. Where's a moderator when I need one, I'm being sexually harassed!

Cool game, but the forum moderators are hardcore Nazis.

I got the achievement ""Is it hot in here?"" for destroying parts of my mech by overheating. Only problem... parts blew off due to death from above, something completely unrelated to the achievement.

This game burns your GPU with a passion, even on lowest settings. Weird since GTA V on max settings doesn't nuke my **** anywhere near as hard as this.

You can shoot through terrain and other mechs.

If you're around 300k C-Bills, the game will warn you about it, four times a month, completely stopping the game to remind you. Well no **** I'm almost out of money, my MechWarriors need 109 days to heal after that last **** show you sent me on.

The game lags heavily.

In the Mech Lab (the place where you fit and repair your mechs), if you sort it by ballistic weapons, it also shows the ammo, making it pretty lame to scroll through the screen to get what you want fitted.

It uses Unity.

You spend more time waiting for your mechs to repair and your MechWarriors to heal.

You have a huge debt that you're never told how much is left, so.. spend spend spend on... thorwing C-Bills into the fire I guess.

Your ship's crew argues over crap, some destroy parts of it, which.. SURPRISE! Angers the banks.. so you have to pay for it.

Character creation and past setup the stage for your character's skill. You can choose to be a she, he or they. Customize the look of your character (picture) from various settings including complection, skin/eyehair color, paint, tattoos, make-up and scars. Limited clothing options, but that's not what you're playing the game for.

Story is alright, if you don't mind missing out on ALL of the story up until you're placed on some planet with some lady and old dude. And then missing out on three years.

Graphics... well, it's Unity.

I do wish for the first tutorial section, they'd choose between fully voiced, or all text, since they switch voice to text and back and forth very often. I find it annoying.

Animations aren't too bad, except every mech that falls over, lands on it's back, destroyed or not, hit from behind. (I stand corrected, mechs do fall forward when dead... even if they were hit in the front)

It's mech combat, so that's a plus.

Destroy mechs, tanks, turrets, buildings, etc. The explosions themselves and damage states leave something to be desired.

* Takes forever to load. (3 Minutes to load the tutorial..  4+ for first level)
* Makes my video card run @ 100%  (R9 290! and I still have crap fps!)
* Graphics like a mobile game but drops FPS when you fire weapons.
* AI takes 30 seconds to decide what it's going to do if there are more then about six units on screen.
* FPS drop when ANYTHING explodes.

I tried about a dozen fixes I found online.  Still drops FPS.  Then when I finally decide to just suck it up and play..... the first level locks up and I have to play it again.  Screw that.

I returned this game and I'm glad I was able to get my money back.
My recommendation is to go play a mechwarior knock off on your phone.  At least it will run smoothly.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game. I have been a Battletech/Mechwarrior fan for a long time (Games and Books, and even the old animated show). They got a lot of things right, and its pretty impressive for being a Unity game. Though its not without its glitches. Sometimes your shots will hit an invisible wall (Though this is not common).

I really enjoyed trying to go about completing a mission in a way other than would the game may expect.

The campaign itself is pretty good. Some good characters in there, and you can really go at your own pace. I did a lot more missions than I really needed too. This typically meant I had a stronger lance than was needed, even though I played on one of the harder difficulties.

If I had an annoyance it was with how they implemented the move vs action system. Lets say a mech has a move range of 6 for one turn. And you move it one square. Thats it. No then deciding to move the additional 5 squares. It would also have been nice to be able to pick the order of move and action. Instead, a mechwarrior needs to have an ability that would let them attack first, and then move.

Mechwarrior 5 should have just embraced this aesthetic. There is a lot going on, a lot of variability, and a lot to learn. You can take your time. Now, I mention vanilla because another benefit is this game has a lot of loving modders who have made a massive add-on to the game.

*Original Review*
To any old Mechcommander fans: this is probably as close as we're going to get to MC3.  Solid game getting better as DLC and mods expand on it.  Was great on day 1 and is even better now.  Not going to change your life or anything but if you like Battletech and/or turn based combat there's a great mix going on here.  Also, shockingly, heavier isn't always better here.  Light mech strategies have a place, speed actually has value.

BattleTech is a strategy game based on the tabletop game of the same universe. Basically, big mechs stomping around shooting up stuff and doing war crimes. Fun times! The game has two levels, the tactical view which is based on a triangular dot / Hexagonal grid placement, and a strategic view which gives you a view of the southern part of the known galaxy. There are two sorts of game, three if you count skirmish but it’s so similar to the main game that it’s just the tactical level. You have the campaign and the career modes. In some ways you get two main games, and I would call it a strength not a weakness. The game is all about being a mercenary company of mechwarriors, shoot other mechs, destroy buildings and recover packages.

Gameplay

In terms of the main show of the game, the tactical game is very solid. It can be a little dazzling as there is a lot to pay attention to but this can all be learned over time. The game is very much centred around being a mercenary, you go in to do a job, achieve it and get out. You are dropped in a Lance, that is BattleTech speak for a squad of four mechs, you then usually have to blow up or destroy something, and then go back to your dropship and taken back into orbit. It is a turn based game that has a staggered timing system, 5 to 1. Each mech has a speed rating which says when it will act in the turn, so smaller mechs have the ability to do something and usually run away and be annoying. Slower mechs are usually colossuses that lumber slowly around the battlefield firing as much dakka as they can. Each turn usually starts with you moving and then shooting. The more a mech moves, the more evasion it gains, which is a way to reduce the accuracy of enemies trying to fire at that mech. Small mechs rely on zooming around the map not getting instantly clobbered. Shooting is the opposite affair, it’s usually a percentage and scales by 5%. All the guns have different ranges so being at the right range is important. Lastly there is damage, mechs have an outer armour, this is designed to be shot at and costs nothing to replace, much to the annoyance of purists. Once the armour of a part of a mech has gone, then internal systems get hit and this is when the anxiety kicks in. This can result in limbs being blown off, guns being destroyed and the mech possibly being cored. In that case the mech blows up and is gone.

So what do I think of this gameplay? It’s good, once you’ve got down how these basic systems work, alongside heat levels and balance the game gives you a lot of things to keep an eye on. When you know how to play the game, all of these become second nature and adds to the game. It’s less of a hassle than say Darkest Dungeon with it’s numerous systems which can bone you at any point. BattleTech is quite forgiving in that regard, however playing badly will get your Mechwarriors killed. One criticism of the game is that as you get familiar with the games systems and triggers, it’s very easy to set up a mission how you want. Also the maps, while having a lot of variety get familiar quickly with you knowing how the mission is going to go. One other problem is Leopard dropships, do not walk on any points with a red triangle on them. If the mission completes at any time, that ship will come down and insta-kill your mech.

In terms of strategy game, again, the game is solid. The strategy layer is very much business, you have to pay your mechwarriors, upkeeping your mechs, your ship, replacing weapons, making repairs. All of this before you think about buying new parts and mechs. Thankfully, once you know what you are doing the money comes in easily. One thing you will find yourself saying in the game is that when one of your mechs arms comes off is “oh no, that’s expensive!”. Hell, as a little role play experience I try to only shoot lasers when destroying buildings as getting more ammo would cost money. Also, the after mission report is one of the highlights of the game, LOOT! Get three pieces of a mech and congratulations, you get one of those mechs. Most of the time, shooting a mech usually only creates one part in the loot, however a clean headshot will give up three parts, if you’ve done your negotiations well then you can get that brand new mech BAYBEE! Moments like that are absolute gamechangers and you can feel it in subsequent missions. I am putting the cart before the horse when I should be talking about contracts. Contracts go from half to 5. There are ten levels but in this game the levels go up in halves, so half to 5. These levels are steep, and biting off more than you can chew can see you lose mechwarriors or worse, the mech itself. Going into missions is apprehensive as you’re not sure what you’ll face, as you get experienced though, the game turns into Pokemon as when you see a mech you haven’t got in the wild, it’s attempted headshot time.

I had previously said that there are two game modes, campaign and career. I would strongly advise that you play career as it is a tutorial and gives you a lot of latitude to make mistakes, even though some missions are straight up brutal. The campaign is a story mode, and will give you a preset team and mechs, the story missions pay out a lot and will punctuate the game. However, in my opinion, this is the side show. Career mode is very familiar once you’ve played the campaign, and with a few DLCs it is strengthened with some lovely extra story content called flashpoints. The career mode really makes you feel like a mercenary, taking your crew around the southern part of the periphery. This is where when you make good decisions in battle or in the shop it feels like it was all down to you.

Aesthetics

This game is an elegant beauty. The artwork is some of the best I have seen in any game. The soundtrack is engaging and fitting. I’ve played a few other Battletech games, but they always had this overly pumped up and rocky soundtrack that was a little too macho. This one on the other hand presents itself as more sombre and melancholic, this you can tell immediately from the opening cutscene which gives you a good rushed history of the setting. The music, the one in the intro is called “for all mankind” it’s a tune I will come back to as it’s this lovely combination of moving, tragic, and grandiose. The in-game graphics are excellent, you can tell what mechs are what type from outlines in game quite easily. The character models are somewhat wooden but I can forgive this considering they are secondary to the game.  The scenery is excellent, it’s clear to see what is what without looking like a hex grid. The voice acting is mostly good too, there is one male pilot you’ll always remember, you’ll know him when you hear him, but he adds a light hearted silliness to the game. The story is decent as well, nothing breathtaking but something that moves its way around your brain. For me though where the aesthetics fail a little bit is the main menu in the strategy segment of the game. Switching to different sections of the ship is tricky as the buttons aren’t quite accessible and using the larger buttons takes longer. Also when going through the crew roster to advance Mechwarrior abilities, it keeps scrolling the menu back up which is an extremely mild irritation. Ultimately I would love to see more of the BattleTech universe through the lens of Harebrained Schemes, their depiction of the game is very accessible and relatable.

Overall

BattleTech is a dry, slow moving game. However if you work with that pace and the drama found in those tiny moments it can put a real smile, or frown, on your face. Every time a mech goes boom in the game, every time that special loot comes up, every time that new mech build becomes ready, it provides that tiny excitement. At its current price of £35, it’s a decent price for a strategy buff, if it ever goes down to sale for £20 it is worth some serious consideration. Also snap up the DLCs, they are mostly good.

But if you've played any MechWarrior game or any other BattleTech game, this rendition of BattleTech (as usual it seems) has some weirdness to it.  It also an extremely truncated weapons list, which bothers me on a number of levels.

...or rather...  it's not that those weapons don't necessarily exist.  It is that a lot of them are special missions salvage only.  If those missions were a little more common, I'd be less annoyed about it?  But I'm fifty hours in and have a single Large Pulse Laser.  That's kinda' bad.  See, they're technically LosTech in this era, along with Ultra Auto Cannons, LBX Autocannons, Streak SRMs, ER Lasers, so on and so forth.  Functionally, this means I can list all the weapons in this post quite easily:

Missiles:  SRM2, SRM4, SRM6, LRM5, LRM10, LRM15, LRM20
Autocanons:  AC2, AC5, AC10, AC20
Lasers:  Small, Medium, Large
PPC's:  PPC

And that's it.  It's not an impossibly small list of armaments, but the rules governing their use is a little weird, Small Lasers are rare, and generally good luck building several setups like you might be used to.

Most importantly HBS's love for the franchise really comes through in the attention to detail and the overall feel of the game, which isn't surprising as some folks involved at HBS are from the older FASA days and Mechcommander design team. 

It's a turn-based game where you find yourself inheriting a ragtag mercenary unit and work for various competing factions of the inner sphere and periphery states. For those interested, it takes place in 3025, during the Succession Wars, all the big inner sphere factions are present, but the campaign focusses on working for the 'Aurigan  Coalition' in a remote part of the periphery. You'll spend the campaign flying around on your drop ship, doing missions for the coalition (who are fighting a civil war over a handful of star systems, the antagonists are backed by the Taurian Confederation and its refreshing that the campaign shies away from the usual big 4 inner sphere houses).

You will flit around a small section of periphery space in your drop ship, modding it, buying add-ons as your finances grown. training your pilots etc and putting your lance of battlemechs (up to 4) through various types of missions (straight up fights, base capture, base defence etc). Although the campaign focusses on the aurigan coalition, you'll be able to do missions for/against plenty of other inner sphere factions. 

Gameplay-wise It's not a perfect representation of the miniature game by any means, but it definitely carries forward the right spirit and I like the way HBS have adapted the classic Battletech miniature game rules for their turn-based video game. 

While I can happily recommend this game there are a few caveats:

1) - It's not very well optimised to my mind, I have a decent rig and the FPS varies widly from 90 down to 30-40 depending on the terrain. The urban maps are particularly bothersome. I have a radeon card so it may be better on nvidia. 

2) - The mission difficulties vary from very, very easy to hellishly difficult and the estimated mission difficulty rating before you select your mission can be VERY innaccurate - I appreciate this seems to be a 'feature' of the game, playing on bad intel etc,  but keep it in mind, particularly on iron man mode if you're the salty type. 

3) - Each of the DLC provide nice game features, but they're a bit pricey and the features feel like things that should have been included in the base game to me, wait for a sale. 

All in all, if you're a fan of BattleTech as I am, get it! It's not as though we have many options for decent video games these days based on the franchise, but this is definitely a good game in its own right.

What makes this game so bad:

1: Long loading time on everything. 

2: Ugly and confusing UI. Everything involves extra clicks.

3: Emotionless characters. Everyone on the ship feels so dead. Despite being 3D modeled, characters don't even open their mouth when they speak. 

4: Unskippable cut scene every time you travel to another system (ranging from 30 seconds to 1 minute. Seriously, what's the point of this nonsense.)

5: A story that you will never care. 

6: If you want a new mech, you have to grind (collecting parts). The grinding is unbearable in this game.

Flashpoint DLC was an attempt at further improving this game but it seems like the game developers and the mod developers dont get along or something.  I bought the DLC and it doesnt work.  The instructions on downloading Roguetech are misleading and complicated for the average gamer and Im having to do clean installs over and over again due to glitches, incompatiility with Battletech and Roguetech.
All the different update versions and programer jargen,....just gets old.

im now burnt out on working so hard to play a game I already paid for.   sheesh man

UPDATE

Furthermore,.....I tried the ""RogueTech"" MOD and very initially  very excited how it added SO MUCH MORE DEPTH AND CONTENT WITHOUT SILLY PRICES.
After Playing it for the last few months,.....the developer of the MOD has done nothing but try to make it harder and harder to win, while badmouthing and blocking anyone that disagrees with her from Nexus forums, ..well,....shows, daily, that she doesn't want feedback,..just praise. 
Honestly, it has gotten worse with each update. I just played a game where the enemy mechs had a ""Blinding Flare"" that takes away targeting ability from a single mech for like ten rounds. It was a Catapult and apparently it had two of these devices and it split its fire and effectively made half my lance useless. 
This and the fact that you get dropped into tactic nightmares almost regularly, are ALWAYS outnumbered, out classed, and scrambling to just survive for a few rounds (Mind you this is on the easiest settings).
I tried to talk with her about it and explain that it seemed like she has played this so much and obviously must be a super pro at the game (not to mention being the one who programmed the MOD and knows exactly how to beat it), but that not everyone has the time she must have to play that much. Learning curve is important in a game and in a MOD.
So,....Ive read all the articles, all the pages she keeps claiming nobody reads. Ive tried to understand why she is so hostile. Ive tried to wait and see if it all balances out in time. I even tried going back to the vanilla game out of sheer frustration and disapointment but,...now that Im used to the few major GOOD changes ""Roguetech"" made that helped uplift the game, ...the vanilla version is just unbearable. 
Its quite possible that steam will remove this to support its MOD community or becuase I violated some minor statute in the rules for speaking my mind on this, but if I save one person from the following list of issues I found with this MOD,..then I will be happy.

Here are the big issues:

-Roguetech MOD is updated too frequently and sometimes you have to delete or not use your saved game,OR expect glitches and crashes if you dont do a fresh install of both the vanilla game and Roguetech.

-The developer,...covered this above.

-The loading process, takes way too long

-The A.I., has been really improved but there are two A.I. entities to consider, not just the enemy. My dropship pilot or the tactical dude who sets up the missions, WOULD BE SHOT, for dropping my lance into some of the obvious traps and worst locations on the map,..ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME! So,..what about that A.I.???

-The battles have stopped making sense at all. Its like if you were playing D and D back in your collage days and the GM says ""Well your first level elf mage just stumbled into the war camp of 100 ""Dragons Of Hell Fire"" with 1000 followers each (all ""Dread Lords Of Chaos"") and,...your weapons just turned to dust.....yeah."" The whole focus has become the ""look what I can do"" of making the game more and more difficult without any thought to continuity or game-play and you can just forget about a learning curve,......SHE DONT CARE IF ITS FUN.

-New update, well, new rules, new game play,..my god its Mechwarrior online the tactics version.  Everytime you start to get a slight edge,..UPDATE uh oh,....toss your save and totally rethink this game because susy modmaker thought of another crafty way to make this more of a challenge,........come on dude.


Brothers and sisters,...I'm tired of this MOD, its arrogant developer, the lack luster vanilla version of this game (that spawned MOD developers to fix so much), all the fan boys and girls that champion the development of a majorly flawed MOD and just keep seeking ""Hell mode"" and ""Cow level"" to what could have been,..a great accomplishment. 

No more updates, no more paying for new additions that should be with the original game I paid for,..and ABSOLUTELY no more a$$ kissing MOD developers because they work for free. That's their choice, if they wanted a$$ kissing, they should have named the MOD', A$$TECH.

thanks for your time,...Im going to go play a game that makes sense.

UPDATE......wow, major improvements in all the right areas.  putting the "" "" creator aside, this group of modders has completely turned this mod around  -Roguetech- has surpassed all expectation, silenced me into awe, and deserves the title of best mod this century.  I dont often give good reviews and im a bit hard on modders and developers but I know when to say Ive been humbled.  Not by the attitude of early founders of this mod, but the obvious hard work and creativity of the team that fixed every single major flaw, and improved the game play on top of it.

I went from supporting this game to not at all.   I'm not sure who is running this circus but it seems a bunch of children are running amok in the software businesses anymore.  It has evolved into probably one of the most dysfunctional, toxic, abusive communities out there for customers. That says a lot in today's world. 

I was playing a mod that is even broader than this original game for a while (Rougetech). Though Rougetech is and unprofessional bug ridden mess it expands the playing universe and units. Sadly, they (those in in charge from the top down) went full-mental-meltdown on their fans and shutdown their own online mod and ran the whole entire concept into the ground because they couldn't handle the basic concepts and premises of community relations. They have found a way to make everyone they interact with- enemies. It is study failure in process and what NOT to do. There has never been a mod so deserving of extinction and it creators so actively promoting it! They just need to walk away and let someone more competent fill the void. Sadly, the main game (Battletech) and community is not much better as their consumer response and boards is just as much a mess.

Finally, for those obvious loser and clown company plants in the message boards (those in charge and steam should be ashamed of themselves for allowing/promoting this), this has gotten so obnoxious in almost every paradox steam board, just no..lol.  Mod support does NOT equal being able to control whether your software patches and screws up everything.  Being able to prevent some stupid software company from deciding for me and forcing a software change is not entitlement- get a clue in life stop playing with lego's and get out of your moma's basement!

I had been enjoying myself until I hit the mission ""Liberate Smithson"", which was, to put it bluntly, a utter slog of a mission which raised the difficulty the same way that Games Workshop raises the prices of their plastic miniatures: uncomfortably high. I then proceeded to rip into the game for lacking balance, and uninstalled, resolving never to return to the game. 

But then something happened: I found myself feeling a slight hint of guilt for not giving the game a fair chance. So, after some difficulties with my home internet, I reinstalled the game, and now I'm pretty fond of it. This doesn't make Smithson one of the worst levels in gaming however, fuck that mission. 

Battletech is first and foremost a tactical game with strategic management elements, similar to the X-COM/XCOM franchise. Unlike in XCOM, where the closest you will ever get to commanding a giant motherfucking robot is slicing off some poor sod's limbs and sticking him in a hulkbuster suit, Battletech has you control four oversized mobile Rock'em-Sock'em robots, fitted with enough raw firepower to level small towns. In addition to this, you also manage a team of MechWarriors, one of which is your personal avatar in the game. MechWarriors gain experience as they fight, which can be spent to unlock stat upgrades and nifty skills that aid them in coring every damn mecha that so much as looks at them funny. 

However, by far the biggest issue of this game is the pacing. It can take upwards of five minutes for the AI to end its turn and let you actually play the game, and you have no control during the long segments where the AI barrages your lance with dakka, and there's few ways to mitigate damage other than 'Turn your mech to present the less damaged side towards the enemy'. Then, when it finally rolls around to your go, you'll often get interrupted while the AI moves the [i]other[/i] units it hadn't moved during the bulk of its turn. It's boring, frustrating, and often unfair when the AI has tons of units, and you can only ever bring four. 

However, despite this, I found that after the intial speedbump, I was having a lot of fun. The AI aside, your Mechwarriors have a lot of personality (especially Glitch), and there's some real charm to this game's semi-RPG mechanics. I think that, with a bit more polish, some better turn mechanics, and maybe some more loadout and character building options, this sort of game could be a lot more fun. As it stands though, I can really only give this a 8/10, with the recommendation to get this on sale.

This is a great game at first.  Once you start really getting battered down by what the game expects from you constantly, it starts to get tired and somewhat repetitive.  The balance does not feels as good as it should.  Enemy encounters have you generally outnumbered, and there are not sufficient layers to the strategy to make it feel especially rewarding to win.

Buy mechs. Salvage mechs. Equip mechs. Hire pilots. Chose their roles. Load. Load again. Try not to go bankrupt of your second month. 
Get to a point when you decide who takes over which planet.

This game is sort of hot garbage. The RNG is absolutely terrible. This is compounded by the fact that AI is simply going to keep attacking you long after any human player would have given up. In the actual lore of the game most any pilot would have given up. But not the AI in this trash. 
It will run a walking stick with no guns left past your 3 battered mechs to place a kick directly in the head of a virtually untouched Assault mech killing the pilot.
 The AI will manage to lose a game terribly but still hit every one of your machines in the head once or even twice just to ensure every pilot you have is injured for 2 months.
 The load times are really long. You can only field 4 mechs. You can carry up to 12 ready to fight in your ship, paying upkeep on each of them every cycle but only ever drop with 4.

The AI cheats however and that ruins the game.

The UI also gives you a huge amount of information that it never explains, I had to look up guides on what all of the ranging and targeting pips and lines mean, and I still cant tell what enemies are going next in the turn order so planning can be difficult. 

All in all I think there is a compelling experience in here that is really hampered by the way the AI behaves and outnumbers you, especially early game when you dont have the tools to deal with it, It always feels like I am playing a distinctly different game than the enemy team and that is a big time bummer.",1635745427,1635745427,False,4,1,0.528580069541931152,2,True,False,False

Well why do lighter mechs suck? Cause RNG means you can insta-kill or be insta-kill by large weaponry so you need lots of armor to prevent that happening.
In the end ALL of this could be forgiven if the game had lots of customisation and weapon variation but for some reason we have a handful of machine guns, lasers, rockets and flamethrowers and thats it.

No strategy or depth to the game at all. All combat boils down to a few different cover elements that reduce damage taken, which can be hard to see on the map with the camera view, mechs have more armor on the front than the back, and every single shot your units take have a random chance to hit that's comically low. I've played long enough to run a few missions and the pacing and watching my units just miss over, and over, and over again, made combat frustrating at first, but that feeling quickly gave way to just not caring at all. The game is stupid.

The turn based nature of the game wouldn't be bad if the cut scene time between every turn didn't add up so that you spend most of your time waiting and watching for some dumb cut scene to complete.

All of the game assets have come straight from mechwarrior, and this was just a slap-dash job to throw together some existing assets in a format with absolutely no depth at all and call it a day.

When it works.

When does it work? About 40% of the time.


Most of my turns are incrediably awkward as my actions are cut in half by massive lag spikes, the loading screens easily reach into the five minute mark and the game loves to crash behind them while leaving the cursor working and the music playing. And all of this when the game isn't letting enemy units hide inside the level geometry.



The rest of the game is solid, though the plot characters mechs and everything else looses any and all meaning unless your already familiar with the lore. If you strip out the massive performance issues and the ocasional cheating bastard who parks inside a mountain then you'd have a solid turn based game.


But unfortunately we live in the real world were no modern game can be bug tested or allowed to run good. 

Maybe if you have a NASA quantum computer or a degree in comp sci you can make this game run and have a good time, but as for me I'm stuck frustrated and mired in laggy inputs, unexplained X-Com style base/time management elements and the ocasional good old fashioned hard crash.

Update: I made the mistake of ignoring my own review, I figured after all the DLC has come out and the community made some fan patches I could get the game running. Nope. Not even the ""performance fix"" works. Don't buy.",1559952788,1635019645,False,3,0,0.504474043846130371,0,True,False,False

also started a new game in the career mode. it's a good thing that you can adjust the difficulty you're going to play in a pretty detailed way to make things very challenging.

the mech- and weapon-build-variety which you get to test on many different mission types with different difficulties is what brings me the most enjoyment in this game.


cons: 

there could be many more mechs included in this game, i know many others from mechwarrior 5 .. bring hero mechs!! also mechwarrior 5 could bring some mechs from this game for example the bullshark!

flashpoints are a nice addition to add some sidestories but i feel that they are underwhelming and too short.

my biggest issue with this is the performance. the game has so many -i like them to be called ""lags""- where the screen just freezes and then goes on after ?calculating? things, even in the menu when you choose things like travelling through space or loading up the mission screen in your spaceship after you entered a new solar system.

all in all a very nice game which could use more REALLY moneyworthy content with more in-depth flashpoints (or even a new campaign?), more mech variants and a overhauled performance",1634851071,1634851071,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are meant to be stuck in a balance / loop: you fight, you earn your money, you wait time to repair mechs, and you have to pay at the end of the month. So this waiting time to repair mechs is supposed to offset your income speed. To overcome this you can stuff most of your mechs with LRMs and have a couple of drivers with a sensory lock skill to be able to detect and kill enemies without having a line of sight to them (preferably, have jump jets in your mechs to kite the enemies). This allows you to go through missions without damage and, thus, without delays to be able to complete several missions in a single day. This way you make money quickly, but LRM-ing your enemies becomes quite boring. But any other type of enemy engagement punishes you by incurring repair wait time.

It has gotten much better with the expansions compared when I first reviewed it (see below). But they really want to stick with the 4 mech cap. Better go assault.

I wanted to love this game. I really did. I put the hours in, but this game is so persistantly annoying for so many reasons.

Wait for the DLC to come out and then see if you can get a discounted bundle. 

Problems include but are NOT limited to:

1. Lance Size

You are locked at 4 mechs. Period. Campaign or skirmish mode it makes no diffrence. At the very least they could have gone the way of xcom and let you field 6 units in leiu of letting you use 2 lances of 4 mechs each. But no, and this causes all sorts of problems. 

In the campaign you are badly outnumbered in virtually every single mission. 2 to 1 generally. I would have the tonnage recommended by the game and I would still land in an impossible mission becasue the enemy would hit me with 2 full lances at once. Most of the time the game is good enough to let you employ defeat in detail and attack you with only one lance at a time, but not always. 

The ship you have has capacity for a ton more mechs than 4. You also unlock the ability to have many many more than 4 mech warriors in your employ at a time. Some will sit there and argue that this allows you greater flexibility in your deployments depending on the enviroment and nature of the mission. However, every single mech and pilot you have costs money every month to maintain. To spend thousands on mechs and pilots you will end up using once or twice simply for the sake of having them is not sound business stratagy. Battletech at its very best is a game that simulates the month to month running of a mercanary company. That means it really ought to give you the flexibility to deploy the way you want if you are going to invest in more than six or seven mechs in your mech bays at a time.

2. Locked weapons in the campaign and skirmish mode.

There a bunch of star league weapons that are virtually impossible to get in the campaign and locked away completly from skirmish mode. They are powerful so I can see making it hard to get them in the campaign, but to lock them out of skirmish mode just because? Seriousely? Probably on the way in the form of paid DLC.

3. The campaign makes it a royal pain to get new mechs.

Back in the good old days of Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries you could buy assault mechs and that was that. Here, you have to destroy and salvage three pieces of each mech you want to use in order to field it. This is just beyond aggravating, as there are diffrent variants of each mech and only components from the same variant can be used to rebuild the mechs you salvage. There is a mech store, but in 40+ hours of campagining I saw like two mechs you could buy. Both were pretty useless. Better hope your missions lead you to the stuff you want.

Thus, if you want the assault mechs for your campaign you have to blow up three of them and hope you can get the salvage to rebuild them. Can we just go steal them? Nope. Can we buy them? Nope. You are gonna GRIND for them.

(Minor Spoiler Alert)

Following issues 2 and 3, there is a mission in the campaign where you take this huge castle full of mechs and weapons. And then OMG. This small force of comes to attack you and the brillant descision is then made to blow the entire thing up by this chippy idiot on your side who has to go and yell ""SUPRIIIIIISE"" as he annihalates your motherload of mechs and weapons.

Some missions can get pretty brutal, especially some of the scripted escort or plot missions that force you to take dead weight characters instead of your A-team or even B-team, or which force you to accompany NPCs with a death wish.  I definitely hit a few frustrating walls at various times while playing.  There are also some marathons where you just have to endure a seemingly endless stream of foes - you might only fight 3-4 at a time, but you may rinse and repeat 3-4 times over the same mission.

This would be a good game in general, but it really helps that it's Battletech - I grew up playing Mechwarrior video games and the Mechwarrior tabletop RPG, so the setting is very familiar, and for me, that helps me overlook some faults.

There are times you are going to get RNG screwed, but it's usually not too bad.  I have had plot missions where a particular character has to survive, only to have them cored or head-shotted after just a round of attacks or two, but it's fairly rare, so it doesn't generally feel too cheap.

I enjoyed this game a lot, so far.   My most recent mission had me racing the clock to get my character's mech in position to destroy a dropship/spaceport control center before a new wave of enemies could make planetfall.  

But that meant throwing my 3 best squadmates right into the grinder to draw all the enemy mech fire.  They took a pounding from the advancing enemy, and sadly one well placed crit killed ""Glitch""; one of my favorite pilots before I could command her to eject.   I was racing the clock (and thanking my wisdom to mod my mech with a custom loadout and jump jets). 

With only one turn left before the dropship landed, I made it up the cliff face and unloaded everything into the base control structure.  But the victory was tempered with the loss of a mech pilot.

This is a game that makes you ""play one more drop mission"" and then you realize its 2am.... and you do it anyway!

All in all, the game has good and bad.
But it also has unrealised ambitions, and that is what tips the balance towards a non-recommandation for me.

While it has good art, sound etc, gameplay has unsatifying or even frustrating sides.
The forced camera animations are especially bad (after an update, some of it can be disabled, but not all of it).

The campaign balance was updated at some point, because of random difficulty spikes.

In the past ive played Mechwarrior 2, Mech 2 Mercs, Mech 3 and 4 and now 5, finished them all apart from mech 5, Ive also played and finished mech commander 1, So i know the mech universe pretty well.
Ive also played xcom 1 and 2 to death and wasteland turn based games, but this one i cannot get my head around at all, i think the tutorial is too vague, i do not like the UI either, its not that well explained in the tutorial.

I have tried 3 times since the game came out to get past the first mission after the tutorial and i just get bored so quickly, the game is so slow paced and i don't understand as to why on some turns i can move my mechs and on another turn i cannot, this game gave me a terrible 1st impression.

The graphics are good, so is the sound, but i just do not enjoy it, i cannot get into it. 

The best way to improve this game is to reboot it to real time mode like the mech commander series.

I wish i could give an average rating rather than a thumbs down, as i feel its a bit harsh, but i just really think its not that good compared to mech commander, x com 2 or wasteland 2\3.

The Battletech Universe is so rich, diverse and spans such a long time with different eras, it would be nice if that had been showcased in the game. 

If you like being able to modify your units in a squad, turn based tactical game, with strategic finances this game is for you. 

The salvage I particularly liked. It has some limitations (if you destroy a side torso, and a mech loses an arm, it considers the arm destroyed along with any weapons or equipment in it). But, overall I really liked the way it is handled. 

If you like Battletech this game is for you. 

If you lick windows, this game probably isn't for you. 

If you want infantry, powered armor, aerospace, off board artillery, a variety of drop ships, Clans, full mech customization make sure to have realistic expectations about this game. It doesn't have any of that for the player. 

My recommendation is get this game on sale. Its fun, it can be challenging depending on settings and if you get unlucky in the first few missions.

Do you have a thing for big robots (Gundam Mobile Suits, Power Ranger's Zords , the titans of WH40K or the old Mech warrior games/ 90s animated series)?
Do you like turn based role play games that have a sizeable amount of rules including some micro-management to consider?
Do you wonder what it would be like to run your own business?

If you answered YES to all 3, then this is a game you should consider. 

After an initial tutorial mission, you become the commander of a squad of 5 mech pilots and 5 battle mechs. The second story mission pre-deploys you and three other pilots in mechs; the fifth one is not deployed and you will only find out about after the battle is over. Your initial team consists of 3 medium mechs (blackjack, shadowhunter & vindicator classes) and 2 light mechs (spider & locust classes), along with enough cash to cover your expenses for ~4 months. Personally I'd consider ditching the Locust and then the Spider for more substantial light mechs like a Javelin or Panther as soon as is possible. 

Besides completing the main story mission, you will need to perform contract missions for various clients in order to keep your business afloat. You will also need to manage your repairs after battle, along with any injuries your team sustain.  

Note that it is not cheap to buy any mech; you are far more likely to acquire new mechs through post battle salvage early on. All you need is to find 3 salvageable chassis in the same configuration in order to build a mech. Some mechs have 2 or more pre-set configurations e.g. Commando B Class is laser focused but the common D Class is Short ranged missile focused. This is important as each configuration can hold a specific number of machine guns/lasers/missiles/close-quarters weapons. Thankfully each weapon class is colour coded and there is a counter to remind you have equipped.

Missions will offer you the ability to decide on how much cash and salvage you want from the battle. The salvage element is written as a fraction X/Y where X = the number of pieces selected by you and Y is the number of randomly assigned pieces gifted to you. Partial mechs will sell from 45K (locust) to 65k (wolverine), so lots of mech hulls can offset a low cash payment.

During battle you will need to be aware of fog of war, terrain effects, heat management, weapon min/max ranges, to hit % chance and mech integrity. Your mech has a white health and an orange health for each body segment. White is removed first, then orange. When the orange health bar is depleted that section is destroyed. The head or centre torso going is death. Losing a limb is more of a hindrance. Minor armour damage will be repaired for free, everything else will cost you.

The only tips I can give are: 
Focus your fire on one target, ideally all from a similar facing to ensure the shots land in one part of the body for a quick kill.
Don't rush to progress the story; go out there and strengthen your squad first.
Pay attention to the action phase meter when encountering unknown targets without a visual confirmation. Their phase will indicate the group they belong to (light/medium/heavy/assault), so you can decide which unit is the bigger threat.

EDIT: The campaign is 20 events in total including at least 1 story only segment (noted by low payment). A leisurely pace approach will see you take ~110 hrs to complete the campaign. This equates to ~300 weeks of in game calendar. I finished with ~40 million C-bills, 8 maxed out mechwarriors, an Atlas Mk 2 , Annihilator, King Crab, All 3 Highlander variants, LosTech versions of  the Marauder, Warhammer & Black Knight along with a Thunderbolt & Hunchback as my active roster with ~20 mech chassis in storage. 

Completing the story opens up the map in full, so you can interact with houses Steiner & Kurita. If you have the DLC installed the flash points will become active. They're mini-campaigns that sometimes feature follow on battles that prevent healing & repairs. You could also be provided with a choice that will dictate the nature of a battle (e.g. escort vs attack). The criteria for a flash point are: fixed location for each mini-story; time limit (in days) to reach the relevant system; travel costs are not covered upfront; occasional weight restrictions (mech/lance); reward cache provided upon completion. You will sometimes face random minor factions instead of the other houses.",1628021975,1631995543,True,16,1,0.636990368366241455,3,True,False,False

Check the subsystems and choose where to make a hit, you must check many parameters and factors every move to decide what to do next. Misstep is fatal.

Every crew member became part of your story. Economics and research are motivating you to take all available contracts.

The sins. Game has technical problems: Mechs are moving through each other. Lasers and rockets animation sometimes ignores landscape objects such as big rocks and covers. It can start freezing for a short time without any heavy scene action or reason, just because.

Outside of that particular incident with 6 bars of evision amounting to absolutely nothing with shot after shot across turns (not even called shots) smacking the CT of a phoenix on a one or two star mission with low skill enemy pilots, this is a slightly better game than the Xbox on Windows version, if only for borderless fullscreen mode (you'd think MS of all people would have ti down...but nope). It isn't the ordeal it used to be on older PCs, but it's still nice having literally no delay when you click on a window on another screen and want to play the game again. Minor, but still cool.

One minute I hate this game and the next I'm praising it.  I get fed up and I'm ready to put it down and then something cool happens that keeps me going.  It's clear that a lot of love and attention to detail went into this game.  Here's an example... In one non-campaign, random mission, my mech lance had to spot for off-map artillery.  The goal was to wipe out an enemy base using big guns from far away.  Once I completed the spotting part, a little radio cinematic took over and it was an honest-to-god radio fire mission request.  I'm former US Army and it was very near the real thing.  That means some dev took the time to look up how these things work and put it in the game.  I was impressed.

The feeling started to fade as the next few missions ground on.  The enemy AI is nothing to write home about so to present a modicum of challenge, the game throws 6-8 enemy mechs against your 4 every sortie.  It gets old, especially when all they do is focus fire down one of your mechs at a time.  This happens every single mission and, as the repair bills rack up, the challenge of keeping a mercenary company in the black transforms from an interesting resource management exercise into a gigantic, tedious grind.  All the customization options go out the window as you're forced to play a specific way to avoid excess damage in battle.

Then two of my mercs that I'm emotionally invested in had it out with the engineering crew and I, of course, backed my fighter jocks.  Dirty grease monkeys.  Then some witty banter happened over the ship PA system... and, crap, I've played for ten more hours.  If I get one more part, I can build a heavy mech.

Now I can say I finally finished the campaign. Am I done playing the game? No. I still need to play the Flashpoints and maybe do a Career Mode Playthrough, but still I managed to do the Campaign so I decided to finally write out a Review for the game. That said. Let's get into it! 

First of all. I really love the whole story of the game. It was quite exciting and interesting overall. It was something I could follow and enjoy as the story unfolded. However, that said the story could have been a bit better in some places and some bits of the story needed a better overall feel if you will. I really wished they did another Campaign since the Campaign we play is titled as Restoration there could have been a second Campaign added in my opinion. Though the Flashpoints and other included content added with the DLCs did add some further story to the game. I just wish they continued the story of the newborn Aurigan Coalition and Kamea Arano. Sigh. Moving on. 

The gameplay of the overall game I believe needs some time to get used to since it is quite different from other turn-based tactical games out there. It took me awhile to really get used to the gameplay of the game which lead me to finally finish the game. Sometimes you need luck and prayer to get through a battle. I think personally that it makes the game a bit more exciting. When I first started playing this game when it first came out I was constantly losing my Mechwarriors and Mechs by enemy mechs headshoting my Mechs. Either something was iffy with my game or I was just getting unlucky rolls of the dice. Still the overall gameplay of the game is smooth and exciting once you get used to it. 

Finally, the art and the design of the game is quite a treat to watch. The cut-scenes of the campaign are quite awesome and always a treat to watch. I still get chills when I watch Kamea's speech at Weldry or Mastiff's last fight. Even after I have seen them several times by now. The design of the mechs are quite different from when I was younger and reading the old Battletech books for the first time. I always thought the Mechs were quite ugly when compared to say anime mecha at the time for me. Battletech made me eat my words and actually like watching these massive warmachines do battle in pretty awesome terrain and different biomes. I actually liked that different biomes affected how your mechs fought. Not to mention the different terrain types on a map was quite interesting and added a bit of more ""Watch your Feet"" while you were playing. Some of the different terrain types did help you in a fight while the majority actually hindered your mechs during a fight if you stepped on them. So to close this long paragraph the development team should be quite proud on on what they did with the visuals and environments of the game. You guys made the game alive! Thanks. 

With all that said. I really hope the team come back to the game in the future to develop another campaign or maybe even a Battletech II but I doubt it, and can only wish it. Thanks HBS for an awesome game and thanks Paradox for helping to bring the game to life. While Piranha has my thanks for redesigning many of the old Mechs into a more modern take.

Roguetech is probably the most comprehensive mod I've ever played in how much it changes the game. Once you get regular dose of it you can't put it down

It's a good game overall, especially if you're already a fan of battletech. Upgrading your mechs, experimenting with builds, leveling up your squad, upgrading the ship are all great things. I really like what they did with weapon upgrades and the like. It adds a lot of differentiation to what would otherwise be a pretty stale set of weapons. The story and characters aren't that bad either.

However the problems many others have cited such as stupidly long load times, a sometimes frustrating difficulty curve, and repetitive combat are all true. Enemy tactics and mechs start to feel the same the more you play. You can also look forward to seeing the same enemy mechs over and over again. Be prepared to fight a swarm of shadow hawks and thunderbolts. There's also the problem of lighter chassis becoming useless later in the game. Part of that exists because there's no additional cost of fielding heavier mechs and few objectives that allow light mech advantages to be useful.

they do seem to have tweaked the amount of mechs enemy's will field but to seemingly wizz all over that they tweaked RNG against you, i have noted in this most recent attempt to play that they field one heavy mech and 2 mediums or 1 and 2 lights but now you will hit every limb and blow off several before it goes down light mech's seem to get twice as much evasion as you and even with a full stack of evasion in your favour hahah they don't miss,

as i said in my earlier review i like a game that tests you but this is a joke skill and clever play should be rewarded but in this its just not its punished and will leave you with a very bitter taste.

great story, love the look and feel to the game, amazing design, very poor RNG based structure to it, its almost like the main part of this game is the story the actual aspect of playing the game feels like an after thought.


:- ORIGINAL REVIEW -:

Ok i have given this game a good go twice and both times i get 50 hrs in and i have had enough.

in the plain terms it's just not fun what it is, is frustrating, frustrating to the point that the fun is drained out of it

And here is why.

you can only ever field 4 mechs no more but yet the enemy can feild twice that number.

you have to strike a balance between armor and weapons but the enemy can seem to field mech's that will stack a full compliment of weapons and maximum armor.

then there is RNG if the game tells you it has an 80% chance to hit dont be fooled what it means is 80% chance to miss but the enemy like a QuickDraw will land all its 5 lasers and most of its missile's from the very edge of its maximum range.

Then later in the game when you finally get some solid mechs hahaha don't get complacent because the enemy will land head shot after head shot so now your heavy lance means nothing because a pilot can be taken out in no time.

and here is the most frustrating bit 114 hours in countless missions and even more countless targeted strikes at an enemy mech's head i have never that's never landed a head shot that I've aimed for I've landed random head shots but never an aimed one.

you are at such a disadvantage that the fun is sucked away i don't mind an up hill fight or a difficult game i play battle brothers and that's equally frustrating but retains its fun factor but this takes the cake and i cant help but wish i never bought it i don't think i will ever finish this game so for me its off to YouTube to see how the story ends i cant stomach another 6 tries at a mission.

oooo and the mission difficulty rating needs fixing when it says two and half skulls and your lance rating is equal don't be fooled they will field twice your numbers as i said and never miss.

the simplest way to put it is you never feel settled you never feel like you've beaten the game. Even when you finish a mission its been such an uphill fight that you don't feel satisfaction from finishing it, you leave the mission exhausted and left feeling like no matter what you would have done different you still would've got your butt handed to you.

Having said all of this if you like a game that will test you to the limit of your skill and push you past the limits of your mental stability and seem impossible to beat then this is the game for you.

it looks good, plays well and so far the story has been very well wrote all these things i have enjoyed. i just wish they would've struck an equal balance between skill, difficulty and fun rather than just skill and difficulty.",1540758794,1631404254,False,37,16,0.485486000776290894,0,True,False,False

I've been a fan of the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe for about two decades now. This game manages to convey some of the history and blaze a new trail in the lore at the same time, and it does so wonderfully. The action is relatively crisp, the weapons and customization is accurate (mostly) for the era it's set in, and the 'Mechs....... oh the 'Mechs! while you as a player don't have access to the whole catalog of 'Mechs for the era, the game offers like 80-90% of them. And then you customize them, and then you fight them, and then you make money. The all mighty C-Bill is what makes the universe go round, and you will be swimming in them if you play your cards right.

There are some cons. Most of them have been fixed via DLC, Patches, and HotFixes. But occasionally one will rear it's ugly head and will require a restart of the game. The only other con is that the game will PUNISH you for not using the best tactics for the situation. Leave a 'Mech exposed, enjoy watching it get cored by every thing on the map. Put expensive and hard to replace weapons in your arms, be prepared to scounge for new ones. Run outta money, game over, your ship gets repo'd and you can't do a damn thing about it.

After many hours of play, this is possibly my favorite video game of all time. I am heavily invested in the board game, and while I think some things are kind of dumb (mainly pilot abilities) it very much feels like playing the board game. The weapons in this game are actually better balanced than the weapons in the board game. The medium laser generates more heat and the AC/2 is not worthless; the AC/5 is the general purpose all-rounder that it is supposed to be instead of a poor relation to the PPC and large laser. The Gauss Rifle is toned-down in this game, which I like very much. The board game could learn a few things from this revised vision BattleTech, but not the limited spotting distance. Fog of War is notoriously difficult to simulate in a tabletop game without a gamemaster.

I wish some of the mech customization flexibility was present in the board game; hardpoints are a must.

I like the management side, but I think it could have been more granular. I dislike how all battletech games remove the need for speed in later missions, but I could see people not liking that. I think the mechs need not have to be repaired sequentially, after all a dropship is designed to allow the entire complement to be repaired in transit. Granted, the techs would not have the manpower to work on all machines at once, but they would not be forced to work on just one either.

The random missions are good, but eventually you ""play them out"". I cannot think of a single designed mission that was not fun, even the end of the campaign where you massacre the final goons is funny.... all bad guys in BattleTech drive King Crabs. :)

The thing that made me stop playing the game is I got to ""know"" the AI quite well after a while and could beat it easily. However, I realize that making an AI unpredictable is a tall order for a mere video game... in other words the benefit is not worth the resources that a typical video game has in the development budget.

I paid about $100 for the base game and all of the add-ons, so when you divide 100 by 278.4 you get about $0.36/hour. You cannot get that kind of value outside of reading a mass-market paperback book.

I liked the end of the game; one of the better endings for sure.

There's three main layers to this game. The first layer is the stellar neighbourhood, which involves jumping from star system to star system very much in the vein of Stellaris; different factions, planets. The lore and variety of people and planets and planetary factions is truly astounding for such an out-of-the-way part of the game; the writing is very on point. The second layer is the ship you're on, which is a bit like Mass Effect in terms of managing systems, repairing mechs, travelling, upgrading, researching contracts - it's also probably the most tedious part of the game, having to watch the screen tick down day after day during repairs and/or travel. Then there's the third-layer of the game. The mechs, the battles, the missions, which are like three-dimensional chess. Positioning is key, So is knowing your terrain. Plotting your path. Following mission guidelines. Springing traps. Evacuating.

Difficulty: The difficulty scaling feels smooth and challenging, with the option of taking harder missions if you need more of a challenge. 

Customization: It's a mech game, so obviously it's heavily built around creating custom mechs to suit your playstyle. The balancing of weapon weight, damage, damage types, etc., are all done pretty well, with no option outright better than another, it's all about maximizing the mech's frame to your needs.

This game does justice to both the Battletech universe as well as classic hex based, turn based strategy games of old. Going back to the old days of DOS games such as Steel Panthers but with great graphics and far better AI. 
It's a crime that this game wasn't continued with more DLC. This title was perfect for an entire line of DLC for new mechs, ground vehicles, new maps, etc. However what we got was really good with urban warfare and some unique mechs that appeal to the Battletech fans. 
I once heard these types of games called 'beer and pretzel' gaming, which Battletech perfectly matches. Being turn based you aren't relying on twitch reflexes and can take your time considering your moves. But that element of RNG is always present and even a perfectly executed ambush can go sideways in a hurry when a lucky shot blows your mech's legs off. 
The array of mechs is great, especially for those familiar with Battletech but it's not a requirement to understand the game. The downside is that bigger usually just means better in Battletech, and once you graduate to the largest mechs, you'll struggle to find room in your four mech 'lance' for the light mechs. There are a few mechanics to help keep small and fast mechs relevant in later stages but overall there is little reason to bring anything but your biggest guns to any given fight. 
AI is decent but too aggressive and often chooses a suicidal charge over tactics. Difficulty seems more aimed at hit probability and damage than improving how the AI approaches a fight. Higher difficulty just makes them bullet sponges while hitting you more often but AI behavior is largely unchanged. AI does make good use of terrain and mobility like jump jets but it's pretty easy to keep their brawlers at bay. 
The main campaign is decently written and is delivered in a nice art style. Choices seem fairly pointless as all roads lead to the same key battles. The story does give unique mechs and gear though. It is played fairly open ended, where you can roam the galaxy doing side missions at will between triggering campaign missions. The sandbox 'career' offers endless gameplay. It has a time limit for accomplishing certain benchmarks achievements but the career can be played beyond that forever. There is some light character development to engage with that shapes your team and who uses what mech. 
Multiplayer is an active community with some seriously good players and crazy load outs. Since there hasn't been a sequel, people are still playing this game.

Got to see a fight between distributors for FASA and FASA employees and they had power tools to tear apart the mechs as they lost segments. Quite a show. 

This game seems to have captured the flavour and behaviours of the original PnP game and abstracted a lot of the annoying admin or calculations and it also adds subtleties that are sensible and effective without altering that original flavour. 

Frankly, I love miniatures, but this games' ability to hand me game after game on vastly different 3D environments and different tactical challenges is great. 

And, like the real world, sometimes you bring a knife to a gun-fight. So much for being cocky...

I highly recommend this to anyone from the PnP days of BT and to anyone who likes essentially a faster, more scenic tactical miniatures game. If other miniatures wargames I have played had this sort of implementation, I'd be ecstatic, but most don't. This one does and it ought to be played.

EDIT: 29 AUG 2021 - I have a few bones to pick. The game is rock solid on my machine and the graphics are good. I have no issue with the turn based system because the whole movement system is tied to a hex grid and mimics the original FASA games. BUT nobody every seems to be on to go human-to-human (I've tried 4 times recently and never see an open game in North America or anywhere else) and the bots don't offer the same challenge a human would (I crave human competition). Also, mods? I can't find any with the game. Maybe I need to look somewhere else....?

The game play is alright, the story is fine, but there's so much that just wastes your time in uninteresting ways. I tried to like it, but found myself board over and over again, wishing I had more access to weapons or skills to make my characters/mechs interesting, but the game starts out slow and stays slow.

Not much on the strategy side of things. You always want a mech that has as much available tonnage as possible to outfit it with as many weapons as possible. Then you gang up on enemy mechs one by one, and withdraw one of your dudes out of line of sight if it gets battered up enough. Rinse and repeat.

I really want to love this game... but I feel like Harebrained Schemes just really hates players. There are a lot of design choices meant to punish players for playing, and in the end they just suck the fun right out of the game.

Pros:
- Battle: The mech combat is fun. It's pretty enjoyable to decapitate a mech and take it home intact.

Cons:
- Limits: You only get to take 4 units into combat, which dramatically limits your loadouts. You will almost always fight at least 1:2, sometimes up to 1:4, and that means the battles come down to staying power. The game becomes all about tonnage as you progress, and that's really sad, because the light and medium mechs are very interesting.
- Frustration: Enemy reinforcements can spawn right next to you. And they get to take their turn immediately. That means that at any point you could lose a mech to an enemy that spawns out of thin air. There is no fighting it, and no strategy involved here - they just focus fire on the closest mech, and that mech is going to die.
- Waiting: It takes 15-20 days in game to overhaul a mech. This really shuts down experimentation, especially in the early game where you have only 6 mech bays, and you need to keep spare mechs to cycle in during repairs. Timed repairs and rebuilds isn't a bad feature, it just takes way too long. I've found myself looking at contracts thinking ""I guess I can take this contract to waste some time while I wait for my new mech to load out."" There is no joy in that interaction. Just waiting.
- Bugs: Sometimes the game stops rendering animations, and you just have to exit and restart. Sometimes a single click becomes a double click and you miss some key dialogue. They aren't game breaking bugs, they just add to the feeling that the game doesn't really want you to play it.
- Restrictions: You'll likely spend the early game fighting pirates. The Black Market, where all the best weapons are found, has prices based on your pirate reputation. If they dislike you, costs are raised by 50%. If they really dislike you, costs are raised by 1000%. Why? This seems like a bug, a simple typo from 50% to 100% - but it hasn't been fixed in almost a year since it was added by a patch, so I can only assume it is intentional. It basically cuts the Black Market out of the game.",1568447709,1629994787,True,0,0,0.558305263519287109,0,True,False,False

Story 2/5 - Hardly memorable. Lots of characters and factions that you couldn't care about, let alone remember. Cut scenes are all just the same except for different dialog, just like a visual novel. 

Graphics 3/5 - Nothing special. Not well optimised even on a non-urban map (where FPS drop is so severe), the game stutters even on pre-mission menus. 

Game play 2/5 - Missions are full of artificial difficulty. There's no amount of tactics you can use if you can only drop 4 mechs against 20 mechs/vehicles of equal tonnage.

This game is so impossibly difficult that I gave a thumb up simply because I really love the previous games this developer company had made(the Shadowrun series).
-combat is map based. You accept the mission you like, and control at most 4 robots on the battlefield, and the ai throws more than double your number at you more often than not.
-game is not time sensitive . But it is extremely mistake sensitive. There is no meaningful difficulty settings. Everything is hard and tedius. A small mistake will snow-ball into game-over in no time. There is a bank loan looming over your head all the time. Very stressful.
-font size is too small for my desktop monitor at 1920 x 1080 resolution. It is so small and cannot be changed(I searched on google and steam forum) that I have to pull the monitor to my face to read it.
-choosing the wrong dialogue options during random event might cost you your best pilot (this design sucks big time, hopefully you were not playing the ironman mode because you cannot reload the game). A signature move of a-hole game  designer.
-the background story of kickstarter characters are absolutely well written. No story for other generic characters though
-absolutely good looking mechs and battlefields.

I used some cheating mods to complete the campaign for the story. Took me around 40 hours to rush through the combat crap, and I destroyed the minimum amount of enemy mechs needed , which is around 200 units according to the achievement .

Stuttery/janky move animations, firing animations have projectiles and beams leaving the the barrel at awkward angles because your torso doesn't rotate downward/upward. Weapon hits don't FEEL impactfull and there is this weird delay between your hit and actually showing its damage on the health bars. Core game play is solid enough but for 40 bux from a decent sized studio this should be a lot more polished. 

+Story: I'm diggin it so far, pretty political in nature
+Gameplay: its definitely Battletech
+Graphics: Games looks decent enough for me and the Mechs look great

-Controls: Its a simple turn based xcom'esq but it's more the lack of explanation why you can't do something that gets you. For instance if you're stuck on the Move option it won't let you swap to ranged weapons without pressing the Attack icon first but it will let you melee from move action. It won't tell you that your torso is miss aligned it just won't let you shoot either. There is no message or indicator for any of this you just kinda gotta know about it. 
-Animations: Just solid like D animations, if this was a small indi group I'd be more forgiving about it but that's not the case here. 
-Immersion? I guess? Not sure what to put it under but the fact non of the weapons actually FEEL devastating doesn't help set a mood at all. Sub par sound effects and janky animations or lack of decent impact animations are the cause of this. Limbs do fly off at least.

The game seems pretty stable now. The default audio mix is still weird, but you can adjust them all manually.
The game still struggles with framerate in places (not the end of the world since it's not exactly a first person shooter), and the steam overlay doesn't work for me but overall it's perfectly playable. 

=== Original review follows ===

Gameplay-wise, I've been enjoying the time that I've spent playing the actual game, however...
From a technical standpoint, this is the buggiest game that I have played in recent years. 
Within my ten hours of 'gameplay' (really half that) I have experienced:
- Random softlocks during missions where everything just freezes and the UI vanishes. I can't open menus or interact with anything. I have to Alt-F4 out and restart the mission.  
- UI randomly flickering and disappearing outside of missions.
- Game suddenly loses all sound (except in cutscenes). Verifying files via Steam does nothing, but switching to a previous version (through steam betas) and back again seems to fix it sometimes.
- Overlapping UI elements (e.g. talking to an NPC and also editing a mech's layout at the same time)

At this point I thought to try the usual troubleshooting including graphics driver updates, etc, only for things to get way worse:

- The cinematic intro no longer played and I got stuck at a black screen forever. I fixed this by deleting a random shared library file in the game files after following troubleshooting breadcrumbs from the Battletech forums. But then I had no sound again. I fixed the sound issue somehow (no idea how, it'll probably disappear again like before), but now...
-In some ship areas (Mech Bay in particular), 99.9% of your cursor movements are dropped. I literally can't move my cursor there. Still renders at 60fps though, so it's not a performance issue.

I've played about thirty games on Linux now, and none were as bad performing as this - even the non-native ones that run through Proton! 
I'm tempted to try using the Windows version with Proton rather than the native Linux port. Proton doesn't work out of the box, but maybe it'll be better than this hot mess.

My favorite  memories of mechwarrior games (MW 3, 4, mercs, mechcommander gold) are commanding multiple lances of mechs in real time.  
Strategy, like being able to pick apart weak elements of your enemies, setting up traps, or fighting on your terms, is lost in the random chance turn based brawl hell world where enemies spawn magically in shooting range of you or or escort. 
The career mode gameplay itself is a horrible grind, which highlights all the worst parts of being a crew of mercenaries including waiting months for a injuries/broken mechs to repair, critically blocking progression of any kind, all while you pay your monthly taxes basically.  Mech upkeep in time/resources, punished just for tinkering by waiting for weeks for the mechbay. Capturing several fractions of a mech that you will need to assemble over random chunks in certain areas. The market selling for 3x cost, while you sell for 0.1x cost. 
And in all of the other mech games I mentioned, you can field more than 4 mechwarriors! Even the first person mechwarrior games offer more tactical control than this! Mods can increase this number, but it does not help because the engine simply cannot handle having so many models at times, yours and the increased enemies to compensate (you will notice the AI calculation time increase to many minutes in mods like Battletech Advanced. Why is calculation so hard? Just attack the nearest guy, or eject if you are injured); besides, the normally engaging and intense battle of other games grinds to a halt in turn based.",1629513875,1629513875,False,4,0,0.480070888996124268,0,True,False,False

I have a lot of time in this game and it has been fun every now and then. Started fun. But mostly it's just been frustrating, and comprised of various attempts to overcome my frustration with a sh** system that so often doesn't make sense. It's also the late-game bullsh** stacking enemy lance on top of enemy lance on top of enemy lance just to make up for sh** AI. And STUPID lance weight restrictions that don't make sense in context and are clearly only there because they thought it was easier than coming up with actual storyline or gameplay that would be interesting. The grind just feels stupid, and I feel like I've wasted so much time trying to convince myself it's fun. The more I play it, the more I see the bad system's limitations and their efforts to hide it.

After some more time with the game, I've definitely come to realize that this is made for nobody but the hardcore members of the Battletech community.

I've played various MechWarrior games through my life, I've played multiple tactics games throughout my life, I've even modded some of those games (XCOM--> Long War) to make them more difficult after the initial play through. They ultimately feel like there was an effort to make the game approachable.

Battletech just spits in your face like a 90's game console advertisement. It just turns out to be the Atari Jaguar of the MechWarrior franchise.

As Is.. the game is very intriguing. It has a really well fleshed out story line for the campaign, but I like so many others get trapped by side contract hell 3 missions in, so who knows what happens next?

I swapped around the difficulty, changing to 'baby' mode in an attempt to continue and yet all that happened was that the game made 1 of 2 possible side contracts 'Restricited'. The unrestricted, 'less difficult' Orion Factory mission still results in the same antics.

Of course, I attempted to research multiple community streams just to see if there is a way forward, but every thread results in the toxic community who never actually answer your question, yet are happy to say that they beat the game on Ironman first try (not available first try so they lie).

This isn't good.. Harebrained Schemes did have some people who could calculate good math back in the Shadowrun days, but apparently not now.


Oh and yeah, the modding community is great, but to have to rely on them (still infected with toxic gremlins), in order to complete the base game is inherently a failure in design.

Edit 8AUG21 - Ok so I've put round 80 hours into this game and as far as games of this genre go its a good entry. For me  it scratches a few different itches: turn based combat, big fucken death robots, individual unit customisation, management sim, to name a few. 

-Things I like-

Combat: The actual combat (on high difficulty) is very satisfying. Managing unit heat, position and AP against tough and numerous enemies is quite satisfying. It feels good to finally smash through a challenging mission with your mechs battered.

Customisation: Building mechs is wicked. Choosing to build different mechs different ways to suit your play style and mech roles is nice. You can choose weapons, equipment and armour thickness for each individual part of the mech. 

- Things I didnt like - 

Rubber-banding: Feels like the game is babying me. Its very hard and unforgiving, when im winning. As soon as I start to lose encounters feel easier and random events (the mean kind) are fewer and farther between.

I will say that it's a great game. It is not without its issues.  None of these are game breaking for me in anyway, but, here's a bit of a shortlist:

It's immersive. You WILL get attached to your mechwarriors and mechs. It will hurt when you lose one. Some of the MWs you recruit are very well written/voice acted and seem to add a lot of flavour to an otherwise pretty bleak universe. Many of the characters and many of your recruits are not nearly as well done. That feels like a bit of a bit of a missed opportunity in an otherwise very well done BATTLETECH story.  It's only 3025 and the clans have yet to return. The future doesn't get much easier in the Inner Sphere from what little I know. Hopefully HBS gives this a bit more polish in the coming DLC and further full content releases. That being said: This is feeling *very* much like a Paradox title if for no other reason but the release strategy. 
 
As much as it pains me to say it... Good lord this game is slow. The engine feels a bit....creaky? Yeah, creaky. Like one of those sketchy elevators in an old apartment building that smells like... Something that is dead and extra-old. Loading missions becomes almost a trust exercise as it takes forever and there's a chance  the you have yourself a merry little Crashmas.
                                           (EDIT: This does seem to have been improved)

There are a couple screws to be tightened with the UI as well. Seriously, guys? I have never had to jump back and forth between my storage menus and the store menus in any game ever.  I'd mind this less if they loaded faster. A shame they don't.  Some of the mission design could use a second look as well. Sometimes you get pretttttty shafted by your placement and triggered events. 

I, personally, don't mind the look so much. I get that nicer graphics can really give a game a nice polish and help immersion. I just do not think it is really important here. I am sad, however, that the maps you stomp around on seem pretty dead. There's no one around to stomp on. Less stomping = less fun. But, it does look and FEEL like Battletech. And, for that, I am grateful.

Listen, I'll level with you. This game is not perfect. But, holy hell is it ever fun. Managing your company/Mech Storage and armaments is fun. Shooting lasers at big robots is fun. Punching big robots with your big robot is really fun. Timeline management is....well if you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't.  The story is a factory Battletech story with some nice ornamentation and a zesty cheese sauce. For me, that is a GREAT thing. The soundtrack is pretty rad. The in-game sound could be... better. Loads of weapons and equipment. Endless variation in customization. 

Is it worth $40 + DLC? As a whole, I think it is. Individually the DLC might leave you feeling a little empty inside. See: Paradox Interactive. If you have purchased it already and are feeling a little underwhelmed. ROGUETECH may give the game a whole new (hard) life for you.

Three weeks ago, things went a bit pair shaped. We were hired to jump up and down on a military convoy, and when I say jump up and down I mean it. This is a game where you command a squad of 40 ton giant robots with laser cannons for arms, but half those robots have giant jump jets strapped to them and can bounce around the map like fucking murder-bunnies. Needless to say, the convoy went bye-bye. The convoy escort were clearly being paid based on performance, because they went balls to the fucking wall to make me personally suffer for this.

I was piloting a Blackjack. This was MY Blackjack, a Black Flag Blackjack, if you like. It had two laser cannons, one in each arm, and the left arm had an even bigger laser cannon to keep the little one company. There was a third laser cannon in the chest (because nothing says 'fuck you' like crotch lasers), and it also had an autocannon because putting any more lasers on this thing would cause it to melt during an alpha strike.

You may have noticed the use of past-tense in the above paragraph, and that's because by the end of that little adventure my big laser was blown off, both my kneecaps had gone spinning away into the woods, and my torso was more a theoretical concept that an actual armoured framework. But I wasn't dead, because everyone in Battletech went to the Monty Python school of refusing to fucking die. The only way to kill a Mech is to either blow the head off and kill the pilot, blow a hole through centre mass and kill the reactor, or cause so much random damage that shrapnel and ammunition detonations cause the pilot to bleed out.

So I limped away in a Mech with as much structural support as a single-mother's household, facing three weeks in the hospital to get the shrapnel pulled out. My Blackjack was going to be out of action for almost as long. The cost of repairing it, as well as sourcing new weapons for the ones that were GONE FOREVER thanks to the eighteen thousand missiles I'd caught with my face was so extreme I honestly didn't know if it was worth the effort.

That was three weeks ago. As I staggered out of the medbay, my base of operations had jumped to a new system with a new job. Before we launched, I checked the market and discovered I could buy a new mech called a ""Warhammer"". Well, one look at my Steam Library will tell you this was a mandatory purchase.

So off we went again. Me and my three best buddies marching slowly up a hill with fuck-all cover, towards a prepared position and numerically superior foes. Our targets were rocking 35-40 ton mechs, the heavier end of the ""light"" category. They're fast, they're tricky, and they pack just enough dakka to make you wish they didn't get to fire first. So while I plodded my new toy slooooowly up the road, my buddies used what cover they could to engage. It went well enough, light damage on both sides, but the enemy was flanking us. A Jenner was speeding down the road, hell bent on getting behind us and performing a prostate exam with a quad of medium lasers and a barrage of dumbfire rockets. This was going to hurt.

Then, two glorious things happened in quick succession. First, one of my Mechs landed the most GLORIOUS lucky shot in all of MechWarrior history. He blew the head clean off an approaching enemy Mech - a proper one-in-a-hundred shot that killed the thing outright. Now we had a solid advantage in tonnage. We just had to apply it.

Enter the Warhammer.

You know I said this game is about 40-ton stompy robots with laser cannons for arms? I lied. That's what it's about at the start. The Warhammer is 70-tons of stompy robot. He doesn't have laser cannons for arms. He has laser cannons on his torso. Four of them. As a backup. His main guns, throbbing with power like Thor's mighty manhood, are Particle Projector Cannons. They get their own special name because no other weapon is worthy of sharing a category with this spectacular instrument of skull-fuckery.

You might also remember I mentioned how the only way to kill a Mech was to destroy the head or central torso. The Warhammer could have done that with a single well-placed shot. But a message had to be sent, and that message was ""you are unworthy of existing on the same planet as me."" The Warhammer took out the ENTIRE Torso - Left, Right and Centre - in a single salvo. Legend has it the arms were found in low orbit.

The Warhammer isn't even the biggest bastard stomping around in this game. Once my erection had subsided, I went online to see what else I could obtain and I found something called an 'Awesome'. It has three PPCs, and a Small Laser. One PPC is a bad day. Two PPCs deletes small mechs, as we've discussed. Three PPCs is a walking war crime. I assume that the small laser is placed between the legs of the 'Awesome' so it can piss on whatever is left of you after being bitch-slapped by a star.

Terrible implementation on many critial game features ruins your gameplay all the time.
Specifically
- terrible performance, especially dlc jungle and ecm
- ai is mostly ok but sometimes makes incredibly stupid decisions; most of the times your single lance is fighting 2 - target and reinforcement and the later comes too early or from the 1st turn; evac posion many times stupid
- no proper UI for map, contacts, market so you have little to no tools for strategic planing of your carrior; also this make so grastrating hunting for certain goods to buy and missions to run
- unrealistic target for certain career score; the game is very much repetetive with little replayability so doing stupid score kills motivation play the game at all
- bad pilot skill design: it does provide some framework for builds generally bad and doesn't help overcome some critical gameplay challenges like injuries
- bad faction politics: 1 faction doesn't count for score; pirate faction is treated as any other and alliance result in permanent enemy which is wrong - pirates must be separated for black market access
- random loot is generally ok and useless but when you have black market it total rubish; so getting access to market is a must so no ally with factions - stupid
- dlc missions flashpoint are really nice to have and give some immersion into endless grinding but the random reward sucks and big disappointment
- other dlc certain weapons are really OP and break ballance

- campain is mostly good expect several really stupid missions

Overall the game is mediocre so better stay away.

So what do we have here? A turn-based strategy in the spirit of the tabletop Battletech game. So what would we naturally expect? To play with our friends. Does this game allow us to do so? No.

Why? Good question.
The multiplayer is buggy, the meta is stale, and 90% of the time your game will either crash or disconnect if you try to play with other online. The dev team does not support the game and didn't even want to fix the multiplayer issues. Good job, devs, thank you. 

You did put in a lot of effort to ensuring DIVERSITY on the character portrait selection screen. Could've put this effort into multiplayer instead.

SINGLEPLAYER:

The campaign is extremely boring and forgettable, gameplay is time-consuming (in a bad way, see other reviews) and the AI is dumb.

This game is a lot to take in at once. I originally abandoned my attempt after trying it years ago due to my lack of understanding and patience, but holy shit am I glad I came back to try it again. 

It does a terrible job of explaining mechanics/rules, building a mech is difficult to understand for first time MechWarriors (that’s you), and invisible dice rolls leave most scratching their head in confusion. But if you can look past the bugs, the average story, and the somewhat high barrier to entry. This is genuinely one of the most amazing turn-based strategy games ever made. 

The world of BattleTech is almost 40 years old, and it shows in the best possible way. Most things have a great explanation and tons of history. Entire real books have been written on single significant battles that you hear about when exploring space in this game. If you’re a sucker for reading into the lore, you’ll love this game.

Single player story and single player sandbox style career modes are great. Usually you field up to a full lance (4) mechs. You are always out manned, but sometimes you get allies or a 3 way fight.

Co-Op is weak, limited to a single 4 on 4 match.

This is BattleTech at it's best. The MechWarrior game series is personal and real time FPS style, BattleTech is squad based, tactical, mercenary company management and a little bit about looting the corpses of your fallen enemies :)

Tip- if new to the game, make sure your lance has more 'weight' than the mission calls for... some missions may have ambushes :)

This one is a turn-based tactical game where the player controlls squads of four ""Mechs"" and fights small scale skirmishes vs. other Mechs and sometimes vehicles. The action is seen from a bird's eye 3rd person view as usual for the tactical genre.
The dystopian background story is centered around a mercenary company taking contracts and participating in the various conflicts of a future galaxy settled by various human factions fighting each other. The player has their mercenary troop travel from solar system to solar system, fight in small scale regional encounters, hire and train Mech pilots in various skills salvage Mech parts from the battlefield and upgrade their own Mechs.
The design of the combat mechanics is solid but not groundbraking. The main tactical aspects are cover, evasion by moving and attack from behind capitalising on a Mech's lower back armour. One also has to manage heat generateds by firing weapons and using jumpjets. All-in-all the fighting feels a lot like X-Com: Enemy Unknown but with a less challenging AI.
Mech customisation is also reasonable, one can chose from 3 main weapon categories (guns, lasers, missiles) and has several options in each of these including rare advanced versions. There are also auxilliary upgrades such as range finders. Detailed editing of the armour profile is possible, providing some tactical subtleties such as mechs being heavily armoured on one side only but requiring cover from a teammate on the other side. The limiting factors for all mech configurations are the tonnage allowed for each chassis and the available weapon mount points. There is a wide range of base chassis (Mech models) to chose from, most of which one has to buy after tedious grinding for funds as the mercenary outfit one has to manage is completely broke at the beginning of the campaign.
Mentioning the campaign, we come to the bad parts of the game: Multiplayer is virtually non-existent, I have been told there is a discord group and a forum on the paradox page for the few players who still fight each other online. On a friday evening I found a single open lobby which was set to private. - There is a reason less than 0.1% of players have the multiplayer-related achievements on steam.
So we are left with said singleplayer campaign: The story evolves around the player character being drawn into a succession conflict, helping a lady enforce her claim to the throne and avenge their old mentor who has been killed by the ursurper.
Rather cheesy cartoonish sequences, run-of-the-mill storyboard and dialogues that have three answer-options that all lead to the same outcome could all be forgiven for a tactical game. What can not is the repetitiveness of the missions. Grinding for funds, one will have to play the same mission on the same maps versus slightly different opponents over and over. The AI is really stupid and sometimes even fails at pathfinding. Repetitive boredom all over it is.
So maybe one could at least sit back, relax and enjoy the artworks...? Nope, sadly not! The design of the space ships is actually rather good, reminding a bit of the Perry Rhodan illustrations. But starships are only shown in cutscenes while travelling between different solar systems. These actually become an annoyance after a while, as they can not be skipped (at least not on Linux where, by the way, the game runs very well thanks to Unity).
The different Mechs often look so very similar that one has to click them and chack the info-box in order to determine what model they are. The variety of biomes is even smaller than the size of the map pool - everything looks very much like old earth. For a game set in an era of interstellar travel this is really underwhelming. Even the odd sets from George Lucas' Star Wars look more credibly alien than what Battletech offers. As a consequence of loveless design, or rather the total lack thereof, the visual appeal of the skirmish-battles is on-par with the genericity of an asset-flip.
All that comes at a steep price tag, charging extra for dlc with content so very limited even pay-for-every-button Paradox should be ashamed.

Bottomline: The main problem with Battletech is that it does break every promise made during the first two missions by sheer repetitiveness and boring look-and-feel. Don't buy, even at a bargain, unless you are being paid for the time spent playing.",1626356239,1626356239,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Several months later, this game is much better, many of the bugs are gone, the missions are better and somehow the balance is okay. 
The choice of mechs also seems better after the updates and DLCs

All in all, now, the positive points outweigh the negative points, so... well positive review

637090,95675565,76561198173600727,0,35,239,0,170,1626201358,"A classic board game made anew in PC form. Sadly it is not done so well and should be considered a pass or a buy when it is extremely cheap. Yes many reviews praise this game but I am writing this based on the merits of itself from the prospective of those familiar with BattleTech and the casual gamer.

The game itself is a strategic war simulator where you command a small company of pilots who are in large war machines. However, several elements from the original board game are included which brings to the first chief complaint, no tutorials. As you start the campaign you are given a very brief introduction to controls limited to map movement and some buttons to make your mechs move and fire weapons. It is not until after the completion of the introduction scenario where you are given something of a tutorial. This however is limited to functions on your ship and management aspect of the game for your crew. Combat elements such as what do different weapon types do, environmental conditions, weapon ranges, etc. are nowhere to be explained. For those familiar with the table top game this is not an issue, but if you are the causal gamer not familiar with these then it becomes a problem. So if you are one be prepared to do a lot of homework to figure this stuff out. 

As to the actual implementation of the game well this to has its problems. Firstly, you are limited to just 4 characters to control on the battlefield. This may not seem so bad but as you complete missions there comes a point where you could be facing upwards of 10-12 enemies who have just as heavily armed mechs as yours. Why you are unable to deploy more is a baffling choice from the developer’s stand point as you can hire a multitude of individuals to fight for you. Further you are only limited to just mechs. The game has instances where you will be facing other types of enemy units like tanks, moble rocket deployment vehicles, etc. that for some reason you cannot get. 

Additionally there are several bugs that even with patches just didn’t work. Universal problems come about in terms of initiative for combat. As it is structured, mechs and other combat vehicles which are the lightest typically go first. Yet in my playthrough I observed several instances where mechs of the same weight class as my own were given higher priority in the turn phase over light mechs for no reason. Further bugs consist of weapons being able to fire through solid structures like buildings or even high hills were line of sight is completely blocked. Mostly this was limited to enemies who performed the attacks but I had also experienced this a few times with my own. More so is a very random damage system. I had experienced instances where firing multiple times at a mech did nothing yet one shot from a weak weapon was able to instantly take out a foe. Other baffiling things consist of such things like blowing an enemy mech's leg off yet it was still able to move around like nothing happened.

The other thing to note about this game is it demands much of your time to complete one mission. Even the most simplistic of this on average takes 30 minutes to complete. Longer or more complicated missions can take anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half for that mission. There is no option to speed up combat or skip through the animations that play out. So be prepared to spend the time.

Additionally, the mission scenarios are not the most inventive. While there is some variety in terms of objectives, 99% of them can be resolved by simply just destroying enemy mechs. This combined with long turn sequences makes for a very dull game. 

Another unknown design implementation is in the campaign mode. As you create your character you are given background choices that at first seem to indicate said choices will have consequences. However they do not. Instead your background choices only allow for a few additional lines of dialogue exchanges with npc’s. You may gain some small bonuses such as your troops getting a minor buff of some sort which is mostly the case. Largely forgetful and not really anything that will tip the scales in your favor. Combined with the infrequency of them happening, it becomes a moot mechanic. Further, the campaign mode has a mechanic where if you complete missions for specific factions you gain favor. Ultimately this has no barring on the overall campaign other than just allowing you to perhaps find better mechs and gear. The only real one of consequence I have seen in my playthrough was gaining favor of a pirate faction allowing me to gain access to a black market where gear appeared at a reduced cost. There was much wasted potential in having choices really impact the overall campaign. On the writing of the campaign and story, it is very dull as well. Options are meant to give you the feel that meaningful exchange with side characters is to do something but again it does not other than provide trivial background information that plays no part in the bigger scope of the game. 

Ultimately, Battletech was a let down for me. As one who is familiar with the game I personally expected more especially with the campaign mode. Instead it is just a poorly programmed rehash of the board game. To the casual game who is not well versed in the Battletech lore or mechanics of the board game, I cannot say this is a good buy for you unless you are willing to put in the time to learn a lot of little rules that have been taken and implemented. If you are looking for something to just pick up and play because you seen giant robots fighting one another, well….your going to be disappointed.",1626197053,1626197053,False,2,0,0.461937546730041504,0,True,False,False

Some parts of Battletech are great, the story telling and introduction to the lore are really nicely done, however, the game suffers from some horrible defects which aren't approached by the developers or are completely ignored.

There's a very basic tutorial in the game which gives you the basics, but, doesn't even touch on 10% of the rest of the gameplay including the pilot skills/perks, weapon systems or additional mech's or equipment (of which there are many in Battletech). It's almost as though they expect you to know everything from the crappy tutorial and should be ""pro"" from that point on.

If you've played the rebooted UFO series you'll be familiar with the basic type of gameplay that Battletech gives you aka RNG Turn Based Tactical gameplay, just like UFO you're also gimped with a max Lance size of 4. This might not mean much initially, but, in the later missions where you're supposed to kill more than 10 enemy units it becomes silly (especially when assault mechs are involved). More so considering the AI advantage - they know all the rules to the game already and how to abuse them!

Some missions seem to be made to be almost impossible to do with all the secondary objectives, one of the main missions I did where I was raiding an ammo dump meant I was supposed to destroy 2 ammo trucks before they escaped. Bearing in mind they weren't visible from the initial attack position and you were also under attack by 8? mechs/turrets as well at the same time. I did eventually do it, but, it took 3 attempts to get all the objectives. RNG also plays a part of the normal missions as well, as if you reload to a save outside of the battle will re-randomize the enemies you'll face. e.g. I did one bounty hunting mission and on the first attempt saw an Annihilator, after realizing my deployment mistake I reloaded the out of mission save and attempted it again only to find the Annihilator had been replaced with a Victor. This effectively allows you to reload a mission until you're happy with the enemies you'll face, as it happens in my example I reloaded it a few times to see how it ""rolled"" and eventually ended up getting myself an Atlas by knocking out the pilot.

The RNG aspect of the game can be a pain in the backside. It wasn't until the very final mission of the campaign that I saw the AI gain an additional advantage from nowhere in the form of taking less damage from my weapons (they had a 20% damage reduction invisible debuff). This magical debuff then kept appearing in missions I did after completing the campaign and eventually made me stop playing altogether. At that point I had 8 or 9 assault mechs and a completely full dropship of mechs in waiting, but, nothing to do other than basic missions and the ""Hotspots"" which seem to be fairly mediocre in terms of rewards.

The biggest issue I had with it really was the way they made light mechs virtually irrelevant in the mid-late game, effectively speaking there's no point in taking them into battle with your pilots after you've finished the first 5 or 6 story missions and indeed you'll gimp yourself by doing so. You might think that skills would help with this and that's what I thought as well, though you'll find that the skills really don't help with this regard and you'll probably end up with a KO'd mech and dead or injured pilot.

Overall, it's not a bad adaptation of the boardgame, it's just a pity that the developers went down the UFO path, rather than create their own or follow the TTG more closely. The learning curve for the game is probably the worst part of getting into it, as I've already mentioned there's not much info in the game and you're somehow supposed to know all of the additional bits and pieces the dev's threw in to try and make it more interesting. If you're a fan of the lore and games, then I'd suggest waiting for this to go on sale and also to check out the mods available as they should hopefully change or help fix some of the issues I've mentioned.",1626131170,1626187228,False,10,2,0.535075843334197998,0,True,False,False

This game feels very faithful to the tabletop strategy game (though I can't say how faithful, since I don't play it). You can see rules being adjucated, and character progression, and it's turn based--meaning you have plenty of time to think on your strategy before making a move. 

The mech modification section is surprisingly deep and lets you customize a chassis with lots of variations. And each chassis 'type' has several variants, so you can seek out those perfect combinations that suit your play style.

This is Battletech. A PC version of the tabletop pen-and-paper game. 
Mechwarrior fans may find the game mechanics different from what they're used to.

In Battletech, you play the whole board. Not just the mech. Environmental factors can give help or hindrance. Crazy things can happen, such as having a lucky shot snipe and kill a pilot in their cockpit. Strategy, planning, and luck will decide the battles. Rushing your enemy will probably get you killed.

Battletech encourages you to play off the strengths of your pilots and mechs while targeting the weaknesses of your enemy mechs and defenses. Rough terrain or a hot enviornment can throw your whole plan into the trash. This game has a learning curve. Easy to learn, but it may take some time to master. There's NO autosave during combat so save scumming isn't much of an option. Fail a mission or lose a pilot and you will probably start over from the beginning of that mission.

All in all, tabletop Battletech fans will love it. I encourage the Mechwarrior fans to give it a try.

We are Clan Wolf, Children of Kerensky. We carry the honor of his name on our shoulders as our fathers did before us. The Remembrance speaks to us about the evil in man's will, the reason for Exodus, and the rights of the travel. Arcadia is our destiny and our right. Enlightenment is our gift. By the Bloodname of The Founders we must return. Return and protect that which is unique among the stars. Terra awaits us, as it was written. We are the last of the Wardens, the sole hope for the earth.

This game is great. I've been waiting for (this game) a video game like this since before the dawn of time, and I'm not disappointed. If you're a Battletech lover like I am, just get it and shut the fuck up.

That said, the gameplay is slow. I know that's an issue for the younger generation, y'all have the attention span of a cat on crack and a dozen red bulls. It's even an issue for me at times. If you want quick action, hit it and quit it type missions, this isn't for you. You actually have to talk to the girl to get her to take her clothes of here. I don't mean an idle conversation at the bar, 5th date? Nah bruh. Hour phone calls every day, a thousand texts. She's gotta know you. She's gotta trust you. She's gotta actually think she might have a future with you. You gotta meet her parents. You gotta spend time with her older brother and get him to like you. Then you might get a nip on a Saturday afternoon on the Ferris Wheel at the state fair on your tenth date. Panties ain't dropping for months and the blowies comes AFTER the first penetration.

That kinda slow.

It's fun as fuck though, and worth it. If you have the patience. As of the date of this review it's on sale. Buy it now.
Also, Mods. Great ones. Play through once then mod the shit out of it. Haven't gone Roguetech yet but I hear good things.

I was not disappointed. I cannot recommend this game enough. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and with some great mods for it on NEXUS you can really expand the game and increase it's longevity and user experience. 

The graphics are really nice even for a relatively old game. The game play is intuitive, and after a short while becomes easy to master. The explosions and sound effects are incredible! they have weight and impact to them and some of the Mech deaths are ""holy s**t!"" moments. 

There is a decent range of weaponry options available, and you can customise any Mech to suit your play style and preferred load out.

The ONLY grip I have is missile barrages. Man they can go on and on, with most Mechs housing Long range missile racks that do not need line of sight means you get hit every turn with huge volleys of missiles and the sound is.... well it gets on my nerves after a while hahaha.
And missiles do very little damage, they are pretty much specifically for stability damage, that is knocking your Mech over. So it's a whole lotta noise and annoyance for little effect. 

That being said, I highly recommend this game. I have never played it multi-player but would love to give that a go.
Just go buy it! you won't be sorry.

Previous Mech games let you deploy up to 12 mechs, which helped the player build a strategy for the mission at hand. This game will only let you deploy 4 mechs, limiting your options, and the terrible part is that the enemy keeps spawning mechs as if it was a joke, while telling you that you have to deal with it and take them all out with your almost completely destroyed 4 mechs at hand, which is unreasonable, and pretty lame. These developers certainly didn't even search for similar games like XCOM 2 and learn anything from them.

Game is repetitive. Same strategy:
Walk until you detect someone, back everyone further back, let the mech come to the visible range and (try to almost) one shot them until the other mechs come out of their ambushing locations. Rinse and repeat. [Every single mission] [No imagination what so ever]

Game was released recently, and the franchise has been out there for ages. Why can't they come up with ideas were you build your own mech like in Front Mission? (The old games). Or put any weapon in any slot inside the mech like in Mech Commander Gold? [Yes, you cannot modify your own mech's weapon slots, if its designated as a long range mech, it dies a long range mech, no true customization].

The worst part of them all, is not letting you buy weapons whatsoever. [You have to fly to other planets to get a few low key weapons which are by far worse than the ones you earn through the missions, which at the same time are not likable at all. ""add +2 damage to the weapon and accuracy +3"", pretty boring actually]. In Mech Commander Gold you could buy any weapon at any time, any mech anywhen, being the money given per mission the one that limited your options for the next level. Nothing of it is here, that is gone, which is very disappointing for me. 


And to put the cherry at the top. The story: The most lame story I could have ever seen in my life. It's laughable because in one point of the game they paint you this idea of a big bad enemy that has an enormous fleet and they are billions and have gigantic mechs, everyone seems to have Atlas (the most badass mech in the game as far as I know), and they are ready to kick your butt. 3 to 5 whole animated scenes where this bad villain challenges you to the ends of the earth. Next cutscene, he dies without fighting you, The End. (me) Roll eyes.

Conclusion:
Bad Uninteresting story.
Gameplay has been downgraded to a boring category. Very repetitive and very limited.

Great strategic gameplay that will eat up a huge quantity of your life, but also a game that could've done with a lot of extra love and attention. For every good the game brings, there's an equally bad side. Voice-acting for instance is pretty solid, single player story less so. 2D art is stellar, wel drawn and brought to life with all kinds of neat tricks, but the 3D-models on the battlefield...let's just say that the mechs look like toys in a sandbox.

Terrain isn't very special either, but the main problem here isn't how it looks, but that lasers and rockets occasionaly are able to pass through mountains (which sucks when you're trying to find cover), but the camera isn't, so it regularly gets stuck (leaving you to guess if you properly hit your target or not). Same goes for your spaceship which is beutiful to look at and upgradable (which is cool), but those upgrades aren't always visible and some parts of the ship are mentioned, but you can't access them (med-bay for instance), which is dumb 'cause I own the bloody ship, right? And then there's the long, long, looooong loadingtimes, during which you'll have enough time to build your own IRL mech from scratch. But like I said in the beginning. Gameplay is addictive, deep and loads of fun and that's wat counts in the end, so thumbs up.

I enjoy the gameplay enough that I can look past the weird woke activism of the game devs. Don't play the base game though, use roguetech or battletech3065, because the story is still terrible.

I want to say, I'm leaving a negative review solely because of the SJW activism of the developer, and not for lack of quality of the game. The game is a great battletech game.

However, the cast of the actual-story-mode of the game more resembles the Village People than it resembles anything like a mercenary company. The engineer is a woman in a burka, the game has more transgender characters than male/female ones, and all the badguys are white and all the goodguys are black/muslim/indian.

I made a forum post about this and was banned for it. So clearly they want their SJW ideals to go completely unchallenged and cannot accept criticism of any kind.

It's a clear case of them trying to push a political agenda, rather than trying to make a good story. If you feel that my review is undeserved, feel free to leave your comments below.

AI cheats on initiative as battles progress moving slower mechs up in initiative resulting in double attacks from heavy and assault mechs.

Major issue with the insane movement of fragged mechs.  Had a mech with only 1 busted up leg, a swiss cheese torso, and a head charge across the battle field and melee my mechs.  That mech should be relegated to fighting from the ground.  How did it even get up!?  In the table top version standing when missing a leg was not automatic.  That's only one story, but it's completely consistent, one legged mechs have no loss of mobility.

None of the expansions allow for dropping more than 4 mechs/1 lance.  It's apparently possible to use a mod to be able to drop multiple lances on non campaign missions, but that really needs to be a core, first party feature.

Can be a bit glitchy and is slow to transition/load.

I'll begin by saying that as a kid I played Battletech (the actual board game).  The first Battletech based computer game I played was Mech Commander 2 when it came out in the late 1990's - great game.  i was searching for a way to get Mech Commander 2 to work on modern operating systems when I came across this game.  Naturally I was super excited and figured that it would be amazing with modern computing power and ample time to improve on older games like Mech Commander.  So to get to it I dislike the following:

1.)  User interface is really bad.  There's a terrible lag with moving the mouse around.  It just makes for unpleasant game play.

2.)  The load times for everything are absurdly long, and I don't understand why.  I had one mission where I waited three and a half minutes for an ally convoy to move four vehicles down a road.  

3.)  I hate the map view and that they do not have a mini-map.  I get lost and don't even know what's going on half the time.  I've already had numerous missions where I am trying to protect a building and didn't know that new enemies appeared on a different part of the map.  I like the mini-map in the old Mech Commander because you can see once something enters your sensor field and send some mechs to intercept.  I also don't like that I cannot zoom in or out (or at least I haven't figured out how to) on the map.  I feel like I'm missing the bigger picture of what's going on.  
 
4.)  The fact that you can only field a maximum of four mechs is profoundly retarded.  The game is designed to just get the biggest mechs you can, and then equip those mechs with the best and most expensive equipment that you can get your hands on.  This completely eliminates the value of smaller mechs and a lot of the strategy to the game.  Small mechs are not ""bad"", they just need to be used for appropriate tasks.  I always loved having a few small mechs on hand to either clean up taking out enemy vehicles, or to harass larger mechs from behind while my heavy hitters slug it out with them face to face.  They really screwed up by having the four mech limitation...which brings me to my next issue.

5.)  The drop ship determines that you can only drop four mechs and you apparently are not allowed to get more drop ships.  This is just plain dumb.  First of all they could have eliminated much of the problems by having the drop ship have a tonnage cap, like it can only carry 400 tonnes or something like that.  This would allow the player to decide how they want to structure their approach and style.  Some might go with all huge mechs, others might have a variety of sizes, and yet others might go the swarm approach of having nothing but small mechs.  This allows the player to develop their style.  Second, they should have allowed you to buy more drop ships.  The campaign is heavily focused on financial efficiency, so they could still keep that as a factor in this case.  Having more drop ships equals additional expenses.  Furthermore, having multiple drop ships could allow you to work multiple contracts in the same location simultaneously.  So basically you can do multiple things in the same calendar day.  They can mitigate the problem of people just sending a massive amount of mechs to crush the enemies in every mission by charging for each drop and deployment of each mech.  This would encourage the player to choose the correct amount of tonnage for each mission to maximize financial efficiency.  

6.)  I was disappointed to see aspects of the ""woke"" political agenda in this game.  

Those are the main grievances that I can think of at the moment.  This game would be amazing if they could fix the UI and load times, add a mini-map like they had in all the older versions, correct the mech deployment limitation issue, and keep current political agendas out of games.  It's really not that complicated.  Maybe one day they can figure it out.",1625012995,1625012995,False,6,0,0.515462219715118408,0,True,False,False

I had never heard of battletech until this showed up in my suggested games by steam. I have always been a tabletop game fan, primary W40K or pokemon. So to find out theres an entire new tabletop game that I have never heard of, and they ALSO have a TBG like this, really drove the interest for me.

Some people complained about the story, I personally find the lore fascinating and a good spin on most sci-fi games.

Original Review:
Only played 3 hours, but I returned it on 6/11/2018 as it still needs lots of work. Camera was clunky and annoying to deal with, controls were not very intuitive, and graphic demands are FAR too high for what is essentially a visually exciting tabletop game. I have a pretty good gaming laptop that can run Skyrim on highest settings without effort, but THIS game on lowest settings is barely playable.

Mech customisation is deep and interesting - any combination of weapons and gear can be attached to any mech (up to the mech's weight limit). This allows you to turn light, speedy sniper units into frontline flamethrower infantry, gigantic close-range bruisers into long-range artillery pieces, or any combination you can imagine, although cosmetic customisation is limited to just colours and a few different decal patterns per mech, which is a shame, but doesn't detract from the experience really.

Missions have an okay level of variety, a little bit more would have been nice (Maybe more are added in DLC, I don't know).

Core tactical gameplay is absolutely solid; interface has some great quality-of-life features such as previewing sightlines and chance-to-hit before you commit to moving your units, and for anyone at least a little bit familiar with other tactical RPGs, it should be immediately intuitive, and definitely won't be impenetrable to complete newbies to the genre. 

Unloading a full volley of all your weapons at once and seeing the target mech be torn limb from limb is viscerally satisfying, and the systems feel very well balanced. There's no 'difficulty slider' and instead you can just choose from missions of varying threat level based on your own gear and confidence, with higher threat level missions having higher rewards, which is a good way, IMO, to let the player moderate their own difficulty curve.

Macro gameplay, i.e. base building, is fairly simple, but works totally fine. A little less depth and decision making than XCOM, with no tech trees or picking where to place facilities, but the system of unlocking new mechs by collecting three pieces of salvage from destroyed enemies is a really compelling way to earn new mechs, and gets you legitimately excited for each new machine, and to work your way up from light, to medium, heavy, and assault class mechs.

Overall, highly recommend for fans of other tactical RPGs, and/or big stompy robots that fire massive guns at each other.",1624229280,1624656409,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I played BT on tabletop for many years  and was even on the world champion lance at hatchetman one year over 20 years ago, our only loss in the finals was my hatchet was shot out of my hand early on, damn that was fun. This game brings that all back. One issue is there needs to be a training scenario. I had to go look up how to do a number of things and still am missing a good bit. I just installed this a few days ago but I am enjoying it. It can be tough when your commander gets hurt and is out of action for 3 months, the money drys up but fortunately I collected enough salvage to keep going so far by selling a couple rebuilt light mechs.. I was up to 8 mechs , now with 6. I like being able to alter your mechs to your own taste.. I recommend this game a lot and would sing its praises if it had s training scenario or an instruction set up.

Coming  back to add to my original post. The game is fun,  You are always outgunned and outnumbered after the 1st part of the overall quest. I have now finished it all the way thru 25+ times. I have tried it using different strats, different mechs- I always end up at the end using Star League Atlas II's, SL Highlanders and SL Battlemaster's for my main strike force. I always end up with 2 Atlas II's, the highlander and a Battlemaster usually with ECM unit. The 1st 3 use Gauss instead of AC/20.

Now I always end up with 70-100 mechs in storage, 18 in the bays. They never let you run more than a lance. and often you face a company or more of mechs and/or vechicles. There are worlds shown we can never travel to. Once you make ally with the factions you want you literally have little else to do. I and others are hoping they will expand the game one of these days to allow us to run up to a company. It would even begreat if they allowed us create and run a battalion or even a regiment, get newer and bigger dropships, even a jumpship. Now actually running more than a company would be so time consuming the game would be useless, but once you learn the game, running a company would be child's play.  They could add a meta-game in which we could drop our batt/regiment and let us run our command company and the mta-game would let us order our troops around. Maybe even let us run other companies within our own forces. I would love to have a regiment drop on a planet as part of an invasion going after Liao or the DC or Marik. Then run individual companies at different objectives. A regiment would mean 6+ objectives . We could add vech - I would love a couple srm/lrm carriers lol

The characters could stand to be fleshed out more. In all my games, I always end up with 2-4 pilots with all 10's, then watch their xp totals head for 100,000+ with nothing to do with them. Maybe some additional skills that could help like learning certain tacttics, strategies, and other command skills. 

The biggest addition needs to be the ability to travel across the Inner Sphere and Periphery. More quest lines, more mech types, maybe even facing the clans one day- I would fight the clans with my end groups anytime. I have SL tech mechs of every class- light/medium/heavy/assault. Maybe we could do things for Comstar- though I dislike them lol (sorry hardcore Federated Commonwealth man here for many many many years lol.

The game is great, and I will continue to play it but unless they start expanding it, they will start losing players of at last hardcore players. Don't let this game withe, come on people, give us more.",1594228499,1624283408,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are likely to enjoy this game if you answer yes to these questions :

Do you like turn based tactics games?
Do you like mechs / giant robots?
Do you like customizing your robots, mixing and matching components, and getting new robots?
Do you like Battle Tech ( the Franchise )? 
If yes to the above, do you mind an adaptation to table top that is not 100% lore accurate but logical for its platform?

Another thing I don't get is you have more than one mech but when you take a shot with one the turn ends for all of them and passes to the enemy.  I don't know if it's because of 'initiative' or what but it seems lame to me if it isn't.   I also didn't notice any 'overwatch' reaction shot capability.  Like I said, it's a clunky game.   Don't pay more than 10 bucks for it.   I'll recommend it with some reservations.  It's sort of like an overly ambitious indie game that falls short.

-customizable weaponry on mechs
-able to capture enemy mechs and refit them
-interesting cover and evasion system
-wide variety of weapons
-multiple pilots (though none of them have meanifulness other then what skills you gave them)
-variety of different class of mechs making it fun to move up and get stronger mechs

Negatives:
-if you move once you cannot move again in a turn unlike other strategy games
-throughout the whole game you only can bring 4 mechs, in the later game you can face 8-12 mechs of the same class or better than yours, sometimes at the same time. Not eventually being able to deploy more mechs as you further upgrade your ship is hugely disspointing, making cool lower class mechs completely useless later no matter how fun they are (like the firestarter or even the hatchetman which you have to buy the dlc for!)
-missions straight up can be unfair, base defense missions will have enemy ai ignore you mechs and destroy all the buildings because you have 4 and the enemy again can have 6-12. Escort missions one the escort is complete enemy mechs will get an extra movement turn to get behind your mechs which is where your most vulnerable armor is. Assassination missions about half the time has the target stay one sprint away from their retreat point and even if you knock them down, meaning they should not be able to sprint anymore, they get an extra boost to escape. 

Additional Thoughts: 
-a lot of the issues they make reoccuring play throughs of the game less enjoyabel since it will lose the wow factor of the first play through of discoverying new things could be easily fixed by just increasing how many mechs you could use during missions. to be able to have 15 mechs on stand by but only use 4 per mission is stupid while the enemy can send 6-12 mechs of the same class or higher. It is still a fun game though that I have poured a lot of hours into so still worth a buy. I'd definitely would play a second game of this if it were made.

Interesting story that I thought was just the right length. Fantastic soundtrack. I think there's some room for improvement here and there (unskippable travel animations, occaisional messages or death sounds from enemies, escort mission bugs and slowness), but overall, a memorable and positive experience.

Load times - I think multiple saves are associated with absurdly long load times. Play on ironman to keep them shorter. Even if you're like me, and don't normally do ironman, I think it makes this game feel better. 

Compared to xcom - Units are beefier, so engagements are less reliant on luck. I find this to be good, since there's much less frustration than xcom's instances of bad luck. The character roles aren't quite as well developed, but enough so that they're still significant. Plot and writing in Battletech is more compelling, as is the soundtrack. 

DLC
- Heavy Metal - the new mechs operate differently and I'm very pleased with it. The new weapons are really fun too.
- Urban Warfare - I don't really like the new cloaking technology, so I ignore that. But the urban biome is fantastic. Would recommend. 
- Flashpoint - I'd prefer if these missions were available during the campaign, so you could experience everything there if you only really want to play through the game loop once, but in the sandbox mode, these break up the gameplay loop in a refreshing way, the missions are compelling, and they're very well written.

I think this is a pretty good game. 

X-Com style turn based gameplay. X-Com but mechs. 

The campaign story isn't anything revolutionary, but for what it is and is going for, in my opinion it is well written and is enough to keep you interested. 

X-Com style turn based combat, not as intricate or complex as X-Com, it is notably simplified but still provides opportunity and a need for strategic gameplay. More so with varied difficulty options.

Good variety of equipment, mechs and weapons.

Good modding community. The game has plenty of mods on Nexus that can provide smaller adjustments or additions, to larger overhauls that give quite allot of new content to change things up.

DLCs are a good thing to have. They add to the game fairly well. Especially the Flashpoint DLC. Though I do believe that the 20$ dlcs are totally overpriced, If you're on a tight budget, i'd recommend waiting for sale unless you really want them.

Side missions/contracts have good variety. Both in environmental and in the design of the levels/maps. 

Fairly decent voice acting. 

Note - I personally haven't had any real technical issues with the game, even while running mods, and when that happens I can only attribute any crashes or bugs to mods. So take this with a grain of salt, my easy time with the game isn't a guarantee. 
-Now for some negatives.-
First point, and this one isn't inherently bad, it depends on the person. 

X-Com style combat. There is plenty of rng, there are a good amount of ways to play smart and gain advantages to negate this, but be wary of it nonetheless, depending on who you are.
That said, this game's combat isn't the most intricate or thought intensive thing in the world. If you're looking for a simulator, then this isn't it. At the same time, it is far from mindless combat. 

I'll edit this review as I come up with noteworthy mentions. I have noted some smaller bugs here and there in vanilla, but the game overall seems pretty stable even when mods are in play. Naturally it isn't perfect. Take this with a grain of salt, watch some gameplay elsewhere to help determine. But I can't think of much that's truly bad off the top of my head at the time of making this review. But it may just be me not remembering certain things or overlooking them.

I played over 250 hours before mods were added in, by the by.

Graphics are solid. Performance is reasonably good, though having a good, high clocked CPU with something to the tune of a GTX 1060 is recommended.

It is as I understand it originally based on a board game. Various games have been made on the theme before, a sci/fi universe RPG setting of sorts with lore exists. The RPG elements in this particular game are very few however, apart from the story-based campain. For this to get immersive, you'll also have to swallow the somewhat ridiculous idea of giant robots walking on legs piloted by humans sitting in a cockpit :) (""Why do they have legs!?"" ""Why don't they control them remotely?"" Excellent questions... since we can build remote-controlled robots with the technology available in 2021 just fine... so why couldn't they in 2721. Hrm, moving on!)

The story is that you are running a battlemech mercenary company travelling the universe taking on contracts from different factions. You start with humble means and work yourself upwards. The main campain has a nice story where your company finds itself on the payroll of one side in a civil war. You can however play the game in a free mode as well, without any campain missions. And when you finish the campain you can keep on doing missions, although at that point you'll have quite over-powerful mechs given from the campain. Either way, there's lots of ""end game"" content and you can just keep playing.

The game mechanics are somewhat similar to XCOM 2: you take on a mission, you field a party (""a lance"") of 4 pilots, whom may end up injured or even killed. And your mechs will get shot up and need repairs. But the combat mechanics are completely different: there's no hiding a giant mech behind cover, that is unless you happen to find a mountain or a big building. You are going to get hit. Instead the strategy is rather to always position yourself so that you take as little damage as possible while dealing as much as possible. Walk into a forest to have trees soak some of the damage. Move as fast as you can to become harder to hit. Position the mech so that damaged parts are facing away from the enemy. Use high ground for better chance of hitting. And so on. The terrain and biome matters a lot here. 

The maps are procedurally generated, so you never quite know what you are up against before you deploy. You generally just pick pilots that complement each other, or field the best ones you have for the hardest missions. Then you pick mechs depending on biome. It isn't a good idea to field mechs that generate a lot of heat if you are deploying in a desert or martian environment, but it might be a good idea in cold environments, since mechs generating lots of heat generally also are the bigger damage dealers. Early on you'll simply deploy what mechs you have that aren't damaged, later on you can try to look for combinations that make sense: spotter, tank, ranged etc.

Mechs come in different sizes: light, medium, heavy and assault. Within these 4 classes, they also come with individual sizes. ""Tonnage"" matters a lot, the weight of the individual mech and the weight of your whole party. Light mechs are obviously the fastest and can jump great distances, but they have thin armor and can't equip a lot of weapons. The larger the mech, the more armor and weapons you can put on. In theory light mechs can ""speed tank"" by moving fast and avoid getting to close, but in practice it's a big risk sitting in one and they often get shot up first. So basically, the heavier the mech, the better it gets.

There are numerous mech models, each with a typical default layout. Some are good at cannons, some at melee, some at long range missiles and so on. You can however re-fit them and customize the loadout quite a bit, and generally each model comes in two different flavours with different slot layouts. You can get quite creative here - or just use the default fittings. (Or do a more 'hardcore' game setting like I always do, where each mech you get comes without any equipment, so you have to fit whatever you happen to have laying around.)

For each mission you take, you get paid both in cash and salvage, and you can negotiate how much of each you get. Salvage being parts grabbed from the destroyed mechs after the battle. This is generally how you get new mechs, so there's a bit of 'Pokemon' gotta catch them all to it. You deploy and encounter some rare enemy mech that you want to claim for yourself. In which case you might be tempted to either blow the head off or blow off both legs, either is very hard to do, but leaves more salvage. To do this however, you might compromise the mission or end up taking much more damage than you should, spending lots of time trying to headshot an enemy mech (which is a rare thing even with high skills).

Otherwise, you can at least count on 1 piece out of the 3 necessary to scrap together a mech from the salvage. Or you could buy mech parts or whole mechs with cash, but it is very expensive. Money is also needed to pay out wages & maintenance, early on you will struggle just to not get broke and lose the game. Your expenses grow as your company grows, but generally you have to worry less about money in the later stages.

Regarding the DLC: I have the 3 DLC packs and overall they are nice but overpriced. They don't add -that- much new content to the game, mainly they add new mech models. For the price they are charging I'd expect some larger ""expansion"", rather than just some new mechs, missions and biomes.",1622480065,1622480065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Following is a more in depth review besides ""Top kek, buy it!""

Overview:
Battletech is a turn-based strategy mech game that has solid game play reminiscent of XCOM in its organization. It contains a reasonably good core story. It also has some light rpg elements in conversation and overall skew. Finally, customization is present in medium depth.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Graphics are fairly pleasant, no issues running the game. (my device is an aging entry level gaming rig)
[*]Story is interesting. It's been a while since I finished the game and I remember what it was about.
[*]Game play itself is addicting. Build and customize mechs, go on contracts to smash stuff, build and customize more.
[*]Fairly polished. I encountered no major bugs and felt that many interfaces and features were implemented correctly.
[*]Combat is fun. Building a mech to your satisfaction and watching it one shot an enemy when everything goes right is ""10/10 would build an OP melee mech again"".
[*]Customization is well implemented. It is not so complicated as to turn away players who aren't mech fanbois, but it still has depth. 
[*]Combat chance-to-hit typically feels fair. (Full disclosure. I am a huge baby about firing 10 shots at 80% and only having 5 hit.)
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Customization is not so absurdly over-complicated I feel some of the more hardcore Mech-heads would be let down. If you are worried, do a little research.
[*] The story is not as omnipresent as I like. In my perfect game: story and characters develop constantly, even in side questing phases. There is a core story here, and some side stories. It's solid, but not perfect.
[*] While mission types are technically varied, combat is somewhat repetitive. For what it's worth, I almost listed this as a ""Pro"". As XCOM fans can attest, repetitive fun can still be fun.
[*] My first unqualified con: collecting the best mechs and equipment can be a real crap-chute. Some weapons and mechs are essentially pulled from a pool of potential loot, meaning that there are some specialty mech varieties you just won't get in some play-throughs. For such a long game with a largely linear set up, I found this immensely disappointing. (Some high end things you can totally get easily though).
[*] The set-up and execution of the stores you travel around to buy parts from is...not ideal. Traveling across the galaxy to not get what you want can be upsetting.
[/list]

Final thoughts: This game is well-polished not perfectly polished. There is a learning curve, but it isn't ridiculous. If you start playing one morning, you'll know what you're about that night. Overall, even the less excellent aspects of the game are sufficient, and the places where it excels such as combat and customization it truly excels.

I enjoy this game because you can customize your battlemechs a lot, making them fit into roles that they may not have been designed for. The only customization you may want to do that isn't allowed is changing the engine, but that's not a big deal (I don't think).

RNG is used to determine if your weapons hit their target (like the tabletop game does), and sometimes you will miss. If you don't take into account what to do if you miss, then you'll probably have a tough time beating some missions.

If you don't know what a battlemech is, it's basically a walking tank with (usually) lots of different weapons mounted on them.

So its always a race to find the heaviest mechs you can get you hands on. this can be a good and a bad thing i guess. The battles are pretty fun too as they are pretty unique strategy wise even if your fighting in the same map that you have done many times before.
Turn based system drives me crazy. Lets the AI cheat imo. its not based on turn but mech weight class. So the turn system is annoying. google it, too much detail as to why to put in here.

Elements of the combat are rich and deserving of praise, however it's quickly lost to bugs and quirks in each mission. Often forcing you to save-scum missions simply to get any clue of what's happening. Any mission more complex than 'Kill Kill Kill' often contains confounding trigger sequences, miss one and the LEAST you'll lose is a mission bonus. 

4-Mech limitation, essentially all the features of light mechs are gone after the 5th mission. Light, fast, hit and run doesn't work if you can only bring four mechs. The player simply gets swarmed by Heavy mechs. It would be nice to see a tonnage limit, instead of a pilot limit. 

Frequently values on-screen do not reflect the values in the engine. Some missions with turn limits will suddenly skip 2 turns randomly. Tooltips that are meant to warn of overheating occasionally do not show (that being said, they are challenging to see against the typically orange/brown backdrops of many maps). Repairs for mechs state ""1-day to repair"" but end up in the queue with a 3-day timer (perhaps this has to do with mechanics? but then why does it say 1-day in the first place?).

Edit: Story missions feel like the only way to make money early on. After a few story missions however, the random missions appear to have higher difficulty, driving the player to do increasingly more story missions. Unfortunately the difficulty rating is entirely misleading, story missions often pin the player against 8+ mechs with fortifications. These same missions have 2 or 3 'skulls' of difficulty, while random missions have 3-4 skulls and simpler fights. 

It's all fixable, but it will take playtesting and time.

Edit: Did not get fixed. Combat is unrewarding and buggy. 
""What's going to happen next?"" You literally can NEVER know. Not just because of RNG, but fluid rules... Enemies who move, attack, then move, attack again immediately after. Move actions that behave like Sprint and immediately end your characters turn, a recurring mystery.

Edit. Random Rolls the Game. Strategy can't fix when RNGsus is the only god.",1524968120,1622225739,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're running a mercenary business and can't grow beyond a lance on the field at a time?  You can only use a single Leopard and not upgrade to a drop ship with more capacity?

No ability to call air strikes, or other aerospace support makes it complete 1 dimensional.

Can't add ground vehicles or any other support vehicles, which would make things more interesting too (dropship capacity is always based on tonnage, I'm sure you can squeeze a 40 ton tank in there somewhere...)

In terms of gameplay, it's amazing. A nearly perfect rendition of the Tabletop game translated to PC, without losing any of the charm or quality. If you love Battletech, if you love tactics, this is an amazing game. Heck, even casual fans of giant robots fighting, sci-fi, you'll definitely find a welcoming community that is willing to help you with the steep learning curve.

But this game is a mess. It causes severe overwork to the CPU for NO reason. The graphics aren't that impressive. During cutscenes you may get better FPS from a flip-book. And the crashes. The crashes are non-stop. Before opening the game? Check. Reboot is the only fix, sometimes. Crashing during cutscenes? Check, especially during story missions that take longer. Random crashes if left idle on a menu screen? Check. Crashing at any point during any mission, or for any reason? Check.

This game is the worst one I have ever played, from a technical standpoint. Blame unity all you want but even lousy asset flips don't crash every 30 minutes. This one does. And I have so many hours in because I love it all the same.

 I am going to finish this game, and keep following it. If one day they fix up the memory leaks and crashes, I will revise this review to say it's the greatest overall strategy game I've ever played.",1526260933,1621561140,True,0,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False

While it's not extremely complex, it's also not overly simplified - gameplay mechanics like recoil modifiers from firing ballistic weapons, stability damage from projectiles, pilot injuries and heat management make it more than a mindless clicking spree, but it is something that you can absolutely learn how to operate through gameplay without needing to research essay-length guides for individual mechanics. 

Probably the most difficult aspect of the game is also, IMO, the most fun - building loadouts for your mechs and tinkering with them between missions. There's a lot to consider like hardpoint type, number, and locations on individual mech chassis, how much armor, firepower, or heat control you want to add or sacrifice in order to boost another area - it takes a while to really find your optimized setups but it allows you to get creative. It also helps that you can choose the difficulty of your missions so if you want to just test something in a battle with less risk, you can always just choose an easier mission.

Story wise, the game is enjoyable. Without spoilers I can say it's a bit cliche at times, but the voice acting is pretty solid, the semi-static artwork is actually pretty nice to look at and make some good desktops in a pinch. It's nothing groundbreaking but at the same time it's not badly executed. I'd say it's more than adequate.

If you're looking for an intuitive game that you can learn quickly, it's not this one. 

I've played every Mech Warrior Game ever made and both Mech Commander games, I had some success when I started running and then firing over and over, that game mechanic seems really kindof stupid tho and isn't how actual battles work at all.

You don't gain 'agility' from running and then stopping, this game also seems to completely lack any modding, I'm guessing because they probably have some sortof corrupt after-market store.

I don't often write bade reviews for games, with this title though, if Steam had a return policy I'd return it immediately.  I don't understand their development choices, you run and then stop and that somehow makes enemies sometimes miss you?

And the enemies seem to have psychic powers, despite not being able to see you, they can sometimes hit you blind firing over a mountain?

It's like they took Mech Warrior and Mech Commander 2, tried to improve upon it and instead made almost everything worse.  

The one bright spot is being able to target fire and damage specific parts on enemy units, then again, with Mech Commander and Mech Warrior you were able to destroy certain body parts and you or your enemy didn't simply explode.  You might be able to hop around on 1 leg, use your jump jets to get from place to place with one leg, or perhaps you have no arms, but you still have torso, shoulder, and back mounted weapons.

Set in the eponymous BattleTech universe, it largely focuses on missions where a lance (team of 4) consisting of MechWarriors and their respective BattleMechs are sent on missions. More specifically, it focuses on the endeavors of a mercenary company lead by the player.

It's XCOM, but with mechs.
Seriously, you have the squad of soldiers, except they're piloting 'Mechs. You have the steady upgrade progression and associated looting mechanics. You have the budget balancing. You have the individual character progression. You have the grid-based movement system. You have the wildly inconsistent hit chances that piss players off to no end to the point of achieving meme status.
All that's missing are the aliens, because there are no aliens in BattleTech.
Or, well, technically there are, but we don't talk about Far Country.

At the end of the day, despite all its flaws, I like BattleTech a lot.
I love the setting, and I'm a sucker for mechs designed to look like they might be feasible to actually build and operate. It sometimes runs poorly and stutters in performance aren't all that uncommon. Loading screens can be annoyingly long at times, but none of these issues sufficiently impact my enjoyment of the game enough that I won't recommend it.
Am I a hero? Did I sacrifice too much at the altar of victory? Moral compass optional.

After finishing the main campaign, i think i can rate the game.
This game has some good gameplay, solid visuals and a nice albeit very short campaign story.

But the bad point are what annoys me to no end even though it is only my opinion.
Keep in mind that i installed this game on a very fast SSD and have not found any visible bugs.
As for the bad points :
 1. The loading. It's unearthly. Load campaign after launching the game? 10-20 seconds. Starting a fight? 10-20 seconds of loading and THEN you see the mission loading screen. Then wait again the same time. Once the fight is over? Loading again for the Victory screen THEN loading again to go back to ship. I even had loading when trying to see the available missions. In the bay with the mechs it's the same : loading when going to refitting screen, loading when canceling the changes. This game wastes a lot of time loading stuff.
 2. Some battle mechanics are weird. For example : there is a stability mechanic. So far, when i knockout a mech using said mechanic, they get up and immediately move/attack, no penalty for being knocked down. Doesn't keep the mech out of combat in the current turn, nor the next one. The only penalty being the pilot getting injured but usually i kill them so fast the injuries don't matter. Same with drop ins : in many missions mechs were dropped in mid-fight. But they all immediately get to move/attack without me being able to do anything. A penalty for that should have been added especially when all my mechs are targeting the drop-in spot.
 3. Fights are too long. Once i got used to the novelty of mechs stumbling about doing stuff, i wanted to remove the unnecessary zoom-ins or camera movement/locks that began to annoy me. There are options for that in the menu but i still had some annoying camera movement. For example when a knocked out mech gets back up the camera always zooms-in, no matter what, even though i was looking at the mech from afar with the camera centered on it. All the options made the fights much shorter but there were still many mech movements that were executed at normal speed dragging out the fights unreasonably.
 4. In the victory screen, if you have 5 priority slots (5 object you can specifically claim while others are randomly chosen), if you are not interested in the presented objects, you can't simply let the game randomly assign the loot, you HAVE to manually select 5 objects, the click on confirm, then click on Next. Very tedious when the number of priority slots is high (6+).
 5. In the refitting screen, there are some convenient buttons such as strip equipment and strip armor but when you want to unequip only once piece of gear, you have to drag it outside any gear slot instead of simply right-clicking. A minor design flaw but very annoying to me,

All of this made the very short campaign (around 10 main fights) dragged out to ~50 hours of play time.

Once again, this game is not bad by any means. It has some annoying stuff in it in my opinion, but if you don't mind it, it is a great game. This is why, even though i'm in the middle, i would still recommend the game.",1620270316,1620270316,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game is worth full price because you get access to the core mechanics as well as the incredibly deep mods available on Nexus (Roguetech or BTA). I thoroughly enjoyed the DLC too and did get my money's worth out of them all, but I do recommend rather getting those on sale.

Gameplay: Its mostly classic Turn-Based move-and-shoot with unlockable abilities and traits for your pilots. There is an Initiative system allowing lighter, faster and less armored mechs to move first in almost all cases, with a few exceptions thanks to abilities (reducing targeted enemy initiative and increasing your own). There is also Evasion, which is applied for 1 turn. The more you move, the more Evasion tokens are added to your unit. Each time you get shot at, you lose 1 Evasion, so the more you can stack the better, especially if you are expecting plenty of return fire for the upcoming turn. Weapons and Equipment all have stats such as component weight, heat generation and slots needed to equip them. The mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master/exploit. 

Some people complain that light mechs are useless after early game. My 35 Ton Firestarter begs to differ. With a good pilot and loadout it has as much damage as most of my Heavies which are 65 Ton plus. I have 6 MG++ on mine. The MG is a close range weapon dealing 5x5 damage. It is arguably the weakest weapon in game as not all 5 hits will land on the same part of your target in most cases. However, the MG++'s on my Firestarter have +5 Shots and -0.5 Tons (they only weigh 0.5 by default so they are weightless haha). So I have 6 MGs which are now weighing nothing and do 5x10. Boom, damage dealer AND survivable thanks to Evasion stacks of 5+.

The other complaint people have is that the endgame gets too easy when you have awesome +++ equipment on badass 90 Ton+ Assault Mechs. This is remedied by challenging yourself with a more varied Mech lineup, including Light Scouts etc, or simply installing RogueTech from NexusMods.

Conclusion: This is a fairly old game at this point but RogueTech gets regular updates so its still worth buying. Vanilla with DLC also holds plenty of hours of fun.",1620244649,1620244649,True,20,0,0.699401199817657471,0,True,False,False

Constant missions where 'easy' missions seem to have the enemy rolling out more and more high tier units vs whatever you scrape together.",1620017244,1620017244,False,2,1,0,0,True,False,False

I have own this game for years but never got past the starter mission. Took me 4 tries due to loosing. It is fun when you do not miss just about every shot. Keep in mind you will lose arms and legs. Weapons and parts. So good luck on your RNG. At the start I did review this game as recommended but now after 20ish hours it just makes me really mad. I have lost mechs in the 3rd round of a battle. I have lost pilots after a random head shot. I have changed my setup, my mechs loadouts. Short of restarting the game and starting the campaign I fail to understand why I suck so much as this game. I even turned the settings down to easy in hopes I can learn without being killed every other mission.
Never learned so I guess I suck that bad at this game so I am going to say Not Recommended.

If you have any familiarity with the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe, you'll understand how deep the lore of this setting is and how incredible the detail can be. This game stays true to the license. If you DONT know the Battletech universe, the best comparison i can make is to Warhammer - theres tons of tabletop games, books, videogames, etc. for the setting. Worth checking out. 

The game itself? If you like XCOM youll probably enjoy this game too. Has similar mechanics with turn based tactics, RPG elements, and unit management between your missions.

The MECHS - finding them ,customizing them, fighting them, the discovery of weapons, the tragedy of losing your favorite lostech equipment, theres nothing like it. 

The main campaign is great, and career mode will give you countless hours of replayability exploring the stars and finding mechs and equipment you didnt try out the last time.

Then the modding community - omg. It can get as crazy more in depth as you want. The Battletech Extended mod and Roguetech advance the timeline to include soooo much more mechs and technology - and expand the map a solid 10x the level to include the entire universe.

Even on lowest settings, nice to watch. Merc management is done well. Story missions are full of variety, and there's tons of places to visit and do dirty work in. The game is also difficult, so put on your big boy pants cuz there's only one difficulty setting, and it's papa spank.

Cons: Incomprehensibly bad performance and absolutely ridiculous hardware demands. There is no reason why the game should be so cumbersome to run. Optimization is as much present as an everlasting peace in the Inner Sphere. The story, while an average BT yarn, is poorly told, full of unsurprising events and clumsy attempts at provoking Feels. Huge drop in quality after successes in storytelling with the Shadowrun series. However, storyline is not mandatory after certain point.

Buy it? Absolutely recommended for any BT fan who is ready to put up with the performance and do some tinkering with it. For the rest, wait till HBS or modders optimize the game to run smoothly, if it is even possible with it's attrocious choices in code and 3d engine. Hopefully the game is succesfull enough to warrant DLCs that expand the map area and bring us new and better told BT stories to explore, and maybe in the long run, the Clan Invasion.

Edit: Three years later, and nothing was done about the memory issues or poor performance. Three DLCs, which add barely anything. There's a vast ocean of lore and story in BT franchise, of which none was utilized. At least there's Roguetech which is a major overhaul, but it also exacerbates performance issues to the point of the game becoming barely playable.",1525043409,1619760871,False,0,0,0.507042229175567627,0,True,False,False

It's a turn based squad strategy game with a fun campaign, loads of customization and freeplay options AND a huge modding community. Much like their shadowrun games, also squad based strategy games.  (If you haven't played those, I highly recommend them as well)

If you're at all a fan of the Battletech/Mech Warrior universe/games then get this. Even if you're not, get it anyway! Who doesn't love 100 ton mechs punching each other in the face and shooting lasers or 200 caliber guns. Even without any knowledge of any setting or lore, the game's campaign does a good job of introducing you to the universe, it's people and political system. While not overly story heavy like a singleplayer RPG, the story does what it's supposed to do to get you on your way or immerse you in the setting and then it let's you go your own way with story missions cropping up from time to time to drive it onwards, and they'll wait until you want to take them so no need to rush the story if you don't want to.

The game looks really good and Harebrained Schemes has done a good job of bringing the mechs and planets to life. However like with most good looking unity games, the loading times can be a bit of a pain, although it's much much better than it was in the beginning.

Harebrained Schemes is a good studio that always listens to their community and puts in the effort that is so sorely lacking from the current market. I'm looking forward to their next game release!",1619554502,1619554502,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most bugs responsible for early bad reviews appear fixed, although I still have a bug that stops the game from shutting down completely upon exiting.  There's also the need to get a Paradox account if you want to use multiplayer features which stinks.  That said, the game itself is fairly immersive with a fairly slow burn.  There is repetition and the same maps/terrain in the stock game reappear pretty regularly.  You might be in a different system and run into the same map you fought on just a couple systems back.  That said, the combat is good, lots of choices and freedom to choose even if the mech selection is limited and parsed out into overpriced DLC.  The management and progression of the ship, mech pilots and crew is turning out to be a welcome bonus that I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I have.  I'm giving this game a thumbs up based on the game alone and not the Paradox account, the minor bugs, or the fact the DLC may not be as good as Roguetech mods.

Between the turn-based mech fights you have a story mode on your ship in which you can interact with your crew and where you must manage the company you run making sure you have enough to pay your pilots and maintain your mechs.

Traveling the galaxy, building mechs, managing your crew, taking contracts and going out on missions to do combat in your giant robots is actually pretty awesome.

Original Review: Select a space nation based on your desired level of ethnic and cultural diversity, then select your preferred pronoun. Make sure to choose something non-offensive.

The game asks you to make some choices about your background but each choice you make gives you a positive benefit which is very ablist, with no options for disabilities or sexual orientation.

It's absolutely nail biting to get fired upon. Every damaged limb needs repairing/replacement so you can feel the damage done to your mechs in your pocket. 

It is a fun ride. The difference between different factions don't really show themselves ingame. No faction really has different strategy or unit composition which is a lost opportunity. You also don't really get an inside in how their respective societies operate.

Turn based squad-focused RPG, with a monumentally in depth system for your ""Lance"" - The Mechwarriors themselves having stats and active & passive abilities, the varieties in tonnage of the mechs, the weapon systems each Mech can utilize (and the sizes/calibers of those weapons)... 

I have only done a few (maybe 5 or 6) story missions, and am still in love with the game. The story seems pretty good so far, and I initially bought it based on reviews that said it was worthwhile. Somewhat related, the factions are all decently varied, if based a little too hard on stereotypes than I'd have liked. Completing missions for one faction may make them like you more, but if that mission has you working against the interest of another faction, your reputation with them falls at the same time. This delicate balance of choosing who to piss off and who to keep happy also keeps you moving/keeps missions somewhat varied, as different factions utilize different mechs (generally speaking). 

There are events that randomly pop up from time to time, giving you decisions to make when not in combat. There are usually 2 or 3 options for you to choose from, with varying results based on what you choose, plus an additional 1 or 2 relevant options based on ""tags"" for the characters on your ship. 

And of course, the combat encounters themselves are actually quite fun. Whereas most missions/quests in similar games are just two forces slamming into each other, there is a surprising amount of depth in Battletech contracts, from the aforementioned Battles, to Rescuing VIPs, Ambushing Convoys, Defending a Base, Assassinations, and more. And each of THOSE can also have sudden twists and turns, such as enemy reinforcements (You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you?) to a 3rd-party showing up and complicating the entire scenario. The Heat system prevents you from spamming the biggest, baddest weapons each turn, and instead making important decisions on when, and more importantly, WHAT guns to fire. The armor/structure system (and the related arms/legs/torso/head system) feels very intuitive and just works beautifully. Using a massive autocannon to shoot an enemy Mech in the arm and completely blowing it off its chassis is just as exciting as it was the first time I did it. Melee attacks (and ""Death From Above"" attacks for mechs with Jump Jets) are also exciting, in addition to being positively brutal at times. 


[b] Quick Review: [/b]
[u] Pros: [/u]
+ Missions/Combat are incredibly diverse and reward decision making
+ Story is good so far, and I've been told it continues to be so. (I have not finished the campaign at time of writing)
+ Has that ""it"" factor that just makes it fun, but is hard to define. I legitimately have a smile on my face the whole time while playing, which is rare compared to other games I have many hours in!

[u] Neither  [/u]
+- The ""minigame"" of money management could be annoying for some, and no doubt has stressed me when I was early into the campaign. But as long as you chase contracts and don't go overboard hiring warriors/buying items/refitting mechs, you'll be fine.

[u] Cons:  [/u]
- Audio clips played over stationary pictures for combat dialogue and cinematics is a bit of a turn off compared to what we are used to from video games these days, but I actually didn't mind it that much.
- Traveling between systems using unskippable cutscenes that only take a few seconds, but really add up when traveling far across the galaxy, and can be somewhat annoying.",1618948850,1618948850,True,6,0,0.612333416938781738,0,True,False,False

This game has serious flaws but overall BattleTech's simplicity is its best quality, and for a game sale @ $9.99 it's a steal.  Some MAJOR omissions this game has is squad buffs, Area of Effect damage, and terrain destruction.  I also think the physics and animation of Mech damage,staggering, or falling could significantly be improved.  Games like Divinity Original Sin and XCOM are light years ahead of Battletech, but also require a longer learning curve.  

Managing Mech load-outs and hard-points is probably one of the best features.  This coupled with upgrading your base of operations and roaming the galaxy for best gear is actually quite fun.  There is also a large sense of nostalgia for me playing this game.  I can actually recall a lot of the Mech's from 90's Mech games like the ""Catapult"" Mech.

The drawback is that when you try to turtle for heat or to allow another unit to reinforce you're still going to take some taps unless you just run out of range.

I was a little iffy on the cut scene art style choice at first, but it quickly grew on me and it lends itself well to telling the story while keeping the system impact relatively low.  There seem to be enough random events to keep the game fresh for several times through the campaign.

I would say a solid 8/10...9/10 if you didn't play the TT game because you won't notice the hit percentage thing.  For any who know, this is like playing mega-mech without the advanced era rules and with prettier graphics.

Now let me start with this, Battletech for the most part doesn't play like the old table top Battletech. Now that's not a bad thing, but if you are looking to use Battletech as a game to learn how to play on the table top? Well... This is not the game for that. If you want something like the new XCom titles only you are not fighting invading aliens, you are taking jobs and blowing up everything in a big stompy Robot? This is the game for you!

Okay so lets get some basic stuff out of the way. First things first if you are a canon person who lives for Battletech's lore and the like? This game is going to have you yelling things. Battletech takes place in the Periphery in 3025 where after doing a few missions to help you learn the gameplay, you now find yourself running a mercenary outfit. You reconnect with old friends and find yourself fighting a war to take back a Kingdom from a bunch of Saturday Morning Cartoon show Villains. And why are you doing this? Honor? Loyalty? That sweet, sweet, sweet pile of C-Bills? That's for you to decide.

Gameplay wise you take a mission be it a story mission or just some general mission that is along the lines of kill all enemy mech's or keep this one asshole who decided to drive a lightly armed car into a warzone alive. You decide on 'payment' when taking the mission, this can be a mix of C-Bills, Mech Salvage or hey do the mission for free and make that faction you are doing it for happy with you! Drop down to the planet and try not to get yourselves killed and the Mech's turned into burning piles of garbage. And that last part? That's where the XCom like gameplay comes in, it's easy to screw yourself over or get overwhelmed. Save scumming is once again there for you to use. And you may as you only get a lance of four Mech's.

Mech wise? There's a good amount. You have everything from Jenner's, Locust's, the beloved UrbanMech, Centurion's, Blackjack's, Catapult's, Highlander's and Atlas's. Note that the Warhammer and Marauder you also get now via updates, and there's a number of other Mech's via the DLC's, with one brand new Mech to Battletech the Bull Shark put into the DLC's. And yes my friend who's super into Battletech canon those are all found in the periphery. Okay quick Battletech lore for those wondering what I'm talking about. The periphery is sorta the space wild west if you will, so finding super high tech Mech's and weapons in canon shouldn't be happening. However in the game you'll be able to find yourself super lost tech Mech's and weapons. Hell nearing the end of the main story I got myself a Royal SLDF Warhammer and Marauder.

So that's the game in a nutshell, take missions, blow crap up, save scum as you just took a mission and you *really* want that Battlemaster to salvage thus you will try and not blow it to bits. Go back to the ship and screw around in the Mech Lab trying to see how many Laser's you can fit onto a Hunchback. Hire new MechWarriors. Pay the Pirates off so you can keep going to the black market. Hey it's fun!

The Mech's look good, all of them using the updated designs that PGI made for MWO. The story stuff tends to have some very good artwork giving it a very nice look. And soundtrack wise? I'll admit now and then I'll put the soundtrack on when I'm playing WoW or ESO.

Again if you are looking for a game that's going to be like Battletech table top this is not it. But if you are just looking for a fun big stompy robot game that plays like XCom I'd check it out. Again however if you are super into Battletech lore? Yeah this game is going to upset ya.",1618439855,1618439855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example you might have several missions you could play, or travel to another system and try harder missions, or do a story mission, you can spend money on upgrading the ship, or buying and experimenting with mech loadouts.  However at the start especially, a lot of these choices are traps that will screw you over.  Spend too much on upgrades, the upkeep costs wreck you.  Try too hard of missions, and you lose out on repair etc.

All that said, if you do spend some time getting past frustrations and learn the systems, this game has A LOT of fun to offer.  For example, if you don't get much upgrades for your ship at the start, and take every easy mission possible, and once your system dries up, move to the next nearest lowest difficulty system and repeat a bit.  You can farm up a lot of cash, then actually search shops for some good BIG mechs.  Once you have a heavy mech or two in your team, you can really farm up some 1-2 skull missions, and then the game really opens up.  You start having the ability to buy what you need, not run outta cash, level up your pilots, and start getting all those upgrades.

Learning how the melee attack positioning works, how facing works, how called shots can help you finish wounded components for quick kills etc.  It's all important, and fun.

On a serious note, it's pretty good turn based game. It is a bit simple in places. It's difficult not to compare it to XCOM. It's a lot simpler than XCOM in terms of there's no cover etc but it still has enough, more in terms of how you design and setup your mechs rather than the actual tactical depth used in the turn based fighting part of the game.

There's also the atmosphere and storyline of the game that more than makes up for other areas. This game does atmosphere very well. I must praise the ship cinematics, character interactions and the ship interiors. The sound design also needs praise for rounding off the feeling of the game.

The game does seem a bit thin on the content is could have had. For example, a lot of the starmap is left unexplored or unvisited by end of the story campaign but you can continue afterwards of your own accord afaik. However, what the story is, is long. I haven't reached the end of the campaign (although I am close) and i've played 83 hours. Although probably some of that is trying to fit too many lasers onto my mech without it melting.

For those who've played an X-COM game or Xenonauts, Battletech has a very similar feel to it.  That said, RNG has a lower propensity to screw you over here, as your mechs have (usually) multiple weapons systems, so if one misses a guaranteed shot, the others usually make up for it.  Gameplay is far richer: refitting mechs lets you optimize for your preferred playstyle, collecting mechs is exciting, and the combat is tactically incredible.  If new to the Battletech franchise but familiar with XCOM-style games, buy the base game and play the campaign.  You're sure to enjoy that.  If you get the itch to play through again, pick up the season pass and play a career game; the flashpoints might as well be an entirely new campaign.  If you're still wanting more, I'd recommend the BEX mod.

Combat is intuitive and fun.  They nailed the feel of the Battletech setting.  Even light mechs feel big and stompy, and the bigger mechs feel even bigger and stompier.  The hits feels powerful and blasting a Locust's stupid face off with an AC-20 is exactly as satisfying as you'd expect.  The random cinematic shots get annoying at times, but if you want they can be disabled in the menus or skipped by pressing space.

This is not a faithful 1-to-1 clone of the tabletop rules.  IMO that's a good thing, every change they made works while still keeping the ""feel"" of tabletop battles.

Haven't finished the campaign yet.  The story so far is decent, not bad but nothing special.  I like the base management mechanic, it gives the story a nice fight-rest-recover pacing without making you feel like you're being rushed or wasting time.  The missions feel a bit on the easy side, but I'm still in the early parts of the campaign.  Hopefully things will ramp up.

+ hard to master (long term fun to try)
+ good sound effects (except for balancing)
+ like the art style cutscenes (superb voice actors)

- hard to learn (horrible beginning until you get everything right)
- conversation happening between wax figures (facial expressions recommended)
- needs mods to unleash the full Battletech potential (e.g. Mech customisation)
- in-battle game engine performance (horrible FPS drops)
- sometimes too much ""RnG"" like gameplay (e.g. enemy mechs, therefore loot)
- bit repetative (at least without mods)

i was originally excited because it was a game based off the mech warrior franchise. but this game has some major flaws to it that drive me crazy. 

- this is more of a personal opinion of mine but i don't like how forced all of the diversity stuff in this game is. it feels like they had to make every character anything but white. it feels off to me. like its on purpose. the story and premise reflect this because its a petty and weak story. there is not a single decision you make that has any significance in this story. you are pretty much forced to help this military disney princes take back her throne from her evil uncle because she's the protagonist in the story, not you. now there is nothing wrong with being a side-character in certain games; but again, this feels forced and i don't get to make any choices in game that circumvent that.
- it feels like they put all their money into intro cinematic because the rest of the games quality is lacking. some major characters are fully voiced while other important characters are not. the dialogue you do with your crewmates is super cursed as they all look like maya autodesk tutorial models and they have almost no actual animation or voice to them. the combat cinematics are just plain broken, where the camera will just clip into buildings or terrain so you wont be able to see anything. its best that you just turn it off completely
- i don't have any complaints about the AI or combat. it seems like the only thing that works is the gameplay. but that brings another problem. its tedious. its repetitive. it gets boring after like 2 hours of fighting the same mechs and waiting 10 minutes for your mechs to repair and your people to heal, only to deal with disappointing story missions.
-i have seen alot of people in the batteltech community say its not worth playing if you don't have all the DLC. well i dont have any of the DLC....so this is just a review of the base game. also, from what i have been told, the DLC doesn't actually have any major content. it just adds little niches to the game that are also half-baked.

i can't bring myself to play this game anymore. it just annoys me too much. if you want to find a better mech TTS then go play Into the Breach. or just play xcom if you want a better made TTS in general",1617478785,1617478785,False,4,1,0.487722605466842651,0,True,False,False

For me it's as addictive and replayable as any of those Blizzard games. The problem is the star map. As with most games that encompass the entire universe, most missions on most planets are exactly the same. You end up ""escorting the prototype"" or ""killng the pirate leader"" dozens of times on the same maps. The DLC flashpoints help, but it would have been better if that were the mission structure to begin with.

There's so much potential in the gameplay and management parts of Battletech that I not only overlook its short comings but I feel like it's made me into an advocate for it. (I mean I never ever write video game reviews.)
I would love to see an entry in the Mechwarrior franchise that forgoes a tedious map of the universe and is instead built around branching mission flashpoints, perhaps on a single planet. Why not take a page from rogue-likes such as ""Slay the Spire"" or ""Hades""?

What would really make my dreams come true though would be procedurally generated maps and events a la Diablo. By the end of the campaign, you're basically just cruising the galaxy for rare parts, so some of those loot mechanics might fit in there as well, but I don't want to be greedy. 

Long story short; Battletech is great. You should play it so that hopefully one day they make another one that builds on everything that works so well in this one.

Career mode is where you start a mercenary company and you have to keep it afloat, by doing anything from docking pay to selling whole 'Mechs. you start with a torn-apart spaceship and a few light-to-medium 'Mechs, and a million C-Bills (the in-game currency). You travel system to system, taking jobs and blowing things up, repairing your ship and upgrading your 'Mechs in the process. Your crew will die sooner or later, but you can hire more in the systems. There is also a reputation system, where each faction will offer more pay or higher difficulty jobs      to you. It can also go the other way. I usually make the mistake of not helping the pirate faction, and later not being able to get into the black market. 

Stopping my rambling, this game is fun, if you like a heaping helping of strategy. It's kinda like chess, but with robots on the Unity engine. There are two flaws in this game. 

One, the explosions are kinda lame. It's not really as satisfying as a massive fireball, but there still are explosions. I guess that's better than nothing.

Alright, now to the actual review. This game is a lot of fun, as stated previously. This game is a game about giant stompy death machines punching, shooting, or stomping their enemies to death and being punched, shot, or stomped to death in turn. This game's campaign is centered around a periphery power bordering on the Taurian Concordat known as the Aurigan Reach, and the political turmoil it undergoes when its high lord decides to up and die in the early 31st century. As far as campaigns go, this one is fairly weak writing wise, but the 'mechs make up for it.
The 'mechs, oh the 'mechs. The 'mechs, or BattleMechs, if you want to be specific, are the central stars of this game, ranging from 20 to 100 tons of fusion-powered, gun-toting fury, the 'mechs are an absolutely wonderful part of this game. They are incredibly modular (except for the engine, chassis construction, or armor type, sadly) and allow for a large amount of varied loadouts. Sadly, the enemies do not make use of any custom builds, either premade or procedurally generated in most cases, which I find to be a weakness of this game. Mods likely fix this problem (and others), and overall it is a fun game with lots of replayability.
TL;DR: Overall a good game set in an interesting universe with a lot of ability to play differently. 7/10.",1616788106,1616788106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

HBS has done an amazing job of translating the experience of the original Battletech board game to the digital landscape.  It's *almost* a 1:1 translation of the core Battletech rules, to the point where I was able to implement many of my original strategies and builds, used over long hours of staring down at paper battlemats and rolling dice, to this version of the game.

This is also where the game slips a bit.  Many of the negative reviews I have read point to the ""lack of depth"" of the management systems the games contains like negotiating for pay, training mechwarriors and balancing your mercenary company finances.  The thing is, all of these systems are bolt-ons.  They were never part of the original board game, and maybe only existed in some fashion in the Mechwarrior pen and paper roleplaying game or in previous incarnation of the Mechwarrior series.  They were never intended to be the core focus of this game, nor should they be.  Complaining that you can't micro-manage your merc company's toilet paper budget is completely missing the entire point of this game.

And that point is tactical combat.  With the rebalance of the knockdown mechanics (which were too easily exploitable in the late game) BATTLETECH has cemented itself as the superior mech-combat strategy game.  It's made with fans of the original board game in mind.  So if you loved the original 80's box set with its cardboard standups and lightweight dice, or any of the following incarnations with the fancy pewter minis and glossy spec sheets...this is your game.  It promises to be Battletech on your computer screen, and it fully delivers on that promise.  Fans of more modern computer strategy games may still find it lacking, but this game was never meant for the Sim-InsertIndustrailMechanicHere crowd.  It was meant for those who love to imagine the hot exhaust of the reactor filling their cockpit as they hit the override switch to lay down the killing volley of laser fire on their foes.  It's meant for those who remember the thrill of executing a Death From Above to take out their opponent, even if it cost you both your legs.  It's meant, in other words, for fans of Battletech, both old and new, and I hope they keep on adding content to this amazing game.",1616425166,1616637734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Years ago, my friend used to get his ancient Amiga PC out of storage and set it up so we could hot seat the original Battletech.  It was a lot of fun.  But the bottom line is that I don't enjoy this version of Battletech [i]out of the box[/i].  It wouldn't even run past the second map on my old PC, so I tabled it for a long while.   (Got into it again after getting a new PC).  

IMO, it IS however, a lot of fun once modified.

Just to set expectations - The game is grossly unfair.  Not 'whining', it's a factual observation.  You will almost always be outnumbered 2 or more to 1.  There will almost always be one or more lances between you and your evac.  Enemy lances often spawn on either side of you exposing your flank if you turn to face one.  The AI will almost always fire first even if you see them and could fire.  The AI will occasionally drop a full lance on your rear arc without warning and fire the same turn before you can react (yeah, You can kiss that Jeager good-bye!).  The AI will occasionally drop mechs that fire upon and destroy protection mission assets before you can do anything.  [strike]I have seen enemy mechs with 60% damage reduction in forests where I only get 20%![/strike] (That one's a ligit Guts ability, I don't normally take).  Don't even get me started on the suicidal escort mission asset AIs.  And the list goes on...  

It seems the one thing the AI excelarates at is seriously D!<k moves.
   
This is unfair because [i]there is nothing you can do about it[/i].  It's like playing an old school pen and paper RPG with an insecure Game Master.

Starter mechs have poor heat management and for the most part general purpose designs that make it painful to do enough damage for a kill.  It is also really challenging to try to maintain a full lance and make money the first 30 weeks or so of the campaign with them all under repair for 20 days at a time and your pilots in the med bay (Although some people enjoy that kind of challenge).  This jades new players because it is easy to get discouraged before you hit that mid-game sweet spot and start owning the battlefield and raking cash.

This is offset somewhat by the fact that the AI mechs are also mostly general-purpose, have poor heat management and will do things like mindlessly charge your 250+ ton lance solo with a 20 ton locust.   [b]BANZAIIIIIIII!!!!! [/b]  (Keep in mind that even 8 poorly designed mechs plus turrets can still take down your weakest mech by spiking it for a few turns - Which they WILL do!)  They will also occasionally spawn with reduced armor in missions that appear to be designed to give you chassis parts.

There is a lot of nuance to the game that isn't explained or immediately obvious.  I was 100 hours into the game before I realized you had to push the jump icon before the 'death from above' icon would appear for example.  I went bankrupt in one of my early games by accident - I just wasn't aware of the way the accounting worked and could have easily avoided it.   I tried ejecting a scout pilot once.  I had to look up how to do it on the web and then was surprised by the immediate mission failure.  I had 3 perfectly good mechs on the map and would have won the mission.  

If you do get this game, plan for a steep learning curve.  It's not just run at the enemy and push all the buttons.

Somehow Pirates got all the best stuff,  Blackmarket is your friend?  Support theft and crime through purchase of stolen goods?

At one point I turned to some online guides which were helpful, but seem to be mid to late game strategies using advanced tech and mechs you can't possibly buy or build in the early game.  

The role play aspect is really light compared to the original game where you could at least run around town and talk to NPCs. 

So, out of the box for $39 I can't say I recommend it.  On sale for $10 - yeah, I'd go for that.

 While I am sure there are those that do love the game as-is (some people juggle geese), If you are willing to bend the rules a bit using some of the excellent mods out there to tailor Battletech more to your personal tastes, it can be quite an enjoyable game.

the bad:
1: the scale of the battles is far to small, being limited to 4 mechs is desperatly diapointing, especially for a turn based game.
2: the AI, seriously how did the entirty of game development get worse at designing AI? the AI enemies appear to be suicidal and very one deminsional... 
3: the balance, theres no drop limit and only 4 mech limit, so theres no point to anything but the biggest tanks you can get and put the best version of equipment on them... which as a mechwarrior, mechcommander fan I find this completly baffeling and disapointing. theres almost no strategy to this tacticle game...
4: once you get past about 5 missions theres not much of a challenge left., over the entire campaign i only had to retry twice, and one of those was due to the npc getting to destroy an objective before i even got a turn(normal Difficulty).
5: suprisingly little variety in mechs considering theres hundreds in the battletech universe. also, can't deploy vehicles...
6: theres not much sense of scale, no establishing shots to show off the massive size of things...
7: the automatic cinematrography camera, developers note this RULE: never, ever lock camera controls away from player, if i want to pan or rotate the veiw after you qued a camera movment, dump your que and give the camera back to player.

the good: it's giant robots fighting!

1: graphics are good.
2: the sound is good.
3: the voice acting is actually good.
4: the interface is good.
5: the auto cenimatography camera can be quite neat when it's not messed up by trying to show you something through a rock. you can adjust the freaquency of auto camera routines in the options menu... you will want to reduce the freaquency.
6: three primary layers to the overall strategy: the drop ship(think economics), the pilots(skill points), the mechs(equipment). and then the tacticts in the battlefeild.
7:campaign story is pretty good a bit short, but good. i would be compelled to watch a movie of this type and style.

There is definitely a learning curve when you start to get missions where you need to deploy larger units with heavier weapons. The smaller mechs become useless unless you have the Flashpoints expansion that has missions that require or allow for you to feasibly use them (not to say that a more skilled player could get by).

There is a fairly steep learning curve, but once you figure out your way around the UI (which is pretty easy), with a little experimentation you can learn a lot. Overall excellent game.

pros:
- Fantastic UI. My only complaint of it is that I would've liked a tutorial option that goes through all its elements, but they're not hard to figure out with just a little experimenting. Otherwise it conveys so much information so compactly - truly a model for others to follow.
- Lots of things to fiddle with that can really change how you play, from which mechs you keep ready for combat to their weapons and armor down to each component part (arms, legs, etc), as well as the stats on your MechWarriors. You can spend a huge amount of time deciding what equipment your mechs will have.
- Combat is very interesting and, combined with mech customization, quite deep. You need to manage line of sight, cover, and positioning so you hit people from the right direction and take hits where you have armor.
- The UI really facilitates that deep combat - while planning a move, you can even see which targets your mech can hit from any potential new position, what your hit chances are with each weapon, which side you would be hitting the other mech from, and the likelihood of a hit hitting each part of the enemy mech. Of course you can also wing it if you want, but you can be as meticulous as you like in planning.
- While your character only shows up as a portrait (graphically speaking), there is a good deal of aesthetic customization should you choose to do it.
- Mech customization is decent - you can choose your company's color scheme (primary, secondary, and accent colors) and symbol (many options), and for each mech you can choose one of several patterns.
- You can choose your MechWarrior's pronouns from ""she,"" ""he,"" and ""they."" The game does not refer to them as ""preferred pronouns"" as some have claimed, it just says ""pronoun:"" and you can pick an option.

cons:
- The initial tutorial is pretty bare, though you can later click through some optional dialogue to get more information. Since I didn't really ""get"" what different mech builds are for in my first mission (which happens before the extra detail is available), I actually lost one of my characters and so basically needed to restart.
- Overall a steep learning curve that the game doesn't help you with too much right at the start, but once you've figured out the basics the UI lets you learn the rest.
- (ETA after finishing the game) The campaign is frustrating. You are almost always fighting more mechs than you have, which necessitates very defensive fighting (especially since there's permadeath). Also, you rarely know all your objectives going in. There's almost always some kind of twist, and if you aren't aware of what that is (eg playing for the first time and not reading a guide), you may well poorly position your mechs, making them vulnerable or making it difficult to achieve the objective
- The world seems fairly interesting, but the specific story of the game is bland. I wouldn't play this for the story, which mostly takes the form of cinematics (the kind which feel more like a slightly animated painting with voiceover) and dialogue trees, but it's easy to skip or skim through everything.
- When choosing the (purely aesthetic) color pattern for a mech, the lighting is terrible and it's very hard to see what the differences are.",1524932187,1615172022,True,2,0,0.550172984600067139,0,True,False,False

Once again their math skills seem to be faulty. 80 or 90% hit rate and 37 attacks from full lance did 0 damage to enemy unit. Meanwhile, enemies get head shots on my mechs twice in a row, hit me with attacks from outside of sensor range, and use direct fire weapons to hit me when there is no line-of-site. Unless you touch trigger points, some enemies are invulnerable. So, if you don't take the exact path they want and walk into the trap, you can't hurt them.
 Cinematics are beautiful, but gameplay sucks. If you want to watch a semi-interactive movie where the protagonist usually loses, then this game may be for you. If you want to use actual tactics, then definitely look elsewhere.",1615162565,1615162565,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Yet you also see the potential that could have been so much more. But first, we have to draw a limit on what to review... so when I refer to BT, I will refer to Battletech the game itself. When I refer to the game with mods, I still specify ""with mods"", and when I refer to the boardgame, I will tell you it's BTBG. 

Battletech is a game of turn-based tactical combat based mostly on BTBG rules. The backstory is not that important, as it gets into murky politics, but safe to say, you were the survivors of am ambush and coup d'etat to overthrow the government by a neighbor and a betrayer, and a rich backer decided to backdoor fund the merc outfit you joined as a way to proxy war. 

But most people will play the campaign once, and forget it. They want to play the game on their own terms, which means starting the mercenary mode... i.e. take the Argo dropship and go out on your own... and win on your own terms. Which basically means: go to a system, decide which missions you want to take (which can affect your reputation among various factions), and negotiate pay and salvage. Once you accept, and picked your lance of mechs to drop up to the weight limit, it is time to go stomping. 

The tactical combat is turn-based, full 3D, and full terrain. It is based on BTBG, but is its own. Movement generates ""evasion"" which adds targeting penalties to anyone shooting at it. But one cna also perform called shots which targets specific parts of the mech. As mechwarriors (the mech pilots) gain experience they also gain bonuses in movements and shooting, and weapons proficiency. The longer they survive and kill others the better they become at their jobs. 

And not all are about shooting big lasers and cannons. There is melee as well, and the infamous ""death from above"" where you jumpjet above the enemy and land on it for massive damage to its head (and your legs). 

Between deployments, your wounded will convalesce. Your mechs will be repaired and refitted. Your loot will be processed, and new mechs assembled and refurbed, and any changes you wanted (like you want to replace the MLAS version of your mech with a more AC heavy version for hot planet ops) is being carried out. And the time in transit between systems is perfect for that. 

The idea is the earn money to grow your mercenary company into an group pf elite mechwarriors with the best equipment money can buy (or hire) capable of defeating most enemies, without making too many enemies. 

But what raised for bar for this game is how mod-friendly the game was, and how the community have responded, with huge expansion packs like BTAdvanced, BTXpanded, and even total conversions like MechEngineer and RogueTech. And the developers also pumped out no less than 3 expansion packs themselves, including the first brand new mech for BT (and BTBG) in years.

Not to like: Even single player plays over the internet, and they must have slow servers, I have extremely fast internet, SSD drive, 16GB and this game loads slow. I don't have any other games that load this slow.
The game play is clunky, as stated above movement is grid based (with extreme detail terrain), this is contradictory since some times you can hide behind a rock but only if there is a properly located grid location.
Each movement is slow to execute.
The micro money management between missions can override the joy of what is supposed to be a battle simulation game. I do some project management as part of my job, and this game is worse than reality.

Short they spent too much time on graphics, not enough on game play ability, the game is too much about micro economics not enough about battle strategy.

The biggest flaw to this turn-based tactics game is that, there is nothing tactical to go about it.

I tried with much patience to grow my mechs but at the end of the day there is never a ""balanced"" match. Every mission is either a steamroll for the enemy or me.

I tried to play ""tactically"", by using guerrilla warfare of running and gunning to lure enemy mechs in 1 by 1, but even with this it'll result in my mechs taking too much damage because of the sheer amount of enemies the game throws at me.

The only strategy I can see here is, just bring the biggest guns, the biggest mech. Light and medium mechs becomes obsolete, there is no point running them in your lance at all.

I will tell you straight up, this is not a game you steamroll easily and quickly. The difficulty can be punishingly hard at first, and you need a lot of patience to fight optimally. If you're looking for a fairly deep strategic game then this can scratch that itch.

Gameplay:
The gameplay has two main features. There's the combat missions where you order your mechs around to achieve your objectives, and there's the galaxy map where you roam around looking for work, parts and pilots. Both require you to learn a fair bit of nuance to get good at. You can play through the campaign multiple times and use different specialties for your pilots to try out different strategies, which adds a lot of variety and replayability. The DLC's add a lot more variety to the missions you can wind up on, which helps a lot.

Battles aren't extremely high on variety. Your mechs generally have to defend something, destroy something or both. The level of opposition can make the same mission quite different, as well as what you brought to the party. There's a lot of different weapons and strategies based on the weapons you have chosen to bring, and the biome you battle in will have a significant effect on which to employ. You'll have to make decisions from the mission select screen to know which to bring. It's fun and engaging gameplay, of a kind I personally very much enjoy.

The galaxy map allows you to move between stars in search of contracts or stores. Movement takes weeks of game time - this is good though because your mechs and pilots need to be repaired or rebuilt after missions. The time between locations is the best way to pass this time, and knowing which planets to head to can keep your units downtime to a minimum. If you lose mechs and pilots then you'll be looking at expensive repair bills. Managing your merc company and keeping your head above water can be tricky until you learn how to best approach it.

Complaints: You can find yourself utterly curb-stomped by the RNG on some missions. The difficulty rating for missions is a little vague and you could find yourself seriously outgunned. Also, it's not impossible for a lucky roll by the enemy to leave you down a mech with one shot. It's great when it happens for you, but against you is a different story. This will turn off players who get frustrated by difficult gameplay, who don't have the patience to learn the system.

Graphics: The graphics are good, fairly simple as a top-down game like this would be expected to have. You can move the camera around for better looks, and nothing really looks bad. The interfaces are pretty clean and nice to watch. It is a little weird how they went to the trouble of fully rendering 3d characters just to have them stand around during dialogue options, and not actually bother to record a voice track.

Sound: Sound is good. I doubt it'll be winning any awards but the music settles you in, the explosions are nice and meaty. As mentioned previously it is weird how they didn't get VA for all the dialogue in the campaign, especially when most of the characters are voiced at some point. Perhaps it was too weird that your own character does not speak.

System: The game can be a bit of a systems hog. There's likely a memory leak and the more save files you have the worse the chug can get. Not a problem on good rated systems but you will sometimes have to delete a bunch of saves if you want to keep playing.

Story: There's a free campaign mode which is good fun but the main campaign is a story driven affair. I quite liked the story, I am a little tired of games having universe ending consequences. This is a small feifdom on the fringes of galactic politics. The main events of the Battletech Universe aren't really mentioned or impacted. It's not entirely unpredictable as plots go but that's about right for BT. If you've read any of the novels, this kind of storyline fits in fairly neatly.

Who should play this?
Anyone who likes turn based strategy games with long playtimes. A session can be multiple hours but won't often be less than one. If you're a fan of the BT universe, this is a pretty great addition. If you're looking for the kind of game you can play a campaign mode with a difficulty curve that can go up to Demonic, you could lose a lot of hours in this.

Who should avoid this?
If you don't like waiting around for the gameplay to happen, or like short play sessions, this may not be your jam. Missions can be slow and grindy at times, and the gameplay isn't fluid by the very nature of the turn based system. If you like easy gameplay you can pick up and burn through for the story, this will probably frustrate you.",1614521111,1614521111,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You control a lance of 4 mechs on every mission, however enemy often outnumbers you (as it is in these type of games). As a result you'd often need to refit your mechs to have more armour and specialise accordingly.

Also, game suffers from some sort of memory leak which slows down everything including the UI after a few missions. Had to restart the game from time to time.

As for the DLCs, not necessarily required as they mostly just add new maps and mechs. Major additions are the flashpoints, which are basically multiple-mission contracts with rare rewards. It's a nice addition if you're into contracts with story behind them, especially the mini campaign introduced in Heavy Metal. Definitely interesting if you're into Battletech lore as they pull in some major characters and events.

You’re a mercenary. You take missions for hire. You have a huge intergalactic map at your disposal, and a base of operations that needs maintaining. 

However, once you hit deploy and send your units to the battlefield, things change.

Mechs are huge, hulking machines. And it shows in Battletech. Not only in its presentation. Though there certainly are a lot of elements here showcasing just how much tonnage is stomping around -- both on a visual level, and kinesthetically. But gameplay tells a lot as well, based on how you actually interact with the game; how the rules are implemented and conveyed. 

And boy do I know a lot of things having played Battletech. 

For example, I know mechs have a lot of firepower. Firepower is important because it dictates how easily they can topple the enemy. You don’t do that with diplomacy or persuasion. You do it by loading up with as many lasers, ballistic cannons and missile launchers as possible. Being able to fire a multitude of weapons across multiple types of scenarios is important. It gives you flexibility.

Having learned this, I also now know that they easily overheat. Firing a lot of weapons means heat sinks kick in. But if you’re not adequately equipped with hardware, it’s going to affect their performance. A lot of factors do, actually. And if you’re not careful, you risk overheating and take damage. Or even worse, become unstable and fall over. They’re especially prone to this if they deploy in hot climates, or move over rough terrain.

Luckily, their massive bulk and armor means they can take one hell of a beating. Sure, it’s a double edged sword, seeing as they’re very hard to miss once you take aim. But that just means mobility becomes that much more important. Hiding amongst tree-tops for cover, or breaking line-of-sight behind mountains will work. But nothing is as important as staying on the move, making them harder to hit. Double that if you’re running around with one of the smaller, more nimble mech models. 

In this regard, relative size is important. Size matters. Smaller mechs move longer and at higher speeds, making them inherently harder to hit. Very much so by bigger foes. And hadn’t it been for their less-than-flexible chassis’ -- being both less armored and having less of an armament -- it would have been an easy choice for first pick. 

Besides, no amount of legwork is going to protect you from a well placed uppercut up close and personal anyway, so you need to be wary of your strengths and weaknesses.

Another big lesson I’ve learned from all of this is that with enough punishment, your units will start to fall apart. Literally, piece by piece. Lose an arm, lose the gun you’re carrying. Lose a shoulder, lose the missile launcher attached to it. Lose both legs? That’s like a game over, to be honest. Nothing exposes the modularity of these machines better than firing at them. They’ll tear apart at the seams. Some parts are more important than others. Just make sure you don’t carry volatile ammunition in the ones that matter the most.

This is why configuring your mechs is so much fun as it is. Because it’s important in running a well oiled outfit. It’s also where one of Battletechs more ingenious gameplay loops comes in. The one that favors precision tactics over all-out-attacks. Because even though these mechs drop parts and weapons like dandruff, the truly valuable pieces, the ones you can salvage and 
assemble in your engineering bay later, can only be captured if you’re surgical with your strikes -- and lucky with the hits.

I usually hate luck in games like these. I think they often have too much of a role, dictating too much of the outcome. It can be frustrating in tactical games, because you spend so much time weighing the pros and cons of every move. It’s a balancing act: mitigating the negatives and making room for the positives. 

That calculation is different in Battletech.

Here, I have a contract with the game. I know I’ll take heavy fire. I know I’ll take damage. The game is not about avoiding that. It’s about picking your battles within the battles, so to speak; take damage in instances where you can mitigate it, where it opens up for a counter attack down the line. In many ways it’s a battle of attrition. I know a barrage of long-distance missiles is going to hurt. It might even penetrate my armor; take out an arm, or worse: incapacitate my pilot. But since I know the rules and the mechs so well, It’s always part of a calculated risk.

There’s a lot more going on in this game than what I’ve just described. But none of it makes it worth playing as much as the meat and potatoes -- the battles that play out. 

The good thing is, the developers know this. Even though the surrounding vignettes and story beats are dreadfully dry, Battletech never lingers on its narrative. Nor does it get in the way. It’s a means to an end, though I commend them for squeezing in so much of it. I guess it comes with the territory when you’re dealing with a decade-long franchise.

Anyway, highly recommended if you enjoy tactical strategy games.",1614098889,1614098889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's also poorly optimized and crashes regularly. Expect a 2 hour mission to sometimes end in an immediate crash and a loss of all progress on that mission.

Update: I upgraded to a vast improvement on my old setup. I found every optimization I could and threw it at this game. I turned all the settings down to medium.

I got 60 fps for ~30 hours.

- That there are four categories of Mech: Light, Medium, Heavy and Assault.
- That each Mech has two arms, two legs, three front torso and three rear torso locations (and a head).
- That destroying the head, center torso (front or rear) or both legs is the only way to destroy a Mech.
- That there are three categories of weapon - Energy, Ballistic and Missile.
- That weapons generate heat (energy most of all, but require no ammo).
- That Jump jets are damn useful.

And the list goes on! So the learning curve for a fan of the original is much shallower than for the average player, most of whom will never see let alone play the original game. That said, I am also a fan of this genre of turn-based strategy game, having played many through their evolution, and this is definitely one of the best.

The learning curve will be a bit frustrating at first, but I would highly recommend pushing through. As with so many games that take time to get in to, the richness and depth of the experience is rewarding and worth the wait. The tutorial (which is essentially the campaign) is definitely the best way to learn how the game works. I enjoyed the story line very much, but I can see from the comments that some people found it less so. I think most of those were able to look past it and enjoy the sandbox experience outside the main story missions.

I highly recommend this game and its three expansions (on sale of course) to anyone interested in trying it out. Its a great game, and the rewards of blowing up all the enemy Mechs and slowly acquiring heavier and more powerful Mechs of your own is deeply satisfying.

One final point - its a good game for casual use (i.e. where you get interrupted every 5 minutes by your parents/child) as you can duck in and out even mid mission thanks to the fact it is turn based :)

As a game, this is a well-made game. I started playing it in 2021 and do not notice any significant bugs or crashes. So, it is a stable game. The game is not a audio-visual giant and the cut-scene is just so-so. But this is not the main selling point. If you are familiar with most of Paradox's games, their main selling point is gameplay, not graphic.

The gameplay is great. The battle is what you expect from a tactical turn-base game. It's simple at first, but when you progress through the game, the enemies become tougher and tougher that you need to think hard before each move. Because you will be numerical overwhelmed most of the time (by design), many people who down-vote this game seem to struggle with this. But if you think hard and utilize the terrain, Mech's movement and position, and some understanding about how the AI move, you can overcome this. The AI gets only numerical advantage, but no statistical advantage (unlike CIV 6); so, it is very fair. If you cannot outsmart the AI and keep whining on the internet, you cannot improve your game. As a matter of fact, it reflects on how you live your life (constant whining rather than improving yourself when encounter obstruction).

Apart from the main campaign missions, the contact missions are repetitive. But as the game progresses, the mission may be the same, but the enemy's Mechs you encounter changes. This keeps it from getting boring for a while, but after you see everything, it's done.

Make sure that a pilot's skills are well matched with the kind of weapons and role that mech can play in the team. There are so many variations to each mech chassis and so many ways to play, it's a lot to unpack.

As a comparison, combat is way slower than XCOM, partially because these mechs have a ton of armor and can really lay into each other.

I dabbled in Classic Battletech miniatures when I was younger and feel this game definitely captures some of that magic.

Good mech selection (I don't own any DLC) and the progression of the story is steady and engaging in my honest opinion.

This might sound contradictory because I think the game looks beautiful but something about the Mechs and the graphics make everything feel kinda same-y, almost like everything blends together.

1. Only mechs.  You can't bring tanks, helicopters, whatever, it's going to be only mechs.
2. Only four.  You will never field more than four mechs.  Could be four small and crappy ones, could be four of the biggest doombringer world crusher Atlas mechs, it is only four.  
3. There's only so many mission types, and eventually you'll feel some element of ""same"" to combat.

These make sense in the lore of the game to a degree, and even the gameplay dynamic (it does keep you from bulldozing through with just ""more"" of everything), but it can be frustrating, like you have to try to use lighter mechs, eventually it feels like you will need to go big or go home.

For the repetition it takes a while to build, and the various special missions, and the random enemy force composition keeps it from really being completely the same from battle to battle.

On the plus side:

The game is really easy to play okay.   It takes some effort to be ""good"" but after a few missions, there's not a lot of weird quirks (like odd controls, or things you need a manual to understand) but it still gives an experience that rewards smarter play styles once you are a bit more savvy.  The basic flow of doing a bunch of missions on a planet until you are out of functional mechs or missions, then flying to the next planet makes for a game that is also easy to sit down, leave and come back to without feeling weird which is awesome if you are semi-casual gaming.

The lore and setting is awesome.  I'm not an expert on Battletech/mechwarrior stuff, but all the trimmings, references, style and the like has great fidelity without weighing you down if you don't care either way.  The visual style is great, things feel like they have weight, the mechs look mostly as practical as a mech will ever look.  Storytelling is mostly in writing, but it's well written and the quantity of it makes up for a less animated setting.

This is really a game I'll play a lot for a few weeks, hang up, ignore for a few weeks, then have a hankering for battlemechs.

The graphics aren't especially flashy, the characters aren't really engaging, this is really a game about collecting gear.

I've been a big fan of similar turn-based strategy games and waded into the story mode thinking it would be a piece of cake. It wasn't. Every move matters and lots of things to think about...heat, armor, evasion, positioning. Every decision on which mech to field, what to put on it, and which pilot to match with it matters and haunts you when you are careless. Getting new loot and mech feels great. Watching it get shredded because you got cocky hurts...and then you get something good again and keep going. Lots of room for individual styles of play. I have my favorite mech, weapons etc. and love to see how others play through the message boards.  I've played with the DLC and like what they added to the game especially the Flashpoints which are a series of connected missions that result in loot.  Career mode is great after you finish the campaign. 

AI is pretty good. Eventually you figure out some weaknesses but 600+ hours in I'm still a little careful. My only knocks on this game is that eventually you've seen all the maps and learn where not to go but even that does not give you a huge advantage. Also, the mission difficultly isn't always accurate....sometimes made harder by bringing the wrong mechs and other times by a mission twist that doesn't seem to fit the stated difficulty level. You need to figure out quick when to run and fight another day when you are in over your head.

[*]Looks pretty, but could be nicer.
[*]Battles are fun. Destroying enemy Mechs is satisfying. Missions can become repetitive and monotonous.
[*]Management simulator lacks depth (Star Travel, New Recruits, Ship Customization)
[*]Mech Management interesting but lacks freedom (lots of Hardpoint policing, unless modded)
[*]Story is interesting enough to keep you engaged

I would have liked to see the art direction take a few more risks even if it is true to the battletech universe. The ""Chess"" game played during battle NEEDS to be explored and expanded more. As it stands, there are just not enough tools in the toolbox to make battles truly exciting. Other turn-based tactical games will often have many different ways to complete a scenario, from stealth to strength to inventory et cetera. There is just not the tactical depth needed to make this a truly amazing game. I honestly got to the point playing the campaign i just wanted to *Auto-Battle* which is not necessarily a good sign for the combat portion of the game....

 I look forward to seeing where this franchise goes - if they develop a few things like the management simulation and diversifying combat options - Battletech 2 has [i] potential [/i] to be great!",1612537411,1612537411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: Fun, good story, the gameplay captures much of the feel of the Battletech universe.

Cons:
Too easy, a single configuration of mechs and pilots will work for every mission throughout the game.
Too much grind. There are lot's of places to go to do missions, but they're all the same. Also these missions are required to unlock the required heavy mechs to progress through the game.
Bad tactical design. I don't think it's possible to know which weapons can hit your mechs or how far enemy mechs can move. This makes it very difficult to play tactically with any depth.
Technical issues. It is possible to lose a required mission (mission 6) without getting a turn to respond or defend. Travel takes too long and combat is too slow.

I'm guessing that the game was too short when they finished it (thus the grind) and / or it was rushed to market before it was done (technical issues)",1612375786,1612375786,True,1,0,0.503225803375244141,0,True,False,False

Pros: In line with the actual timeline developed by FASA decades ago. Realistic heat and damage systems. Definitely fun to play. Random event instances are quite a nice touch.

Cons: Lack of mech variants (so far). Many of the mech designs look similar. Customizable paint schemes for the mechs seem limited. There is always an accent color. You are unable to make the mech one solid color. 

So far, there is only one LosTech mission. It would be nice to have them as an option after completing certain missions post-campaign.
