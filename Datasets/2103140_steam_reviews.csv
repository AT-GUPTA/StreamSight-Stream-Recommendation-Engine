If the game was $20 I would wait and see if I run into any game breaking bugs, but at $10 it is super fun and well worth the cost even if later in the game there is a bug that prevents progression. The synergies are amazing and fun and who wouldn't find ""oh let me equip this wand with modifiers that make my dragon laser circle me while freezing stuff and have this second wand that shoots a volley of admiditly weak but super quick shots every half a step I make to where I am constantly firing a barrage of rainbox shotgun bullets any time I am moving and able to enable a circle of death around me any time I use my equiped weapon.  The progression unlocks that rouge lites have is well balanced here to where no run feels like ""oh that was a waist of time"" because you are constantly getting resources to unlock new things. 

All in all Binding of Isaac is not just my most played rouge lite but a game in which I played for years and still keep going back to, and this game in it's current state feels like it will satisfy that same itch of being quick enough to where I don't feel overwhelmed with picking it up again and enjoyable enough to have some real staying power. The thing most rogue lites fail at are clunky controls or lack of staying power, and this one does not suffer from either, it controls smooth and each run feels like a different experience due to just how much synergy there is between things (not to mention the ""oh I love bouncing shots but this shotgun modifier it great for my current other parts, let me just swap the bouncy bullets with shotgun ones since I have no slots, oh hey I got an upgrade where bouncy bullets are better, no problem I can just switch back"" there is nothing besides inventory space that prevents you from changing up your entire build at any point during a run.",1708015927,1708015927,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h2] Art Style [/h2]
Visually this game looks uninspired and incredibly boring. First thing that comes to mind when you see every character and almost every enemy is ""mobile game ad"". And i can understand when such measures are used in order to quickly get the game looking like something and then do all the mechanics and gameplay, and then overhaul the visuals. But aparently it is not the case, and i will have to stare at this incredibly childish and boring artstyle for the rest of this game's life.
Sound design is just as bad, with SFX sounding like plaseholders or, again, ""mobile game ad"". Music is unremarkable, use of ""meme"" sounds feels extrimely cringy and childish. Almost everything sounds so soft and boring it feels like this is a soft room in a mental assylum and you don't remember for how long you've been there, only that every few hours you get to ""enjoy"" a compilation of horrible mobile game ads and cashgrab children's videos. 
Overall, unimpressed, or rather disappointed that indie games seldom come out perfect, or at least good, in every aspect. 
4/10

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
Well, let's not linger and talk about wand making. It is considerably simpler than in Noita, and i guess that won't be the case down the line when devs add more spells and wands, but the scope of what you can make seems not that big compared to Noita, simply because the mad wands in it start to become a thing once you are already 2-10 hours into a run, and here it is obviously not possible due to linear progression. Still, the lack of spells is compensated via wands being unique. In Noita, every wand aside from a few special ones is random. Here they are all premade if i understand it correctly, which makes it a bit more fun, since you don't rely on the random nature of them so much.
But random this game is. What makes you come up with incredible strategies, allowed you to ""rig"" the game in Isaac, EtG, StS? Most likely, it is the fact that you have a map and you can walk all over it, and/or choose where to go. This game does not have such a map structure, and in fact compared to StS you don't even know what rooms are up ahead so you can't plan, there is no room for strategizing. This makes runs feel so, so much less in your control, because the only decision you can make is the one in the room you're in. You cannot get hit by the chest or get a curse, knowing you'll be able to recover from that with items in the previous or next room. Every time you do something in this game - you take an unjustified and blind risk. And it feels much less like you're playing a roguelike and more like you're playing dice; you can sometimes choose wich path to go, and your risk is never justified because you never actually know if you'll get rid of that curse, or reroll that spell, or buy some health.
And on top of that the game is actually not really that hard. Making an OP wand is easy if you understand how to chain spells correctly; enemies don't really have some hard mechanics and killing them comes down to not getting hit, which is considerably easier than in Isaac or EtG. Bosses aren't that mechanically hard either. And so it turns out that to win in this game you need a good seed, because it determines basically everything, whether or not you get a good wand, good spells and so on. And the seed is much more important here than in other games like it because, again, you have very little control over your progression? build and path. 
7/10

But alas, it has enough content to hold you for at least 20-40 hours i presume, and it's only gonna grow and change from here, i hope. And for such a state of development, it's quite fun and well worth the price. I really hope this becomes a great roguelike, worthy of a place amongst aformentioned TBoI, Noita, EtG, StS, and it will not fail to deliver upon those inspirations.",1698929754,1705490848,True,1,0,0.506746649742126465,0,True,False,True

However, that is where the praise ends.

The game is riddled with [b]GAME BREAKING[/b] bugs. Yes it is Early Access but the [b]Major Bugs[/b] are things that should be [b]Immediately Fixed[/b]. Some bugs here and there that are annoying but dont impact gameplay are acceptable to be fixed over time in an Early Access game, but Game Breaking bugs that kill your enjoyment or desire to play are devastating.

Currently there are [b]Several[/b] bugs that impact gameplay. 

One of the worst is the [b]Inability to enter the door to progress the stage[/b]. This forces you to close out your game. When you do so, your language immediately gets set to Chinese. When trying to continue your run, it will show 3 identical copies of your save file and trying to continue will [b]Start your game as a NEW FILE[/b].

In addition, there is a [b]Constant[/b] progression bug that strips away your currencies anytime you start your file. For some reason your save file will read for example: ""20x Ancient Bloods, 400x Crystal, etc"" but when you enter the game you have ""2x Ancient Bloods, 6x, Crystals, etc"". And you [b]NEVER[/b] spent them. Your progress was just mystically deleted.

I was grinding out bosses to get the Summoner Starter Class which takes 50 Ancient Bloods, of which you get around 3 Bloods every time you beat an End of Act Boss (Not the Elite, which is the first boss fight of that level). This means you need around 17 [b]End of Act Bosses[/b] to get the class. I was at 48 Ancient Bloods, decided to exit the game by going back to the main menu, then quitting from there (to make sure it saves) and when I came back to play again, my Ancient Bloods were at [b]30[/b]. Meaning the game [b]FORCIBLY[/b] deleted 18 Bloods (which is 6 End of Act Bosses) for no reason. My 600 saved-up crystals were reduced to 16. 

This is a [b]MASSIVE[/b] issue. The entire premise of games like these is to rinse and repeat, and each time you will end up getting stronger because you can buy upgrades that will make future runs easier to take off. However, if the game has bugs that [b]Delete Progress[/b] it jeopardizes the entire game. 

Unfortunately, I will be dropping the game until I see some updates that will prevent people from losing progress, having their save files almost deleted, etc. I encourage everyone who is on the fence of buying this product to be extremely careful, and maybe wait to see if there are updates in terms of game stability and save protection.",1705083513,1705083694,False,17,0,0.49752122163772583,8,True,False,True

edit:
It's really good.
Only game since Vampire Survivors where I've followed patch notes. Dev clearly cares about the game and there's constant patches and fixes, although I've not had a single noticeable bug. Would strongly recommend if you enjoy your Rougelites.

edit edit:
Recently played Noita which is also a cracking game, it's currently far far deeper and the spell crafting is far more advanced. What this game does have over Noita is that it's far simpler and easier. Much better for a chill session and I really can't wait for additional patches.

Best part is the really open-ended spell customization; the Leg Wire spell can be turned into magical room-clearing nukage, and summons are pretty OP as in nearly every game where you can have minions--especially if you build them right. Those enchanted grimoire minions in particular can get crazy. Aside from the game being unfinished due to EA, the one major complaint I have is the obnoxious ""otaku"" dialogue from the protag.

I'm honestly surprised how active the devs are with releasing patches, communicating, they even added a new NPC to address feedback.  I'm honestly impressed.

Aside from Magicraft being supported by great devs and a active community, Magicraft is one of the best and underrated Roguelites I've ever played. Like HOW HASN'T THIS GAME BLOWN UP?! Anyways, the gameplay is a lite version of Noita but the game doesn't give a sh*t how OP you get and partly it's because it will absolutely destroy you if you get too wreckless. There's so many ways to modify spells using other spells, wands, relics, and upgrades. Also at the time of the review they have also added a multitude of new spells to mess around with. 

Don't come here expecting a walk in the park because this game will absolutely destroy you constantly and if you have skill issue like me, your first complete run may not come until you're 10 hours deep. After you complete the game once, you unlock Hard mode so good luck! (PS I've completed hard mode several times at this mode) but they're adding a 4th chapter sometime in the near future. I'm not sure exactly what to expect but I know it'll be amazing. The devs have stated they are adding new enemies to make Chapter 4 feel fresh.

Keep in mind this is an Early Access so this game may be drastically different by 1,0 with the balances, changes, and whatever their road map will bring. 

My only real complaint is that the training area doesn't unlock until chapter 3 which would be nice to have unlocked sooner. Either way I certainly recommend this game to any fan of the Roguelite genre.",1699027744,1703755582,True,0,0,0.475205987691879272,21,True,False,True

I played Noita for around 200 hours++ and I think this game made their own version of wand mechanic briliantly, to be honest, the phrase ""Inspired by Noita"" is missing from the game description, and seriously it is! [b]So to speak, this game suffers a lot in terms of executions[/b], for example, showing respect to the references (Noita + The Binding of Isaac) would earn you credibility, free marketing, better expectations and learning curve for players. Just saying.

[h2]More rants:[/h2]
By the time of this review, there are many contents creators covering this game and I myself heard this game from Youtube and/or Twitch. [b]If you are still skeptical whether to buy this game, just play the demo and click on the Follow button, you can always decide later after the devs decide to add new contents[/b] (like, Stage 4 on 2024 Q1).

Also, I saw most negative reviews from the Chinese community, seems like they do not play Noita, which explains their misaligned expectations. For me, roguelike or not, beating the game requires some basic knowledge of wand mechanic and optimizing the wand, which is easy for Noita player like me. However, Noita's player community had grown bigger over the years and now have a lot of player-made contents, like guides and Youtube tutorials, which is what this game needs but missing, [b]we need an in-depth guide for new players[/b], yet, this is not the work of devs, but of player community.

The devs should continue focus on the new contents and mechanics, like new spells, new monsters, etc. And also lore, yes, the game seems to be [b]missing a lot of in-depth story writing[/b], note that both Noita and Issac have secrets that uncovers more background stories, which motivates player to dive deeper even after a complete run.

[h2]Good potential but too little contents, even for early-access[/h2]
I've beaten the game after grinding some upgrades in about 20 hours, after this, there's no much left to do. [strike]Although I could grind to unlock the tier-3 (2-stars) spells, but I felt this is easier once Stage 4 is released. So if this is not yet ready, I think the devs should just hide the entire tier-3 (2-stars) spells from the beginning, just saying.[/strike]
EDIT: considering this is a good problem, I spent more time grinding and found a way to unlock tier-3 spells, I'm still patiently waiting for more contents.

[strike]Even though I beaten the game, I did not kill the final ""开发中"" meme boss, which is also another bad executions. Well, obviously the meme boss is meant to be a casual joke while ending player's current run. Yet, the devs decided to give the meme boss a hp bar, its like hinting people to kill it, but players who did killed it then claimed that nothing happened. To elaborate, the devs could simply use a notice sign to game over the player, or when the meme boss is finally killed, doing a 4th-wall-breaking punchline will finish the joke nicely, any of the sort would be just fine, just saying.[/strike]
EDIT: I finally manage to kill the meme final boss, now is do-able using certain builds. The devs listened to feedback, this is a great news for me! Nominated for Steam Award~

[h2]Bad bad executions[/h2]
You see, there's a lot of things that could be done better, including [strike]the above-mentioned tier-3 spells, unavailable Stage 4, the meme boss,[/strike] game descriptions and the ""ABOUT THIS GAME"" translations.

However, I'm still recommending this game because of good core concept and great potentials, as for me picking up the game earlier, this is better for me than getting overwhelmed later when there's more stuff added to the game.

UPDATE: I love this game, hope that the devs will come up with a solid solution for long terms gameplay, which, for example, people can play this game daily and stream online, just saying. =)",1699662805,1703586934,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

do not buy this piece of shit game.

EVERYTHING the game does is guided by an aimbot that knows where your mouse cursor is. mobs will evade you by simply moving out of the way of your cursor, bosses will bullrush you and mimic your mouse movements so you got zero chance to counter play.

plenty of mobs will zoom with lightspeed to your location when you hurt them. like those snakes. hitting some mobs means you get pulled to them (can land you in traps or in a pit) and *they* get pulled to *you* until they sit right ontop of you. the only ""counterplay"" is one-shotting them. but for that you have to be incredibly lucky to find a combo early on.
those snakes know your movements as you make them and simply stick you you like glue. 
it is the most obnoxious garbage design I have ever experienced.
the game has all these ""*crazy skill combinations*"", but 99% end with a snake glued to you till you die, 5 ghosts phasing through a wall and becoming visible when they're ontop of you and you die.
if you build the same BS build over and over and over and over, you can get through the game. how great...

upgrades you get have some internal ""balancing"" attached to them:
i.e. should you get a ""if you got 5 curses, get rid of them"" flask, the game will never show you cursed chests. I get cursed chests CONSTANTLY, just not when I can counter play them. then I NEVER get them.

get the ""a side room is guaranteed"" rare relics you have to pay for with max HP, you'll not get shops [side rooms in shops are crazy good cause of the 6 potions you can buy], only witching areas that have a sideroom that has zero use in most playthroughs.

you are never ""lucky"" in this game. because the game knows your stats and items and makes sure you won't ""get too strong"" or some insane reason. all you can hope for is not being dumped on with unwinnable scenarios.

got zero money? here's a shop. happens to me constantly. got 150 gold? shops won't appear.

I've unlocked most things in the game by now. I've played countless rounds to be sure of it cause I really wanted to know how these effers designed this game and if I was maybe just having bad luck....
if you roll a 1 on a 20 sided die, that's bad luck. if you roll that 200 times in a row, I'd call that a pattern.
this game is designed to fuck with you. that's the core design philosophy. 

it spawns mobs directly ontop of you. it has mobs that go though walls, get invisible and appear right ontop of you - as a group of 5 so you WILL take damage. there's mechanics in this game that punish taking *any* damage and reward taking none. so this stuff matters.

bosses don't have patterns they repeat. some move at speeds much too fast to react to and shoot at you, use some ground attack, or beams and trap you. I just died to getting stuck in one of this aim botted shots.

mind you I got 2000 hours in path of exile. I know how to evade things. I've been gaming since the late 80s. I have never seen an action game of any kind that so blatantly cheats 

other classic eff you dog poop mechanics include a boss doing damage while literally invulnerable and damage sources not being removed when you finish a room/beat a boss. 
you beat the boss, but the mass of maggots he spawned are still there even though you won the round. the red dots left by these ball monsters linger far past the point you beat the room.
everything in this game is designed to inconvenience you, eff with you and just waste your time.
others are pit traps anywhere in a game with crazy spell effects where seeing the ground is often not even possible.  

visually and how the game's systems and logic works, it's really well done. great game in that sense.
but the game is clearly cheating and messing with you nonstop. this isn't a hard game. you can just grind through it. but it plays horribly. 
you know eventually that nothing you do is a result of you playing well or badly. it's just that you were allowed to go far or not so far. 
if you beat it, the game simply let you. if you don't, you just got into one of these no-win rooms, got denied resources for 5 rooms straight, or had some boss push you into a corner and hit you a billion times in 2 seconds.

I suspect it's complete incompetence, not malice, since the game has a lot of work put into it otherwise, the spell system is amazing, the art and music is really great, the dev(s?) just published a gigantic patch with content.... but it *feels* like malice when you play. it feels like someone's effing with you. 

this should have a 99% rating if the combat design was any good and if the game did not treat you like a dummy who can't figure out that its cheating. but it very clearly is cheating. 

e.g. you can unlock something with extremely rare and very limited resources that gives you a kind of goodie box in rooms in the second area. but to open that box, you need to have stumbled on a spell that can kill you when you cast it. ONLY those 2 can open the box. that alone feels incredibly malicious because the description never tells you this.

but it gets better. should you not find such a spell, the damn boxes are in every room almost.
should you find such a spell, the boxes never appear. I had maybe 2 or 3 rounds in well over 50 where I could actually open *one* box. i.e. about 3 boxes overall. look at my playtime.

it's like that with anything.

you can never be happy about finding some item that's amazing because the game will make absolutely sure that you won't be able to ""abuse it"" (i.e. use it in the way it is obviously intended)

once you're cursed, you will never find a curse shrine. if you are not cursed, the game rains them on your maps.",1702916536,1703427688,False,3,0,0.335770100355148315,0,True,False,True

It's a roguelike with a little bullet-heaven feel to it... but where it shines is mixing the spells, as the name suggests.

There are some fun spell combos.
Fire a poisoning laser at the bad guy that then explodes into eight swords.
Turn your cursor into a big glowing ball of destructive energy.
A bunch of energy snakes homing in on their enemy, summoning meteors.
A whirlwind of boomerangs circling you leaving a trail of lightning storms.

It's unbelievably fun to play.

Negatives - relatively minor - and do remember this is early access so a lot of content just won't be ready yet.
Some runs feel doomed if you're unlucky on rolls that you can't get a viable end-game build going.

Not QUITE must-buy, but close enough that if you like a good action(ish) Roguelike and coming up with insane combos, it's probably for you.

Magicraft starts with what is arguably an Isekai - some non-name guy ends up in a magical world through strange circumstances and is burdened with saving the day.  Except this means dying a lot to improve and a hope for a harem quickly dashed on the rocks of reality.  So now to try to move on with life, or afterlife, our hero ventures into magically twisted lands.

The gameplay is simple - point, shoot, vanquish monsters, chose the next room based on rewards, repeat.  But then the game elements start to interact and it gets more and more complex and interesting.

The core is wand crafting, which has three components:
* The basic wand, which has various traits and special abilities.
* The spell components you plug into it.
* The ORDER and interaction of the components which affect how the components work.

A self-casting wand that summons vampiric spiders?  Check.  How about a wand that generates enormous explosions all over that also poison enemies?  Check.  A wand that encircles you with ghostly snakes that slow enemies?  Check.  You can - and will - build all sorts of strange combinations.

You also find relics (which can upgrade) that grant various abilities, change character or wand traits, and so on.  This adds a layer of more interaction - when you blow up everything in a room, you might spawn a legion of ghosts that make short work of the survivors.

All of this is pretty easy to play, effective controls, good graphics and music.  It's a solid product, especially for Early Access.  It feels a good 80% complete, mostly needing the last level tweaked and/or a new level added and some camp content finished.

I can't QUITE call it a Must Buy - it sits on the edge of it.  It's extremely solid, evolutionary not revolutionary, so you won't see anything NEW, but what you'll see is extremely well done.  Perhaps when it leaves Early Access it will be.  But if you want a good action roguelike of wild crafting that's easy to get into, it's probably for you.",1703199427,1703199427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are 3 islands that you fight through with a mini boss and main boss on each island. (There is also normal + Hardmode)

Each play through you encounter different wands and a myriad of spells that can be swapped around to have interesting effects.

After buying the game and playing for about 1 hour I beat act 3 on my very first run.

I would call these peoples inability to beat act 3 a ""skill issue"", however, maybe I just got insanely lucky or they are getting insanely bad RNG.

That being said, there actually is a problem with beating act 3 on the first try. I think I softlocked my save file, because I can't seem to be able to spend my currency on any permanent upgrades? f.ex. a second wand slot, which I really want.

Won't refund for 10€, but the game is not yet finished and still needs a lot of work. Still very promising, as it really fits a niche between Isaac and Hades IMHO.

So, it a usual rogue-like genre where you goes for a run and try to survive on the resources you rolled with. The game play is top down shooter. not exactly top, but like bird eye. You can see the videos about this. move with WASD button and shoot by aiming your mouse and left click to shoot.

The spell combining part is actually the big plus here. You are a mage, collecting wands, spells, and relics on your journey. These wands, spells, and relics will have their own effect that will give huge range of variety.

You can be a one shot wonder with one big exploding bullets, or rapid machine gun with laser, or close and personal with blade spell, or summoner that let your summons do the dirty works, and still much more.

The possibility is quite huge. Your creativity will be satisfied here. For example, there is a summoning spell that summon a pillar. A simple pillar that does nothing but blocks projectiles. there is also a spell modification that makes your spell orbiting you, and there is also a modification that connects you and your summons while damaging anything that touch these connection link. These will make you spinning a rope attached to a pillar around like a helicopter and damaging anything around you. You can put poison, and freeze to this makeshift helicopter too.

My favorite build is the blade build. where you put auto attack on other wands, and give those wands a blade spell that slashing stuff around. Put a rapid shooting spell on your main wand and those blades on other wands will triggered too. this resulting in crazy flurry of blades that erasing multiple dangerous projectiles and small critters. I won my first hard last boss with this.

Or other weird builds like invisible summoners. Like when you use a relic that put you to be invisible as long as you aren't attacking. Just let your summons and your wand guardians doing the attacks. Making you safe from many harm.

The rogue-like piece is quite deep too. Really a thought provoking. There is a summon that can do your spell. there is a spell that on impact can trigger your summon. Combine those and you can do matryoshka inception stuff. That summon can shoot a projectile that will summon something, etc etc.

And many more, like orbiting black holes, field of poisonous snakes, large freezing web of butterflies, etc.

There is also some side rooms with its own challenges and puzzles. Those are challenging enough. and you can take up more curses if you need more challenge. The puzzle is also not that boring and will take some time to be solved.

The art also good enough. Proper 2D arts for the sprites. The fire works is dazzling. your character appearance will follow your current relics. You can turn off some effect if you don't like it. You can turn down the bullet transparency if those fireworks you created filling your monitor like crazy.

The sound is still lackluster. Not that its bad, but its still need more variety so I wont get bored with the BGM. I mean, I goes thru that jungle so many time that the background sound gonna make me sick. I turn the music off and let youtube cover that part. The sound effect is still good tho.

Its also still in early access, so its till cheaper and will have more stuff to add. That, on top of the fact that there is already huge enough stuff to tinker with already.

So, yeah. For those who like rogue-like genre, and how the genre giving the best bang for your bucks, this game will give you huge amount of play time for the dollar. This game is one of the fun ones tinkering with weird combinations. You should give it a try.

Enemies provide a variety of attack patterns, including some grouping behaviours I've not seen before.  The bosses are challenging, and everything overall seems fair.  Well, if you put too much flashy stuff on your wand it can be hard to seen the screen through all the fireworks!

Stage 1 elite worm attack that charges at you 
Stage 1 Rolling orb boss (nearly all attacks)
Stage 2 elite eye boss that has a volley fire attack that is incredibly rapid and very very difficult to dodge
Stage 2 cage boss (phase 2): Attack where the boss sweeps across the screen is impossible to dodge
Stage 3 black slime boss (several undodgeable attacks including him following you and popping out of the ground, and the puddles he leaves makes it increasingly impossible to not take damage)

 I do gotta say that hard mode needs balancing, chapter 3 is full of enemy spawns with tons of HP.

Noita and Binding of Isaac had a baby. And that baby is Magicraft. Even in early access, this game is an absolute gem. I cannot wait to see the end result. What a fantastic game. 

If you like Roguelikes like Binding of Isaac, Noita, etc. This is the perfect game for you.

Edit after 30+ hours -  

Cons -

The recoil on spells is wayyyyy overtuned. Half the time you knock yourself into holes in the floor using big spells.

Some spells literally fall down in holes so if you  have a build that goes against enemies that spawn in holes, you are fu****. 

Speaking of holes (thats what she said), Everytime you fall into one, the spawn point feels so random so half the time you fall in 2-3 more times because you don't know where you're going to respawn.

Key drops are way to rare.

I wish the rerolls in shops actually rerolled EVERYTHING even  after purchasing something. I would love to be able to re-up my  health or spells when I have 300+ gold instead of only being able to get a few things.

Pros -

Despite my criticisms, this game is absolutely incredible. 

The spell combinations are so fun and 30 hours in I'm still finding new interactions.

I haven't found a roguelike this satisfying since Hades and thats saying something

The way you can be OP in this game is unmatched. Its not easy though,  you have to understand the way spells work and put them in the correct order.

This game does a good job of making the spellwork easy to understand unlike Noita.
I love Noita, but it is definitely complicated and hard to grasp. This game, takes what makes Noita fantastic, and elevates it.


Overall, this game is ion my top 10 favorite roguelikes. I cannot WAIT for 1.0 launch. This

The good thing about the game, is that it offers a wide variety of spell-types and enemies, allowing you to build complicated and fun to use attacks.
There is also a variety of bosses to fight against!

The bad things about the game, is that while there is a lot of spells to potentially make, most of the spell 'pieces' so to speak, are very minor, and only noticeable if you upgrade them, which takes a few rooms worth per spell, and some luck.
Of course, that's part of the game and intention, for the spell to be built by small pieces, but I think that even then, the pieces are too insignificant on a whole, because the wands themselves only have a few slots, and those with more slots have very crippling drawbacks like terribly slow attack-speed or ridiculously high mana cost, hindering the ""fun"" of it in my opinion.
Perhaps, having bigger and better wands or stronger spells would make you overpowered, but that's not hard to balance, make the enemies harder, or make a difficulty with ""more complicated spells but harder foes"" or similar.
There is also a personal problem I have that the characters to me, are unlikable, and I'd like the option to just silence them, and for some, alter their appearances. (Especially the maincharacter, I'm not very fond of the skins of the playable character, and the lack of option to change your gender and appearence)

To echo a lot of the other sentiments, it's Isaac + Noita in an albeit unpolished state. The game has an incredible amount of potential, so here's a list of my pros and cons:

Pros:
- Finding new combos is incredibly satisfying
- The spell/wand test area gives my min/max brain the good brain chemicals
- No crashes, no noticeable glitches, perfectly playable in current state (I have played a lot of Ark so this is impressive to me)
- Appears to be a pretty active dev. Don't let this become abandonware, my dude.
- Difficulty seems pretty fair, as of the time posted. 
- New loadouts are being added and it's a nice way to lean into your preferred playstyle. (Currently 4)
- My dad is dead and, let me tell ya, that guy fucking sucked.
- Good amount of spell variety and wands for the current release. Dev claims they'll expand on it later (keep this promise)

Cons:
- The music sucks. It's boring and doesn't really fit until the 3rd chapter
- The art style isn't my thing but that's more of a personal preference. I can deal with it.
- Act 3 on hard still feels like a slog, despite balancing. You can breeze through Act 2 but, though it's hard to die once you get there, things still take too long to die in Act 3. This might change as the dev adds more acts to increase the difficulty but, at the time of posting, it's kind of the least interesting part of the run. Characters are pretty much developed by the middle of Act 2. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. 1982's ""The Thing"" is a pretty fucking great movie.

I've seen the criticism about this game and I've found it a bit unwarranted , maybe it is because I come from Noita Stock, but I don't find the level super hard or the game unfair. The game is tough and I believe that is by design. Now the issue I do take with is bullet sponges they call bosses. It might be because they have so few of them they want them to last but my suggestion is to do what Issac does and have a bunch more bosses. This thought will also run through the levels because especially in the later stages getting past one stage in a level takes forever even with a god tier wand. They should be mostly pretty quick maybe 2 minutes at most.

I find the wand crafting to be extremely fun and rewarding. Really lets you stretch your legs and experiment. Gives me those same Notia crafting tingles. I've not had a run where I couldn't craft a god tier wand.

The game's enemies are also worth mentioning in that they have fun gimmicks and their hp pools increase at an appropriately fast rate and get pretty huge pretty fast, so you actually do have to engage with said magic system to keep up, which is great.

The dialogue isn't a deal breaker because there isn't a lot of it, but it's pretty bad and spoils the vibe of being a magical killing machine when it does come up. The bigger problem is the sound. Both the effects and music are extremely lame and generic which is the real vibe killer.

If they can afford it, the developers should really invest in some custom music tracks and try to add some spice to the sound effects because it would make the world of difference to the game's feel.",1700257508,1700257508,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Nothing new in terms of gameplay or mechanics, but well put together with a lot of polish.  If you enjoy roguelikes and making spell combos I think you'll find this one worth your time and money.

The main gameplay loop appears done and I'm greatly enjoying it.  No bugs or crashes at all so far.  Lots of referential humor.  The potential spell/wand combos are highly varied and I've already found a few that can wipe out everything.  Combos like [spoiler]automatic minion summoning that lets me focus on dodging, clouds of poison-lightning homing butterflies, avalanches of boulders that clear projectiles, meteor storms, rainbow death rays, etc.[/spoiler]  The curses and relics are interesting even if not mechanically new and there are some combinations that can get very spicy.

I want to start with saying this game is certainly fun. I love the style and the mechanics are easy to learn. The balance between randomness and choice is great. Sometimes your luck will turn out poorly and sometimes amazing. I especially love the large list of random effects you can find on  your wands and how you can customize your spells vastly. My last play-through I obtained a high-tier wand to which i added 6+ slots to the already massive slot list and managed to beat the game on hard with a vast array of spells combinations. Honestly I would keep coming back and hope the developers have a bunch more planned for the future. Wholly recommend the game.

That being said I have a few complaints. The game feels fun but lacks challenge especially once you learn what works. There are some builds that are out-right broken while others are left lacking. You end up finding one good spell and push that to its limits with little regard for the other spells. The biggest issue is that single-target spells seem to be far too weak to get you through late-game being as there is little to no way to utilize them effectively. (AOE being king)
Secondly the game is short (which they are working on.) If there was endless modes or some form of advancement past the 4th stage I would enjoy it more, especially if the game got progressively harder while restricting rewards the deeper you went. Relics are great but I would love to see greater variety in the game including some sort of viable minion build (including taunting and player shields or sharing damage). Early game minions are nice but late-game they either die too easily or do no real damage. 
Finally I do not think it is currently worth the whole 10$ price tag, maybe 7 or 8 but it needs greater variety and deeper game play first. Haven't really encountered any game-breaking bugs either.",1699923724,1699923724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

PROS
This game is essentially Noita-lite meets Gungeon. Plenty of wand building (the best thing about Noita) and crazy Isaac/Gungeon-like screen-filling synergies with tons to unlock via meta progress. It's great.

CONS
- The writing. An edgelord would be embarrassed. I understand there may been a translation hurdle, but it's pure juvenile, innuendo-filled garbage.
- The music. Not only does it not FIT the style or gameplay, it's horribly repetitive. I disabled it entirely in favor of my own playlist. 
- I have not witnessed this personally, but a community member sent me a screenshot of the ending of the demo (which I have since heard has been removed) with a trollface and reference to self-harm. Pathetic, even by 2008 standards.

The image in question: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/796662036368588820/1169693345069662249/image.png

To the developers: You have the beginnings of something wonderful. Don't mess it up with awful behavior and marketing. Treat the game (and its audience) with respect. And for gods sake, hire a decent writer and video game consultant: Hi, btw. With Bilibili's publishing support, this can be solved in no time. Good luck!

Edit: Oh, and please add the game to IGDB so I can stream to the correct category on Twitch. Thank you.

Update edit:

I'm honestly enjoying this more than both.  I was late to the party with Isaac and everything feels done already by a large community.  So Magicraft from that perspective is still fresh.

This game shares a very similar wand building system to Noita, only this time you get to play with more of the spells and sometimes great combos can be made.  No need for hours reading a wiki or watching very long play through's to learn about Noita's mysteries.  Some of the things in Noita will never be seen by me sadly.

My only real gripe with Magicraft is the English language localisation.  It's fully functional but some of the grammar has been lost in translation and needs a tweak.

Spells combine to make new and interesting things happen, TONS of variety not usually seen in small games, lots of new ideas for attacks not seen in other games. Honestly this is the type game you can tell was made by a master craftsman.

Game is a bit hard though on the final chapter.

Some fun combos:
A spare wand with pillars that block bullets with an autocast passive upgrade that summons them 30% of the time so you block all bullets. Bonus points if you get the item that links you to your summons and creates a chain of damage for a massive tentacle damage wall.

A low cooldown wand with fast firing lasers and poison.

The mage book summon that copies your spells next to it with ghost fire balls and freezing to cover the entire map in freezing projectiles.

There is so much to try and experiment with in this game. However it does feel like by chapter 3 you can't really be messing around and need a ton of dps to clear stages.

Don't even get me started on the side rooms, which some are just a death sentence that when completed feel unrewarding. All that being said this game is fun, and I would say worth the money.

I would like to see some way to control what spells you get a bit more, or a way to trash spells you have no need for, like selling them for gold. Some more variety in wands would be nice, as all of the ones without post-spells feel basically the same except for the mana pools. Also getting familiars that aren't just summons would be neat too. 

As for what I like about this game, it just feels nice to play. It's such a chill experience, just testing wands, shooting enemies, and being a lil wizard guy.

[list]
[*]Some of the bosses have what seem to be unavoidable attacks.
[*]Enemies spawn out of nowhere on top of you.
[*]It is hard to see where you are in the clutter of everything on screen.
[*]Your summons have collision with you and their ground effects can hurt you.
[*]The floor 2 boss has giga HP.
[*]Floor 3 is a slog of square room with waves and waves of very tough enemies one after the other.
[*]The enemies have super tight tracking and do not stop tracking even while attacking.
[*]Some of the enemies take knockback in really weird ways.
[*]There are almost no attack indicators for bosses.
[*]There's some minor spelling errors (it is a Japanese game).
[*]The puzzle rooms and cursed chests don't seem to ever be worth it.
[*]Some of the parts of the game won't be explained to you until after you interact with them.
[*]Once, my character's neck got really long and he looked like a giraffe except my neck was going sideways instead of up.
[*]Spell knockback seems a little excessive.
[*]The Spell room (not the Witchy things room) has very little use when compared to the Coin room because coins can buy spells OR reroll the spells you have OR buy a new wand and sometimes all three.

A very fun game, well worth the 10$. tThe demo is fun, but the actual early access has added much more. nNot just further levels etc but more items it seems.

Like other reviews say, it has wand mechanics of Noita. Others compare it to BOI, and the character does change looks with items, and it feels a bit like it, but the progression and unlocking is a bit more like Hades imo. 

Great game, well worth the money.

The enemy design is good, one thing that many rogue-like games like these tend to lack is interesting enemies, there's a good variety, challenge, and unique design to them. I felt genuine fear when I saw those snake enemies, so kudos. They definitely were taking notes when they played Isaac, and did a good job at emulating some of those enemies while keeping their personal identity. There's also a Hades style progression system/room exploration. I like that there are no rooms SPECIFICALLY for your overarching progression, that's one of the worst things a game like this can do. (The awful question: ""Do you doom your run now/have less fun now to get more power for future runs?) Thankfully this game gives you meaningful choices throughout, and you simply get the passive upgrade currency by beating bosses, meaning you don't need to do any 'scrap' runs. 

One of the first things I noticed was how good the game felt as well, smacking enemies with spells should be satisfying, and I'd say they accomplished that, as well as making each projectile/spell feel meaningful and meaningfully different from each other. They also did a good job with balance, as crazy as every run gets, you never feel so OP that everything is a cakewalk. I've never been to the point yet where I don't feel like I can ignore new options, and I feel constantly encouraged to FIND those game-breaking synergies because there's no definitive 'right answer' so far. 

The magic system is EXTREMELY good. It's a combination of Noita and Isaac, and done incredibly well. Within 3 runs I've had such vastly different power combinations that I'm actually quite surprised. The mixture of Noita's wand mechanics and Isaac's projectile synergy systems works very well, and I hope they just keep adding new spells (mostly projectiles). I hope there's an unlock system I just haven't gotten to yet because I do feel like the number of overall spells is slightly lacking, HOWEVER the wand combo system and relics do a good job of making up for it and making each run feel quite unique. Especially certain rare wands that make synergies you wouldn't really think of. 

I'm excited to continue this game, and I hope the developers add more content because I am HERE for it. If you liked classic Isaac and/or Noita's creative synergies, this is a pretty easy purchase.",1698940912,1698940912,True,4,0,0.561752974987030029,0,True,False,True

Spell building is similar to noita (with less variety though).

Luck matter a lot during a run but you can make it work with less than perfect spell, and you can get some upgrade once you die (usual roguelite features).

the biggest issue I have currently is the lack of visibility. If you played Isaac or Noita, imagine either covering the screen in tears or having less than 20% of the screen being explosion particules by the end game.

Even when you enter a room you might not know where you are and get hit quickly or fall into a hole/ walk over some spikes as you try to find your location.

Some build simply cannot work because of this. A boss can be hard to kill during chapter 3, since you and monster alike can walk on a side of the screen and appear on the other side while sometime have your control inverted and having monster spam/teleport around with a lot of projectiles. At least there is some way to block/destroy projectiles.

Still, it's really fun IMO. Give it a try.",1698934335,1698934335,True,2,0,0.513808965682983398,0,True,False,True

It has a nice vibe, the magic programming part makes you wonder ""how about we put this in this slot and that in that slot, does this also effect that"" sort of things, and the outcomes are sometimes beyond what you can imagine. It's like a hilarious and top-down version of Notia. As you unlock more rare spells, the game becomes exponentially more exciting and funny.
The enemy design is something else. You can see some of the references that makes you smile, and yet some them them are really annoying (in a good way). My personal most hated enemy is the stone monster with one eye which smash towards you everytime your mag ball deals damage on it, it's a rare but effective design.
The 3 things I think this game stands out of the others are:

1. Really nice enemy and summons animation. Some of them makes me loosing my sanity.
2. The incredible variety of magics 
3. The chill yet humorous vibe and the dumb face of the hero.

This vibe dilutes the difficulty of the game, allowing you to constantly want to challenge deeper levels and try other combinations of magic. Many dungeon or roguelike games usually strive to create a difficult and heavy-duty vibe for players. They tend to make you feel like ""I am a lone brave, constantly going deep into these harsh levels."" 
But this game is different. It has a cute and chill sense of humor that makes you feel cheerful even if you die a hundred times. After all, the protagonist is just like us, a nerd who plays video games all day long, powerless to do anything else.  During the gameplay, my mentality was less like a ""lonely brave"" and more like a naughty student who poured active metal stolen from chemistry teacher into a random toilet seat in school and see what happens. There are shy-looking big spiders, bad-tempered rocks and very cute pop cats. Here you can study and learn the effects of magic combinations based on your own interests, and have fun doing it. It's a pure joy of exploration, and your enemies don't look that intimidating. Ok, well some of them look pretty gross, but overall they're cute.
Our real world is already so bad that the depressing and hopeless news is crushing our nerves. Why not find a little bit of pure happiness in the virtual world?

If you can manage to add as much(ok, I know that's a tall order) as Isaac, and find the perfect balance of items, powers, bosses, secrets and difficulty, this can be at the top of the Action-roguelites-bullets-money-doors-keys-crazy synergies-secrets, with the likes of BoI, Enter the Gungeon, and Nuclear throne. 

The control you have over the sequence of spells and their added bonuses is really cool. You get the impression of finding a sequence that is the ultimate one! Then you find another one. 

Enemies of the first 2 biomes are varied and fairly tough, although it seamed the step up to biome 2 was a big one. I got hit only twice in the 1st biome but got eviscerated by the 1st room worms, that seemed to be armoured in stone... But I prefer it too tough than too easy.

Graphics are nice and ""comicky"", there's graphic violence but its still pretty soft, You could appeal to all BoI clientele with a mature direction, going for 13+ content.

Music is ok but I reaaaally hope the softy dream music is a 1st biome exception. The game is semi-violent, action-packed,  you kill monsters, you dodge bullets and enemies, you're hungry for power, the music should follow. Metal, high-rythm, scary, somber, melancolic, music. Not happy music. The guy is stuck in another world, having to deal with post-trauma, kill monsters he didn't know existed and die over and over, for gods sake!
