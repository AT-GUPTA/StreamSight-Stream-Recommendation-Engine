Can't. Stop. Playing.

I can't even stop thinking about the game outside the game. I'm probably working or preparing breakfast and have a past Devstream or analysis about it running on my cellphone.

Every Warframe you can use is unique. There's a ton of weapons that i haven't seen in other MMO's and playing with friends is a blast.

Warframe is an F2P game where you can grind the cash currency (platinum) and never spending a single penny on it. (And even if you need to, you'll probably get discounts in game) and this is awesome, because customization mostly comes from cash items. And customization in warframe is super complete. (also our true endgame)

Lastly: you have freedom. You can build your characters and weapons any way, and you'll always be able to rearrange and change everything whenever you want. You don't have to always play the same character because is the only one you leveled up. You don't have to start from the complete bottom if you wanna play something else. You don't have to do the same quests and the same missions again with another warframe. You just swap, and continue fighting.

Try it, and if you have problems progressing, ask in the region chat. Most people in the community will be happy to help you.

UPDATE: I just crossed the 10 years line in October 2023. The game is better than ever. I PLAYED THIS 10 YEARS ALMOST NON-STOP. The last time I played something this much, it was Ragnarok Online.

One of the massive flaws sadly is how massively RNG based it gets (The further you are in it)
Finishing all quests/collecting everything eventually leaves you bored and with nothing to do but wait for new stuff

Other than that,It's really good (i recommend heavily to grind lovers out there)


Edit: Game is still Amazing and going to get a hell of a lot better,get it asap! (2017)

Edit: Going to be a good year for Warframe,They Finally finished a 4 year quest in the making (Sacrifice) And Gave us a Massive Plot Twist in Lore. Hyped to see what they do next. (2018)

Edit: We 3264 hours in and feeling a bit dry honestly, Can't tell if my hunger for warframe has died or the content died.. Still a good game just take your time with it


Edit: Alright..it's the end of 2021 and you might have noticed there's a time jump from my last review and now, The Explanation to this is just lacking motivation to play due to lack of content.
Honestly I tried now and then with the side quests that would pop up but it just wasn't bringing that spirit back to me. Recently Warframe got a HUGE Quest update that brought me back  and it...is AMAZING!!! DUDE IM TELLING YOU THIS GAME IS INSANELY GOOD FOR A FREE TO PLAY GAME!!! Like this quest had me emotional bro!!!! Seriously if you haven't put a good amount of time into warframe, What are you doing bro? GET GRINDING MY DUDES SIGMA GRINDSET ACTIVATE. (Cringe aside the game is back at the top, hopefully stays this way (: enjoy it )

Edit: It's 2023, We got some decent updates and QOL updates to warframe which feels kinda good ngl however its been another year of no attention grabbing content which throws you off but this is only if you play the game Solo, I recently met the Love of My Life and she's gotten into warframe which has once again awaken my motivation to play this game again.

I don't usually play third person shooter games with photo-realistic design like these, but this one is an exception. The Warframe designs which are like bio mechas are amazing, the gameplay is really fun, and it's not just about the guns, it also have melees and warframes abilities, which combines into unique builds. You can also change your warframes functionalities like strength, durations and range with mods and such. The cinematic stories are phenomenal and I still praise them till this day. The game also has a lot of game modes, which we will also come to this later. The game also has amazingly friendly comunity as well. This game is FREE TO PLAY while having AAA game level of designs, and you can grind premium currency ingame pretty easily.

HOWEVER the game is quite grindy, which is the least worst thing on the list.
You want to play with new stuffs NOW, but you have to wait 3 days for it to finish crafting, which kills off the hype.
Every content updates brings you new game modes, which is another content island that has barely anything to do with the rest of the game, with materials that once you have everything you can craft with that materials will, with no doubt, never want to have anything to do with that game mode ever again. Although a lot of content updates adds a lot of refreshing new game modes and well, contents, they all feel so different that it feels like another game entirely. Every time.
The game also lacks a form of ""endgame content"". By that I don't mean sitting in Survival for 2 hours killing level 9999 foot soldiers. By that I mean actual hard bosses. Assassinate missions are a joke, the bosses are forgettable, save for Eidolons, Orbs and Ropalolyst, which are not available for majority of the player unless they grind really hard to unlock them, not to mention actually be able to beat them. Railjacks are fun for the first hour or so, but it's also another content island which you don't want to have anything to do with. Asides from those, Liches and Sisters hunts are actually quite fun, challenging and memorable as a boss, and does give some nice uses or Raijacks as their dramatic final confrontation. The new Orowyrm in Duviri Paradox is also quite something too, but wayy too easy.
I stopped playing Warframe around The New War, but it's still fun enough to keep me coming back to the game occasionally because of the fun gameplay, the mechanics deep under it keeps pushing me away, and every updates with new game modes keep getting me dumbfounded of what is going on and what to do every time I return.

The game gets constantly updated pretty much which my computer couldn't handle the amount of GB's this game was putting on my computer so I had to uninstall it.

Sci-fi co-op grindfest with pretty but very hidden lore, bunch of best monsters west games can suggest for free and ultimate possibility to level up yourself into fashion icon/victim. Warning: can ruin your time count.
Sweet times of second Dream afterwards.

Update 2018:
I'm still here and this game is still on fire. In good meaning.
Aaand remember:
We all lift together and will make a needed sacrifice, inevitably.

Update 2019:
(Made under impression of break from game for few months) This is game which can be harsh to you at first, but it will feel like home after a while. And you will not want to leave it forever, even if you start to have tired veteran syndrome, like I did. You may think you broke up this strange and attractive relationship, but eventually you go back, sit in your orbiter and think ""Hey, I am back and I am happy to it"".
It's still grindgest though, and all the lore is still carefully hidden in darkest corners of Origin system, but when you can kill things and uncover secrets with power, style, fashion and more than 30+ shiny warframes, it's a lot funnier.

Update December 2019: Honeymoon period vanished long ago, but I am still in love. Can't wait to go for more.

Update August 2021: 
Time flies, i am still here. Game continues to improve, continues to grow and strive. Now 40+ warframes strong, full of reworks old and new, it flourishes as varied (infested pun?) mass of universe-flavored mini-games in one big, weird and still fascinating third person shooter. You can be here for a lot of things, to be a lot of characters. But more often then not, you will find a reason to keep playing again and again.
_
And remember, Tenno, New War is coming.

Update August 2022:
World goes to sh*t, but I am still here and with all the dirt happening around future of game goes brighter every day.
New War is here, Zariman hangs in the system and so many questions were answered, but weren't answered.
New Crew, new hardships, new Warframes, tragic stories and new guests of our small System. 
Ninjas keep playing for free, so it's always great time to hop in game.

The games open worlds while it may be what you came for should not be what you stay for the game has alot to it and you should check it all out. The game is great and I love it i've known the game for two years now and it has given me things to look forward to and to keep me active in my lower times. Warframe is a great game and while it can seem intimidating there is always youtube and its community which is mostly helpful, right there and ready to give you some tips and info. Check it out DE cares about their game.

Edit: This is a long time after my initial review above here.  Warframe is a game built up on dreams, the game is in a constant state of drought lacking things to do all while the developers promise new things to keep its community of sheep happy and talking about the potential of things rather than what's actually there. Nothing is ever given a release date leaving players to wait a full year or longer for anything to do only have what ever is released not even last very long. The game lacks any difficult content for its later stages and the developers have proven they don't care, constantly creating content with the potential to be difficult but then keeping it new player friendly so everyone can do everything. The games community while being praised for how supportive it is, does not push the game to grow and do better and will shame anyone that brings actual judgment to the game. Warframe is an overhyped experience that continues to grow off of promises that it never quite delivers on. I'm not gonna just sit here and call the game bad because it's not, the game is enjoyable and can be played but personally it just shouldn't be your main game as it will always lack things to do other than random self set goals you create out of boredom.

I'm MR26 and in a lead position for a wonderful clan full of amazing people that I'm honored to call my friends.  I've helped numerous people through the beginning of the game, and their reactions to the storyline quests still make my heart happy in a different way every time.

Pretty solid MMO looter-shooter and hack'n slash hybrid. It has flaws ( overwhelming for newer players, story only really gets interesting after certain point which takes about 10/50 hours, pretty mediocre end game and is one of the most grindiest games i've ever played) but for it's price and content, it's worth it.

 I've come to appreciate a lot of what Warframe is over the years, there's no game out there that made me this hook into playing it, it's not one of the most original games out there and the devs ( even though they respond to the community quite well) do tend to meddle with the balancing of the game in a questionable way quite often, but there is always some new content being added that brings a whole new system into play, some of these new content doesn't stick the landing but some do and that's the ''magic'' ( more like, addictive nature) of Warframe, there is always something to do, and best of all, since this is a ''pay to skip'' game rather than a ''pay to win'' game, it's all free ( more like 95% free, the other 5% is some exclusive cosmetic items and slots for some stuff like weapons, companions, etc).

 My main recommendation if you ever gonna play this, is that Warframe, just like any MMO, is best played in bursts (that way you can always take a break when feeling burnt out and come back when a new update has been added) and with a group of friends ( any game is always better played with a group of friends but since Warframe is technically an MMO, it has elements to it's gameplay that are better when playing in a group). If you ever feel lost in this game, make sure to always use the official wiki page and there's plenty of youtube channels out there dedicated to this game.

DE always listen to their community, it's a great game with a great community. The gameplay? Well no comment here, all good and fun. Warframe is a bit hard to play for newbie, because there's so many playstyle with different types of MODS to upgrade the weapon and the warframe, we need to find the synergize of every mod and the ability. Warframe has their own uniqueness, awesome story line and quest. Warframe is not a pay-to-win game, we spend our money not to be super crazy strong player, but it's only to making everything faster  (because Warframe is all about grinding)
Last but not the least, WARFRAME always evolve, with so many nerf and changes, makes warframe much more enjoyable, maybe it's a bit frustating at first, but it makes the player to go out exploring the new things, making us escape from our comfort zone.
Trust me, this game worth every second and every penny, by penny i mean the Prime Access (for fashion frame purpose and for high level player and as the last end game purpose)

Players will give reasonable and constructive feedback or a suggestion and they'll not just ignore it, but avoid that solution by any means possible. I just don't understand. It's like they think if they take player feedback, and make changes based off that, that it wont be their game anymore. DE used to let the game grow around the players, such as the melee sliding movement which turned into the parkour system we have today. Now, they're an overprotective parent, not allowing it to grow.

So to start us off, I want to address my personal Elephant in the room.
The game runs fucking amazing for such a beautiful game on my shitty PC, if you check some of my other Reviews, you see a theme starting to run where newer games with high graphics are troublesome on my PC, this game only lags in heavy cutscenes on lowest graphics because there's physics simulations happening in the background seperate from the Cutscene(which is heavy on my PC)

Now, to get into the actual review with the + points

+:
My first compliment to the game is it's variety in, well, everything. From the movement system, to the Warframes you can collect, to the approach you can have for the game. Be it either Stealth, Loud and Proud or just casual, if you have the gear and time, you have the style.
Next up I gotta address the Graphics(again)
The Graphics are beautiful, yet not realistic. For example: Horizon Zero Dawn has a somewhat Realistic approach to most of it's Sci-Fi ideas and workings, while Warframe throws all of that out the window
The entire game is pure Fantasy-Sci-Fi elements, and it somehow manages to make it all seem like it makes sense.

My next big + is the story
There isn't really a very clear story if you don't look it up at the start, but once you get to a quest called: The Chains of Harrow, shit gets real. And good too

The last + I really want to point out here is that the game is constantly getting updated in numerous ways, be it Story/Quest updates, bug fixes, hell, even stuff like entirely new maps being added to existing Planets, it's awesome and feels like they can keep this game going for another few years to come


Now, to the - points

-:
My few - points have a similar theme, you'll see

Ever since a certain update(Plains of Eidolon) and another(Fortuna), the game seems to kinda have been dulled out, lemme explain.
Before those updates, every Story/Quest update took around 5 to 8 Months to make or Publish, while nowadays, new Quests and updates come out almost Monthly, and they almost never(to me) feel like they published the update to actually drive the Story forward, or just as just another excuse to make you get another Warframe

Another complaint lies with the current progression of the actual Story(Not just Warframe Quests with little itty bits of Story sprinkled in there)
I think that The Sacrifice was a GREAT Quest(not entirely completed, but I know the main theme already and where it's headed), and I would honestly recommend going into the main Story Quests blind if you can(The main Story Quests that I would recommend that with shall be at the END of the review), but they almost seemed to have stopped working on that next ""Chapter"" so to speak, as it's been almost 2 years since the last Story Quest for the Main Story came out.

All in all, I believe that the game went frmo a 9,5/10 for me, to a 8,5/10 for me.
The fact they almost stopped production on the main Story just leaves you hanging, which is a little sad


The Main Story Quests I would recommend you go into Blind!!!!!:
Stolen Dreams.
The New Strange.
Natah.
The Second Dream.
The War Within.
The Chains of Harrow
The Apostasy Prologue
The Sacrifice

These are all interesting Story Quests that really drive home the world this game is set in, and I could not imagine myself having spoiled these for myself as they are AMAZING Quests",1486645471,1604926554,True,1,0,0.502332806587219238,0,True,False,False

Warframe. There was a point in my time with World of Warcraft that I just became bored the fantasy asthetic. I yearned for  the sci-fi, for space. I took a chance and played Mass Effect, long after it had been out, and was gobsmacked. ""How could I have missed this game!!"", I thought.  It strached that itched. But it was not enough. I needed more. I looked and looked until I found Totalbiscuts lets play of Warframe. And that was it. I had found my game. 

For a free to play game, it has one of the most fair models there is. If you have the time, play. If you don't, pay. The point of game is to play. It is your choice to use faux-money to by the in-game currency. Orrrrrrrr, you can just play the game. 
And if you are of a mind to, try to have some fun while you do it.

Pros-
Support and engagement: It would be hard pressed to say that they people that develope Warframe, Digital Extreme, lack any passion for this game. They are almost fanatical about it. Which in and of itself is a pro and a con. You forget where you started, see only the bright future, and very rarely fill in the cracks that develop along the way. 

I may have put too much into the idea that a developer would truly heed the calls by the player base. In the end they have to keep the lights on. And while that must be put first, without an ear to the people that are paying to keep the lights on, a developer may find the dog didn't just bite, but took the whole forearm off at the elbow.  

Game play- a nice blend of beat'em up and shooter in 3rd person perspective. I like to see myself in relationship to world around me. 

Cons-

Loot system- I am a big advocate of diablo style loot systems. Warframe could hands down benefit from this style system with a revamped crafting system. 

Parthian sTHOughT-
The push for end game- lt was in this game that learned that end game is what people look for when they want a reason to stop playing a game. That is really what endgame is. It is our push to escape the gravity of something that we have invested such a large amount of time in that we want that period at the end of the sentance.

You are basically a god, and the enemies are the puny mortals that can't even aim half the time. Difficulty is infrequent. The AI can be braindead sometimes. The story is basically there to keep you entertained when you have nothing to do in the game, and the writing can be really cringy sometimes. 

After the first few months of playing, you start to realize how flat Warframe is. The characters are not compelling. Ordis is not funny. Lotus just basically lies to you for the whole game; it's really obvious sometimes, the devs weren't really trying with the plot twists, but she keeps lying for the sake of plot progression. 

And DE turned it into a microtransaction moshpit, too, even worse than Team Fortress 2. 

The bulk of the game is just grinding for a while in boring side missions. It was fun at first, but now it's too much.

The final verdict for Warframe is a 4/10. The only thing that keeps it from being any lower is that it's occasionally fun with friends. Warframe also has a lot of potential, but for now, it's just potential. If you do subject yourself to this game, don't expect any deep stories like you would in say Fallout: New Vegas.

Tl;dr Don't play this game anymore not until they fix their bugs (which they probably won't)

The game's grind is all right back before Railjack update dropped, after that I just wasn't having it anymore. The Dry-dock itself was a grind to build that only the veterans or the players with enough resource to cash out can build, then comes out the 6 million credits* and new resources needed to craft the damned ship. After that they announced a new event, the so-called ""Scarlet Spear"" which was tied to a broken update riddled with bugs a new skill system that you can't access without building the goddamned ship, the only good thing they did was they refunded the astronomical cost for creating the ship so that players can easily join in the event. But unfortunately, it was too late. A lot of the games features is still not polished for god knows how long and now amidst the pandemic the devs are trying to patch the sinking ship of a game by going for a ""Railjack Revisited"". 

Yes, I understand that the devs are also humans and they make mistakes. Yes, I understand that the devs were forced to ship contents to satisfy the needs of the player-base. But you can always ask the players of what do they feel about the current state of the game, you can always explain to the players why the content need to be delayed rather than pretend to communicate to the player-base and do exactly nothing about it, then try and fix the game but do it in the worst possible time.

=======================================================================

To honest if there is a middle button if I recommend this game or not I would press that.

There are good and bad things about this game (seems like most of the games today). 

> The good in this game is that the Developers of the game are actively listening to the player base.
> They let the players decide the next fashion item to be released in-game (Tennogen items). 
> The game itself is a vast and beautiful masterpiece of stories connecting to one another.
> Loads of free stuffs (as long you have enough will and time to do stuffs)
> Free-2-Play :V

As for the bad well....

> Grind-fest (YOU NEED A LOT OF PATIENCE! LITERALLY!)
> Lots-a-bug (Well it is a big/F2P/WIP Game, that much is expected)
> The Burnout is Real (when you reach the part when you can't do anything because you finished every quest available and finished leveling nearly everything available for your arsenal)

Overall this is a great Free-2-Play Game that doesn't go with ""F2P but P2W (Pay 2 Win)"", thou it still needs refining :V But still I personally would recommend it to you guys out there but I hope you can deal with the burnout and the tiring Grind-fest.",1486183431,1587531429,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

They added riven mod that are very hard to aquire, when aquired they still have very hard challenge to show what they do, when unveiled they propably gonna be trash for a trash weapon that no one likes using.

They added modular moa companions, modular secondary guns and modular meele weapons. Why bother with crafting moa companion and heavly grind if we can get a carrier or kavat easier. Why bother with secondary if they are very situatonal at most to use bcs meele/primary are always superior and even then, syndicate secondaries are better. Why bother with heavly grinded modular meeles if there are such things as sancti magnus or whatever that new loka mace is called or gram prime, the first heals with power attacks, able to fully heal a 10k hp inaros in 1 channeled power attack, it also heals allies and most importantly, objective, gram prime is just the best meele weapon, so why again, have to bother with super grindy weapons that are so much weaker with worse effects?

---------

Revisited at 30/05/2019, gave it a longer run. The game got some noob friendly updates, but not a positive ones, ppl don't need anymore to cooperate, everyone gets 4 free ressurects for a low low price of tiny affinity piece which is like killing few enemies, everyone can just yolo in now and if they get downed, just memessurect themselves, almost never being able to pick someone up, ppl just smash that ressurect button instantly as they are downed and they also get downed so often!, like com'on, not only they play squishes (personaly building most frames as tanks and liking tanky frames), they also don't even bother to dodge some obvious attacks... but whow e are kidding, they don't have to learn to dodge, they can just stand up for free.

The game also got no challenge left, even tho they made enemies hit harder (propbly bcs self ressurection was too strong... and that damage still doesn't matter), corpus moas no longer are warframes type of star troopers, they have pinpoint accuracy now, there is even a new aura mod that reduces corpus accuracy so prepare to have ass kicked vs corpus without having a cover from all sides and/or strong abilities/weapos. Back to challenge, there is such huge powercreep that ppl just melt everything with 1 button press even up to lvl 100, riven mods if lucky rolled get radiculously powerfull, there's more legendary mods too, they added arcanes which even more boost players with bs effects like... % to restore WHOLE shields when being hit, so imagine having 2 like those and play that frame with 3k shields, can't die, just can't, there are arcanes that also boost dmg, crits, attack speed etc as if one-shotting lvl 100+ enemies was not enough. Ppl also don't bother to go past round 5 of any defense/interception/survival, never was in a team that went past 6 or 7 think, most even leave before round 5 but some last to 5... they can one-shot lvl 100 enemies so what is the point of such power if only using it on lvl 10-30?!

-----------------

Grind Simulator 2016/2017, didn't play this game for a few months bcs of this reason and after thinking that should come back, maybe something nice added, checked warframe wiki, a few useless infected warframes and pet, more and more primes with primce access 40-100€+ (if remember right and not that they are only for real money, but the grind is extreme, realy) and almost no interesting meele weapons (other than galatine prime), but when was thinking about that galatine..., did remind self about the grind... and removed warframe from download list when it was just at 3 GB.

Was this game fun over those 800 hours that played? yeah, when firstly started it was a ton of fun solo or with friends, but devs started adding more stuff (which was not bad at first), more randomness, less chance to drop things, more grind, then it came to bad side of it, before needed like 50-100 hours to level up primed mod, now after nerfing drop from... neptune excavation with corpus if correct it feels like they removed half of the gold cores from rewards.

While adding things they removed things into ""vault"" leaving ppl with uncomplete parts, without possibility to get that stuff unless paying some thousands of plat on market from some antique collector players.

What else..., ah, the void which was so extremaly grindy and frustrating when played then when lost an item that farmed for last 2 weeks back then bcs of their servers dying, called their support for giving it back... but no, they refused, never again got that part of volt again. Other than that, can't speak for void part of the game as they changed it in some way and didn't play it, no more void keys, that's all that know, but the extreme grind for anything else stays and it only gets worse with time, whe started the game it was so.... casual to just go and do few missions with randoms or friends and get many levels into weapons, many mods and cores that could be used to upgrade stuff and if wanted to farm parts.. it was just droping, now to get anything, thou wilt dedicate entire day, week, month, maybe even months who knows, met some ppl who were literaly screaming in chat in happiness when in void we were farming together and after 1-2 months they finally got that part. (and so here comes super ""cheap"" prime access and other stuff that drops like a b****)

Master level, to level it up need to use weapons and things that don't want to, that are useless garbage, need to craft them/drop and whatever and ppl who played from very beggining or got prime excalibur will always have it highest bcs those items are no longer in loot tables.

Last thing, the requirements for this game are missleading, 2GB of RAM?, 10GB free space?, pfhah lol, on windows xp (now have 7 so it wouldn't do such things.. perhaps?) where is 2GB RAM limit only the game in last months of playing it was crashing after 1-3 missions and don't even start with relays (or how those things are called), the amount of tenno that is there requires a beast computer... or a friend that can log in and buy stuff for us~. About space required, that's 25GB when downloading, what would be with all those patches. (not that is a thing to say game is bad, just saying that's wrong number)

So okay, is the game bad, is that not worth the time to play and all that stuff, well... depends, depends if someone is patient. The story... was nice, decent, with many things to theorise, to discuss, to imagine, for self? that end with tenno being some stupid humanoid just controling a frame destroyed it and any new story after that and arround that was bad (except Clem, he is best NPC and quest giver in the game, glad atleast this devs did for playerbase other than expanding their prime crap). Enjoy grinding 100+ hours to upgrade 1 mod and doing literaly, the same thing while also trying as best as can to keep up to 20 or 30 wave? then thou wilt enjoy this. The game is further progressing into Super Grind Small Loan of One Million Dollars Hit Our Dev Heads Let's Prime It UP, not pay to win... atleast yet, unless we will consider boosters to improve our chances to drop that ""thing"" we want rather than wasting months, devs spends more time on making primed extremaly rare things that are either dropable after weeks or months or other stuff farmable like ships, pets, weapons, resources and put that stuff in their store for Small Loan Of One Million Dollars and spend noticably less and less time on making good story content, fixing pvp and new areas (archmode rubs us in a wrong way, an interesting idea that was left in basics that no one plays other than getting master level or for atlas warframe grind). So, after all of that... choose if want to play, game was good, no longer, it became like rest f2p games, no longer shines.",1487619122,1559234418,False,7,0,0.537594020366668701,0,True,False,False

It is so difficult to find toxic players in the community, everyone is just too damn nice, you'd think the place was run by abunch of Canadians with how friendly people are.

The game has too much content, two massive open world areas, lore that just bends your mind at times. hundreds for different weapons, 

AAA graphics, hot fixes when ever bugs are found, several times a week at times. The Devs seem to listen to the players. They publish their drop tables. Where is the thrill of getting burned when buying a loot box full of crap, they don't have any gambling you can spend real money on.

How the hell can this happen from a little 250 person indie house out of London Ontario Canada, they don't have a big corparate master cracking the whip to get them to monitize the life out the game.

Oh yes and the biggest thing I dislike about Warframe,

It Is Free.
All the expansions over the past 5 year have been free. 
Anything you could spend real money on, you can earn for free.
How can anyone trust a company that gives all their shit away for free?

They're up to something, those Canadians at Digital Extremes, probably some subversive plot.

I saw one of their people with a mafioso sounding name, Space Muther (I've seen reports from trusted sources that she may have green skin) She bragged on a live stream that they have millions of ""registered lusers"", brainwashed no doubt, ready to do their bidding.

Almost everything can be earned in the game. Even paid currency thanks to the trade system. It will just take effort and time as the foundry builds everything.

ONLY spend platinum on colors or slots. Rushing is practically throwing money away and most things in the market can be gotten for free fairly easily.

the thing i find most astonishing is the number of people who can play this sh_itty game for thousands of hours and still not comprehend the free-2-play concept. free-2-play is a rip off of your time-on-Earth or your money, it's either one or the other. you pay for the in-game crap with your money or with your time-on-Earth, that is the exchange, those are your payment options. that is the core mechanism of every free-2-play game. the only question is how much monetary value do you place on your time-on-Earth? how much are the individual hours of your life worth to you in terms of money? this is the question you must ask of yourself when you play a free-2-play game. [u]coincidentally, it is the same question that you ask yourself when you apply for a job[/u], you know, ""[b]work[/b]"", as in [u]the opposite of ""[b]play[/b]""[/u], it's that thing that your dad does all day so that you can sit around and play games all day and never ponder the value of your time-on-Earth or how it relates to your money. but most customers do not have the capacity to comprehend the question or that there even is a question. remember that you only have so many hours left to live on Earth, no matter how old or young you are and that tomorrow is not guaranteed for anyone. just something to keep in mind when frittering the hours of your life away, grinding like a slave to receive ""free"", ""in-game"" junk.

as intelligent as some of the people who've reviewed this game can make themselves appear to be, in spite of their 300 to 3k hours of grinding, they're still idiots who've learned nothing if they continue to play this game.

i don't claim to be a genius but you can plainly see how long I was able to tolerate this extortive, exorbitant grinding and i do see it as a test of intelligence.you see, [u]the sooner you discover the razor blade that's hidden within the apple, the smarter you are.[/u]

spending more hours of your time playing a game than you would actually enjoy spending with it, in order to keep from spending more money on the game is essentially a self-inflicted form of enslavement and when you finally break down and give the game publisher your money it's like you are only buying back a little bit of your precious time-on-Earth from the game publisher. as though the game publisher already owns your time-on-Earth and they are withholding it from you and selling it back to you in little parcels, as you make only the tiniest incremental steps of progression through the years of grinding your precious ""Time-on-Earth"" away, in the form of pointless in-game trinkets.

Pros:
1. Controls are amazing. When they say space-ninja, they mean space-ninja. Btw, new players, the most important parkour action is called a bullet jump. On pc it is Ctl+Space in the direction you want to jump in. On console it's L1+X.
2. Not p2w, you can get anything in this game for free. While most games that do this die out because devs can't get enough money, this is completely untrue for Warframe. People support it enough to pay for small things like player-made cosmetics. These are the only things you can't get for free, but hear me out, when you buy this ""tennogen"" 30% of the money made in the transaction goes to the creator. But, this isn't a free market, the ""tennogen"" is submitted and then voted on to see what gets into the game.
3. VARIATION. This is one of the most important parts to me in this game. All of the 36 warframes, not including primes or umbra, are completely and utterly unique. All of the weapons, there are a lot, are completely and utterly unique, not including primes or prismas or wraiths or whatever. The pets and sentinels are all completely and utterly unique, and they are not just there for show. AND IT DOES NOT END THERE! Not only do you have this plethora of weapons and warframes and pets and sentinels, you can also mod each and every one of them. Which means that you can have pistol and make it set enemys on fire. You can make a shotgun spit out a hundred bullets, you can do pretty much anything. There are thousands if not millions of combinations. And don't forget that you can colour anything. I mean anything. This includes your orbiter, your warframe, your pet, your setinel, all of your weapons. If you add this into the mix of all the options you get uncountable combinations. Colors are not included in the ""tennogen"" category.
4. The story line. If you are reading this as a new player, you probably don't know what i'm talking about. You saw the tutorial mission and you think ""Eh, generic story."" false. When you complete the second dream, war within and the sacrifice, then you'll know what i'm talking about.

Cons:
1. Not that good of a new player experience. For starters, tutorial is pretty bad, it doesn't teach you bulletjumping, which is really important. It is a slow start up for new players, it takes them a while to get new items.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some people think that this game isn't challenging. I have seen countless negative reviews stating just that. However, every single one of those has a relatively low amount of playtime for a looter game like this. Anywhere from 0.1 hours to around 15. Of course like I said, Warframe doesn't have that good of a new player experience, which could explain that. I just don't see how anyone could leave a bad review for this game while only playing 15 hours of it, of course excluding bugs. I have seen reviews with less than an hour playtime and saying it's p2w too, which makes even less sense to me. You NEED at the very least 15 hours of playtime for me to consider that you have played this game enough to write a review. I myself am a new player, at well over 600 hours, but i'll be conservative with you fellow new players. I am only half-way to rank 8 out of i think 30. I have only played 7.5/30 of this game and I am so supportive of it right now, especially with Fortuna and hopefully Railjack coming out soon.

What, you wanna see some explanation as to why I'm not recommending this 
[strike]piece of cake
[/strike] game? Alright, I'll do my best to explain, but first a tiny note: if you are already playing Warframe and enjoying it - great! keep playing :)

At a first glance Warframe seemed to be fairly good and engaging game: visually it looks fine, gameplay is fast-paced and overall fun to play. Huge solar map and seeming existence of story creates an illusion of a deep well made game. But that doesn't last long and as soon as you dive deep into the game it reveals what it really all about: repetitive boring meaningless grind, spiced up with endless bugs, lack of structure, logic, and creativity.
Warframe has actually very little content to offer and whatever content is there is just shoved into players face with absolutely no explanation or guidance or preparation.
With the exception of a few story-missions and Plains of Eidolon all locations are just a random pile of pre-made ""tiles"" glued together during loading. ”Tiles” are rooms, and there are maybe a few dozens of them in each set. As a consequence missions look alike on different planets to the point when it's impossible to differentiate one from another. Considering that there are over 200 missions and only four main tile-sets, one for every enemy faction, with tiny variations for on-planet and in-space missions, soon I got sick of seeing same surroundings again and again.
Game modes can't boast of variety either: there are basically (again) four of them + a few modifiers. Um, correction: that is on paper there are four+change, in reality you’d be hard pressed to find difference between them as they feel and play rather identical. 
Adding insult to injury AI is extremely simplistic making enemies blindly run at the player in (sometimes) straight line. Cloak and they would act like nothing happened and no tenno was there. It's little to no fun or excitement dealing this such opponents. Often I felt sorry for them, however odd that sounds.
Now imagine all mentioned above multiplied by hundred or thousand. Sounds tempting, isn’t it? Once all quests are completed and all planets are ”explored” there is not much left to do: either further level up your Mastery Rank or customize your warframe (playable character) and equipment to its max. Leveling Mastery Rank up is simple: level up gear such as weapons, companions or warframes. Process of acquiring an item and then leveling it up is mindlessly simple and requires player to do same/similar mission over and over and over again until the goal is reached. Some stuff can be bought for real money, but process of leveling it up can’t be skipped.
And finally icing on this cake: bugs. Endless bugs. Every new big(or small) update brings bugs, often game breaking. A recent example Sanctuary Onslaught game essentially was crashing when host player disconnected – host migration was not working on release and devs fixed this issue almost a week later. What QA team was doing before the release remains a mystery. Assuming there is a quality assurance team employed at DE (devs)..

At the end of the day, Warframe can offer very simple stylish gameplay with no depth to it. If you are looking for more than that this game would feels just as fun as grinding wooden blocks with a sandpaper - for short sessions and/or with friends to keep distracted –  an okay experience, but playing it solo for a prolonged duration of time at once is just dreadful.

PS My experience is based on playing with Prime Access which costs like new AAA game and cuts in half leveling and credits* grind, plus gives platinum** and credits. Can’t imagine what it’s like to play the f2p-way the first time around.

PPS and I haven’t even touched atrocious boss fights, forsaken Index and Archwing modes, unbalanced rewards, absolutely annoying radio transmissions, amateur voice acting, glitching matchmaking, ""convenient"" trading with other players, lack of creativity or imagination when it comes to new stuff, confusing crafting/mods etc. There are a lot of things wrong and no hint on something getting right anytime soon – only more new stuff added, making game more and more chaotic.

On my first weeks i literally learned all about the game from other random players. Community is really the strongest community of all the games I've seen.

One day, someone explained me abot raids like 30 min and than after i level up, he took me to the raids just for teaching me.

Story and Musics are epic, i dont want to give spoilers but after Witcher 3, thats the first time i got goose bumps while playing a game.

I play it for around ten hours and I get bored of it, again. But I must say I keep going back to Warframe. I don't know why? Maybe it is because of the great and fluid combat? The cool looking characters? or maybe the massive plethora of weapons? Anyway, I always return to it. And that has a reason. It is a good game! It's just THE GRIND and the repetitiveness of it all. As I said the combat is amazing and there are a lot of warframes and weapons. But not only that, The graphics look great, there are quite some planets to explore, you can customize everything (literally everything from your warframe, weapons and companions to your ship and your playstyle), you can make your own guild (with a dojo as base), easily play with friends thanks to the nice matchmaking system, there are multiple PVP modes and there are story missions that you can play. Overall a whole lot of fun things to do in warframe, which is why I do recommend it! The thing is to get all of these awesome warframes, weapons and companions, you have to go through a long proces of grinding missions over and over again. And when you finally get that nice looking gun, you can do it all over again to get the next one. This makes it very boring and repetitive after a short while.

but otherwise if you prefer cooperation, teamwork, friendship in work and being social rather than being competitive and special [b] I Do Really RECOMMEND You This Game [/b] (P.S : as long as you don't care much about Cosmetics or you just need to pay for faster customization.) 
The Most Interesting part of the game is Continuous Cooperation between you and your friends (if you've got and :D). but on the other hand the little disturbing fact is that if you haven't got much free time you'll find it Difficult to Achieve much in game [b] Unless you pay to Skip [/b] , but don't worry it's just pay for skipping and not winning, [b] Being not Pay 2 Win is a good feature of the game for Co-op Part [/b] , of course in the competitive part there is a part called [u] LUNARO [/u] that it's most likely similar to a kind Football, you don't need Equipment and weapons in this type of match, just some Athletic Spirit and a good teamwork (again but against other players this time and not the AI ;) ).

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]     
well in the end I summarize my Opinion in two sentences:
[b] 1- Play it if you've got good Friends (like me ;) ) and a good sense of cooperation and just enjoy how much the Teamwork matters in this game.
2- Don't Waste your time for Competition by Spending time instead of Money if you don't want to pay. [/b]
3-good for time killing with friends but not if you don't have the time cuz the game is so Grinding.

A thirty minute vid, I'm who you're obsessed with
You look like your sister is the girl that you have sex with
Uh, yeah, do you get the message?
On Twitter threaten rape, we should get this guy arrested
But I'm flexin'
Can you get these sheep out my mentions?
How can I be mad? Bitch, I sleep in a mansion
Try to hold me back but I keep on advancing
When I'm looking at his head, oou, that shit so gigantic
I’m coming still, bitch, my pocket’s full of hunnid’ bills
I’m in the hills, bitch, my song just did a hunnid' mil'
They tellin’ me to stop flexing but I’m stuntin' still
I ran it up, all of the sudden bitches wanna chill
Ayy, you done crawled out your little cave
You got a girl but I can tell that you a little gay
Somebody stop the school shooter he look filled with rage
Speak on my name, little bitch, I'll put you in the grave
In the Wraith, I see stars like I'm K.O.'d
Bitches chase me, I don't got no time to chase hoes
For this song, I was gonna make y'all wait though
But like H3 I had to let the weight go
I remember I was broke, I couldn't dress a lot
Came up from nothing, little bitch, that's why I flex a lot
How much money did this cost you? Better guess, a lot
Is this nerd ever getting pussy? Shit, I'm guessing not
Yeah, he used to get picked on, he a big nerd
He don't got no points, he confuses you with big words
He said he study me for months like a mid-term
Ayy, Content Cop, can you get up off my dick sir?
Yeah, I'm yellow and I'm fly, call me Big Bird
They tryna see me start to fall like September
Try to roast me in the comments but remember
How you gon' support a guy who proudly says the N-word?

[Chorus]
I ran it up fast, I feel like The Flash
You can see I'm getting mad, bringing up the past
H3 stop eating snacks, bitch you getting fat
Flew out PewDiePie just to fuck him in the ass
I ran it up fast, I feel like The Flash
You can see I'm getting mad, bringing up the past
H3 stop eating snacks, bitch you getting fat
Flew out PewDiePie just to fuck him in the ass

Hey, you can't do this, you gotta stop this instant
You don't own these streets, you can't just dance here
Wait, wait, who turned off the beat?
Boy, man, fuck a beat!

You're a stalker Ian, you think about me every night
He's definitely white, you might as well be Asian because you're obsessed with rice
Bill Gates face, body like a girl scout
Someone tell this angry Millhouse to take a couple pills and chill out before I knock his grill out
I cannot have it you little Mini Bob Saget
Get your fucking ass kicked
Why don't you buy yourself some thicker glasses
You look like Inspector Gadget
As far as that girl I trolled, sorry if that offended you
I guess I was on some other shit
But now I'm guilty yet again because I'm about to expose another bitch
You are a 27-year-old game nerd who roasts now 'cause dudes think he's cool
Or just lucky he's got this far in life without shooting up a school
Fuck with RiceGum and your life's done

~ Playing the game with friends.
~ Bouncing around the room and slaughtering mooks with my friends.
~ Playing Fashion-Frame.
~ Theory-crafting builds and testing out various weapons and styles
~ Monetization is 99% cosmetic and there is minimal ""Pay to Win"". Not to mention the ability to trade items for ""Platinum"", so even a new player, on a budget, can get a hold of the 'essentials' without too much trouble. The trade market is well established and is slowly becoming easier to navigate.

What is not fun is the constant hotfixing of lame-brained patches and content.
What is not fun is constantly getting half-baked ideas as patches.
What are not fun are the quests. Regular gameplay is fine. Boss fights and quests and anything 'fancy' tends to be a crap-shoot of a mess.
What is not fun is ""fuck you"" game design. Stalker, Sentients, invulnerable Eximus, etc.

I want to give this a poor review, but the early to mid game is a lot of fun, especially if you have a good group of friends to play with. The late game, though, is a constant grind. I became rather jaded with Digital Extremes, in time, as they simply failed to put out content (that was rolling down the hype-tracks like a bullet-hype-train) that felt appropriate for Warframe.

1200 hours on record as of writing this. It was good enough for 1200 hours. 

Yes. I would recomend trying it.

Why? Because it is free to play, and I got 1200 hours out of it. The math there was pretty easy. Hell I quit playing because I didn't like the direction it was going. I am still going to recomend it - 1200 hours, free to play.

Getting that content...requires micro-transactions, of course, the company who makes this couldn't just survive on air alone...

PROS:
+Space Ninjas and parkour. This is one of the best places to play with that.
+Aesthetic. It has a really good feel to the whole ""Tenno war"", I am forced to play on low settings, and it's still stunning.
+Variety, guns, bows, melee weapons, you name it, they got lots.
+Neutral community, haven't had any bad experiences yet...
+Tradings cards and achievements
+Discreet launcher, you won't even know it's there!
+Co-op
+Twirly sparkle  moves, I don't know how else to name the moves that you activate to do cool things for high damage, this and graphics are the good stuff
+Crafting, simple, easy, combine it with having to go hunting for it on worlds, while fighting armies.
+Enemy variety, good thick assortments, each to their own clan, planet, sector, stations and encampments
+Maps are BIG, you gotta look at the mini-map, and look at your terrain to make sure you know where you're going, haven't got lost yet, this work very well. A true highlight of this game.
+You can customize your Tenno, ship, and pet, real damn nice. The Tenno you saw in the trailer and screenshots? Yeah, you can be those.
+Really smooth and flowing gameplay, you feel like a samurai slicing through water.

CONS:
-Micro-transactions.....I got 10 secondary credits left after getting a body skin :(

You have to be a major fan of the grind in order to truly enjoy this game. No matter how hard the grind gets though, you're always having fun and feeling like a badass because at its core, the gameplay is just fun. Warframe will have you feeling like a true space ninja right off the bat, with its fast paced third person shoot-em-up and hack-n-slash action.

Warframe is Digital Extremes' swan song. This is the game that has been in their dreams since as far back as 2005, and it shows. There's just so much love and support put into this game from the developers and they truly are devoted to making this game the best that it can be. There were so many times playing this game where I [i] THOUGHT [/i] I had experienced everything the game had to offer and then all of a sudden there would be this new level, gametype, enemy, feature, or whatever and it would blow my mind that there was just this much content in the game for free.

Pros:
[list]
    [*] Free to play, and you never have to pay a cent to progress, as long as you're patient.
    [*] TONS of depth and content
    [*] Really fun gameplay that not even your ADD can resist.
    [*] Super fun with friends
    [*] The game is pretty much never frustrating, but there's definitely tons of challenge for those seeking it.
    [*] PvE is the main focus.
    [*] Interesting and fresh form of progression system and gearing.
    [*] The newer quests are extremely fun and exciting, breathing more life into an already vibrant gameplay experience.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
    [*] A lot of waiting around for items to finish building. If you don't pay money for platnium, you'll have to wait several days for larger items to finish building, as well as adding rooms onto your clan Dojo.
    [*] The story and lore really take a backseat and aren't that interesting to me.
    [*] PvP and other game modes just don't have a lot of effect on the main game so there's not many reasons to venture into the other game modes. This is unfortunate because those modes are actually all fun, but underpopulated it seems.
    [*] Pretty steep learning curve when you are starting out. It's good to get help from a more experienced player and have them show you the ropes. There's a lot to learn in this complex game.

I am not a blind fanboy wich dosen't see the mistakes, but there are so little of them. I will get to the point. I play this game for aprox 2 years now and I really enjoy it.
     Playing as many roles made me like it. There are these ""WARFRAMES"" exo armours wich are controlled by Tenno through transference. There are many warframes, for example: Loki-stealth, Rhino-Tank, Nekros-grinding and Octavia/Saryn-DPS. The abillity of havng multiple BUILDS (mod set ups) is awsome. There are many mods to be had, each of them modifying weapons and warframe, creating play styles, this is one of the best things.
     The map in a mision is generated, from tiles, and is called tileset, always being someting else, this makes the repetitive feeling dissapear.
      There are many more good things in Warframe, but the best is being free to play, what I mean is that it is pay to win FASTER, but taking your time it is more then FREE, because the community is awsome, so is the game, even tho there are just 17 quests, they are all very entertaining.
      The bad thing of warframe is baiscally GRINDING, the ""prime"" stuff is vaultedafter some time
and this is kinda annoying, grinding for platinum (in gme curency) for buying them isn't nice, but still possible, but the worst grind ever is Hema.

Devs for some reason decided a while ago to start removing anything that was ""fun"" and not grindy, so no I can't recommend this game to anyone.
There are a ton of max lvl players, or lvl 18+ who sit around doing nothing no matter what, and the chat made for playing with other people always hosts negative, or players who have no interest in new players no matter what.

If you love grinding, no, don't get this game, because unless you're interested in using ""tricks"" or ""bugs"" to solo any of the endless modes, you won't be doing anything past quick endless missions, and that's the same as wasting a so called ""key"" for the higher maps, though you can also play the normal maps, for no real loot besides ""resources"" that you'll be using for crafting weapons and such. 
There are of course ""other"" things to do, like spend hours upon hours of grinding for rare items to sell for premium currency so you can join the ""fashionframe"", spending all your money on cosmetics so you can look cool like everyone else.

Is there anything redeeming? Not anymore no, anything that has been added has been kicked down into the dirt due to ""DE"", also known as the devs of this game for some reason thinking it was either overpowered, too easy or a third reason which makes even less sense.

AFK Farming? Impliment a broken AFK timer that completely nullifies any and all regen on your character until you press your dodge key.

A certain build requires very specific ""attributes"" to work but it makes you invincible and isn't fun to use all the time? Don't worry, DE's got you covered, completely change the character's abilities and attribute bonuses, that'll make everyone happy, right?

An ability can be upgraded to pull mob drops to you but still makes you build in a very specific way? Make the upgrade only affect the user, surely that'l lbe a good change, no one will dislike it!

I'm making it sound like it only affected characters, but even the weapons in the game suffer, and they suffer way too hard than you can possibly think, some weapons are just so insanely overpowered, some for a while, some have kept their spot for years, only beaten by newer versions of that weapon, and with this, some weapons are instantly thrown out of the window when some weapons hit the community, even with upgraded versions of the weapon the old ones are most likely thrown out on the spot.

Sure you can use any weapon you like, no one has the right to tell you to not use something just because another weapon is better, but if you aren't doing the damage you need to, and you want to play a tiny bit serious, you'll have to follow everyone else using the strong weapons and say goodbye to your ""cool"" or less popular weapons, no exceptions. 

The list goes on, to things that make even less sense, and even things that didn't make anything ""easy"" or ""stupid"" were changed because of DE's stupidity.
It's surprising this game isn't dead already, if you were here from the start, and still play, I feel very sorry for you.


Edit: I forgot to mention another big thing that completely ruined the game when I was talking about builds, multiple characters, or ""frames / warframes"" have been -completely- changed in how stats affect their abilities, meaning if you had a build from long ago that needed one set of mods, there's a big chance all those hours and items spent on getting the perfect ""build"" together will be completely wasted and you'll more or less have to do it all over. Never any compensation or at least a warning, I'm over 100% sure I'm not the only one that had to re-forma a few frames or discard it completely because of it. Sure, some playstyles or builds will always be good at one point and ""fall off"" or become much less effective at some point, but this was almost completely opposite of what you normally would use on certain characters before. Then there's the problem with mod points, either pay 20 ""premium currency"" for double mod points to upgrade your character with or save it for the prime version of the warframe, which will come, but might first come far in the future, leaving people with less time and money hanging around with characters unsuited for missions behind because they're saving that upgrade for the prime version.

also money paid currency is attainable by trading in game as well. so you can farm rares and trade for it as apposed to buying it.

honestly you have nothing to lose the gameplay is fun the comunity is helpful and the story is ever developing.

Even the ""grindy"" parts are not really that bad aside from being slightly repetitive. At least the maps are randomly generated to a point so it's not the exact same layout every single time you play a specific mission.

The worst part about this game is how long it takes things to ""build"" in your foundry. The minimum time to build something clocks in at 12 hours and the longest is 3 days or 72 hours. But this is real time, not play time so you can log out and come back later to find that your builds have continued while you were away.

Another negative point against Warframe is the fact that they limit the number of Frames/weapons/etc you can have at once unless you purchase extra slots with their real money currency they call platinum. It is entirely possible to acquire platinum from trading to other players if you have something they want, but this is still frustrating if you have bad luck in RNG to get the stuff people want to trade platinum for and that makes you have to go out and purchase your own platinum just so you can buy more slots to have more items. Speaking of RNG, that is the name of this game. It can be very nice to you, or it can be your worst enemy. Some things might come easily, while others will take forever to grind out. For example: each frame requires 3 parts to build before you can combine them with a blueprint. Most of these parts are acquired from a specific boss and that boss has a chance to drop one of the pieces you need out of a loot table that you can't see. They only drop one item per kill and it could be a frame part or it could be something else. You could get the 1st part and the second part on your first 2 runs, but then the 3rd part could refuse to drop for several runs after that. So basically what I am saying here is not to get discouraged. Keep trying and you will get what you are after eventually.

Other than those 2 points, I have not found this game to be annoying at all. I very much enjoy the mobility within missions to be able to get around however you choose. Be creative about how you tackle each mission. There are a lot of ways to do things and even after all the times I have run specific missions, I have found multiple ways that I never knew about before just because I decided to take my time and look around for alternatives to the ""straight path"". It is also refreshing how each and every frame feels completely different and can be played multiple ways depending on how you mod it. You want to play a stealth assassin that is never seen and can pick off foes from the shadows? You can do that. Want to be a tank that can shrug off rockets and heal yourself? You can do that too. Want to be a control master and force all the mobs to bend to your will? You can do that too. There is a very large community on youtube and other sites that will help you with suggestions and tips to help you wherever you are stuck.

Speaking of YouTube, I got into this game before I knew anything about it and that was a very rude awakening for me, so I went and found some beginner guides and now feel like I am a semi-pro at this game lol. The 2 YouTube guides I found the most helpful came from iFlynn and Tactical Potato. Both are very informative and funny to boot. I highly recommend checking out their beginner guides before you dip your toes in Warframe. This will give you a more confident feeling going in rather than feeling like you are fumbling around in the dark. Even if you are already in Warframe, I'd still suggest checking them out for the possibility that they might show something you might not have known before. :)",1488215088,1488215088,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Before I start, I know I dont have 500+ hours and I'm only MR6, but for the time I've played, this game has been an amazing work of art.
The scenes you'll find in this game are astounding, combat is pretty generic, but fun nonetheless. Enemies are fun to assassinate and snipe from across the map. Pushing away the hours of grinding really needed to get into the game, and (this is just my opinion folks who love this thing) the sometimes horrendous hacking from some of the factions, the weapon/frame crafting that takes awhile (and for those who dont have time for weekday playing, it gets kinda annoying), but I'd say the maps, lore, gameplay, and weapons way out the negatives.
Playing with friends is even better, cause you have a team you can trust, depending on how well you do that is.

A bad thing about Warframe -> people are lacking creativity. Most of the players seem to play like blind people, since almost every player is focused on ONE thing... Leveling up, and when they've reached the current max lvl they complain about a lack of content and nothing more to do...
Warframe is a game of customization, filled with opportunities to make every player fit in. Every weapon, Warframe, Archwing etc. can be good. People often seem to think that the prime/stalker weapons are the only thing to use, and that the ""how to mod: ____"" videos on YouTube is the only well working option to make a weapon good. But that is in most cases a big mistake from the players. Sure a starting mk.1 weapon is not as good as the prime one, and of cause there is nothing bad about getting modding inspiration from videos. The thing is, if you put enough effort into a Weapon/Warframe/Archwing/Companion, then that might just work just as good. Why try to make the Ignis good, if you don't like the way it's shooting, why not go for an old school Burston if that's what you prefer?

A lot of people seem to only focus on those things: ranking up and getting good loadouts. It's like people seem to forget what the game is trying to offer you. Try to do something different if you don't like the game. Join a clan, do some Archwing races, finish the quests, challenge yourself like how long can you defend the objective and even better, how long can your squard which you currently are chatting with, having a good time, laughing together about how stupid and yet addorable Clem is, defend the objective!

Don't be a douchebag and join a clan because they've got full research and no taxes. When you join a clan, think of it as you join a community, sure some clans are only out there because of the remaining items they need to reach max lvl.
Do yourself a favour and look for a clan with a great working community, it doesent have to be a big clan, it can be even more exiting to help a clan grow from the bottom, reqruit players, and experience how a community can be made from a single free to play game.

And don't come and say the game is pay to win, because it's not... As they added trading in Warframe, every player is able to get as much platinum as they want. The only thing they can't get without paying is the steam workshop items, and the prime access accessories.... But those are all cosmetics...

So... I don't often review a game but I couldn't help myself on this one.  Warframe is a MMO RPG Space Ninja gem.

I'm a cheapass.. it's true.  I'm a disabled pensioner with very little extra income to 'play' with so that was one of the reasons I first approached Warframe.  It is truly free to play.  You *could* play happily through every item, cosmetic or otherwise, every frame.. without paying a thing.  You would just have to spend a lot of time grinding prime parts and selling them for platinum (being the 'prime' currency of Warframe).

To be honest, after I spent over 300 hours in the game I was already prepared to blow $5 to get a little plat to speed up my progress after I received a 50% off plat deal on my daily reward.  To know that it helps developers keep working on Warframe is just a bonus ;)

I've currently spent almost 600 hours on this game and am not yet max rank which is great value for a game that's a few years old already.  It's primarily PVe with some PVP added on (the PVP needs work but it's passable).

Visually it's fantastic.. you get the odd glitch here and there which I usually have a good laugh over, screenshot and show friends.. but that's about it.  It performs great on my older i5 machine with geforce 670.  Smooth as silk... and speaking of smooth as silk.  

The movement system in the game is brilliant.  Being able to flip, spin, backflip, jump to amazing heights or distances.. grab onto walls, wall run.. I mean, if you want a game that encourages fluidity of movement then this is it!  I always feel so totally like a space ninja!

The warframes themselves are pretty well designed with a lot of aesthetic choices and fun abilities.  Some need a little balancing (ie. hydroid which is one of my favs needs an armour/survival upgrade at the very least) but overall... excellent.

Sound quality is top notch and very memorable at times.  The quests are actually really enjoyable for the most part... Second Dream and War Within were particular favourites of mine.

The community is also excellent.  I've played a lot of League of Legends and Counterstrike and other multiplayer games and at times they can be quite toxic.  In the time I've spent in Warframe I've enjoyed 99% of the interactions I've had with people.  A very genuine fun community.  I've even managed to find friends on here to play other games with :)

The developers are pretty in touch with the community.  They hold regular Twitch.tv streams with upcoming news and the forums are very active.

The only real cons of Warframe to me so far in my experience is that PVP can be a bit weak (it's amazing if you're with friends.. but otherwise can be a little frustrating as it varies for each player a little depending who's hosting amongst other factors) and for the major lack of good beginner tutorials.  (for example.. I knew about crouch jump.. but until rank 6 I didn't realise it actually could be 'aimed' as such in the direction of the mouse allowing for higher jumps).

If you're looking for a game that you can really have some fun with and make some new friends in I'd suggest giving Warframe a go.

Play nice and stay safe people :)  Good luck Tenno!",1488096016,1488096016,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

In game i am mastery rank 14, halfway to the top.
This game is pretty fun, got involved in around 2015 when i got my laptop (coming after tf2, l4d2, and terraria). Overall this game is my favorite third person shooter out there, but DE seems to have plotted a different course. 
Pros-
Space ninja
lots of guns and weapons
gunblades
beautiful artwork
i can run it at 30 fps 
ORDIS
trading lets you earn the premium currency
you get to make a tenno skoom
puppies later in the game

Cons-
Power creep (each new weapon/frame makes the older ones obsolete)
Hema research cost (SRSLY DE?)
hyper exclusive raid culture from what i've seen
Crit domination on meta
DE churns out new material instead of fixing old bugs
Helminth charger pet still needs reskin
banshee=bardframe?

If DE were to stop churning out ridiculously powerful weapons, and focus on fixing bugs (I'm looking at you, Nidus!), I'd be happy. Even make it a joke update, like the bug within or something like that (not very creative guy :P).

Warframe is a huge and awesome free to play MMORPG, it's more about COOP than MMO but nvm. One of the best combat system I have ever seen which success to combine contact, distance and magic (powers) all together with a good balance. You can choose your own style of fighting and switch to another by building another fighter with others powers/pros/cons and create a different combat style.

The possibilities are huge just like the missions which are almost randomly generated.
I regret just a little the progression, you don't really know what to do or where you go, the game give you a amongus playground without giving you real objectives (they exist but they don't point them) so sometimes you are a little bit lost or you stagne farming something instead of progressing.

Except that, the game is really great. Lot of updates & new stuff, devs look very invested.
Graphics are really great.

I have been playing Fashionframe on and off for about 2 years now. 


+   Since most of the game is PvE (90%) you dont have to worry about P2W, though you can get a top notch build if you are ready to spend some $$$.
+   Graphics are pretty good for a 4 year old game.
+   Community is helpful and active. Very few ragers and griefers since mostly mature playerbase.
+   Platinum ( ingame premium currency ) can be earned through a very active ingame trading market.


-   Get ready to grind, alot. 
-   P2P connection, no dedicated servers, and host migration issues are present.
-   Min/Maxing is very expensive if you dont have a lot of free time to grind for platinum. 
-   RNG, shitloads of RNG.

    It does not update through steam but rather its own launcher which sometimes has issues with speed. (not a con just an annoyance)   

    Overall a decent game which I can say is truly f2p in the sense that you can buy anything if you grind hard enough.

Warframe is basically a highly mobile third person shooter with powers.  It's also free to play where most in-game affecting stuff can either be bought or earned.  The only things you can't earn in-game, except through rare events like anniversaries or logging in for a hundred days, are inventory slots.

Now, I'd divide the game into two parts:  star chart and post-star chart.  The star chart is insanely fun to play through.  Granted, the new player experience is rough since so much isn't explained clearly, or not at all, in-game, pretty much forcing you to use the community (which is actually a pretty good one, IMO) or the off-site wiki.  For example, things it doesn't mention are that most regular Warframes drop from specific bosses, most weapon blueprints are market and clan tech rather than drops, and Prime stuff, which is upgraded regular stuff, comes from fissures.  There's also the early resource and credit grind being a big pain, especially without access to some of the planets that drop specific resources.  But get past that, as well as past the long craft times, and playing through the star chart and exploring the confusing and non-chronological storyline is great fun.

Then you clear everything and what's left?  Grinding.  For grind's sake.  I eventually got to the point where I started to wonder ""Why am I still grinding?  To what end?""  I could do most Sorties, solo even if I didn't feel like rushing.  Few enemies were challenging and the ones that are were the ones with bullcrap mechanics (hello Scorches if they've STILL not been fixed yet!)  Basically, it was grinding up incremental power to make me kill stuff faster, or get mastery rank points from leveling weapons and warframes I didn't care for, to kill stuff even faster when I was already killing stuff fine.  This game is fun when you go through a mission at a reasonable rate and the enemies are a reasonable threat:  not too squishy and weak and not too ridiculously OP or bullcrappy.   But in the end game, it's either one or the other and you're speedrunning because it's easy and boring and you just want the reward or you're speedrunning because holy crap this is bullcrap end it now.

So if it becomes that, why am I still recommending this?  Simple:  it's worth picking up for the Star Chart experience.  Early days are a pain, but the amount of fun playing the regular content is worthwhile.  Once you've seen and done all the non-repeatable stuff is when you should consider whether or not you enjoy replaying randomly generated missions with the same enemies over and over enough for the sake of it.  

I had a lot of fun with this, but I'm done.  I've probably put way too many hours in as is and I've bled this game dry of everything it has to offer me.  DE's decisions over the past few months have also left me doubtful for the future of the game (hello Hema and Nidus), especially since they seemed focused on rushing to new and shiny stuff while leaving a trail of broken and unpolished content in their wake since they aren't putting enough time into anything, so I don't ever see me coming back to this except to casually mess around.  But most of my time with the game was still fun, worthwhile, and I don't regret it.  

So, give the game a shot and get your fun out of it.  Just keep an eye on your wallet and how much time you're spending grinding.  And ignore the prime access and stuff, just wait for a 75% off platinum log-in reward if you want to dump money on the game.  I grabbed the $100 one for only $25 and, between that, trading for some more, and conservative spending and it lasted me through my entire excessive number of hours.",1487886431,1487914920,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you wanted something, all you had to do was devote a little time to farming it or pay money for it. I was a decent Mastery Rank when I quit. Enough to know that I'd done well with the time I spent. I would have highly recommended it back in the day. The lore is interesting and the weapons and warframes are very unique. Now, however, I'm telling you to pick a different game.

I recently created a new user and logged on. Now it's much more complicated and difficult to get anything you need. If you're up for a game that sucks the life out of you, this is perfect. You can't pick a weapon blueprint at random and know you'll get the materials in a couple hours. It could be a long time before you get to the planet that drops the resources requied. They've put a large number of warframe primes in the vault, which means you will never be able to build them ever again, unless the developers decide to put them back out for a bit.

Don't worry though, there are plenty of ""common"" warframes and ""rare"" ones out there that aren't primes. Of course, if you don't want to farm or brave the in-game economy, you can just pay more than a full game's price for a prime. No big deal there.

The community is great. It's fun to send enemies flying with explosions, pin them to the walls with bows, or just shred them with some AR you picked up and hopefully were far enough along in the game to not have to buy platinum to obtain it.

I first played this game when it came out some time ago and back then it felt like a genuine game. The combat was fun, gruesome, and all-around it felt like there was a huge variety of things to do in the world itself. You could sit down for an entire day and just play the game and unlock all the systems, do some quests, and maybe during that time you found some warframe parts you could make and everything was awesome. At first it did seem really grind-y and that was really the only part that threw me off plus the fact I had to wait 4 days for a new warframe, but that was mostly it. I stopped playing for a while, played it senior year of highschool, and when I came back I did't even recognize the game I had once loved.

The new system for doing side-quests to unlock planets/systems was a horrid idea and never should have seen the light of day. All 100+ hours I had put in before became meaningless and I had to start from scratch to get anywhere further in the game. But no, I couldn't do that, because somehow every weapon, Warframe, and Mod I had had been reset. Said fuck this, I'm making a new account. Probably the worst decision I had made. The new grind for everything was SO ATROCIOUSLY BORING I couldn't play the game for more than 1 hr at a time. I kept logging on every day to get my daily reward, grind some more, build some shitty weapon, level it up, log off, and do the same thing over and over again for over a month. The bosses don't even feel unique or satisfying to battle anymore. Theyre just another enemy you need to kill to POSSIBLY get a part that you need for something but then you gotta fighr them 12+ more times just to get the same part 6 more times over. The RNG in it is so infuriating I couldn't help but buy platinum just so I could play the game the way I wanted to play it.

And to make matters worse, all the new content is just terrible. Nothing feels unique anymore, nothing feels special or really satisfying to use, it's just all numbers ona screen that let you know how much faster you can farm. Even getting all the new content is nigh impossible because you need to do 1,000,000 things before it to even think about getting any of it becuase the new pre-requisites for getting anything in this game is just complete utter BS. For anyone new looking to get the cool new weapon that they really want to see in action, nope, sorry, play 400+ hours and you'll maybe get it.

As you can see, I've played over 300 hours in this game and have nothing much to show for it and honestly, I wish I could buy my time back that I wasted on this game.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME PLAYING THIS GAME.
Go do something, literally anyting else. Go even play ARK Survival Evolved or run around for 7 hours in DayZ. The communitty for this game is dying and everyone knows it.


TLDR; This game is hard for beginners, is really grindy, and takes lots of time and effort to really get anywhere in the game itself. Also the pre-requisite system is BS

I began my journey as a lowly console player with 30 frames per second and terrible resolution in a completely different game. Now, on PC and after years of development, I have to say I'm very impressed with the sheer amount of improvement. 

The combat is very fluid and easy to master, but each weapon has little nuances that will improve your efficiency as you use them more. And there is endless variety in the weapon selections. From a bow that can cleave enemies in two, to a jet powered hammer that will send enemies flying. Each melee weapon has multiple stances that will change the way you wield it and what sort of combos can be achieved with it. Furthermore, each warframe has 4 unique abilities, and most have augments that will change their effects in some way. 

The movement system when I started was clunky and awkward (maybe just because I was on console), but since the Movement 2.0 update, everything flows together nicely. The movement system seamlessly integrates with the combat to create a fast paced and high flying experience, but also encourages you to move slowly and stealthily in certian missions.

Now on to the grind. I once thought that grinding in this game was terrible, slow, and not rewarding enough. Then I realized that I was missing out on the cooperation. Simply playing with a squad will increase your gain of resources dramatically. I left a 20 minute mission yesterday with 1000 Endo (The resource used to improve mods), which more than enough to improve many mods to max rank. I recommend joining a clan as soon as possible and asking your new clanmates for help.

Which brings me to my next point. The community is wonderful. I had been farming for an essential mod, but had no luck getting it. So I took to the chat and voiced my complaints about my bad luck. Within seconds I had almost 20 people offering to give me the mod for free! People are always willing to help or answer questions you might have. Anything from helping you aquire the resources you need, beat a challenging mission, all the way up to forming groups to take on the Sortie's (High level missions with big rewards).

Overall, this is a completely different game than it was when I first started playing. I would argue that it has done nothing but improve. Some people complain about the grind and feel that they need to spend money in order to get the items they want, but simply asking for help from the community can expedite your process greatly. 

If you decide to play Warframe, come in with a willingness to learn, because there are thousands of things to do and millions of enemies to slaughter.

***This is a RANT more than a REVIEW, so if you really care about my view of the current state of the game, then keep reading.*** 

Here's for the folks that care why I don't recommend this.
1) Devs have turned into a bunch of milk drinkers(greedy/money-grabbers)
2) By word of mouth, Community is toxic and full of fanboys/girls who and white knights
3) Digital Extremes(the developer) reinforce this toxicity by removing all who speak the ill truth of them
*Note: Look up RevxDev on Youtube. He has made bunch of videos trying to do this because of an shady account ban.*
4) All games have a grind. This is too much.
*This is covered with shiny graphics, fast gameplay, and dazzling mechanics. You're better off putting your face on a belt-sander for a better grind.*
5) No proper endgame. Enemy scaling is terrible- they become damage sponges at higher levels.
6) DE owns your account, so no matter how much money you throw at them, once you do something wrong, they can just cut that string that binds you to them.

For a game to be out for at least 3 years, things are bound to go downhill. Let me be straightforward with you. Don't let my hours played fool you. Ive played this game enough and seen all the changes this game has made almost from the start. I should have stopped playing the first few hours I played because I wasnt having any fun at all. It wasnt until a veteran player pretty much showed me cheesing for the first time because the let me leech Exp that I had motivation to play simply because I wanted to be just like that guy who helped me. At this point, my view on this game is this: a snowball rolling downhill, that is actually a turd where is just a pile of crap that DE keeps rolling down that hill. This is no ordinary turd ball you find from a dung beetle. No, this is plated with gold and labeled ""Prime"". Each hotfix/patch/update DE comes out with just makes it 1 more GB to download for new players, and it is painful to wait through with a slow connection. When I speak of things ""Prime"" I mean that most of these items are much better than the original item with slight stat changes. Also, everytime they come out with a new set,  only ONE item of 3-4 are worth using and the rest is to raise your Mastery Rank which is your player level. And this Mastery Rank is mostly irrelevant to 98% of the game. The other 2% is that all weapons are locked behind this. Sadly, you can't use these weapons efficiently if you dont have any or the right mods to make a build for it, which is another thing too grind for. Man, I could go on for a lot more things, but this has become nitpicking. The final thing I want to say is this: Most developers will come out with an update with NEW things rather than putting time to fix the old and broken things simply because of making money. I simply wanted them to improve the current game instead of creating more content which brings more bugs to fix. If youve read this far and you're someone who's been paying attention to all the things hapenning the past 1-2 years, you can definitely see that it is waning.

I usually have an urge to write a short review on this game every few hundred hours I spend in it but usually give up because I get angry at words...Well my inadequacy to accurately portray what I feel about this game.

Seeing that steam shows how many hours I logged on in this game I'm err no stranger to it I suppose. I've been playing this game on and off since around update 7. I started literally on the cusp of closed beta, the week it went into open beta, and fuck me for not logging on that weekend and getting my vandal items (this sort of behavior ends up problematic as you will undoubtedly understand as you read on).

There isn't really a neutral button for this game. I can't in my right fucking mind recommend this to general public, but obviously there is something to it otherwise I wouldn't have logged few thousand hours into it (its more than what steam says, game had its own thing before steam). Anyway for new players. If you are going in and you aren't very social, you will either get really frustrated with this game, or you will spend more money on it than you could probably find sensible. I've spent a great deal of money on this game, to support it because I felt it was worth it, and I sure as hell got my money's worth, I also get a shiny Excalibur variant people can't get anymore.... That being said, this game is NOT new player friendly. No it isn't eve online level of harsh, but unless you have people helping you a great deal at the start you are going to have a very bad time, unless you absolutely love grinding until your eyeballs bleed out. For majority of established playerbase when new content comes out, it isn't too overwhelming to get it by free means. Even if it is grinding intensive if you stockpiled on something you can sell or trade you can usually acquire it without much fuss. If you are in there with nothing and plan on getting somewhere solo, you are in for a bad day.

Deep breath. Game is complex. You 'can' haphazardly hop in shoot and mod stuff on a whim, but when it comes to the harder content you will end up annoying those who might need you to contribute, or you simply won't be doing the very end content at all. Now even the hardest content in the game is relatively easy, but only when you understand the game mechanics and apply the knowledge accordingly. You might as well bookmark the wiki and have it up on all times fo reference. You will need it, be it too look up damage values, resistances, builds, or find out what drops where. Now here I'm talking high end content. If you are new you have one HELL of a ladder to climb to do it, and most of it will be dumb shit like leveling mods, getting mods, getting mastery rank to be able to equip weapons, and so forth. Usually really tedious crap.

As a newcommer you have three options. If you plan to trek it solo you can either grind your eyeballs out, and do minimal amount with other people for when you have to (some sorties like interception or so), you can dive in the community and hope to find folks who can help you (plenty of them btw, don't be discouraged), or if you have a friend with an established account have them bring you up to speed. When you have someone to help you, it will save you months of work. I'm not kidding. I gave my friends maxed mods like Serration or Redirection, which to a new player is a damn tall order to have. As well supplied them with spare nightmare/corrupted mods which can take time. Or give them some spare prime set of a warframe I have stocked etc. In short having a friend who is willing to help you bring you up to speed will help with the biggest shortcoming this game has. The eye gouging tedious grind. It's always gonna be there, but thankfully the core game is fun. Shooting shit is awesome, melee mechanics are satisfying as all hell, and when you get your hands on top tier gun (like say Tigris Prime) you will laugh maniacly as you chunk lv 100 assholes by the hundreds and thousands.

So far I said very little on the actual game itself. In short it is simple. It's mission based co-op game. Each mission is usually randomly generated level with pre-set tiles (like diablo esque games are). With exception of defense type missions, where map is always gonna end up the same with several variants. You either play solo or with up to 4 people(Raid missions are up to 8 people, and are generally pretty fun to play). Enemies are usually plenty, either endlessly spawning, on a timer or numbered. You have one primary weapon,one secondary and melee. Each warframe gets four unique active abilities, and its own stats, bonuses etc. Here you go.It's simple, controls are tight and responsive, guns feel amazing, melee feels amazing, sense of power you can get is overwhelming at times, but you will work to get it. Everything will take time in this game. Learn to try to do multiple things at the same time. If you are farming for something, try to level something at the same time, and so forth.

This is a free to play title. So question is, is the 'free' part fair. Err yes, and no. For a new player I'd say you have months of work ahead if you wanna be up to speed, or at least on the current edge of things. For current players, absolutely. While DE does do unreasonable crap from time to time, they usually get it right and I don't have *too* many complaints. There are 'timed' exclusive content this game has. Bunch of it usually repeats (eventually), but time windows for some things tend to be tight. So say there is an event at one weekend, and you are too busy geting wasted in Vegas, your options are either trade for the item (and the warframe trading is no simple thing, economy exists in this game like many others like it), or you can hope the item gets reintroduced in the game at a later point. In very rare cases it doesn't (like Excalibur Prime).

In my case the game caused some compulsive hoarding behavior. New prime frame? I need to have it, because at some point it's gonna be taken out of circulation. New prime weapon? Oh snap it's amazing, I need it? New Stance? New Mods? Next thing I know I'm putting cosmetics on my warframes and playing fashionframe. Every few months I have to stop playing and hold off for a year or so since I feel it might be detrimental to my mental health.

IF you do end up spending money on it. Try to wait for a coupon that you get with daily login rewards. They can go up to 75% (but those are rare). I don't know what steam packages have but I recommend buying PURE platinum from their store. There are very few things platinum can't get you in this game. Anyway with this platinum DO NOT buy shit from the ingame store. Unless it's cosmetics, potatoes or slots. If you need a warframe, or a mod, or whatever, look to trade for it. If you have platinum everyone and their mother will message you for the trade. You can get any prime weapon and frame with platinum (well save for Excalibur Prime and few things that came with that). Some will be very pricey because they have been out of circulation for a long time, but you will find savvy trading with platinum will get you FAR. Another advice, trading to get platinum is also recommended. When you are in position to stockpile stuff (like prime parts or mods), You can trade for platinum and use that platinum to trade for what you want. It ends up being it's own little game within a game.

Anyway, game is free. Check out the gameplay and see if you like it. There is no harm trying it. On the technical end of things, game is sharp and well made. It's fast, responsive and empowering. On mental health side of things, it might be problematic. I come back after a year and the game gives me a sentinel mod for my first Riven mod. Such a nice middle finger welcome back present.

This can all be ruined by your view on grinding and sometimes absolutely horrible design in some quests.

This game is my all time favorite. If you like ninjas in space, fighting, slashing and dashing, with amazing graphics and animations, then it's for you. The game has everything: great graphics, action all the way, amazing music and of course the incredible storyline. Although it's not a mmo in the traditional way, there's still a lot going on. The game is being constantly updated and fixed, you can also expect new content every month. People who love grinding and farming for weapons or warframes will love this game. There is a ton of customization for your warframes and weapons, too. It's a game that you have to give a shot, at least play through the first main quest of the game, because that's what really makes the game so special and makes you love it even more. That's at least how I got hooked, because the story is fantastic. If you ask if it's p2w, it's not. The only thing you really need to spend your money on are the cosmetics. I think a lot of players would agree with me. The game is perfect for beginners, because you have a lot to do, and I mean A LOT. The only downside is the endgame, because nobody really knows what it is or what it will be in the future, for me it is fashion, making your frames look badass, others like raids or sorties, which are daily quests that reward you with a lot of stuff. If you want a game that has a lot of action in it, just go for it. You won't be disappointed. 

To sum up: 

Pros: Fast-paced
         Beautiful graphics
         Not p2w
         Awesome lore and storyline
         Constantly updated, new content every month

Cons: What should I do in the endgame? (A question always being asked)

If you want more information or need any help, just add me in-game: Djonibigud

Nearly 1.5k hours in (some of it was logged before it was added to Steam) and I feel like its finally time to write a review.

I've been with DE/Warframe since the very, very early beta, and god damn they have come far. I am so proud of them as a developer, actively listening to the community and constantly updating the game with new features and eye candy to spend your hard (bought) platinum on. Of course, its not all sunshine and kubrows. There have been a few 'questionable' choices made to the game, but with community feedback (totally not screaming and cursing on the forums) and hard work, 99% of the nonsense has been fixed. The game it has become is barely recognizable from when I first started playing, and thats a good thing. 

The business model is absolutely fair, you don't have to buy a single thing at all (apart from Tennogen fan created skins, which are purely cosmetic). You can instantly unlock in-game items and cosmetics with 'Platinum' which is bought with real (Steam) money, but you can also obtain that in game for free, albeit more slowly. There is a daily chance to get a 20%, 50% and 75% discount though, which is quite frankly amazing. Some people will argue and say that the farming is ridiculous, but it really isn't. Once you have max level gear, which takes about 2 hours give or take, you can do almost anything, farm anywhere and get as many resources as you need. My only qualm would be the things you can only get from time-limited alerts (Nitain Extracts, Vauban, etc.) but if you play, they will appear more often than you think.

At the end of the day, I don't regret a single dollar or hour I have spent on this game.  I actually wish I had've spent more at the start to get Excalibur Prime, who was only available for beta players that pledged a certain amount, kinda like a Kickstarter. I can see myself playing this for many, many more years and I can't wait to see what DE have planned in the future.

Registered loser, signing off.

(P.S: If you're one of those absolute knob goblins that has over 300 hours on this game and then gives it a bad review, just delete Steam and re-evaluate your life. If its taken you that long to realize you don't enjoy it because ""the grinding is too hard"" or ""prime access is stupid"", you might want to go and get your head checked.)",1487319386,1487319610,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have seen people complain about it being pay to win, that it is grindy, and there is not much variation in gameplay.  This game is not perfect, and if you're looking for a perfect game, go screw yourself. You will literally NEVER find a perfect game.  This game very much does have its flaws, but despite those flaws I still really enjoy playing this game.  It is not a pay to win. You can get everything in game if you are willing to put in the work, but this does mean you will have to grind.  Each weapon and Warframe has its own feel and playstyle, so people that complain about it lacking variety are just using the surface mechanics of the game.  There is PvP for those of you that enjoy it, it isn't perfect, and I prefer the PvE, but that's just me. But if you play this game and focus on the mechanics of play, you are missing a large portion of the game. There isn't much in terms of story, and for most people that is fine, but the lore runs deep, and the story, for what little there is, is spread amongst several important NPC's as well as the Tenno. This is a great example of throw some vauge stuff against the wall and let the player's minds fill in the blanks working.  But even that is not what keeps me coming back day after day.  I have made friends playing this game, and the community will welcome anyone who needs help with open arms.  There are a few people that ""forget"" that they communicate with other people, but every game does. When you first find that person that you just click with in play, and then you get into a clan and all of a sudden you have people that care if you are having fun and what your in game goals are.  The majority of the people I have met playing this game still don't know anything about my life, but they are there if I come in and play more aggressivly. And they will know that something is wrong.

Still worth your time and you’ll get some fun experiences and moments out of it. 

Long version: I don’t like usually playing online but this game intrigued me enough from some videos and looked cool plus I can play solo. I will say the learning curve and experience was quite the challenge. A LOT of game mechanics and other items were not explained or mentioned in the tutorial like Mod Fusion and it took wiki searches and youtube videos to figure out aspects of the game. Also after the tutorial was done I didn’t know quite what to do or if this was just a system of open gaming that I’m not used to.

The combat is fantastic. Weapons have different feels to them, and different characteristics. You can combo different movement and melee strikes to perform multiple and different attacks which especially with a stance can be a great pleasure to watch and experience (Nothing like smashing everything with a mace or spinning around slicing up foes with dual swords).

Also for a good portion of the missions while the objectives are simple you can decide if you want to go stealth or with guns blazing or a combination of the two. Most mission objectives involve you killing enemies and performing variations of tasks such as taking a component to specific locations, protecting points on the map or eliminating targets. You can decide how you want to approach a mission depending on your warframe choice. 

There is also a flight mode called Archwing which is neat but is not as polished as the rest of game and doesn’t get updated very often. The missions and alerts are far in between and would like to see this updated and expanded as it shows promise.

The games sense of progression is decent as you can accomplish a fair amount if you sink in the time with getting new upgrades to customize your warframes, weapons and companion units. There are also quests and some lore options they added to help you explore the universe that reward exploration. 

Almost everything in the game you can get for free if you put in the time. Warframes, weapons, companions, mods everything. The only thing that you’ll need to pay for are cosmetics, or community made content. It can take a LONG time to get a warframe depending on the one you want so be sure to look up where you need to get parts for it via the wiki. Otherwise if you really want it now you can just buy it outright. 

My griefs about the game is that it can be bit repetitive with certain quests and missions asking you to perform similar to the same tasks over and over again. This can be frustrating if the task is a long one and you’re doing it solo. You can get far  on solo but there are some modes and quests that are better with a team. Often you’ll have dome something 3 times to get the reward or the option to build the reward wether it be a weapon, a component or a quest item. I feel like the Titania Quest was the best compromise on this and while it had repetitive tasks I always got the sense of progression instead of being stopped doing the same mission over and over to get a part or a blueprint. 

I’ve recently slowed down my play and actually taking a break from it. Which after the amount of hours and a 1 year for a free to play game is actually really solid. The developers are always updating and applying fixes so I easily see myself coming back for the new content. They have greatly improved the new player experience so the issues I mentioned earlier have been made easier for players to understand and more obvious.  

I would say if the game looks cool to you and fun, it is and it is worth your time. Even if after first quest or couple of planets is all you play the environments and levels are fantastic (Uranus I think has the best in terms of level eye candy and reminds me of  Bioshock). They’ve added a LOT more content to the game since I started so as this continues this game has a greater and greater value especially for the price of a free online account.

-----------------------
On a serious note, this is one of the best free to play games I have ever played. You can aquire everything in the game (including Platinum) without spending any real money at all. The platinum you purchase with real money can get your access to certain items in a shorter amount of time, but by no means is it necessary.

My only suggestion for the game is a little more information from the game itself about the various currencies, mods, junctions, relics, mission types, etc. New players are often very lost as to what to do, or where to go or even how to do it. I also feel like the Raptor boss on Europa is too difficult for players when they first meet it. They have no easy access to plastids, and often are only Mastery Rank 4-6. It is a huge steep curve in difficulty, that only rockets back down to the same consistency the player is used to as you progress onto Saturn and beyond.

Otherwise give this game a try, play solo or in public matchmaking. Even better if you have some friends to play with.

When just beginning it is very fun, but as you get to higher levels you have to grind so damn much for anything, it is ridiculous. It will take you about 3 days to craft a warframe, even when you start every part right after the other part finishes. And if you want to not play free 2 play, it is expensive.

It's played in third person as a Tenno which in the furture of space travel are known to be ninjas. These assassins have unique skills and movements according to the mods they have installed in their suits and weapons. After playing this game for about 100 hours I realized that even when knowing where to go and what to do you are still expected to be agile and skillful in everything you do in order to complete missions. A game of this caliber is not for the feint of heart. Dismemberments are often and the life of a tenno is sometimes cut short to incoming rockets or shadow assassins. The boss fights make this game quite memorable and hunted. If you were looking to pour in atleast 200$ into some of the packs and checking the trade chat regularly for cheap prices you will get all the end game items in no time.

Pros:
Great and friendly community
Great custimization
Amazing class selection
Story is deep, but it does take a while for you to unravel it which is a good thing because it builds suspense
You get animals as companions along with Sentinels (drones)
Massive loot drops during Suvival, Defense and Extraction missions

Cons:
If something goes wrong with your DX11 like mine did, your FPS will literally hover around 5 or below so that would require you to delete everything in the games folder and then redownloading it
Some tedious work to get what you need, but it isn't all that bad as long as you can find some joy in farming whether it be with a friend or other players
Voice chat does work, but not everyone uses it in game

Other than the Cons that I listed, I don't really know what else to really say. This game is great and I do highly recommend you at least try it. Put about 20 hours or so and at least get to Mercury to you can begin to unravel the story a little. Take my advice, don't judge the game by the first few planets when things are JUST starting out. Things, as all other games usually, get a lot better once you can make it to Merury/Mars and onward.

all wepons are not terrible they can be modded which is basically upgrade with card to make them a weapon of mass disctructions meaning the start weps if modded right can be used far into the game and still be good 
many different warframes(classes kinda) too choose fits steath players and more agreesive or support players everyone got a warframe for them
however there are draw back to customize your character you need to pay plat no way to get that unless daily log in or trade but you need to be a more ""experence"" higher  wealth player to get anywhere in trade.
also the inventory systsem really f*cks you up you will find yourself selling weps to make space and the customization i will add is terrible like 3 shades of red blue and green no black or purple the colors really dont get you started anywhere in cuztomization and the grinding sighs but still its a great game",1486874028,1486874028,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

1) This game is truly F2P, But it demand's your time and your playtime agaist money AKA grind, if you don't like it, don't play  it.
2) This game have a premium currency called platinum, you can buy fashions and slots upgrades, this currency is farmable (WHAT!?!?!?!) yes, you can sell items dropped in game for Platinums. I have almost everything the shop have to offfer and didn't spent a dime to gain it, when i had everything, i recharged 20 euro, becuase it's a fair game. and will recharge more.

Gameplay: This game focus only on one thing, You need to be cool cutting enemies to pieces, the movement system is so mobile you need to call it Parkour, you can move on wall, larch on it, make absurd jumps of 20+meters and so on, it's a 3D movement system, like a space ninja. 
Every weapons can be modified whatever u want be it in color, be it effects, the Mod system is a system of ""cards"" that permit you to add everything you can think of to a weapon. Everything. Really.
The melee system is cool and engaging.

Graphics: It's a free-to-play with a graphic that make many AAA titles pale. Warframe have one of the most cool graphic you will see. This is a promise.

FashionFrame: yeah it needs a different category, because the premium currency is farmable many consider the fashion part of this game A PART of the endgame. You have 5 diffent pattern to color your warframe (the ""armor"" or ""char"" u use, u can switch it whenever u want), each pattern can be colored in one of the 1100 COLORS....yeah. But it's not over, you can color the fashion attachment, the fashion armor, the fashion syndana...., 
u can color the primary section of the weapons (Rifle,granade launcher, sawlaunchers) in 5 different pattern.
U can color the secondary section of the weapons (Pistols, gas pistols, sawbarrelshotguns) in 5 different pattern.
U can color you melee ( Rapier, hammer,katana,axe and shield, scissor sword and whip) in 5 different pattern+sugatra (colorable)
U can color you companion be a sentinel (small robot floating near you), Kubrow (space dog with different races and perks), Kavats (space cats with different races and perks) every companion can be fur/skin colored and have a armor/attachment to color too.
You can personalize everything in this game. Gratis, But again they demand you Your time. So grind and be cool.

Leveling system:
In warframe you have 2 types of levels.
MR: Mastery Rank, you gain points by leveling weapons and gears in general the first time. MR unlock access to weapons and daily trades.
Weapons/warframe rank: you gain levels with affinity (in combat, aka exp), every level give you points you can use to upgrade said gearwith the mod system greatly enhanching the effectiveness.

Community: Warframe community is Vocal, Whiny, Helpful, Good and bad, but NOT toxic. Like you wife. Usually you will see someone whine ""there is nothing to do"" when he reach 1500-2000 hours of gameplay...yeah.

Overall is a must try game, if you like the grind (because it's a likeable grind for many, for me it's grind nonetheless).
And it's free.
9.5/10
You will encouter bugs, they add content costantly and weekly so there will always be bugs, accept it and report it. They balance everything so they can nerf or buff things you own, you need to accept it.

Though the beginning of the game can seem really slow, the game is great, it does consume a bit of time so I would reccomend playing this if you have a lot of time. I made my account back when Loki was still a starting frame but he got replaced with Volt now (dont pick him please) this game is better with friends, as most multiplayer games are. The community is USUALLY pretty ok, have run into a few toxic kids but not that bad, nothing I haven't dealt with on League of Legends. The community is always more than willing to help new players, some are even nice enough to give you free stuff. Though the game has a very sudden difficulty curve that hits you like a truck, you get used to it when it first happens. Great story as well, if you follow the story of this game its actually really interesting and kinda bad ass.

There are a few cons to this game though. As I have already stated, the beginning is slow AS HELL you will most likely be playing your starting frame for about a week unless you no life the game like how my friend has been lately and hes now more geared than I am. Endgame is kinda non existant, after you finish all the quests, you will be sitting in trade chat trying to make free plat so you can make your frame look cool cuz endgame is just fashion frame and get the best gear so you can stroke your ego about how much better you are than other players at carrying new guys. So when you get to endgame you wait for the next big quest patch to come out and then just Kuva farm and do Sorties. Thats it. 

Even though endgame is meh, this is easily one of the best F2P games I have played.

Well, to start off, a few years back, DE was quite known for hearing out the community and offering good support to their players, offering us interesting quests, frames, a very pleaseant player base abd other features, however, around 2016, things has started to.....change, to start off, the new relic system......while it allows us to tip the odds a tiny bit to our favor, I didn't quite agree with it being an effective solution to reduce the grinding, being pretty much the key system with pretty much increased grinding due to the void fissure farming, not only that, but the feature to only get rewards if you bring a relic is in theory a good idea, it starts to make it harder to find a good party to play casually, back with keys, you could choose between a keyshare or just a relaxing void run with randoms who needed help, the prime part just being a bonus, now? It's almost Impossible for me to go on a multiplayer Void run without being pestered to bring a certain relic with the current meta weapon, what was that? Play with friends? Oh, I would love to.........if they hadn't stopped playing for the exact reason that troubles me now, clan mates? Not an option either, the veterans all quit after these last few updates. In theory, this system would also makes things cheaper, right? I mean, prime parts would sell for cheaper between players, and everything would be merry forever and ever right...? Well, sadly not so much, ever since the relic system was impanted, the prices for the prime weapons sure decreased, but for some reason many greedy players seem to have taken some interest in the market and overpricing things, in an effort to ensnare a helpless newby who just started......that and since the increased power creep, it is quite hard to sell or find an item for a reasonable price, earning platinum for that shiny new Valkyr Prime...? Well, good luck with either the farming with void fissures & relics, or earning the 160 - 200 platinum you need for it....that is, if someone doesn't charge you way more than that, speaking of newer prime frames, its resource requirements compared to the older frames simply don't stand, while back then the worst we could face was, for instance, getting 600 of a somewhat rare lightweight material (oxium) and 2000 of those resources that comes in clusters (e.g.: Polymer bundles), now? well, I hope you are ready to farm the 20 nitain (a resource only found on alerts, which are some sort of ""event"" missions, which usually are tedious and only come 1 each!), over 6000 of oxium, and more for a frame called Vauban Prime. Want that shiny Valkyr Prime to have a better looking Valkyr or a slightly more powerful version? Well, while not as absurd as the previously mentioned Vauban prime, I hope you are ready to spend some hours farming polymer bundles without buying (or dropping if you're lucky) a resource booster (you need 15000 to build one, and usually each run without the mentioned annoying players, nets you around 3000 bundles per run........in a survival mission where you most likely will spend 20 or more minutes at least before leaving). Sure, some players complained to DE about the absurd farming or resource cost (Hema research and Mutagen sample drop, anyone?) and while I'm NOT interested on the new meta, I find it ridiculous the clear lies regarding reduced grinding they promissed the players, while ignoring the players that are unhappy with it or any other features (for instance, the Frost Deluxe skin, which DE changed slightly and made many players who bought it before the change unhappy, or the Tennogen Syandana, Sari, where many loved their open wings design all the time and folding when shooting or looking the menu, and yes, while they now stay open in the liset,dojos or relays, they stay closed within a mission, which makes it look unimpressive and almost the same as the other capes, taking away its charm), all things considered, Warframe IS a good game with potential, that is if the developers start hearing out their players like before and stop presenting us with solutions that do nothing to fix the problem, unless that happens, I suggest you to stay away from this game for now.

The dev time is excellent at making strides forward with Warframe. Something that impresses me alot is how they keep working on improving their current content while they make new content.  Whether they are polishing and improving the graphics, or sound, or reworking boss fights and making them more interesting, it seems like they work hard to improve what they have instead of ONLY focusing on new content.  The Dev's are VERY open too in their streams, discussing much of what they are working on.

This is my favorite free to play game, and if some other game catches my interest I always find my way back to Warframe and getting back into it.  The in game store doesn't feel pay to win AT ALL, especially since the best versions of things are recieved from farming (or buying off of other people).  The only thing you might have difficulty with if you choose not to spend any money, are extra Warframe and Weapon slots.  But there are ways that you can get items to sell players that will allow you to open up more slots, so you don't have to spend any real money if you choose not to.

Besides the awesome dev team, another thing i like is that they have been doing a REALLY good job adding story to this game.  I remember when i first started to play it felt like any kind of story dropped off.  Now it is there and the story is GOOD!!! I LOVE where they are going with the story in this game, it's amazing!!!

First off, the game WILL take up space on your computer, so this isn't for the weak ones that crash easily either, and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this.

Second: this game is not something you can play for 8+ hours straight a day. Unless you have a clear objective of what it is you're gonna do when playing, be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards, missions, farming resources and prime items, etc. then you WILL get bored easily. I say this because of the hours I've wasted in indecision of what it is I wanted to do, and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on.

Third: Be prepared to grind the shit out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up. You will not get far simply blitzing through each mission, and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later. Do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding, they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous. That said, this leads me to my next point.

Fourth: this IS a genuine F2P, and although real currency CAN (not WILL) be used, it is not necessary to advance at all. Using platinum (this is the currency you do exchange your real money into) is completely optional, and there are multiple tips I'll give on the use of it for newcomers: 
1. Spending platinum is optional
2. don't use it on frivolous things like credits (the game's other currency that you can earn in any mission) or resources as it is NOT WORTH IT IN VALUE
3. save it for big purchases like colours, hard-to-obtain warframes or accessories. Trust me, you'll want to be stingy
4. There are ways of gaining plat WITHOUT spending real money, but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners. These items are called 'Prime' items, and hold onto as many as possible - you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them. Trade them as 'prime junk' with other items to gain platinum, just be patient when looking for partners. 

Finally, Each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use. buttons 1-4 on your keyboard activate them during missions. It took me ages to realise they were even there, so I figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you.

Its entirely up to you on how you play this, and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players, but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting. Or hell for the recovering ones, anyway. In short, good luck grinding the shit out of this game.",1486550561,1486550561,True,50,5,0.703905105590820313,1,True,False,False

You really dont need to buy any platnium from store for ingame bonus because once you get to like endgame builds and max warframes and you basically have them all you can farm weapons peices for people who are lower lvl and want to buy it with plat you can trade via trading chat. You can literally become a trader if you will.

Cons... the only issue i had was like how long it takes to build a warframes, Each peice takes 6 to 12 hours then to build whole warframes takes 3 days....

Here are a few positives and negatives in my opinion. 
[h1] Positives [/h1]
[*] There are a vast array of warframes (characters) to play as.
[*] There are always people willing to join you in missions
[*] It can be as easy or difficult as you like up to a point, you can test different weapons and frames as you please.
[*] There is always new content, game modes etc being added, It's hard to keep up.
[*] There is no need to buy in-game money (platinum) if you do not wish, farming for items you can exchange for platinum is relatively easy even at lower levels.
[*] Lots of weapons to play with, plenty of these can be ""End-Game"".
[*] It's just too much fun !

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
[*] Some changes made make life more difficult i.e The new Junction system makes travelling across planets more burdensome.
[*] The fact it is ever-changing can make it difficult to remain at ""end game"". i.e the changes to the Sortie missions meant i had to take steps back into quests to move forwards again.
[*] sometimes the host-players will have poor internet connection, occasionally making games difficult to succeed in. 
[*] sometimes the massess of special effects or powers can make it difficult to see what you're doing.
[*] Things take a lot of time to craft, but if you keep up with crafting parts and such as you go along, you can always be levelling something. i.e try levelling weapons while you wait for frames to finish building or vice versa. 

I'm not sure there is much else to say, if you like shooting stuff, slashing stuff and working towards getting better gear all the time then this game is for you.
If you can't stand having to repeat missions sometimes or hate having to search for good gear then it's probably not for you.
Either way, it has a good community, you can always find people to play with, there is so much to do in-game you'd have to live on it to get it all done. 
I sincerely advise everyone to at least give it a go :)

All the game is being fixed with gimmicks and band-aids, and all new features are so deeply flawed, that it creates more issues on top of old issues.

The game is 90% farming and grinding and the other 10% is waiting even more time to build the things you already spent hours on trying to grind for, any speedy progression requires you to tap into the plague on this game that is microtransactions.

The game is repetitive, even more so later in the game. Missions varey just a little and the ""randomly generated maps"" eventually show a pattern. 
If you're not the kind of person that likes to play the same stuff over and over again, just to level and unlock new stuff, then this game is nothing for you.
I myself, wouldn't have started playing this game if I hadn't have a friend helping me and showing me around.

Pro:
+ Free.
+ Easy to install.
+ A lot of content, weapons, ""warframes"" and the such.
+ Good asthetics.
+ Good storyline.
+ Trading between players.
+ Good communication system, easy to leave a note to your friends.
+ A lot of customisations, weapons and other stuff can be unlocked through Alert-missions that usually have a lot of other players that can help you get them.

Contra:
- Archwing missions (Space and Water).
- Hard to learn without help.
- Slow progression without any help.
- Stuff locked behind a paywall.
- Stuff locked behind the requirment to join clan.
- Missions and enemies that require you to team up with players, unbeatable in solo. (Unless you're some kind of level 25+ Which will take ages to get there.)
- Everything requires in-game money to upgrade, trade or advance. Trading has a tax/fee on it and upgrading mods requires you to grind through hours and hours of gameplay to get enough resources together.",1486294362,1486294362,False,2,0,0.51500701904296875,0,True,False,False

This game has some of the most fun combat i've ever experienced in a shooter. smooth controls that allow combat to flow smoothly. The amount of diffrent weapons and frames keep this game fun and interestering for many hours, getting a new Cyro gun or crazy whip with a tazer on the end keeps the game interestering. The only problem  Is that this game is extremely grindy, while I and others may like the grind to get the best weapons in the game others will find it hinders the game greatly. The story is interestering and mysterious, and the additions of amazing cutscenes is greatly appreciated, the story is easy to follow along to and lends itself greatly to the overall feeling of the game.
At first you will think this game is pay to win but its not. It's just pay to speed things up. EVERYTHING (Aside from cosmetics) is available to get, you just have to grind to get it.

Pros-
-Total time killer
-Great story with well made cutscenes
-Awesome Warframes and weapons to keep the game interestering
-Very smooth gameplay/gunplay
-Very pretty visuals
-Well optimised for bad PC's
-Overall fun for many hours.
-Cutting enemies in half with a Plasma sword is AWESOME.

Cons-
-Extremely grindy.

OK, so I paid about $50 for plat to get my favorite frame.  But that was when I started playing some odd 1,150 hours ago.  Since then, I've gotten my own resources and credits and everything else to rise to rank 20.  Definitely Free to Play, and I know how to play.

I've seen some major changes in this game.  From the time Excalibur had the ability to jump high to the time he can now wield an Exalted blade.  Going from a space map to a solar system.  From Void Keys to Void Relics.  Major changes in movement and Archwing maneuvering.  At least 8 new warframes and who knows how many weapons since.

My Favorite Waframe is Valkyr.  She's maxed out, heavily modded, overpowered,  and I have finally settle on her final appearance and I love it!

Some folks whine about grinding, but I think they just don't have the patience for the game.  Myself, I never felt like I really grinded or farmed.  I just played and the resources came along.  Now I got so much of everything, I don't know what to do with it all.

There is no denying the value you are getting in this package without having to pay a thing upfront. The game does however have a few minor issues which, however insignificant, should still be mentioned.

Pros:
The game has a intricate and interesting lore which is just ripe for exploring. Whether thats done via scanning different things in mission or completeing the various quests there is always more to learn about this world. That said you won't be running out of content any time soon. The variety when it comes to weapons, warframes and equipment is truly amazing and they keed adding to it constantly. Furthermore the extensive customization and upgradability of different items provides even more depth,
My personal reccomendation for anyone is to play with a group of friends because that's when this game really shines. The public matchmaking isn't too bad either however you may encounter lag as well as AFK playes which are to be expected.

Cons:
Playing this game alone can sometimes be extremely boring and on higher tier mission it is directly discoraged as the game can get pretty difficult and going solo will just be a pain. The higher level equipment often requires a fair bit of farming which can quickly get repetitive and what doesn't help is that the rng sometimes seems utterly broken. And don't get surprised if it actually is broken as the game does suffer from its share of bugs and connectivity issues. Oh yeah and everytime you launch the game prepare yourself for 15 minutes of downloading new content....but maybe that's just me.

Overall I think warframe is a stellar example of how ftp games should be done. Whilst having microtransactions most of the high tier equipment isn't actually purchasable so forget about the ''pay to win'' strategy. There is no denying the ammount of content, lore and hours of fun you can have with your friends without paying a dollar.",1486164418,1486164418,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,False

When u got bored seeing so much text just get to the end where is a honest short opinion

-pros

1You get to shoot stuff,
2You get to shooot more stuff
3Story is compeling and the level of detail is amasing.
4You get to choose from different styles to play even any character or weapon can be used in your unique way.
5It's a co-op 3rd person shooter that has even a pvp mode and ""lunaro"" the spacefuture rocket leauge that none plays.
6.There is around 370 uniqe different items (currently, game is updated) that u can play with, so it's fun. 

-cons

1.You need to grind a lifetime there if you don't waste money (like i had in mind)
2.The tilesets are a generic mix that are randomly created of (i think 4 same posible tileset parts used on that planet)
3.There are like 10 modes maximum ingame, still compeling but if you go as exaple to an endlles mission and a dude that's hosting it leaves after the first rotation, you gota leave it beacuse it gets buggy or they force end the mission (surv).
4.No dedicated servers, just for PVP *people provide hosting on volontary basis but so far i doubt i played on one
5.Do not stay in regional chat nor try to make like minded firends (applies just for sharing thoughts about the way u play, it's not that toxic to talk about general) the thing is there is allways someone that ""knows better"" is ""pro"" in a game that has only pvp mode to measure individual skill, when u play the acctuall game you just grind or buy gear to shoot alien stuff so you can't prove you got the skill, best setup in any case scenario.
6.When you start off, gota have patience and be efficient, or you will need to waste money (you get only 2 trades per day that increase while u get more rank, your contribution to other teams is limited so nobody wants to take you to the better runs *most often)
7.The endgame (after u grind everything or buy) looks like a fashion show, you barely have to do something after acomplishments are made you just foucs your gear looks nice for the few runs you do.... untill next update where u get to grind more stuff.

Honest as short as posible

This game is accutally not that bad, the only problems are when u start off or reach near the end, at the begin you don't have much to begin and you need to do so much things, and at the end you have everything and it gets boring in some way. But besides unfinished content and some bugs, nerfs that freak out most of the players. It's really most of the time fun to play and looks quite nice with a really nice story. And you get to grind so much so it's either time or money demanding, if you are efficient you need around 1.5k hours to get most of the stuff (money spending not included) if you are a rich boi/waifu this game is quite easy for you, just find someone that will help you rank that stuff you get for your ""hard earned money"" anyways i whould recomend this game. Because if you play efficient and want to shoot from amasing looking uniqe weapons on good looking tilesets. you can have a try. BUT have patience and learn what are dmg types and what is mostly used for so you get that efficiency.",1486137564,1486137564,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The matchmaking has been very spotty and when you do join a sqaud with your friend, clan, or even other people in your respective region, the game/server (forgive my ignorance, im not super tech savy) refuses to keep a connection.
 
The game play has been very great, don't get me wrong. This is one of my favorite games, but with the terrible servers it is hard to enjoy the game with friends or even with people i don't know (which is one of the main reasons i downloaded this game). With all do respect to Digital Extremes, i wasn't going to write an almost ""nasty-gram"" review about this came because this is the first problem i had with it. But what happened less than a few minutes ago kind of ground my gears a little bit. i was playing with other random folks and i got a Vengeful Revenant stance mod, which looked promising on first glance. but right as the the other people in the squad were going to extract (i wasn't their because i had gotten lost in the map), the game told me something along the lines of ""host migration failed. we will return you to the multiplayer menu."" When i got back to my ship, i looked at the mission report and the mod wasn't their. I'm not sething with rage or anything (my keyboard AND all of it's keys still work) i am just very annoyed with the fact that i am not the only one with this problem. if it was just me i wouldn't have written a review like this, but the fact it isn't just me and the Digital Extremes have not done anything yet to fix the problem is very disappointing for such a beautiful game such as Warframe.

In conclusion, if you are thinking about getting this game because you want to play with your friends, please wait. While it is a very great game, the lack of support to the entire Warframe community from Digital Extremes is very upsetting and mildly to extremely disappointing. They have found a gold mine with this game, but please do not let the mine collapse on the people inside",1485993893,1485993893,True,0,0,0.490909069776535034,0,True,False,False

No this is not one of those p2w games. I think its a play 2 win type of game. The only way to acutally get good is to play the game. Which takes a HELL A LOT OF TIME (unless you buy stuff). 

PROS:
There are many different types of warframes, and they all have a unique features. There's also a lot of weapons, guns, kubrows, missions, etc. It's a game where you can team up and play with your friends and have a great time. It's a very satisfying game and burns time FAST. The price for the plat isn't that bad, 20 dollars for 370 plat isn't that bad tbh. And there's trading too, so you can trade stuff with other players to speed things up. Another pro is that all the missions aren't on land. There's archwing missions, where you can fly around space and kick ass and it's soooo cooool.

CONS:
Too much grind. The grind is literally unreal. Students like me wont be able to catch up to what's going on and play. The missions are repetitive, and they're all pretty much the same, but on different planets. The Warframes are hard to get without paying money, but even with paying money it's still hard because all the good primed warframes are in the vault so you have to wait till they release it from the vault. Another con is THE LAG. This game is NOT suitable for people with really weak and cheap PC's. If you try to run it on a really horrible and cheap PC, it's only gonna go 10 or 20 FPS max, maybe even 5 FPS, especially in infested missions since there's so many graphics involved with it.

Overall, I think this game is pretty good. I would give it a 8.5/10",1485825703,1485825703,True,1,1,0.505395710468292236,0,True,False,False

Cons:

The grind gets a bit rediculous but not to the point that it seems impossible

Gamebreaking:

The movement system might possibly be the worst freerunning/parkour system in all of video games. While attemping to freerun you will constantly be launched across the map, clip into the map and be trapped, fall through the map, go in the opposite direction you intended, and fall into death pits. Sometimes this leads to you failing a mission or a mastery rank that is locked for another 24 hours. This is by far the most infuriating part of the game because it's written about as well as spaghetti thrown at a wall. 

There are some completely gamebreaking glitches, such as Rescue on Lua that will frequently leave you without the ability to shoot, hack, change weapons, or use abilities, and the only way to get unglitched is to die which may lose you the mission.

For all its other positive qualities, I can't blame you if the small amount of gamebreaking glitches annoys you. There aren't many glitches, but they are serious enough to make you ragequit and not touch the game for days.",1485672263,1485672263,True,1,0,0.503716230392456055,0,True,False,False

everything in this game is earnable and doesn't take long if you use relics and do void fissures for parts, which in turn make warframes/prime warframes/weapons etc. 

or you could support the developers and buy plat, which allows you cosmetics/skins/in game weapons/warframes etc. everything in the cash shop can be earned in game besides some prime warframes that may be vaulted.... the other items will appear as alerts.....

new and cool weapons and frames are often nerfed into the ground or locked behind a grind wall soo tall even donald trump would be jealous 

but if you opt to put in some money for some of the core items frames and weapons you will need to be competative you will see a game that does nothing more or less than send you on the largest power trip since doom

this game is boring as hell to play alone to find a clan and unlock some of the more powerful weapons as a result as well as get support as a new player because this community is great (with its fair share of douche bags)

just don't come into this game expecting to get far by doing it one mission at a time and ignoring what people say is good, take this from someone who knows, in this game if everyone is using it, chances are it trivialises the entire game and you will be making it 300% harder on yourself not doing that popular thing

With friends Warframe is very enjoyable and even boring missions become fun experience when playing with friends. When playing with random peoples you can't really enjoy the game because especially players with high rank want to just complete the mission and go to the goal immediately.

if i could change anything in this game it would be trading limit they limit you to 5 trades a day which i do think is a good idea for a mmorpg based game. because trading is huge part of this game. but i am coming off 11 years or WoW and you can trade as much as you want.

It was already great upon release with just the co-op/solo type of missions and initial content of warframes and gear, but then ... ohhh then ... they added PvP, Archwing and many different types of missions, rearranged the star system map, mods and the most various upgrades and much more.

It is by far one of the most engaging game i've seen in a while, they don't seem to be slowing it down either (in develpment of new content) and it just keeps getting better.

One thing you'll notice on this game is that all missions are rewarding, and if you push harder (defend longer, kill more, extract more etc) than necessary, the rewards increase as well. For example: you have a mission to defend ""drills"" until they extract 500 units of something, after that you can leave with the mission completed, but if you keep fueling the drills they will extract more and more, increasing your reward and maybe finding some rare mod or something ...

Let me get the most basic things out of the way, this game is grindy as all hell. If you don't like grinding, even for like 20 hours, you'll get really annoyed with this game. The game DOES get very repititive, which, you might be thinking, is a terrible thing to go with grinding, and you wouldn't be completely wrong. But it's not as bad as it seems as long as you DO take a break now and again. You level up in this game in a similar fashion to League of Legends, where you have your main level (Master Rank or MR) and the level of each of your equipment. You get experience of rank up your MR by leveling new equipment such as primary weapons, secondary weapons, warframes, melee weapons, etc. You can also get mods to increase various stats of your equipment to make them better.

One more thing is, this review isn't a complete ""traditional"" review. I WILL BE PUTTING IN SOME OF MY OWN OPINIONS ABOUT THIS GAME SO DON'T GET TRIGGERED.
And these point are in no particular order, I'm just listing them out in the best of my knowledge...

MAIN Good things about this game:-
 
1. When it says that it's Free-to-Play, it MEANS that it's Free-to-Play. I'm sure there are other games somewhere that are as Free-to-Play as this, but WF is the only game I've played that doesn't force you to pay money if you want to have fun. You can be all decked out with prime crap and what not without paying a dime. What you DO need to pay for (if you want them) are community-made apparels, and similar things like that. All this because platinum (the premium currency here) can be acquired by either getting rare mods, prime junk, rare prime parts, etc. all of which you can farm indefinitely.

2. The community loves itself. This game has one of the best communities in any free-to-play game on Steam as of right now. Everyone is always helping each other and is generally a fun-loving community. Sure, there are a few rotten apples here and there but with such a big player base, it comes as no surprise. 

3. The adrenaline-filled gameplay. I don't think I need to explain anything here. You're basically a space-ninja-serial-killer going around slaughtering armies. Need I say more? Each Warframe, each weapon, each companion is different from one another. And you'll keep wanting to try out all of them. Some like silent bows, some like rifles and machine-guns, some (me included) love shotguns, others just use melee, either swords, dual swords, axes, whips, etc. You can see the variety here. 

4. The graphics may not be Order 1886-like, but it does look amazing. It honestly is a very good looking game. Mainly, in arch-wing missions, when you're just flying over to another point in the map, take some time to look at the background. It looks astonishing. And the game is optimized very well, as much as I'm aware. I first started playing this game in those old pentuim 2.0 processors intel hd graphics laptops, believe it or not. And I had a decent experience, the frame rate wouldn't go below 30 even in the most chaotic moments. So if you have a decent pc, you'll be able to run this without any problems.

5. The devs, DE, really care about their fanbase. They always respond to major critisicm against the game and try to fix (though they didn't always find the right solution). They do the best they can to give the players the experience DE wants AND the experience the players want. 

6. The lore is very rich and it's presented to you in a very similar fashion to Dark Souls. The main events and major parts of the lore are told to you by the Lotus, Ordis or other various characters. There are several quests in the game that answer crucial questions in the story and raise new questions as well. Most of the lore is given to you in the form of description in the codex of several items (like Dark Souls).

Small things that I really like about this game:-

1. The relays. It's like a pub where other players can hang out together. It brings the community together a bit. I've also seen them go around and judge each others warframe's appearance, hence people calling it Fashion-Frame. 

2. The dojo. Similar to the relays, the dojo is a place where clan members can just hang out and do whatever. You can have duels with one another, or try to beat someone's high score in the obstacle course. At one point or another, you will join a clan and need to go to the dojo to buy the blueprints of some items which you can't get from farming or the market. 

3. Syndicates are similar to covenants in Dark Souls (i don't know why i keep relating things to ds in here but this is the best explanation i can find). Basically, you can join a syndicate and you climb up the ranks to be a more well-known member of that syndicate. These syndicates can also give you several offerings or rewards which you can get by either ranking up and choosing one or buying them with ""standing"".


MAIN Bad things about this game:-

1. One of the most frequent issues that I've seen people talk about is the lack of things to do in lategame. This isn't an issue that I've faced yet because I'm not that level yet, but around MR 20, you'll slowly run out of things to do. Then all you do is Sorties, farm rare prime parts, or wait for the next big update.

2. The ""Vault System"". If you've read the other reviews here, you'll know what I'm talking about. Basically, to rank up your MR, you need to level new equipment as I've said before, problem is, prime weapons usually tend to get vaulted, locking newers players off from getting that weapon to rank it up. Unless you pay money or grind a lot to get platinum. 

3. Slowly and slowly, I'm noticing DE's implementation of more and more grinding. The ""relic"" system for example. Back then, you could just go to a void defense mission and keep doing waves and keep getting random rarities of prime items. It was pretty simple and straightforward. But now with the new relic system, you have to farm relics from defense missions, or you can farm standing for your syndicate and buy relic packs, which give you only 3 per pack. After getting these relics, you have to open some of them in their ""intact"" state to get void traces. Using void traces, you can ""upgrade"" these relics to increase the chance of getting a rarer prime part. Sure, it makes the prime part rarities more organized and easier to understand but it clearly adds WAY more grinding.


Small things that I dislike about this game:-

1. Freaking Lotus. This lady just won't shut up. The only way to shut her up is to turn off the speech volume, which also mutes other character dialogues, so that's not really an option. Every single mission, she pretends as if you're completely new to the game and haven't ever done a survival mission.

2. Endo farming. There ways to do it, but most people get Ayatan Sculptures and sell them to Maroo for Endo. But the time it takes for Maroo to find another Ayatan treasure mission is unacceptable, like 3-4 days.

3. The Tenno, after the second dream quest. I know half the community will agree with me and the other half will disagree. I'm not going to spoil it for you but I lost something that made the game very unique to me in that quest. I hope DE later implements a system where you can turn your Tenno into..like Orokin Energy or something which you can insert into your wf while tying this into the lore so it doesn't look out of place.",1485511071,1485511337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do enjoy the game honestly, its sporty, stealthy, hack and slash and shoot style, and competitive play is enjoyable. but it lacks in the department of affordability and pay to fully enjoy... 

things take time to craft, eggs take time to hatch, missions available at random... the game begs to be played constantly for bettter rewards.  however if you throw down money to speed up crafting or more gear space or just better gear you will instantly leave behind the free to play players in the dust instantaniously...

so in full oppinion, this game is ""yes"" its fun, I enjoy playing it and will still play it.  but I hate its ""freemium"" concept that boosts players with more money by a landslide.  who wants to play a pvp game against someone who bought all his powerful gear with money?  not this guy...",1485509223,1485509223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do I recommend spending money on platinum? Not on your life. You can farm it in game but DE keeps making it harder and harder, especially if you start later.

Pros: Gameplay is fastpaced for everything except spy and a mode ironically called rush (They legit punish you if you go too fast, and archwing itself is just an abortion, but later on that.)

Can be fun with a competent group.

Most content can be soloed, if you're into that (except interception, which can be a fucking nightmare.)

Cons: There are 9 primary guns that are even end-game ready. 9. Not much for variety. And that doesn't change. Also a handful of those end game weapons were related to a time-specific event, so you can't get those anymore

Also certain warframes are hardcore useless. Avoid Banshee, Oberon, Limbo and Hydroid like the plague.

Credits are impossible to farm easily (Now that they've nerfed Secura Lecta), so more pay to win fun.

Some groups you'll need for sorties (-the- endgame) are literally hat on foot retarded.

If you go in aware that at some point DE will shoot itself in the foot and give you, the customer, the middle finger, you'll love this game and its new turn towards pay to win. (Specifically, the Nidus update)

A note on my purchase: I got a price reduction for platinum as part of a brand new account I set up (had an old one from the very early start of the game; It was so different I needed a clean slate). To my memory, I used $50 and got thousands of platinum to start off my game. I got a warframe, some customization pieces, and started to blitz my way through missions. It was so fun to play as a casual shooter/action game, and the mechanics are well done. That $50 i do not see as a microtransaction, but more as a $50 i would have spent on this game if it wasnt free to play.

Pro:
      The game is large. There is so much to explore, kill, grind, create, and collect. The game would take maybe years to 100%. 

       The game is Free. That is pretty cool on the developers part to make the game free to play.

       Gunplay is pretty good. It is a 3rd person shooter where the player can use a large list of weapons ranging from throwable weapons, katanas, bows, and your generic arsenal of guns like sniper, assult rifles, shotgun, ect. Each weapon feels smooth in the field of combat.

        Rpg elements. Your weapons get stronger through the game boosting damage and increase mod slots. Besides that your warframe also gets stronger the more you level up.

Con:
       Steep learning curve. Right from the early portion of the game, the game has a nasty habit of not informing the player of what to do either in the boss fight or explain about these new enemies in a level. I got caught off guard when for some random reason i teleported some distance into a crowd of enemies because an enemy has the ability to teleport me.

      Annoying enemies. Enemies are pretty chill in the early part of the game but later when you get to sheilded enemies, enemies that have an aoe attack, the flying sheild drones, enemies that can teleport you or grapple you. You will be so very annoyed at how many times you get knocked down breaking any pace the player may have and leaves you open to being attacked for a pretty big ammount of time.

      Grinding. The grind is real in this game. You need to grind for everything from making weapons, warframes, items, leveling up all your weapons and warframes. Not only that but there is rng about getting warframe peices to help make an additional warframe for you own use or to just collect.

       Microtransactions. This wouldnt be a big deal if it didnt play a part in the core game mechanics. If i had to grind for everything and not worry about paying money unless i really want that weapon or warframe then i wouldnt mind the option, not that i would use money to get ingame stuff anyways. Here that exists but that is not the end of it. The player must use platinum which is the ""ingame"" equivalent of real life cash even though the game already has an ingame currency system. Back to the point, the player must use this platinum to buy slots to store these new weapons or warframes created. This pretty much punishes players who do not wish to spend their money on the slots to make the new items available for use. Sure you can trade with players for platinum but it is just a hassle, it would be better if every created warframe or weapon came with a slot eleminating the whole issue or better yet let us use the ingame currency to buy the slots than our actual money.

       Hacking minigames. I dont mind minigames in general but these minigames are just pain to deal with not because they are super hard. It is because they are very apparent in the game and you will be doing the same hacking minigame many times through out the game. There are 2 different types of minigames but it could be sumed up as meh and a pace breaker when doing one. The controls in the pipe minigame are annoying since if using a controller it highlights based on the direction of the analog stick. It would be easier if the stick moved the highlighted pipe section from the last highlighted location. It is just awkard to deal with.

Conclusion:
       The game at first seemed really cool but with this large ammount of grinding and the need to use platinum to buy weapon and warframe shots. I just could not enjoy the game because that means if i want to be a higher mastery rank i must either buy slots or sell my stuff to maintain that one slot i opened by selling my weapons. The minigames are annoying because how many times one must do them either in a single mission or a single planet. In shot since this was alot of typing, was i having fun in the game? Well if i need to ask a question like that then i am obviously not having a fun time with the game.",1485239870,1485239870,False,4,2,0.546956479549407959,0,True,False,False

But ""Warframe"" looks like a dumb, empty place to keep my attention.

This game is great the people who are making negative review are either stuck in a state of nostalgia or are not thinking clearly about what has been happening.

The first thing I saw was that people are saying that the game stinks now and that it needs to go back to it originally was or that it was implemented poorly or something. Well, if it was back to the way it was at release then the game would be incredibly boring it was literally built  as levels then boss almost no story at all. I have been with Warframe since release but stopped playing for like 1.5 years because it was too boring. When I returned there was actually a story that was interesting and got me back into the game. When people say it is implemented horribly I think people don't realise how the business world works when it comes to applications. In this day and age nothing is going to work completely on release programs are too big and complicated to test for everything. So when people get the game and see bugs then they complain without knowing the reason they just see it as ""Oh the devs slacked off fuck them.""

Second thing I am seeing is that the game is too grindy. Ok yeah I will give them that but if it wasnt grindy then everyone would have been done with the game in like a month or so. Then what would be the point and what would keep the player base playing the game? If you have everything in the game then why play? That is why the game is grindy. It is for longevity and so that you have something to aim for in the game. Also make some kind of challenge for yourself because this will actually make the game interesting instead of just trying to find something to do.

Third thing, people are saying the devs are corrupt. Well they don't know what they are talking about if the devs were corrupt then why have huge updates and why promise the player base an update on a certain day then spend up until midnight making sure the game work well enough for people to play it? I am not saying that they always make the update on time. I have seen the promise of an update on a certain month then it happens like 4 or maybe even 6 months later. ....They do have other things you know? They still have to go find bugs and replicate them to see if it was just a one time thing or a common occurance then they have to go through the code to see where a bug is and fix it. Also they have to make sure certain weapons are not too overpowered or underpowered and test damage outputs for each weapon that people mention as such. This is easier said than done so keep that in mind. On top of all that they have to continue working on the update which takes time. Another thing about them being corrupt is people are mentioning that they are charging too much for this or that....who the fuck is forcing you to buy it? That's right no one if it costs too much then don't but it..... Also keep in mind that this is still part of a company they have to make money or this game will be shut down. If a project in a company is losing money then why keep it?(Economics 101) So they have to make money fomr something if this game was competely free then it would have failed in the first month.

I do take breaks for months at a time, but no single game should be expected to entertain forever. I also enjoyed the main story, but it takes a LONG time to slowly playout.  I thought the explanation for just who and what you are was great.
Early on I felt like I was not ""getting"" the game and I didn't even know what I wasn't getting.  I saw other players around me, also at level 30, that were doing like 8 times as much damage as me. Then I read about how to double your frame's slots, your weapons slots, get rare mods, get higher tier weapons, and other tricks, all from outside warframe itself.  This game expects you to metagame the hell out of it and play with a wiki page minimized for quick reference.

Pros:
-Its free, at least to begin with. I spend $5 to $10 a month and feel like I have all I need
-Awesome space ninjas with super powers
-Cool Weapons. There is little in life more satisfying than cutting you foes in half with a high powered laser.

Cons:
-The game is the grind. You'll see a cool gun, grind for hours or days to get it, play with it for a while, then store if you really like it or sell it if you dont, then rinse and repeat.
-Little in game explanations. Requires substantial metagaming.",1485110601,1485110601,True,15,1,0.59230649471282959,0,True,False,False

A big problem people complain about is that it is pay-to-win, but that is really only the appearance early on. It is entirely possible to gain every weapon, frame, etc. without spending any money due to the trading system. However, to get there takes a fair bit of grinding, but the action is so fun that it really isn't that bad. 

One thing that some people may skimp on talking about is the story/universe/lore. I don't want to spoil anything, but DE has done a simply AMAZING job at this, with some absolutely awesome quests and lore recently. The Second Dream and War Within are worth every minute that you invest to get there.

I started playing Warframe on and off 2 years ago, and I have been having a lot of fun with it. 
After a bit of a break, I rejoined just as the Prime vault closed again (my timing sucks, I know) I've been actively doing missions and quests, and getting myself a badass new Kubrow (and those could use an update, but that's another story). 
To finish this review off, before I go off track too much. 
This game is great, it looks good, it's fast paced and you can get most premium stuff for free. 
I honestly recommend it to everyone.
If you want to spend money on this game, I recommend doing it on fashion stuff (which this game has quite a bit of).
