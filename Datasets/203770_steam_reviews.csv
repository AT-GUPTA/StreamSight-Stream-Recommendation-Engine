Pros:

Deep and Complex Gameplay: Crusader Kings II is renowned for its intricate and deep gameplay mechanics, offering players the opportunity to manage a dynasty across centuries. The focus on dynasty building, politics, and diplomacy sets it apart in the grand strategy genre.

Dynastic Management: The game excels in allowing players to shape the destiny of their dynasty. From arranging marriages for strategic alliances to managing succession and dealing with internal conflicts, the dynastic element adds a layer of complexity and immersion.

Historical Authenticity: Crusader Kings II provides an immersive historical experience set in the medieval era. The game's attention to historical detail, including events, characters, and cultural intricacies, enhances the authenticity of the gameplay.

Expansive Map and Variety of Playable Characters: The vast map spans across Europe, Asia, and Africa, offering an extensive playground for players. With a multitude of playable characters, each with unique traits and ambitions, the game encourages diverse playstyles and replayability.

Continuous Development and Modding Community: Paradox Interactive has supported the game with extensive post-launch content, including expansions that add new features and depth. Additionally, a vibrant modding community has created a plethora of user-generated content, expanding the game's possibilities even further.

Cons:

Steep Learning Curve: Crusader Kings II has a notoriously steep learning curve, and newcomers may find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer depth of the gameplay mechanics. The complexity of managing characters, relationships, and realms requires a significant investment of time to fully grasp.

Graphics and UI: While the game's depth compensates for its graphical limitations, the visuals and user interface are not as polished as some other contemporary titles. The user interface, in particular, can be overwhelming, especially for those new to grand strategy games.

Occasional AI Inconsistencies: The game's AI can sometimes exhibit inconsistencies or make seemingly irrational decisions, impacting the overall realism of the medieval political landscape. This can lead to moments of frustration for players seeking a more predictable and strategic experience.

Performance Issues in Late-Game: As campaigns progress into the later centuries, the game may experience performance issues and slowdowns, particularly on less powerful hardware. This can detract from the otherwise immersive experience, especially in lengthy playthroughs.

Conclusion:

Crusader Kings II stands as a grand and ambitious title in the grand strategy genre, offering a deep and engaging experience for players who appreciate complexity and historical authenticity. While its steep learning curve and occasional technical issues may pose challenges, the game's rich tapestry of medieval power politics, dynastic management, and continuous development support make it a captivating choice for those willing to invest time and effort into mastering its intricacies.",1705401495,1705401495,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Crusader Kings never delivers that ""just one more turn"" satisfaction and drive of top-tier strategy games like Civilization, Master of Magic or even Heroes of Might and Magic. It's slow, dull, overly complicated and repetitive.

Both fans and non-fans are quick to mention this game's complexity and depth and, although there sure are many options and buttons to click, it's more complicated than really complex. The complexity comes from constant micro-management of dozens of things happening together at the same time and struggling with the terrible UI, be it on the several game screens or trying to maneuver your military on the world map.

I'm sure many people with hundreds of hours in-game would disagree and say that the interface is very intuitive and everything is very easy to manage - but hey if I had 400 hours of experience doing open-heart surgery, I would probably tell everyone it's a cakewalk too!

Is this game deep? I think there's an argument to be made that it is but I think a majority of people praising its depth are confusing ""complicated"" for a quality. If anything, a game that needs to keep constantly pushing ""story events"" to you every five minutes is an admission that its amazingly ambitious simulation engine fails to generate interesting gameplay by itself.

[b]PS: Font rant[/b]

There are dozens of results you can find through a web-search for ""Crusader Kings 2 text is hard to read"" and i think the problem boils down to: poor support for non-intended resolutions; awful font choice; and transparent backgrounds for text panels.

For a game with minimal graphics and almost entirely menu- and data-driven, this is completely unacceptable. Stellaris by the same studio, using the same engine, on the same device, with the same resolution has perfect readability and was released while CK2 was still being actively developed, for a decade, all the way up to 2021. 

This is beyond mind-boggling to me... but this is the studio that manages to have 90% of their dozens of DLC (per game) be poorly-reviewed and that managed to have half of their players negatively review their latest two major releases, including their most anticipated sequel bar-none in Victoria 3.

So I can see how being able to read text in a game with so much of it is somehow not a priority after an entire decade of complaints. Who has the time to make a panel fully opaque when they have more over-priced, poorly-received DLC packs to put out?

Don't even get me started with the launcher that has broke multiple games, that has just made its latest victim with Across the Obelisk, an otherwise 87% positive game currently rated at 38% because Paradox is just too greedy to ever learn their lesson.",1515007400,1702964243,False,8,0,0.561102449893951416,0,True,False,False

CKII used to be one of the premiere Grand Strategy titles available.  Sadly, over the course of several expansion/DLC releases the game has lost its way, becoming increasingly tedious and straying far from the original wonderful gameplay.

  The Conclave DLC and the accompanying free content patch was released completely unbalanced and apparently largely untested.  It caused a widespread negative reaction which forced Paradox to immediately begin work on a fix patch.  That patch, now in open beta testing, goes a long way toward fixing the worst of the problems.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough.

  The root of the problem is that the entire concept of Conclave makes councils far too powerful.  The intent of Paradox seems to be to make the game more difficult and thus hinder the ability of players to ""paint"" the map all in the color of their empire.  The intended result was achieved.  And now the game is a mess of micromanaging council votes and council favor which detracts from the initial design concept of a fun game focused on dynasties and war in the medieval period.  Paradox might as well change the name of the game to Crusader Kings II: The Council -Hindered, Blocked and Trolled.  The game is no longer focused on dynasty and conquest and religious fervor in the medieval milieu.  Now it is just a grumpy, greedy pseudo-democracy council simulator set in a medieval era with the player forced into spending inordinate amounts of time dealing with fractious, constant council problems almost to the exclusion of everything that once made this a great game. 

  Congratulations, Paradox.  The greed pushing a need to continually release more DLC to line corporate pockets has finally sent the core game into oblivion. You succeeded in satisfying a vocal minority who wanted the game to be more difficult (with no proof that many of those who complained had even played the game beyond the Easy setting).  In return, you've so drastically altered the basic gameplay that Crusader Kings II is no longer really about Crusader Kings.  You've turned a fine Grand Strategy game set in the medieval period into something entirely different. Short of removing the Conclave DLC and the free content expansion entirely, there is no fix for this.  The game has moved too far from its original design concept, which attracted many of us to the game in the first place.  There are other better democracy simulators available.

 Long story short: This is a really good game that everybody should try at least once. Welcome to the ultimate feudal simulator.

 While in many grand strategy games you control a country, raise troops and build an empire through conquest, Crusader Kings II brings on a more complex and interesting experience of country management where you will not actually control a country as a whole, but just a male or a female ruler who will have a limited authority upon the land he or she has through his/her nobility titles.

 These titles vary from being a count (a minor ruler who usually has one or two provinces) to being an emperor (who can even control kings), but each of them has it's advantages and challenges. Although there are other titles (such as Emir for moslems or Jarl for norse pagans), most of them follow the classic feudal system of Baron/Bishop/Mayor<Count<Duke<King<Emperor. There are many ways to get new titles, but the most common ones are through conquest and through inheritance.

 Laws can be changed in your domain, but your vassals have to approve them, so try to keep them happy. There're also inheritance laws, that include the way the titles will be given or if a woman can hold them or not. 

 Speaking about women, marriage plays a pretty important role, being the key to your blood line's survival. Following traditional feudal diplomacy, many alliances and agreements can be reached by marrying another character.

 Wars, crusades, rebellions and infight are not as important as in other games such as Europa Universalis IV, but every ruler will eventually have to live by the sword. Since you don't have an army of your own, you will have to ask your vassals for their leavies, that will remain loyal to you for as long as you don't overuse them. In this game, you cannot declare a war without a casus belli, so you may need to fabricate one. Crusades and Jihads are called by the Pope / Caliph, and you can choose to join them or not.

 Of course, religion has an important role in this game, so there are many religious options you can follow in order to make your religion stronger. Christians, moslems, norse, jews, suomi, zoroastrians, buddhists and many others have different religious options you can use in your benefit.

 As a whole, this game is really fun to play, and you can play it just for doing stupid things with your realm or try to go on and build a new empire. There are many choices, and there's always a new surprise waiting for you.

 The only flaw this game has, and it's a big one indeed, is that you cannot do many things (like playing moslem or pagan countries) if you don't buy the DLCs. So get your wallet ready to spend a lot of money here.",1406030291,1700863110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
+Game is great with all the DLC

Cons
-Game is dogshit without any DLC, and incrementally gets better the more DLC you buy. There's about $100-$200 of ""expansions"" that add up to be worth one or two actual expansions. (Sword of Islam, Holy Fury, etc) and MANY which should be in the base game (Ruler designer, way of life, conclave, EU4 converter, all the cultural cosmetics for different factions, etc)
-In game advertisements, the game actually takes longer to start up than a pirated copy because it tries to load THREE ads on the main menu for CK3 and their monthly DLC subscription.

You should find this game by other, ""free"" means, it's a good game worth playing but Paradox really is greedy as hell, which fine so long as it's not a detriment to the game. The amount of content-scraping they've done with the DLC ranks just below EA/Ubisoft with how badly it negatively impacts the game for people who decide to spend money on it.

This game has a ton of depth and strategy to it, but the time required to learn it may be off putting. It gives you as much as you are willing to put into it. Gameplay is mostly numbers, choosing decisions, and watching the map be carved up into all different funny nations. Not the most engaging for the average person. But if this is your thing, the sheer RP potential is staggering and there are a ton of mods to enhance it. 

Now for the negative: The DLC policy. I’m no fan of the amount of DLC this game has or its pricing. Or really any paradox game, as it’s not just a CK2 issue. But I cannot deny they (usually) enhance the game to a decent degree. Plus, if you don’t want to give them a dime, vanilla is always an acceptable option as well. It’s just a pick your poison type situation. 
Still recommend this as it’s a one-of-a-kind game and the sheer insanity you or the AI can cause is simply fantastic.

Paradox Interactive continues to quietly unfold its wargames. It has been quite a few years since the Swedish studio acquired a certain expertise in the genre. But all of that was just practice. Hearts of Iron? A draft! Europa Universalis? A sketch! Victoria? Unfinished! Back then, the learning process finally acquired something almost perfect! With Crusader Kings II, Paradox delivers its magnum opus, its grand work, the culmination of its quest for the perfect wargame.

Alright, Paradox developers can retire! In fact, if one of them was to leave today, he could do so with a sense of accomplishment. The duty that the studio has imposed on itself for a long time was to deliver the ultimate wargame to players, and that's precisely what Crusader Kings II is. There's no need to reiterate what will be said in the review; I might risk excessive use of superlatives. Just know that if you even have a slight liking for the genre, you can't afford to miss this masterpiece. All things considered, let's hope Paradox developers wait a while longer before considering retirement. I want them to continue releasing games of this caliber for a long time!

[h1]Long review[/h1]

From a historical chronology perspective, Crusader Kings II is the first among Paradox Interactive's wargames, spanning from 1066 to 1453 (from 867 with DLC). It is set just before Europa Universalis III (1453-1820 with the Napoleon's Ambition expansion), followed by Victoria II (1835-1936) and ultimately Hearts of Iron III (1936-1948). In four titles, the studio covers nearly nine centuries of European history. Such dedication is truly commendable, especially considering the established quality of the mentioned titles. However, some questions linger concerning Crusader Kings II. The game had seen only one iteration, which dates back to 2004. Moreover, its older setting, synonymous with less advanced technology, doesn't lead to a shallower gameplay, does it? Rest assured, it's not the case. There's no need for assault tanks to create a complex wargame; political and religious intrigues suffice. In fact, CKII was arguably the most ambitious game ever produced by the Swedish developer.

Ambition, you'll need it as a player as well. By having you embody a noble from Europe (or other regions with DLCs), Crusader Kings II entrusts you with the weighty task of developing your realm and, perhaps, building an empire through warfare, diplomacy, and intrigue across generations. It's worth noting that you can also start right at the top by playing as an established monarch; the task won't be any easier for that. In fact, it's often easier to begin as a small entity, gradually acquiring counties or duchies as opportunities arise. Managing an empire, on the other hand, can prove perilous, with numerous external borders to defend, peasant rebellions to suppress, and most importantly, internal divisions. It's important to remember that the grand political entities of the era exhibit only a facade of unity; in reality, they are disparate aggregates, fragmented into a multitude of provinces controlled by ambitious vassals, sometimes as powerful as their ruler. Consequently, you must contend with noble quarrels and internal power struggles, machinations, and even backstabbing. This is what gives the game its flavor.

You can access the profiles of all the game's characters to interact with them. The possibilities are numerous: you can imprison an unscrupulous conspirator exposed by your spy, bribe a neighbor to improve their opinion of you, or grant a land title to reward a deserving vassal. Let's not forget family relations: it's up to you to decide where to send a child for their education and with whom to arrange a marriage. There's nothing like a good union to secure a valuable ally; in times of conflict, your father-in-law will likely come to your aid. Each character has their own skills (stewardship, diplomacy, etc.), personality traits (humble, courageous, etc.), and, most importantly, their relationships within their lineage and alliances. Dealing with all these parameters is no small feat, but it's captivating. Playing Crusader Kings II is like donning the role of a puppeteer; you take great pleasure in pulling the strings. You sow discord between a vassal and their liege, send a fifteen-year-old cousin to marry an elderly count whose favor you seek, or even assassinate your own spouse if necessary! Machiavelli wasn't born yet, but he already had disciples.

Beside these political intrigues, war seems almost straightforward. There's certainly vigorous fighting, but it happens with rules. Yes, war had its very specific codes at the time. You couldn't just invade your neighbor because you liked their little piece of woodland! A valid casus belli, or in other words, a justifiable pretext for an attack was required. This is the role of your chancellor, who can fabricate claims by working in the shadows. Alternatively, you can target the enemies of God; no one will object if you pick a fight with a pagan Nordic kingdom or a Muslim caliphate! Religion plays a significant role in the game; you must ensure good relations with the Pope to earn piety points and perhaps request the excommunication of a nuisance... But let's get back to war. Once the casus belli is duly established or manufactured, you can raise your troops and those of your vassals, hire mercenaries if the treasury allows it, or call upon orders of warrior monks. All that's left is to march toward the enemy. Combat resolution is quite simple; apart from a few factors related to the terrain (rivers, terrain, etc.), the stronger army prevails. Nevertheless, you will need to occupy the enemy province for a certain period to eliminate all resistance. Afterward, your weakened opponent will likely offer you favorable peace terms. Now you have control of a new province and a healthy stock of prestige points, the accumulation of which is the ultimate goal.

Besides its military aspect, Crusader Kings II, like most wargames, has a management component. Laws, the economy, technological research... In this area, some players will probably lament the limited control over many factors. However, this is a deliberate choice by the developers to adhere closely to history. As mentioned before, even the mightiest emperor must negotiate with his vassals, or risk seeing his grand empire disintegrate. Thus, it is not possible to change laws or taxation without their consent, which can sometimes be challenging to obtain. The lack of direct control over these parameters, while realistic, can be frustrating initially; however, one learns to adapt. The same applies to the game's interface: it's not perfect, but you eventually get used to its minor flaws, which are not insurmountable. It's fair to say that the game is so outstanding that one is inclined to forgive all. The software is stable and smooth, which wasn't always the case with the studio's previous releases. In short, Paradox has truly outdone itself with Crusader Kings II. Every wargame enthusiast should give it a try!",1698766972,1698766972,True,12,2,0.645998716354370117,0,True,False,False

Crusader Kings II, the renowned grand strategy game from Paradox Interactive, is a tour de force in the world of historical simulations. As a long-time fan of both strategy and history, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece.

Gameplay (5/5): Crusader Kings II's gameplay revolves around the intricate management of your medieval dynasty. You play as a ruler and must ensure the survival and prosperity of your family line through generations. The depth of gameplay is astounding, from arranging marriages and alliances to plotting assassinations and waging wars. The game's clever use of character-driven mechanics, which focus on the people rather than abstract entities, sets it apart from other strategy titles. The result is a rich, dynamic, and endlessly engaging experience that unfolds differently with each playthrough.

Graphics and Sound (4/5): While Crusader Kings II might not boast cutting-edge graphics, it's worth noting that it was released in 2012, and its visuals still hold up admirably. The medieval map and character portraits are intricately detailed, and the user interface is clean and functional. The game's music and sound effects add a medieval ambience that enhances the immersive experience, even though they may not be groundbreaking.

Realism (5/5): Crusader Kings II excels in historical authenticity. It successfully captures the essence of the medieval world, replete with political intrigue, religious strife, and dynastic challenges. The simulation of medieval society, complete with the complex web of feudal relationships, is nothing short of exceptional. The game manages to make historical events, no matter how minor, feel significant in the grand tapestry of history.

Replayability (5/5): One of the game's greatest strengths is its tremendous replay value. The sheer variety of starting characters and historical bookmarks, coupled with the open-ended nature of the gameplay, means you can replay Crusader Kings II countless times and still uncover new narratives and challenges. The addition of expansions and mods further extends the game's lifespan, making it a constant favorite among the strategy gaming community.

Overall (5/5): Crusader Kings II is a classic that has stood the test of time for good reason. Its deep, character-driven gameplay, historical authenticity, and immense replayability make it an enduring gem in the strategy gaming world. While it might not boast the flashiest graphics, its substance more than compensates. If you have a penchant for history and enjoy weaving complex stories in a dynamic, ever-evolving medieval world, this game is an absolute must-play. Crusader Kings II is a grand medieval epic that deserves a place in the library of any strategy enthusiast.",1498163405,1697190638,True,3,0,0.514226555824279785,0,True,False,False

It is an excellent game with numerous advantages such as perfect 100% REAL history implementation, high degree of freedom in gameplay, tons of various game contents, and high-quality mods etc.

In particular, the true beauty of this game is that you can experience numerous simulations such as friendship and rival conflict with other NPCs, love and betrayal, interesting own family history, and birth secrets etc, not limited to politics, diplomacy, and war.

When I play this game, I played the game not knowing how much time had passed. So, NEVER play Crusader Kings II at night! if you play at night you'll stay up all night and go to bed the next morning!

One of must-see games before you die especially if you love history.

Ck2 became a big time sink right after I grew tired of AOE and Total War. It changed a lot since the earlier days when there were only two formable empires on the whole map and you could only play christian feudals. You just can't get tired of trying different starts on different start dates or different mods,

I just wish they had done more with it.

After more than ten years waiting, here is a list of repeatedly asked for things which were never actually addressed and are still not adressed in this games sequell, CK3:
-Naval Battles
-Continent spaning defensive pacts
-Shallow Combat
-Shallow Economy
-Streamlined Buildings
-Broken Mechanics(Muslims are too easy to play, Merchants Republics are still prone to buggs, Hordes are broken, Tribals are lame, moral authority is silly)
-The same giant Bloobs every single game
-Game becomes even more broken if you don't own the newly released expansion and usualy the thematic region/culture/religion which inspires the DLC is buffed behond reason(This is a problem in other Paradox titles too)


But hey at least they added a couple buttons that should have been in the game from the get go, altough you still have to pay good value for them.
Like the hability to ransom all of your prisioners at once instead of clicking one by one included in the Monks and Mystics DLC for the modest price of 15 euro or the Jade Dragon DLC that adds an entire civilization in the form of a button for the same amount of money.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

With its rich historical context, deep gameplay mechanics, and engaging storytelling, this game stands as a testament to the brilliance of the genre.The level of detail and historical accuracy in Crusader Kings II is simply astounding. As you navigate through the game, you'll find yourself managing an empire filled with well-researched characters, each with their own unique personalities, desires, and ambitions. The game spans from 1066 to 1453, allowing you to experience the full range of medieval history and witness the rise and fall of great dynasties.The game's depth is truly impressive. You must carefully manage your realm's economy, engage in diplomacy, and make critical decisions about marriages, alliances, and successions. The game is far from a simple war simulation, as you'll spend much of your time carefully plotting your way to power by forging alliances, managing vassals, and navigating the treacherous landscape of medieval politics.One of the standout features of Crusader Kings II is the dynamic event system that constantly keeps you on your toes. These events add a unique flavor to the gameplay, presenting you with various dilemmas, plots, and narrative-driven choices that further immerse you in the world. This dynamic storytelling allows for an almost infinite number of unique playthroughs, ensuring that no two games are ever the same.The game also boasts a passionate and creative modding community, which has developed a wealth of additional content and enhancements that further enrich the experience. From total conversions to small quality-of-life improvements, you'll find a mod to suit your tastes and enhance your gameplay.Crusader Kings II does have a steep learning curve, which might be daunting for newcomers to the genre. However, with patience and perseverance, the game's intricacies become a rewarding experience that few other games can match.In summary, Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy masterpiece that offers a deep, immersive, and engaging experience for those willing to invest the time to master its complexities.

At base the game is good. A few of the DLCs make it simple. Google a good order to play them in. This isn't a game designed for you to ""win."" You just simulate different dynasties and government types throughout history. It great for strategy fans and history buffs alike.

I have played a little of CK3, but at this point in time I would still recommend CK2 over it. If youre a Song of Ice and Fire fan, the total conversion mod for CK2 is the best game out there, as well. Countless other mods exist too -- taking the game back in the past or into the future.

It’s a complicated game where the game play is based on actual characters (kings, dukes, emperors, warlords etc) as opposed to collectively controlling nation states, Like in total war, EU4, Victoria II/III etc. 

This allows for a lot of unique gameplay mechanics and accomplishments that most other strategy map games lack. For example….. you can fuck the wife of any lord you dislike through enough planing and interactions. 

The game play is less “how do I conquer Europe” and more “how do I make my families lineage the most epic? How do I kill this disloyal duke without pissing everyone off? how do I get the pope to like me personally. How do I send an expedition into China to put my dynasty on their throne?” 

Now all of this is solid and super cool. The game also does have a wide array of “map painting” of you want to go the “lets create a single political European entity that just gets bigger” route. 

Now all of this can easily lead to an individual sinking hundreds, even thousands of hours into this game. Slowly getting better, unlocking more intricate strategies, and seeing the full extent of AI random event generation. But there’s a catch. You might have noticed this game is free. It’s a trick, the base game is free. 

To do 4/5th of the epic “I’m a medieval lord now bow before me!!!” Stuff you’d want to do…….. you’d have to spend $100s on DLC. Now you could wait for sales, heavily research the dlcs you want to buy, figure out what you deem the most essential…… but Paradox knows you probably won’t. 

For $5 a month you can “subscribe” to all the dlcs that make this game playable. I’d say it’s worth it as a trial run or place holder as you slowly buy the dlcs to exert full ownership of the game. 

I haven’t played the base game. (I bought it and all the dlc in 2014. But to play as Muslims (half the game rulers and a large part of the literal crusades) you need to fork over $10 for a dlc. Now not all the dlc are winners and some are more essential than others so that $5 a month might seem pretty good. 

The game (as defined as owning all dlcs or the $5 monthly subscription) is amazing. A solid 81/100

As I navigated the complex relationships between rulers and vassals, between faiths and cultures, I felt a strange sense of connection with the divine.

And yet, as I played on, I also couldn't help but wonder at the fickle hand of fate, which can cast down the mighty and exalt the lowly in the blink of an eye. Is this not a reminder of the ever-present hand of God, who guides and directs our lives in mysterious ways?

It was released in 2012, and has since gained a dedicated following of fans. The game combines elements of empire building, warfare, and diplomacy to create a complex and engaging experience. Players take control of one of the great medieval dynasties, and attempt to expand their power, influence, and wealth over the centuries.

I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Crusader Kings II. While I appreciate the complexity and depth of the game, I find it to be too slow and tedious. The game has a steep learning curve, and the interface can be confusing and unintuitive. Additionally, the game has a tendency to drag on for far too long, with some campaigns taking upwards of 20 hours to complete.

That said, I can appreciate the game for what it is. It provides a unique and engaging experience, and its deep and complex systems can provide hours of entertainment. If you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn the game, you'll find a rewarding and enjoyable experience.

For those looking to jump into the game, here are a few tips to help you get started. First, familiarize yourself with the game's interface and controls. Second, read up on the game's systems and mechanics to get a better understanding of how it works. Third, start off small and work your way up. Don't take on too many tasks at once, as it will be overwhelming. Finally, save your game often, so you can undo any mistakes you make.

Overall, I didn't quite enjoy Crusader Kings II as much as I thought I would. It's a complex and deep grand strategy game, but it can be slow and tedious. If you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn the game, you'll find a rewarding and enjoyable experience.",1674141497,1674141497,False,3,0,0.539519846439361572,0,True,False,False

I want to make a in-depth guide on how CK2 is and how you could apply it to CK3, though at the time of writing this that is too much of a task in my given living situation. You heard that right folks, I am that merchant coming into your capital asking for a rest but I promise there will be a review that will cover EVERYTHING I have done. So until then, cheers.

Below is a meme review to show a time capsule of how CK2 was in 2016 for me and many others. Enjoy or not.

The only game where you can start as a French king,

Fail at being king,

Becoming your said basstard child after dying in 2 years,

Having your brother sleep with and marry your kingly wife before said basstard takeover,

End up banging Norse people to make Norse/French basstard kids,

Wait for money,

Wait for piety,

Attack Britian with their pants down in civil war i.e. Norse attacking Britian also while being allied to all Norse through all of my Norse butt harping,

Wait convert germanic religlion,

Wait to be more of a asshat,

Wait to make more fiefs so more of a army to be had,

To own the Kingdom of England as a strong wanabee called Ragnar the Homosexual (, ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),

Wait to break immersion,

Wait to have kids,

Norse queen's ain't having no qweer weener,

Step 2) basstard kid again,

Next generation dip 0,

Next generation stew 0,

Next generation oh fuc* it,
 
Ending of [i]FeelsBadMan[/i] Destiny:

 I had 20 claimants on my empire Norse throne of West Norsen (West French throne of butt harping) and ended in civil war with the Norseland (England) and mainland europe to where Russia is today was my empire with over 250 vassels and working my way to asia minor before all hell broke loose, wait wait die.

But with all jokes aside, I love this game from being a wessel type character to a all powerful war god that your 32 martial and no one can field a army as big as yours.

 This is the most enjoyable game I have on steam for how random things can become if you let them happen, I like to play games on the brink of destruction of your destiny with a basstard child of yours. 

Its just a great game fully recommend. If you have trouble playing this game please comment if your new to the game or recently bought this amazing game. Other than that thank you for reading and have a nice day.

Also why I use basstard is not just fish joke but it is tickling Valves fancy-son *grammer checker* anywho have a nice one.",1452692198,1674140751,True,4,8,0.507858753204345703,0,True,False,False

With DLC attached, it allows you to begin anywhere on the map, any era, and you can even create your own Ruler. The game is very RNG reliant however there are many tricks of the trade you can use to really take the fun to the next level. The game's many achievements act as superb objectives for the player and contain a significant amount of challenge dependent on which you pick to go for.

About two years ago, the developer Paradox decided that, after five years of being released, they were going to hike the price back up to just a bit below the price of a brand new Triple-A game. They attempted to do this not just with CKII, but for all of their other games and DLC as well. The ""reason"" given was ""to match the purchasing power of different currencies..."" or some BS. Basically, they wanted more money for an old game.

As you can imagine, this didn't go over well with the community and resulted in a slew of protest reviews which sent the trend from Very Positive to Mostly Negative. Indeed, as of 26/06/2017 the recent reviews were Mostly Negative. The community rightly drew a line in the sand. They weren't having any of it.

After this massive community revolt, the CEO of Paradox issued a statement that they would be reversing the new price changes. I felt that this statement satisfied me at the time, and my review went back to being very positive. Crusader Kings II is a great game and worthy of all the praise it gets as a game, but it was a shame that Paradox seemed so eager to burn through all the good will they'd built up over the years.

You'd think that this outcome was a good thing, but fast forward another two years and they have succeeded in pulling a bait and switch. No longer does the game and its DLC go on sale for 75% off. Now, 50% is the lowest you'll ever see it go. Basically, since they couldn't hike the base price, they decided to nerf the sales instead which achieves the same result.

To the average potential customer thinking about buying the game's DLC, the 50% off sale price should be viewed as the sticker price. Do NOT pay full price for the game and its DLC when it's not on sale.

CKII is still a great game worthy of being played but it's getting harder and harder to recommend it as the years go by. Still recommend it, but only when it's on sale. We'll see if that changes in another two years.",1479948423,1669334340,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

You know when you are young, full of dreams and hopes, living a simpler life, and you had a game that you always played to, relax, have fun, get mad, overcome a challenge yourself made, and you will always have a fondess towards that game?

Well this is one of the kind for me. So i have a bias about this game.

If you like CYOA games, like Role Playng and are full of imagination. You should try this game.

If you are a sadist that want torture, imprison, commit murders, and some war crimes. You should try this game.

If you want be a noble person, had a life full of joy, friends, spouse, childs, grandchilds. You should try this game.

Like management? Well, watch as you kingdom grow and you have to deal with vassals, titles, laws.

Want have a dog? you can! a cat? Yes you can! both? you can try. Want have a horse? Yep you can, you feel the urge of make your horse the new chancellor? well... why? but you can. For some reason you love so much your new horse that you wana marry him? Well that just became weird realy fast, but you can. Now you are in the pursuit of the eternal life because all of a sudden your horse became imortal and you dont want leave him alone in this miserable world? Yeah go for it, became a imortal being and ride to the battle in your horse wife. After living for so many time, you have you seen your share of blood in many battles, lost a eye, a leg, a arm and lost your dick in surgery trying to get rid of cancer. All of your offspring is dead, you are depressed, yours subjects hate you they are starting a civil war. You tried many times to end your life and failed. Well this is CK 2 for your.

What about a robust character creator? Yeah, that the game don't have. (Maybe some DLC portrait) This game dosnot have great graphics, you need imagination and good will.

If you felt like playing, have in mind that this game has a great learning curve, at first you feel yourself lost, nothing happens on the screen, and out of the blue you die.

There is no possible way production costs that much to charge as much as they do.  Good game but I will not be buying ANY dlc any time soon.  The problem is that they require DLC for the game to work correctly.  I think someone forgot to tell them the definition of DLC.  I think what they would rather want to do is MAKE PEOPLE PAY FOR UPDATES.  This is entirely rediculous.

And for the longest time, this was how I played the game, 4 speed, waiting for my next claim to fabricate or peace treaty to expire. However, it is only after ~1000 hours of gameplay that I have come to realise the true beauty contribution of this masterpiece - that being a facilitator for the imagination. Crusader Kings 2 is one of the few games that is fleshed out enough [with DLC mostly, if you're short on cash there are numerous ways to 'acquire' these ;)] I finally find myself in a position to challenge my creative imagination in response to the many events that transpire over the course of the game. These can come in as ouvert forms such as finally completing that elusive quest for immortality, or even stealing your former rival's skull in a final act of gloating and humiliation, to the more complex narratives that construct themselves over the course of one's playtime - such as avenging the murderer of your father and eradicating his whole bloodline over the course of a few decades or centuries, or even recruiting a promising rebel leader and elevating him to rulership and seeing how he deals with the administrative challanges many rebel leaders would never think to oversee. And for that, I must wholeheartedly thank both Paradox and it's community for encouraging me to think like a child again, and create scenarios after all else has been provided for me. Additional to riveting event chains and qualilty of life decisions, the extensive modding community has only furthered my enjoyment of the game, and despite most efforts being completed in stead of the release of Crusader Kings 3, CK2 will always have a special place in my heart for its propensity to create stories, and most importantly, be an engaging map painting simulator. I've learned it's nice to slow down life every once in a while, let the game 'idle' on 2-3 speed and pay attention to the minutae that is laid out before you. This game has fomented both an interest in imaginative exercises as well as history. What more could you ask for?

That said, you can get hundreds of hours out of this game due to nearly infinite replayability. Some things you can do are raiding, wage wars, assasinate, do commerce, marry, have kids and much more.

Note that I don't own all the DLC's. Just the essential one's that most players will enjoy. In my opinion the rest of the DLC's are way overpriced and just not worth it unless you have a particular interest in - for example  - Indian history.

I was in bed playing Civ 6 on the iPad and I wanted to play a grand strategy game on my computer because I'm on vacation for 6 months.  I've actually had this game in my Steam library for like 8 years.  I have like 4 acres of grass around my properties so I've already been out mowing 4 times in October and I'm cleaning out the garage so I do that for about 5-6 hours a day then I take a shower and I play this game as much as possible.  It's a cool game too because it's baseball playoffs so I can play and watch baseball at the same time.  Last night the Guardians beat the Yankees in the 9th inning!  So anyways, I'm going to Niagara Falls this weekend so I won't be able to play, but I'll be thinking about the game for sure.  I really like Civ 6 but there's one guy who left a bad review for the game after 800 hours so I hope this game isn't as bad.  Also, I think I'm probably really good at it.

Where the game really shines however is in its generation of alt-historical story telling and human conflict. Your dynasty will be full of unpredictable(or in some cases, very predictable) characters who all have their own motivations and decision making abilities. The chaos that ensues as characters engage in ruthless behavior towards one another makes for a different game every time. 

On top of that, the modding community is fantastic and you can easily set up your game to be playing in a variety of universes like warhammer, lord of the rings, game of thrones etc. Performance is demanding despite the game's age due to its old engine so you will need a strong processor to play some of the more in depth mods. Mods also exist to tweak the vanilla experience by adding more historical content/accuracy, removing/adding/expanding/minimizing certain game mechanics, enhancers for performance and the list goes on.

I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

One of my most favorite games of all times.

And it also has an active modding community still developing quality free mods.

Great game if you love history and want to play as a medieval lord in the middle ages with all its harsh and cruel aspects across multiple cultures and religions all which have a unique playthrough. CO OP is a great feature that is in the game, me and my friend managed to get a playthrough with every religion that was in the game, we reformed all of them and our favorite was to always go after the Catholics and spread our pagan religion across Europe. Vikings, the Christians, and Muslims have the most features in my opinion, though there are plenty of mods that you can download for the game to add even more content to some of the dry areas which is what me and my friend did, there's even a Game of Thrones mod we took at stab at that covers all the timelines of the known George R.R Martin world and enjoyed it very much, it was like a whole new game all together. 

  Overall, no strategy game beats CK2 in my opinion, its the best game paradox ever made and I can't wait for CK3 to come to its potential. Only downside is the DLC for this game will cost you a fortune, there is an expansion subscription for $5 a month to get all DLC if you don't want to pay the hefty price, you can also wait for sales which paradox frequently has, this game has also been offered at Humble Bundle .com for $12 with all DLC.",1661626596,1661626694,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Please do take into account that this game is bland unless you buy the important DLCs that paradox have created for this game like the ones that change the start date and ones that add more immersive role play experience for the game that being for example the ""way of life"" DLC, this is because without these critical DLCs the game has little to no events that pop up and the game will feel like a drag.

Alright, now onto what I like, the review I will put out is what is good and bad about the game when you have the important DLCs that the game has available to buy, this being because the game is free so there is no need to do one without the DLC's as you can experience the game yourself and make an opinion as to whether it is worth buying the DLCs but I do recommend that if you like the game that you do go ahead and buy them. 

The good parts are that the game has flavour, you can do a lot when you have the DLC's for example you can seduce your brothers wife and have a child which you can then legitimise making him eligible to inherit your titles, this will obviously annoy your legitimate children who find it offensive that a Bastard of your dynasty has gained legitimacy over their titles but impress your mistress who is happy that you have made her child legitimate but also annoy your wife if she finds out as your will be known as an womaniser by your court and realm.

Now onto the bad side, when you do have most of the DLCs this game can get repetitive as the same events pop up over and over and you get used to these events and already know what it says and how you are going to respond without thinking too much into it, do not get me wrong this by no way makes the game boring but it does dull down the fun a bit as even when the same events pop up you still have the ability to manipulate history to your liking if you know what you are doing.  

Overall I do recommend this game as there are not many things bad about the game a part from it getting repetitive which is not really a problem as you can just come back to the game later when you are in the mood to continue playing.

But in all honesty, its a good strategy game. You play as a Dynasty, holding various titles in medieval Europe and, with the expansions, somewhat beyond as well. Main goal is not to die out, but also expand along the way. Either through marriage or conquest. Quite a fun game with a lot of replay value and possible roleplaying elements.

It can, however, suffer from being slow at times. There is also the question whether all of the mechanics that were added to the game through DLC work well.

Nevertheless, its still a pretty unique and interesting game.

You basically simulate running a kingdom (marrying a spouse, arranging marriages, making decisions about laws, fighting off revolts and invaders or revolting against/invading someone else, managing vassals, managing religious matters, etc...) and when you die you can continue playing as a family member/heir.

I never played Crusader Kings (the first one) so I cannot compare to the previous game.  The reason I was interested in playing this game is because you can actually play as a Muslim ruler.  As a Muslim myself I find that interesting and appealing.  From what I've seen in the game so far I like that it takes a fairly unbiased stance on Muslims.  CKII doesn't focus only on Christian lands or push them as the right or good side of anything.  However, the game mechanics are still largely skewed (even with Islamic expansions) towards a Western Christian Kingdom and Ideology.  Being that the Muslim portion is largely an expansion I understand  that and it would be a bit much to expect that the games mechanics would be altered that much to better fit an Islamic kingdom.

The game itself looks like it could be really fun to play but does require a lot of strategy to play well so it's definitely not for a casual gamer.  My biggest qualms with this game are that:

1. It is not an easy game to get into.  It has a very steep learning curve and the in-game tutorial kind of sucks.  I tried following it twice and got lost both times.  There's very little help available and there doesn't appear to be any really good, simple, getting started guides.  In fact the only real help seems to come from Youtube tutorials.  The most recommended would take several hours to fully watch.  I don't really have that much time to invest in learning a single game and since I struggle to get into it due to the difficult interface and steep learning curve it makes this very difficult to like.

2. The entire interface is difficult to see and navigate.  Maybe I'm just too old but I can barely read anything on the screen of my laptop.  I already make sure to purchase large laptops because small screens are difficult for me to see and strain my eyes but CKII even on my large screen laptop is difficult to see.  I have to really strain my eyes to read the small print and look at the tiny icons.  It seems like a poor use of space and the interface is spread out all over the place on the screen all along the top and parts of the bottom.  Yet nothing is overly obvious as to what menu/options it will pop open.  I find myself wishing there was a single pop open menu that you could navigate in smaller portions (maybe tabs?) so that the information could be presented in a larger font.

So all in all... It has some good points and looks like it could be pretty fun plus has tons of achievements (if you play in the right mode).  However, I have to give it an overall negative review because after about 5.5 hours of playing I still don't understand how to play even at a basic level.  To be blunt the learning curve is too steep for me especially since I'm not getting much enjoyment out of it as is.  Couple that with the price of the game which is pretty prohibitive (plus any expansions you may want to get) [**please note the game was not free-to-play at the time this review was written**] and the  overall result is a game I just can't recommend.",1552532190,1657195060,False,2,1,0.453453153371810913,3,True,False,False

At any specifically chosen starting date, there are over a thousand provinces, and at least five hundred playable characters. In total each starting date has ten thousand characters.

Let's do some math, if there are five hundred playable characters in each of the five main starting dates (And that's a lowball estimate) then that means that there are 2500 unique playable characters in those five combined. That's not including the fact that you can move the clock to any single date between 1066 and 1337.

In terms of map scale, CK2 is dwarfed by its sister titles Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron, as the map is restricted to Europe, The Near East and North Africa, Central Asia, and India, but in terms of playable entities, Crusader Kings 2 is utterly massive and dwarfs the lot of them.

Crusader Kings 2 is so huge and gives the player so many options that in my mind it is the ultimate sand box. If you want an easy game then you can play as Charlemagne in the earliest start date, who gets his hand held by events specifically designed for him. Or you could play as a Nenets count on the tiny island of Kolguyev in modern Russia, where in order to invade anyone you need boats, but you're a technological backwater where nobody knows how to use boats. Or you could play as Genghis Khan and perform perhaps the easiest world conquest in any Paradox game by simply taking your massive unending hordes and stomping Europe into the dust.

Scale and choice are why I love Crusader Kings 2 so much. Whenever I get bored with a campaign I simply go somewhere else and have just as much fun. Mods only deepen the quicksand. It's not for everyone, no Paradox game is and that's okay, because for those who enjoy this kind of game, it's the best around.

I've yet to play it enough to have real qualms. What I will say is that war is EXPENSIVE and there's no loan system. This aint modern day war; no printing money and debasing currency to pay for your crimes. No treasury or war bonds. Make money, expand coffers, weigh taxes vs expansion of the economy (likely flaw; if it were realistic it'd be the economy every time).

Battles and commanders and family mean something. A bunch of family members, that's a bunch of commanders. Also, it's rivals once your die. AI that will vie for the crown that you have, people who might end up with pieces of your kingdom as you are the eldest.

Marriage makes alliances. Betroth your under 10 year old girl (and women today think their life is SOOOO tough), plot to kill your dullard, oldest son so you don't have to play as a rube once you die, or play as a saint and realize your wife is having an affair and wants you dead.

I play Crusader Kings 2 currently, I have a blast while doing so, and I have all 68 downloadable content packs for this game, acquired over the handful of years since I bought it. At the time I wrote this, I have 2,005 hours in this game, if that adds an iota of legitimacy to what I have to say here. This review isn't negative because of CK2, and I'm not bitter about the CK2 subscription model from a ""I should have waited because then I would have saved money"" point of view. This review is negative because of the disturbing pattern that I've noticed and thought about regarding all of Paradox Development Studio's current ""grand strategy"" titles (CK3, EU4, Stellaris, HOI, Imperator). This is just my perspective, and I know I will find many enemies amongst those who drank PDX's kool-aid, but I believe that what I have to say here is right and true, and all I ask is that you consider this before buying, if for nothing more than for hearing a well-informed critical perspective from the inside.

You, potential player, will find that Crusader Kings 2 seems to have a high financial barrier to entry. At the time I write this, the core, gameplay-affecting expansions cost [b]~$183 minus a 10% bundle discount[/b]. The full, [b][i]*developer-intended*[/i][/b] experience, including everything made for the game (including 2 e-books and the completely self-contained Sunset Invasion DLC), is [b]~$317 minus a 17% discount[/b]. Those price points are somewhat ludicrous, but this game is the kind I’ll still be playing 10-20 years from now. As one of those grand strategy games whose gameplay partially exists in your mind, it has the potential for that sort of soft longevity if that’s your thing.

Now, let me tell you my real beef, which is with PDX’s remarkable history of releasing DLCs that can range from competent, significant additions to unpolished or unfinished to just straight broken. Make no mistake: PDX is capable of releasing DLCs that at least seemed like it’s quality was assured by playtesters, and [b]not all DLCs come out in a bad state[/b], but any fellow CK2-heads will recall [u]Way of Life[/u]’s release (every AI took the seduction focus, so the whole world had herpes and syphilis) and [u]Conclave[/u]’s release (The threat system was unbalanced to the point where an Irish duke taking a single county would result in the Pope and the Caliph banding together to take you down a peg. The council was so overpowered that one funny review said something like [i]“tl;dr: paradox thinks there were constitutional elective monarchies in the 8th century”[/i]). Let’s not forget EU4’s [u]Common Sense[/u] and its patch (gave the AI the ability to develop provinces, but not the player unless you bought the DLC; only recently rectified), and what appears to be the case with Stellaris’s [u]Overlord[/u] (haven’t bought it, but the reviews detail a similar experience on launch of a clearly untested DLC that introduces bugs and design issues). All that is to say that there is definitely a lack of QA testing done by PDX for their DLCs. On the one hand, this makes sense. The people who made this game are in their 30s and 40s and 50s with families, kids, and mortgages. They don’t have time to play a video game for long enough to provide adequate QA suggestions, and PDX (or any company that controls a game as a service) will not pay for the QA testing required to ensure a good product because (1) their games get too big, ergo (2) to properly QA test everything to ensure a well-made product would require a robust QA department and an amount of money and time on their end that they are unwilling to spend. That would eat into the bottom line for no other purpose than to make a better game, which isn’t [i]necessarily[/i] profitable. I think you’ll find that PDX grand strategy DLCs and their accompanying patches mirror strongly the patches of League of Legends in both execution and outcome: Changes will be introduced to a game by people who don’t play said game, resulting in changes that don’t accurately reflect what the game needs to be healthy or complete, leading to the frustration of players on the ground and a loss of goodwill from cynics like me. This is the natural sacrifice of a game as a service, and you need to realize this before buying into CK2, whether monthly or wholesale: CK2 and all extant PDX grand strategy games are services whose cost for full ownership of the [b][i]*developer-intended*[/i][/b] experience is obscenely high.

I was there for Stellaris on launch day. I even pre-ordered it for the little bug guy portrait in-game. For those who can recall, 1.0 Stellaris, from a design perspective, is unrecognizable from what we have today. There are so many added and removed systems in current Stellaris that weren’t even considered before its release. This makes me question “Why?” Why would they release a game only to so radically change it down the line? Wouldn’t they have been better off taking a few years and just making one finished game? This can be a matter of perspective, though. Where some people see that and say “Well, PDX needs money to continue the development of the game,” I see that and say “I paid for a game, not a service, so I expect a complete product for my $40-$60, not a perfectly breakable platform to sell me further products.” My problem with all the PDX Dev Studio DLCs isn’t that I don’t like extra stuff being made for a game I like. It’s that there are certain features baked into the CK2 DLCs (excluding Sunset Invasion) that are arguably essential, even if some consider them to just be nice-to-haves. For instance, the Old Gods DLC is fantastic, thematic, and absolutely essential. The component I think is most essential to the DLC and ought to have been baked into the game to begin with was the pushing back of the start date from 1066 (this was way before the free Iron Century update) to 867. To me, the pushing back of the start date is literally more game that is added by just adjusting a couple of values and looking at some real life maps for reference. The analogy I came up with is that this part of Old Gods DLC and those like it (i.e., those DLCs containing non-relevant features that affect the core gameplay) are like the back door to a house you buy. Sure, the back door isn’t strictly necessary for the house to be a house, but having to specifically pay extra for it on top of the house itself is kinda sus. Why wasn’t a back door specified in the original design for the house?

In the end, I can’t recommend CK2. I can’t recommend it in good faith without informing you of the DLC practices of the company that made it. If you in the future choose to buy a PDX Development Studio grand strategy game, you should be prepared for that game to meet one of three fates: either it becomes bloated beyond belief (EU4), it becomes a complete product after almost a decade (CK2), or it will be shelved indefinitely in a somewhat polished yet undercooked and barren state (Imperator: Rome). 

TL;DR: The PDX Grand Strategy model enables the release of sub-standard games and DLCs, and you paying $5 a month (or God forbid $317) for the [b][i]*developer-intended*[/i][/b] CK2 experience after the highs and lows it has been through is an endorsement of that release practice, which I don’t think you should do. If you buy any other PDX Dev Studio title on launch day, just know you are buying into a service, not a complete game.",1653878265,1653878317,False,165,3,0.909344017505645752,18,True,False,False

This is the best 4x dysnatic game there is, no questions about. If managing a family, earning prestigue, using diplomacy and relations to make or break nations, and trying to figuere out a way to throw your moronic firstborn off a cliff so that your genius [b] nullius filius [/b] can inherit the empire sound like your deal, then this is the game for you.

As with all paradox games there is a steep learning curve and at first the game seems a little underwelming but once you get the hang of it you wont let go.

I would like to take the time and edit my previous review. This is honestly my favorite game of all time. Come hell or high water, throw any new game at me, I'll always after a time come back to CK2. This game truly introduced me to strategy games and got me into gaming in general. I have invested so many hours into it and it kept me constantly engaged in story building, character development, and realm expansion. Nothing like coming home and just bustin out a fat sesh of the old CK whether I'm a sexy french count or looking to expand the realm of the Iron throne with the AGOT mod. This game has honestly been the best fall back, disconnecting, kickin back the feet after a long day kinda game I at least could have ever asked for. I still find myself playing ungodly hours of it in 2022! And I know I will continue to keep playing it long after, I don't care if there will be a CK4 or a CK5 in the future cuz I will still always go back to the classic and beloved CK2. If you have come this far in this so called review, there is nothing more I can say than download this fucking game. I bought every single DLC when it wasn't free and I don't have a single god damn regret because honestly, the team behind this game deserved every god damn penny cuz its so god damn well made. They even included wikipedia pages to characters, who does that, big dick energy. Anyways, this is no longer a review, but a thank you and appreciation post for the developers that made this. You guys have honestly made my nights so much more interesting, and thank you for making such a masterpiece. I will always come back to this game and play.

214 hours for an entire dynasty play through.  It took about the first 200 years of dynasty to learn how to play the game. Very heavy learning curve that, once diligently researched, ultimately points out the ""formula"" for how to play this game.  I did not give up or restart my dynasty while learning because it was obvious that I could come back from bad decisions over time - unless I did something that would kill off the dynasty early on.  That's a little hard to do but it's possible if you just ""poke and hope"" without doing some research.

I have most DLCs - all that have decent or very good reviews.  

About half way through the life of the dynasty, things started getting pretty repetitive.  There are some intriguing aspects of this game and then there are some that become a bit boring or tedious over time.

There is more to experience, things to try differently, and different political manipulations to perfect.  

The ""end game"" screen gives you a bit of information about your dynasty but I wish it had much more as some of the joy of playing the game is living through each ruler's tenure.  

It's an interesting game and, as I've played over 200 hours, it's only fair to give it a thumbs up. My opinion is that it actually deserves a 3 out of 5.

To elaborate, the game is ""split"" into several DLCs, some of which are essential, that is, the ""expansions"" which unlock game content that should not be locked; and some which are not and can be ignored, such as coats of arms, models, portraits and soundtracks. So if you want to own the game with all the ""expansions"", that is, the game without locked content, then you have to pay US$164.55, which is too much, let alone speak of the price of owning the game with every single DLC, which is US$263.29.

The price of playing this game may not seem harsh to those who purchased the DLC over time since launch because they paid for this game over time, but to those who are new to the game and want to experience it without being locked out of important features, the game is simply unreasonably expensive, thus not a game that can be recommended in most cases as most people are not wealthy.",1646769068,1646781790,False,81,0,0.79731595516204834,4,True,False,False

Something “less good” is the amount of DLC that Crusader Kings 2 have. The DLC policy of Paradox is able to make their games have a long life with a lot of updates, but it also means that for newer players the amount of DLC makes it look very expensive and hard to get into. This barrier is a lot lower now that Crusader Kings 2 base game have been made free, but that hurdle is still there. However, that hurdle have been lowered even more with the release of a subscription, that I personally think is a great thing for newer players and those who have not got most of the DLC yet. It allows you to test out different DLC to see what you maybe want to get permanently.

Since Crusader Kings 2 is quite old it has gotten a lot of DLC, and some are more important than others. Conclave and Way of Life are two examples of DLC that you should get as soon as possible, while Sword of Islam and Rajas of India are examples of more niche DLC and cater more towards those that really want to play as a Muslim or as an Indian ruler. Still there are more DLC to get, there is the divisive Sunset Invasion, where some like it and other hate it, The Republic, which introduces a lot more complicated government to play, and a lot of different customization and graphical DLC that are not needed, but gives better variation between characters.

I have found a lot of entertainment in this game, and since it is free, I would recommend at least trying it to see what you think for yourself.",1575233760,1646606316,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Otherwise, I wouldn't have spent over 500 hours playing it. Why do I not recommend it then? Because of Paradox. Possibly the most avaricious game studio ever. I bought every single major DLC (I refuse to buy unit packs or music packs, simply unnecessary). I didn't like every DLC I bought, sometimes they added features or content that I didn't like (or sometimes didn't add enough), but I wanted to support and encourage Paradox to continue to develop the game. I knowingly contributed to their greedy attitude. $15-$20 DLCs are outrageous, especially after you make your game free to play. That itself is a betrayal. Is any other Paradox game free to play now? The first Crusader Kings is still $10 on Steam. Why did you make this one free? Why did you make Crusader Kings 3 anyway? There was no reason to make another game. Paradox still pops out major DLCs for EU4, and it runs on the same engine, and it is similar in age to CK2. Then, around a year later, when they realized a money-making machine suddenly stopped making them money, and they alienated part of their fanbase by making a new game, they somehow thought that adding a SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE to a DEAD, SINGLE-PLAYER GAME was a good idea? It's rubbing salt in the wound. Hopefully some other company starts making quality grand-strategy games and will dethrone Paradox.

I've owned it for years, I paid for the base game before it was F2P, but I had played it the least out of all Paradox games. Moreso than other Paradox games it really writes a story for you. The best review I could write is one of those stories.

During an important battle with all three of us involved. As the Saxon, Swabian, and Bohemian armies were clashing with the Hungarian army, the Swabian duke died of cancer at 16. The marriage alliance between Bohemia and Swabia was dashed, and the Swabian army marched home, resulting in an allied defeat. Once the battered Bohemian army reached Prague, the duke of Bohemia hired mercenaries to turn the tide before the victorious Hungarians marched on the capital. However, after a mere few days the treasury was dry, and the mercenaries turned on the Bohemians, slaughtering the remnant of their army. This resulted in the Bohemians surrendering part of their treasury, causing them to go further into debt, and the heir to the duchy, to the Hungarians.

I thought its a mildly interesting story at least, and that doesn't get into any other elements of the campaign like the next Swabian duke, or the one after that (I can't quite remember) becoming the head of a Satanic cult and using unholy power to live until he was eighty, or that Swabian duke and Bohemian king becoming lovers. There's also the tale of Giselbert and his bloodline, a dwarf made Count by the king of Bohemia. There was the duke of Thuringia becoming the Kaiser of the HRE because a blessed king of Bohemia dying in a duel, the king of Saxony becoming the Kaiser and funneling the Empires funds into building a giant statue of himself in Saxony, and many others: from one campaign that hasn't yet finished.

First, the good: the game has some interesting mechanics, in special the dynasty system. Managing a family was something unique to this game and got me hooked up. There are other features like assassination plots, scheming, managing the nobility so that the government goes your way etc. For all that, my thumbs up. However, I have to say, it is just not enough.

Now, the bad: combat and warfare are a disaster. You will plan, hire mercenaries, highly skilled commanders, move your troops to perfection, reach 100% score and all of a sudden see it all crumble. And that's that: You lost your war. You will loose most of your wars out of the blue. Very, very much frustrating.
                        The disease and death system of characters is a mess. Your 21 y.o. ruler will suddenly develop diarrhea or wrap himself on some lady and that's that. You are dead. Some child will take it's place and you will do it all over again. Unpredictable, unfair, and is a part of the game engineered to piss you off.
                        Do I need to mention the DLC system? Well, take a look: it is so disgustingly expensive that the producers are now charging monthly access...

Finally, with a broken heart and great sadness, I give my thumb down to Crusader Kings 2 as it is. 

If you would all allow me one final advice? Get the free version and download mods. There are plenty of it on the workshop and you might get some joy out of it. My family knows how hard I tried.

To which, the base game is pretty much all you need to work with, and you have to introduce some of the DLC slowly as you get used to it. This is different to (for example) the Sims, which even when you have the entire collection for still is relatively easy to get into.

Some of this DLC stuff is stuff that at this point should be a standard for the game, or in a C.Kings 3.  Their constantupdating makes me believe they don't want to make a CK3 and just continue to update this one, resulting in anger at their practices and the belief they are milking the game for all its worth... Which lets face it they are. But regardless, rather then upsetting customers and all that, they need to stop fiddling with this game and move on.  The continued toying with it isnt helping their reputation as a company.

Edit;
So this game isn't the only issue, theres members of the fann following who defend it, try and argue over the devs bad decisions, etc. And otherwise can be annoying.

This review is now not going to change at all, the game was not only let down by its devs, but its fans too.",1498312353,1642023337,False,10,0,0.570101737976074219,12,True,False,False

You cant earn achievements unless you play Ironman mode but Ironman mode is so stupidly unbalanced and broken the only achievement your likely to earn is an early grave from a heart attack brought on by high stress levels. when you pick a faction to play as and it says the difficalty is easy and it ends up being harder than the ones labelled as hard, you know your game is broken. The game is basicly designed to punish you for playing as anything other than famous historical figures. they added all these extra content and punish you for using them by stopping you earning achievements if you use the customisation option to use the DLC. As for the DLC that adds new timelines to play, they are so broken its beyond a joke. they added so much and didnt think to try balancing things out or tweeking the base game to accomadate them, the DLC basicly messes up the difficalty rating. factions i once had no problem playing with on the base game are now next to impossible to do. The DLC adds so much to the game that it interferes with the gameplay, you have to keep pausing the game just to issue commands because it never gives you time to do anything, whats so hard about balancing out the DLC with the base game oh masters of startegy games. if you can make it so you can only change laws once every 5 years in game then you can make it so the game balances out how often you get a pop up event. and the further back you go in history for your starting timeline, the more the game punishes you for not using the base game starting point, it's complete stupidity and a waste of time and money. When this game first came out and I bought it, I actually enjoyed it, simple, basic fun, challenging but doable. As for the retarded Crusades, well, don't join them is the best thing you could do.

Walls are supposed to increase your city/castle/church econemy by 0.20 for each one you build and they do.

[/b] I'll leave my original review, but in a recent update, they patched in a Threat mechanic, which is designed to keep extremely large, aggressive nations in check. But the implementation makes no sense, as all nations of different religions will band together to fight you if you get large enough. So Norse Finland and Hindu India can and will ally against you. It only serves to make the player's job harder.

Then in the next update, Monks and Mystics, they introduce a new ""statecraft"" mechanic only available to owners of that DLC that makes Threat much more managable. 

So in other words, they just made the game much harder in a way that makes no sense, then expect the players to pay to make that mechanic less of a pain. This is straight from the ""how to make a predatory mobile game"" handbook. Introduce pain points, then offer a paid way out of that pain point. Even if the developers didn't intend it like that, that's how it comes off. ""Wait 30 years in between declaring war, or pay 14.99 to lower that wait time!"" 

Nope. Can't endorse that.

Original Review: 
This is the most begrudging recommendation ever. 

The game is riddled with DLC content so you never feel like you're getting the full game. 

It's so complex that you have to spend hours on the wiki and going through tutorials just to begin playing, otherwise you're completely overwhelmed. 

The UI is a mess, they've only just recently patched it to a point it isn't hot garbage and is somewhat useable to a novice player. 

But there is something magical about having being an Irish duke trying to unite all of Ireland, marrying your son off to the 4th in succession Byzantine princess, plotting to have that princess promoted to empress, then having your successor inherit both the Irish Kingdom and the Byzantine Empire. It's a type of fun you can't have with any other game. I speak from experience.

So I recommend it for a very specific kind of video game player. One that is willing to put up with a truckload of BS just so they can pretend to rule all of Europe. And have incestuous moron babies. 

Also, they SPECIFICALLY PATCHED IN that lunatic characters will sometimes plot to kill themselves.",1520015502,1638716659,False,1,0,0.522184312343597412,0,True,False,False

[url=https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-ii-the-kotaku-re-review-1783955128]Here's pretty  eloquent review I found online.[/url]

To echo the author above:  This game is about people.  It crafts compelling and complex stories completely through emergent storytelling.  

This is a game I'd been waiting for for years without knowing it.  I like medieval stuff, roguelikes and other procedurally-generated games, strategy, RPGs, and simulations.  It's more than that, though.

This game captures so many of the defining elements of humanity completely absent from other games.  What are your goals and aspirations?  Who do you marry?  What is your family like?  What kind of legacy do you leave for your children?  The stuff (that has consumed the minds of billions of people since the dawn of history) actually matters in this game.  

Have you ever played a game and been truly and sincerely disappointed in your son?  Betrayed by your wife?  Crushed by circumstances beyond your control?  We pretend like these things aren't part of the human experience, when they are more core to human existence than any amount of power-grabbing, baddie-shooting, mushroom-eating fantasy struggles we create for ourselves in games.  

Your brother hating you can easily be the worst thing in your life in this game.  Doing something stupid or mean and offending everyone around you is a real threat, especially while you are still learning the game.  It sucks, but it happens.  That's a recurring thing in this game.  Sucky stuff happens.  Deal with it the best you can and try to live your life.  

This game still has empire-building and military strategy and all that if you want to dive into it.  You don't have to, though.  You can derp your way through life not really knowing how things work, and still have a fun time.  In fact, I miss the games where I didn't know all the tricks to secure stable holdings and manipulate the succession rules.  It is a great sandbox.  Set a goal and try to reach it.  Quit when you feel like it. 

The stories.  So many stories.  You know that thing where someone really wants to tell you about their D&D character?  I have that experience constantly with this game.   I want to talk about Martin Gabas Gabas who built an empire with nothing but a spear, outlived 6 of his 7 sons then died of old age on the battlefield.  I want tell my friends about Prusas Klakis, the faceless lunatic who passed numerous laws concerning pants and turnips, became the greatest crusader in history, and was canonized as a saint posthumously.  Those are just a two and they each have decades of successes and failures that felt compelling at the time.  Every character you play has a story that matters to you in the moment.   For me, this is another reason why CK2 beats other paradox games (Stellaris, EU4, etc.).  

Forget about any 'Deus Vult' controversy stuff.  The game is not racist nor does it promote a particular religion, but it does put you in the shoes of someone who has a distinct religion and cultural group.  It's up to you to choose how to play it.  The core game is based in medieval Europe, but you can play as a ton of religions and cultural groups.  Some might be harder than others, but they are represented with an eye towards historical accuracy more than balance.",1587087026,1638548627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The complexity and historical content is like no other game. It feels like you're engraving your own mark on history and it is quite a refreshing approach to strategy games. it is extremely intimidating to new players and it takes a while to get into this game so be careful. Paradox is very money hungry with all the dlcs. I would recommend you play it while its free and then buy the dlcs when you feel ready. The dlcs add a whole new layer of content to the game and makes interactions a lot more intriguing. I do wish they would've given older players a dlc or something because they bought the game with money and now it's free just an idea to help keep the player base. The game does lack incentive to go out and take risks and challenges but I think this is just a part of CK2's charm. The game is not constantly badgering you to complete an objective. If you wanna chill and drink tea and watch Constantinople burn as a Viking King, you can or be small english count that will stop at nothing to get to England's throne.

Paradox has created a game that is incredibly complex, and becomes even more complex with every DLC they release. Speaking of DLCs, there are a lot, and the developers make it quite clear what it is you get with each DLC, allowing you to spend your money in a way that satisfies you rather than simply filling the pockets of developers.

Recommended DLCs: The content packs that add music and new portraits/models really add to the feel of the game. Way of Life is one of my favorite DLCs as well, adding new options for every culture. Horse Lords makes life dangerous on the Eurasian steppe, but once you get the hang of the nomadic way of life you'll find your empire growing at an unprecedented rate.

If you're looking for a deep, challenging, complex game, this is the one you're looking for. If you're looking for a game that involves battlefield tactics, though, this is not that kind of game.

2/20/21 edit:  I'm leaving my yes vote as this was a great game when it worked.  It stopped launching for me. 
 From the Steam discussion forums I see this has happened to many others as well.  Some others have been able to find a workaround, but nothing has worked for me.  Also it appears that Paradox has not addressed this issue.  I am uninstalling and removing CK3 from my wishlist.  If this works on your system I still recommend.

I have close to 300 hours into this game now over the last several years and just realized that I never did a review.  There are a lot of other reviews out there so I'll keep this short as I don't have a lot to say that hasn't already been said.  This is more of a ""yes vote"".

It is a bit DLC heavy to get the full game, and I only have a few.  The soundtrack is great and I can't recommend the music enough.  As to gameplay I obviously like it to get as many hours into it as I have.  If you like this sort of strategy game this is a good one to pick up, especially if the price drops after the release of Crusader Kings III and you don't want to pay the high price for that.  I have CK3 on my wishlist, but will probably continue to play CK2 until CK3 has a good sale price.

The good: Crusader kings is as much a story teller as it is a strategy game and the possibilities are endless. Your ruler could be incredibly pious and kind to everyone, or he could be a master seducer who leaves dozens of bastards in his wake. You could be warmongering savages bent on burning civilization to the ground, or you could build incredible centers of learning and bring in the new era centuries ahead of time. As you play, you get to know your families dynamics. You might have an erratic cousin who causes trouble, or a daughter who gets pregnant, or a son who gets killed. And how you deal with all these situations actually matters. It really has a way of making you care about the characters which just makes it all the more dramatic when they die of the plague or accidentally inherit the throne of Italy. If you don't care about the interpersonal politics, then the state politics are just as good. Dealing with insubordinate vassals, declaring wars, building up troops and crushing enemies is all very well fleshed out and dang fun to do. With so much content to play with, its damn near impossible to run out of things to do.

The bad: This game is close to 10 years old now. For its entire life it has been receiving new content updates. That by itself is great! The problem is that the devs have constantly added new mechanics on top of old mechanics. Now this isn't so much a problem for those of us who have been playing the game for years and have had time to gradually learn these new bits as they've come out. Unfortunately, for a new player, having so many things going on at once can be quite intimidating to learn. Often when trying to introduce my friends to this game, they'll lose or be unable to do something and have no idea why, usually because the answer is complex and difficult to understand at first. There is a very steep learning curve to overcome before this game can be even close to fun.

The ugly: As much as I love this game, it has a fundamental problem. As time passes in game more characters spawn in. Familys get bigger. More kingdoms form. The game gets increasingly complex.  You'll notice that after a hundred years the game will noticeably slow down, even on very high end computers. A few hundred years in and even on the max speed setting time will pass at a crawl. Now, credit where credit is due, this used to be a far far bigger problem, bordering on unplayable. The devs put a lot of work into making it better, but its still and issue. The time investment for just one game can be dozens of hours if played to completion.

The verdict: If you can get over the learning curve and you're okay with playing a bit of a slow game, then Crusader Kings has some amazing gameplay to offer.",1636099520,1636099520,True,19,1,0.718116223812103271,0,True,False,False

I only bought it a while ago, so as a complete noob I just decided to play Harold II, King of England. I was under attack by two nations, Norge and the Normans. Both had much larger armies than me and were already on the island. I couldn't get enough troops to attack them so I just frustratingly managed marriages and council positions thinking how hopeless the situation was. 

It was complete chaos. I was deep in dept, thief guilds were popping up in all my holds, factions seeking to dispose me and my line rose up. It seemed England was about to collapse. When suddenly. William the Conqueror has been captured. The main (much larger than mine) force of the Normans had attacked my army while my screen was covered in marriage proposals and had somehow lost, the leader of the army (and country) was captured. 

I executed him quickly, peace was declared. With only one invader left I moved to attack Norge's troops, and beat those too. But Harold IV refused to accept my demands of gold (which I desperately needed), so the war went on for a few months until I finally got that 100% warscore and could get out of debt. Yet it was too late, a total of 4 factions were created specifically focused on disposing me. 

Panicking, I simply imprisoned everyone who joined the factions (Including my own son). Apparently making me a tyrant. The response to this was civil war. (Also I got excommunicated after telling the pope to go fuck himself.) England split into two. Thankfully the rebel half had most of their leaders imprisoned. Executing them crumbled the rebellion, and all that was left were a few holds lead by children.

Unfortunately Harold II was hit on the head while leading the armies and became incapable. Only a few days later, a few servants tried drowning him in his bath, but the guards caught them. So they tried again, and again, and again, and again (They tried drowning him, every single time.) and again until finally they did manage it and my king died. It was too late however, as the civil war had ended the very same day, and England was reunited. Harold II's son is now king, and most people hate him.

It is a generally well designed strategy game where you don't play as a nation, but as a member of dynasty.  Interactions are through personal relationships which is an appropriate twist on the genre.

The replay value is immense, as there is a nearly endless combination of cultures, religions, heresies, government types... character creator, map options, randomizers...and the ability to mod...

It does take a bit of learning to get started, but once you get the basic nuances, its great.  I am still learning new techniques that are driving me to start new play throughs.

This Game random generates better Stories than Netflix and M. night shyamalan ever could. And with all the mods you can keep on going forever.

My favorite overhaul mods are agot (game of thrones) and goa (world of warcraft) wich technically are their own games and bigger than any dlc i ever bought.

Cant do anything wrong here since its free2play!

Just one tip, dont let the UI bother you once youre in you are in. Might need a YT tutorial for the beginning.

2) You understand that this is more of a classic RPG and not a modern action-RPG. Much of the game takes care of itself, your role is at the higher end of govenment. You role is more to guide your county, duchy, kingdom, or empire, not to run it. 

The best part about this game is easily the replay value, there is never a play-through that repeats itself.

[u][i]The Veredict:[/i][/u][/h1]

The game is a really amazing and [b]addictive[/b]. Crusader Kings 2 Is a master in it’s genre. If you're looking for dinasty based management game with INTRICATE diplomacy options, this is it.

[h1]I recommend buying it IF you...[/h1]
[list]
[*]You enjoy pausable strategy game
[*]You enjoy real life historical events and maps
[*]You're looking for that dinasty centered gameplay, rather than a single character or kingdom.
[*]Enjoyed Stellaris and/or TW series, [b] but thought that the diplomacy options there were really bad[/b]
[/list]
[h1]Dont buy it if you...[/h1]
[list]
[*]Can't handle overcomplicated games
[*]Can't handle Paradox DLC policy
[*]Dislike RNG based events and unfairness in start settings
[/list]
[h1]Characteristics:[/h1]
[list]
[*]History Based
[*]Really management driven
[*]Simplistic fights if compared to general RTS or 4X games.
[*]Basically, the core mechanics of Stellaris
[*]Strategy pausable ""real time"" game.
[*]Game really flourishes with DLCs. Most at fair price on sale, I'll list the good ones and why.
[*]Real intricate government systems and diplomatic options.
[/list]

[i]Summary:[/i] Have you ever wanted to be a duke of some feudal county, looking forward to rise into your own kingdom and even maybe empire? Doing that through backstabbing, diplomacy, or even through martial means? Hell, buy Crusader Kings 2!
But if you do, buy it with the Way Of Life DLC. It's a [u]must.[/u]


[h1][i][b]Detailed Rating:[/b][/i][/h1]
[h1]General: [/h1]

[list][*][b]Mechanics: 9/10.[/b] : [b]The game does it's job and it is above average, but hard to learn.[/b]
Amazingly good mechanic, hard to summarize. You'll have a hard time at first, specially if you've never played anything of the sort. I recommend buying it with only [b]Way Of Life DLC[/b], than learn these mechanics. Only they, try new things, as each DLC adds a little more to the game. I bought 3 at the same time and the ammount of content and events almost doubled. Had about only two crashes.
[*][b] Graphics/Interface: 7/10.[/b]: [b]The graphics are smooth and info is well displayed on screen. You'll have some difficulties tho[/b]
I loved the interface and graphics. A lot of different map views, which can give you detailed info on every region, along with soothing graphics. Game is only complete with DLCs, regarding cultural diversity.
[*][b]Content/Surprises: 9/10.[/b] : [b] When you have some important DLCs the game has tons of content[/b]
The game is heavily based on random pop up events, along with possible actions to take. Even with a simple interaction there's so much to do, so many possibilities to try, countless dinasties, challenges, base campaigns and also you can just choose any land owner in the world and play with it in the possible starting ages.
[*][b]Lore/Story: 9/10.[/b] : [b] Historical based events, along with a completely dinamic Europe/Asia/NorthAfrica setting. Amazing[/b]
Specially with [B]Charlemagne DLC[/b], where you get the chronicle feature, where you can check your dinasty's achievmentes and other notable events that occured during that playthrough.
[*][b]Music/Sound: 7/10.[/b] : [b] Music got old quicker than Stellaris. SFX are well put, some will bother sometimes [/b]
Not much to add here. Some environment sounds that may bother you sometimes, sounds based on what tabs are you looking at, which are really pleasing and add most of the flavor to the game. Battle sounds are also pleasing, so most feedback sound is GREAT. The rating goes down because even with the context music, it still gets old quickly and does not feel well paced for the game. I'd rather listen to some podcasts or play some music of my own.
[/list]

[h1]Plus and Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]- Game is heavily dependent on DLC: 5/10.[/b]  : The DLCs are good, and all I've bought till now feel worth [b]on sale[/b], but that I'll vary from buyer to buyer.
[*][b]+ A LOT of achievements: [/b] : It's always a plus for me, but could be a minus for some achievement hunters out there, as you'll need ALL dlcs.
[*][b]-+ Game constantly changes: [/b] : Meta changes, some mechanics will be nerfed, some will be buffed, new things may be introduced.
[*][b]-+The game relies a lot on your roleplaycal[/b] : I have a blast roleplaying my characters, trying new stuff, fitting new personalities, enjoying it's events and adventures in many different ways. That gave me an amazing experience in many playthroughs.
[*][b]+ A lot of historical craziness and events that go from funny to sick as hell 7.5/10[/b]: This is a plus, I can't help it. There's nothing cooler than the aftermath of all the mess you've made on historical events. You can set events to happen on wider random spams, rather than their historical accurate date.[/list]

[*]Way Of Life: Adds focus, which is a +2,+3 buff on primary stat with some other buffs; New diplomatic options
[*]CharleMagne: Earliest starting age; Creating Kingdoms and empires; Annual chronicle, the famous ""annals of history""
[*]Monks and Mystics: Societies, New orders, Relics. Another must have.

HOI3 is too complex and hard while I just lost any motivation in getting into CK2. The medieval setting could have been interesting if it had been more like EU4 where you get claims more easily and the game isn't as obsessed with titles and ""legitimate"" claims. Hold onto your butts because there are a lot of them. If you have not been a staunch republican before playing the game, you will be after CK2. You have to appease the most privileged kings, princes, princesses, dukes and barons and handle them in all kinds of mechanics that you will be dreaming about the French Revolution, eating baguettes and speaking French. Ça Ira! 
If you like the thought of role-playing strategy, Crusader Kings 2 is one of the better ones out there. You can get many random events and many of them are wittily written.

On marketing and financial matters, Paradox has made the base game free, but many of the game's content is hidden behind the dlc paywall. Without a sale it costs several hundreds of squids to get the full game for a game that came out in 2012. So instead of making their old dlcs cheaper, they decided to offer a 5 squid per month subscription for a game that doesn't get new updates and has desync issues in multiplayer mode. I think subscriptions are a slippery slope and many companies will probably take advantage of at the cost of their customers. Paradox are also adding launchers to their modern games that are much worse than what they had before and I don't like seeing ads for dlcs or other Paradox games in-game when I bought the base game. I can't say I'm delighted of the direction Paradox is taking.

Overall I don't recommend CK2. The only thing special about it is the role-playing strategy aspect of the game. If you are into this sort of thing, you might as well check it out. Most people will probably prefer Victoria 2 or EU4 over this though.",1615732839,1626014415,False,5,0,0.536082446575164795,1,True,False,False

That said, CK2 is a game in which you can create and manage a level of inter-dynastic incest that the Habsburgs would find revolting, and commit horrid crimes against God and Nature, and still be named saint by the church. Meanwhile your sister comes into possession of the Necronomicon, and as King Dievas of Finland, you must have the tome for yourself and you kill your sister. If you like stories, and don't mind paying a papal tithe for at least all the major expansions, I would say go for it.

Rating: 7/10

CK2 is a great game. It's not perfect, but it has a wealth of content and much like most Paradox grand strategy games, great replayability.

It focuses more on building your own dynasty and fame for yourself, rather than simply bulding the biggest empire - although that is certainly a valid way to go about it. Unfortunately, it is a bit limited in the roleplaying aspect by a rather limited interactions system, and by over-reliance on randomized events. While it is a lot of fun, at times, you feel like playing a slot-machine - and you, of course, lose more often than win. Considering the rest of the game suffered from this focus on interaction and events and is therefore a bit more simplistic than the other Paradox GS type games, it can be a bit shallow and frustrating to deal with at times.

Still, it is a great window into the life of a medieval ruler, and if you like this type of games, you will easily sink hundreds of hours into it, and it is still one of the best games to roleplay in Multiplayer, where the game really shines, as you can get an actual conversation with your adversaries and allies instead of the limited interactions menu. However, even in singleplayer, the game can still be a lot of fun.

The graphics are passable, given the age of the game, and the genre. Music is pretty good, ambience is as well, but some of it will become annoying pretty quickly and the ability to manage sound types and volumes is a bit limited, the game could use expanded options for audio instead of the very simple ones it has.

Also, I would recommend getting at least the DLCs that expand the roleplaying aspects, such as Conclave, but I cannot recommend the game and DLCs at full price - if you are interested, definitely wait for a discount campaign, they happen often enough.",1622894993,1622894993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing an Earl is a waste of time unless you want to put the game on fast forward and see world events play out.  You can't actually do anything apart from maybe attack your Duke at which point you get stomped.

Playing a King feels like being in a government who privatised and now is held to ransom by unions you can't get rid of.

The whole game is an annoyance of trying to meet criteria in order to do anything which either takes an age or once you do achieve it there is no pay off as it does not affect anything.

In one game England got invaded and the King did nothing, I could not partition him to act or make alliances with others to raise a defence.  I could not partition the attacker to stop or even join them.  Spent the whole game waiting to be taken over.

You can rarely every assassinate or plot to kill any enemies as either it takes far too long or you can rarely get enough support.  You cannot do anything to free capture relatives, I can't invade the county that has them or offer the liege money to set them free.

Money is hard to come by, building and tech are a waste of time.

If you like watching different scenarios of history play out then you might like this game.  If you want war, battles, building empires then it's not.

I gave NO for recommendation simple because ALL of their games have a crazy focus on DLC. and DLC's are often even more expensive then the main game.

I love DLC's with other games, where you actually get every year for a small amount of money a new experience with the old game.

Paradox pricing is ridiculous, it puts you in a hard spot to really really decide if you want to play and love a game, since in the end it will pull money out of your pocket again and again and again (and in a big amount).

No, i will not support this.

I ask everybody to [b][u]just expand the ""content for this game"" part and tell me honestly this is perfectly OK [/u] [/b].

Again, i think they produce high quality games, but their DLC pricing is offensive - i uninstalled all of their games for this reason.

In the year 2019 A.D. I undertook the task of creating The Empire of Britannia in the 700's(Basically, the UK but like 800 years early.) 
- Started as Duke of Mercia (or 'Mercia, as any true patriot will say it.)
- Started to create the Kingdom of England.
- Random nugget head gets the title first.
- I consider invading him.
- I reconsider invading him because of his 10k stack.
- Focus on other smaller counties and create the kingdom of Wales.
- I notice that Nugget head has been losing land to vikings.
- Begins conquest of Ireland.
- Suddenly, England changes color.
- Why?
- Because the vikings got Nugget head and now they have England.
- Keep focusing on Ireland while keeping an eye on the viking threat.
- Half way through Ireland when a bunch of my dukes attack the vikings on their own.
- I applaud their bravery and then jump in with my own men.
- We claim more of England.
- I have become a virtuous paragon by this point.
- People respect me.
- I go insane from reading a book.
- I fire my son twice so my horse can be chancellor...twice.
- I keep trying to conquer England.
- I try seducing a duchess so she'll be my vassel.
- She still doesn't want to be my vassel.
- I wage more war.
- My hair-lipped, lunatic king wants his bloodline to be remembered forever.
- He finishes the conquest of England and Ireland.
- Is named ""The White Knight"" for his virtue and skill in battle.
- Dies 3 days later to sickness.
- Now as his son, I claim the title of Emperor and spend the next 10ish years conquering Scotland to add it to my growing empire.
- After 200 years in game, I finally look over my now complete empire and feel satisfied!
- Then something catches my eye.
- Muslim France?
- I zoom out to look at all of Europe.
- Spain is Muslim
- France/Germany is Muslim.
- Kingdom of Italy is in Poland, not in Italy (and being ruled over by Africans)
- Byzantine Empire is big and has half of Italy.
- Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark are also Muslim.
- Only christian states are the papacy and some random counties in Germany/Poland area that the Muslims haven't claimed for themselves yet.
- Look back at Britannia. 
- Feels small.
- Decides that there can be only one option....

Original:

This is the greatest slice of pie ever. Remember when ck2 first came out and how much it evolved shows that paradox cares. This is an RPG game disguised as a strategy. The stories are amazing, I was a norse werewolf and a found a boy in the wilds raised by wolves, naturally I adopted him as my own and made him my heir his nick name was even wolf. Another game plowed the equivalent of joan of ark and popped out the daughter of satan who proceeded to kill half my dynasty good thing I didnt disown my child, she became queen.

The combat is lacking, you cant really decide what troops make up your troop composition and it usually comes down to who has the bigger stack with a couple exceptions (archers vs heavy infantry. Horse archers OP. Better commanders/actually having one. Terrain,tactics).

The DLCs meanwhile overpriced really pull the game together the only one that you can do without is sunset invasion but I would reccomend it if you decide to export your game over to EU4. 

This has a steep learning curve, when I first got into paradox games I had to learn off EU4 before I could event understand playing this and it sat on my shelf for a long time. Well worth learning, well worth failing, over and over. 

Biggest complaint is the multiplayer, even though there is games up and alot of people play this game you find yourself unable to enter a multiplayer lobby and get kicked constantly without any explanation or reason. When you do get into game there will be the odd time when you cant select your armies or the game bogs out because someone is either running a toaster or lives too far away/has shitty internet. Unlike Eu4 the host will not rehost and will usually continue in spite of you.

edited: changed to negative, too many people support paradox releasing broken as shit games on release, i thought they changed after ck2 and eu4 came out but i guess not. Stop buying raw hamburgers from the burger joint.",1484198824,1619923133,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A niche genre for some, but if you enjoy the genre, you'll probably like the game.
I played the game for somewhere around 500-700 hours before seriously investing in the DLC, mostly in the AGOT (A Game Of Thrones) mod, so while the DLC provide a lot of content, mods can more than make up the difference if you don't want to shell out a rather hefty sum.
My advice is if you are on the fence about it, the base game and mods are completely free. If you enjoy the game in its free form, you can consider if you want to pay for the DLC features, of which there are quite a lot, and subsequently the price tag for the full game is rather high, around $200-300, depending on if you get package deals or sales; prices can vary. 
If you just want to get a taste of the DLC features, the subscription feature seems nice, if you just want a taste of it. If you pay for more than just a few months though, you start having to pay a lot more than if you just bought a few DLC outright. For example, if you pay for the subscription for just over 5 years, roughly 62 months, you will have paid as much in the subscription as if you paid for all DLCs, but once that month runs out, you once again have nothing.
That being said, if you want to play the full experience for just a couple of months, or only occasionally, or want to try the full features before investing $300, the DLC subscription is a great deal.
Full disclosure, I have paid for all major content DLC, and you can see my total hours played. You can really get a lot of enjoyment for the price tag, I personally think that the amount I paid is worth it, as of the time of writing it, the game has cost me roughly $0.14 per hour played, which is a better deal than a lot of other entertainment options, but once again, you have to really like the genre to invest that amount of time in a game, so it's not the best option for people who don't love the genre to invest heavily into the game.",1618962897,1618962897,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It has everything you could wish for in a grand strategy game. Like most Paradox games it has one hell of a learning curve, but for me that's fantastic. You can play this game for a thousand hours and still learn new things, how cool is that? It also has a dark sense of humor, which is quite befitting for the Middle Ages I guess. Want to get posessed by Lucifer himself, sacrifice dwarfs and marry a horse? Sure, why not. Would you rather go wife-swapping as a Viking, kill the pope and duel your own mother into submission? Just an average day am I right.

I do have to talk about the DLC's though. Paradox's DLC policy is probably the second worst in all of Steam (the worst being Train Simulator with over 625 DLC's) Yes, you will have to destroy your life savings account to buy all the DLC because Paradox likes to get their greasy fingers all over your money. Yes, some of these DLC's should be in the base game and Sunset Invasion is basically just a meme. Luckily you can get the Steam keys relatively cheap online for a total of like $50. 

All in all I can definitely recommend CK2, in my oppinion with all DLC's it's still way better and more challenging than CK3. In my oppinion they've dumbed a lot of things down in newer titles.",1618137404,1618137404,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It has completely captivated me, so much so that I've so far spent 1560 hours playing it. And just got my 161st 'Seven Centuries' and last achievement. 

The game itself is a real time grand strategy where the focus is placed on the actual people in your kingdom, and not just warring. It has a very ""Game of Thrones"" element to it where to succeed you have to combine plotting, diplomacy, wars, land management (church, city, county, duchy, kingdom & empire) and execute it perfectly.

When you start, you can select to be a normal lowborn all the way up to emperor. If you select to be the Earl of a single county, you will in most cases report to your liege. You liege reports to his Duke and that Duke reports to his King. Using Marriage and other tricks you can position your family members so that at some point in the game your family inherits more land and titles. Once you have enough power you can then use war to take future land.

Overall this game has endless depth to it and many unique ways to replay it.

The game is very hard to understand at first and you will spend a lot of time on google trying to find out what you are meant to be doing, but once you grasp the methods, it really does come alive.

My only gripe with the game is the DLC is expensive for what you get. Dont buy it up front until you have played through the game enough to understand what you are getting with the DLC.

You will like this game if you enjoyed the Strategy map gameplay in Total War (not the battles) and if you liked Civilisation V. Those games are very simple and casual compared to Crusader Kings 2, so if you found those games hard or boring, then don’t bother playing Crusader Kings 2. If you don’t like slow games with 90% reading, then don’t bother buying this. Otherwise it is excellent and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys grand strategy games.",1606364226,1614577736,True,0,0,0.47348487377166748,0,True,False,False

In my opinion, it's much more interesting to play as a personal ruler than as an impersonal government, and that arguably raises CK2 above any other strategy game. 
The game is quite well balanced between not being too hard or too easy. After you've got a few titles and a dynasty of a decent size, you're unlikely to face a game-over, but expansion is still challenging because of lack of good CBs and abundance of defensive coalitions. 
CK2's world is also really dynamic. Huge empires can suddenly split up when a ruler dies or there is a succesful rebellion. Old alliances and rivalries may change quickly when rulers come and go. Few strategy games have such changeable worlds.
The game also has tons of great historical and fantasy content, like crusades, epidemics, churches, and witches, though much of this content requires you to buy the rather expensive DLCs.
On the negative side, I think that CK2 is a pretty luck-based game. For example, inheritance of good congenital traits, dying of disease, and avoiding hostile plots are often more about luck than skill. You can do almost everything right and still see your amazing character die of a sudden smallpox infection, and you can do almost everything wrong and still suddenly inherit the Kingdom of France. 
It's also quite frustrating that in this game that is all about royal dynasties, you often get just a minor opinion bonus for being of the same dynasty as the ruler of the neighbouring realm. At least you should always be able to ally your kinsmen, even if they are only distant cousins.
Still, CK2 is a game you can easily play for hundreds of hours. Its immersive power, depth, feudalism-based game mechanics, humour, and historical accuracy are amazing. It's a must-try for anyone interested in strategy or role-playing games or medieval history.",1591570943,1614367278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wish I could tell many stories about this beauty of a game, but for the sake of time I'll tell one in the world of Elder Kings (a fantastic Elder Scrolls mod).

I was but an orc boy in a small county to the north west (High Rock for you nerds). My father had died the previous year, a great warrior finally bested in a duel by a rival he had tormented over the years, his enemies took no chances to keep the great man alive. This boy the warrior's son grew in his fathers name. The boy had a mentor, age 65, the same as the one who had once taught his father. He trained and practiced, till one day he grew strong enough to rule, his mentor stood down as regent and sent forth a new era. Once a boy and now a man, he slay the traitor who murdered his father, killed the past, and took his place in the sun. Bolstering his ranks he challenged the might of the Kingdom of Daggerfall in battle, with crushing blows to the enemies flanks he made many sacrifices to the cruel gods that day. Battle after battle and war after war he conquered his enemies, until one day he had achieved his goal, he had conquered all of High Rock and ushered in the Kingdom of Orisinium, a new homeland for all orc-kin. And thus continued his bloodline following his legacy and orsimer tradition each son would challenge his father to combat, the winner would rule and the loser would die. 

And then the crazy CK2 stuff happened. One son who was quite weak killed his father who was a near indomitable force. That son then ruled and all was well for some 20 years, until he was murdered in cold blood by an assassin. Thus his son took the throne, but that son was quite weak and had no chance either, he too was assassinated. Then the next son, only three years of age, he made it but 6 months before he was assassinated as well. That son's Great-Uncle then ruled Orisinium who was promptly killed in combat. At this point the Orisinium vassals were not very content with the state of affairs at which point they removed by bloodline from the throne and placed a more stable one upon the throne. And thus my great bloodline were but mere dukes and it took many hours of gameplay before I was able to reinstate myself as the true rulers of Ork-Kin.

I liked it.

Seriously?

Great way to keep the people who were constantly discriminated against by these EUROCENTRIC societies - forced to live in REAL LIFE POVERTY - from having a shred of escapism from it all.  Not only does Paradox [b]OVERVALUE[/b] DLC in the realm of HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS for a SINGLE GAME, but now they laugh in the face of the underprivileged and rub their own privilege in the face of minorities who face a hostile world - THEY MAKE YOU PAY A SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR CONTENT YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO KEEP.

[h1][b]DLC AS A RENTAL.[/b][/h1]

So now, Paradox is bringing one of the most despicable parts of capitalism into the gaming industry.  You're literally being  taken back fifteen years in history to where you have to RENT your game to enjoy it -  EUROCENTRIC and RACIST as it might be.

Rent is an institution fueled by hate, abuse, and the treatment of human beings as livestock.  Now, they're putting it down as their favored game format.  Tencent - if they at all want to represent the progress proposed by the People's Republic of China - should [b]DUMP[/b] Paradox Interactive.

As someone who has been personally hurt by such far-right policies (celebration of Hitler as the most important ""leader"" in Hearts of Iron IV, watering down cultures and entire races as ""inferior"" as part of game mechanics, and an outright rejection of effort to make African societies in any way ""noble"" beyond simple token existence) Paradox has always had a problem where they LEAP to white-only gaming and racial discrimination against everyone else, price-points just being one part of their systemic Corporate racism. 

What once seemed to be ""Eurocentrism"" has come into full focus as time has gone on.  Post after post glorifying European culture and history - despite how brutal, perverse, and downright mean people were in those days was just the tip of the iceberg.  They have a battalion of rabid [b]Right-Wing extremist fans, now showing themselves even here to insult and harass me for speaking out,[/b] and these people show you how backwards they are with their regular insults.

The truth is that outside of the European and Indo-Aryan cultures, this game is frankly white-centric supremacist propaganda.  Africa has NO detail (and they have had more than enough opportunity to ""SELL"" that detail).  Black characters are not treated with unique love and admiration as the white kings are, and one of the richest men in African and frankly, WORLD history - Mansa Musa - is barely depicted as a footnote in by this overwhelmingly Eurocentric extremist company.

If Genocide of races and racist game mods are tolerated in Stellaris, and if mass-murder and outright cultural discrimination and celebrated - even encouraged - colonization of ""inferior"" cultures are a staple of games like Europa Universalis (itself Universal Europe - the raw definition of white supremacy) then WHAT, dare say, does a game like CKII offer?

ZERO beauty from race mixing.  ZERO celebration of diversity.  Just carbon copy, after carbon copy, of predominantly white superiors 'owning' people in shades of brown; not historically accurate in the slightest.  Some might want to make the argument that Asian cultures are overpowered, but let's be real - they're tokens, just like the Aztec Invasion DLC is a cheap shot at false representation for Latin American peoples of mixed ancestry.

In short?  This game was designed by racists, for racists.  It is absolutely despicable the lack of effort put into making African nations a playable, fun atmosphere, and the lack of effort to make them anything more than a token feature to be colonized by the Europeans to the north.

And now, yet another feature by Paradox to discriminate against people of color and those stricken with poverty has arisen.",1613879592,1613919332,False,8,9,0.339378148317337036,10,True,False,False

CK3 is a really good game.   It wasn't released in the same bare boned DLC hell fashion like all their prior releases (Stellaris, EU4, HOI4, and I:R).

First, CK2 is the definition of DLC Hell.  All the DLC's added together for an 8 year old game is insanely high.  So, instead of doing the smart thing and lowering the prices or creating a overall bundle that is cheaper than currently buying all the DLC's, they decided on a subscription model.  This does two things:

1) It alienates people who have already bought some of the DLC's but can't afford the rest, so they are getting far less value in this subscription than someone who has never bought a single DLC for this game.  That's terrible, but #2 is far worse...
2)  It shows potential customers that they shouldn't buy Paradox's games & DLC because Paradox could just do a subscription model instead, which is cheaper overall.  That's a death knell to a company's immediate profits.

Crusader Kings II is yet another grand strategy game made by Paradox Interactive. It's set in medieval Europe, with parts of Africa, the Middle East, and India as well. You play as a ruler and attempt to make your way to the top and stay in power through intrigue, brute force, and diplomatically useful marriages. Your main goal is to keep your dynasty going, managing your families almost like chess pieces as you strategically marry people off or even give them their own provinces. You rise through the ranks the more counties you conquer, eventually going from a lowly count to an emperor with an empire spanning all of Europe. However, you can select to play as really anyone, already starting as an emperor, so long as your DLC permits it (we'll get to this later). This game is very RPG-like with a mix of strategy as you experience many scenarios ranging from being invaded to having the Black Plague at your door step. You'll find yourself assassinating rebellious dukes, being assassinated yourself, declaring holy wars, preparing invasions, and killing off entire dynasties to ensure your heir will make it to the throne of a nearby kingdom. 

You'll gain and lose traits as your rule goes onward, juggling between how much power you want to grant your vassals, and how you want to expand your kingdom. Unlike some of Paradoxes' other games, this one is very automated. You can have your vassals fight your wars for you without even controlling any units, or take over entire kingdoms through careful marriage planning alone. This isn't to say that the game is easy to understand (the tutorials are almost always useless), but once you get the hang of it you'll find yourself having a grand time. The DLCs allow you to expand your options immensely, being able to eventually play as everyone and unlock many brand new mechanics. That is the inherent problem with the game though. There are so many DLCs that many do not want to fork over the hundreds of dollars required to gain access to all the content. And it is abundantly clear that Paradox cuts off content that makes it harder for you to enjoy the game as new DLCs are released. However, the mods can make up for a lot of this, and you might be able to catch it on sale. Overall, I love this game so much that even the predatory DLC policy Paradox has can't prevent me from recommending it.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Completely engaging gameplay that really makes you feel like a medieval ruler
[*]Fun RPG mechanics to prevent the game from getting dry
[*]Massive world for you to conquer
[*]You'll find yourself making your own stories and messing around to create interesting scenarios
[*]Every game feels different
[*]It's a lot of fun to build up your dynasty
[*]Workshop content is superb
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Predatory and disgusting DLC policies of Paradox Interactive
[*]Hard for beginners 
[*]So much content is locked off or even taken away from you as a result of DLCs
[*]AI can act extremely strange 
[*]There does come a time where you become so powerful the game becomes monotonous
[*]No water DLC
[/list]

[b] Update 2/18/21: Paradox has recently added a subscription element to this game. I am appalled but not surprised. Instead of adjusting their DLC policies (like not making you pay 5 dollars to cut your character's hair in game), they are now setting a dangerous precedent in order to gain a ""passive income"". They even acknowledge they went too far with how much DLC they put in here, but are instead making you pay for it and are going to take it away if you don't constantly renew the subscription instead of adjusting prices. I can no longer in good faith recommend this game, even if it's free. [/b]",1568931181,1613703421,False,1,0,0.520905971527099609,0,True,False,False

The Best Memelord game you will ever play!",1612071438,1612071438,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

At first i was checking this out, then started to get dlc and some magic happened. I was enjoying a game about a map where you click buttons, not only enjoying but having the time of my life. I missed parties to play this, i missed graduation, damn almost sad but it baffles me how hooked i was into this apparently weird and strange game. 

I have the entire dlc collection. But i did not bought it all, i think i started when The Republic came out, and every dlc i would purchase. Most i like with the exception of Conclave and Sunset Invasion. About the game: 10/10. You won't regret this. But we must talk dlc because the barebones game is.....imagine the difference between a desert and a beach hotel. So let's get into it. 

From personal experience, this is the most addictive game you'll ever find in the world, no questions asked. But a word about dlc: Yes it is essential. And i'm sad that you are just picking it up now. I grew along with this game so it was not a thorn in my wallet. It may be in yours. In any case, if you have the money, everything is worth it, but not the songs nor Conclave. Conclave essentially makes the game harder without making it better. This is the one thing that main ruin your experience and take this game from 10/10 to a big fat 0/10. 

So what do you do in it? You roleplay as a person  (ANY PERSON IN THE MAP) and your goal? make your dynasty survive tru the middle ages. Whatever you want to do you can, it's insane the amount of stuff you can do. The amount of ppl you can be, the amount of roles you can play. If you have any semblance of imagination, you'll see your character in the flesh doing his things while only clicking buttons. Game relies heavily on your imagination and it somehow works. It like a D & D party but everything is set up. But a word: this game, like any, has rules, A BUNCH OF RULES. You will only learn by doing it, so do it. 

I recommend to anyone that has free time. Simply a masterpiece, and altho CK 3 did refine the UI, it has no content compared to CK 2. A toddler vs The Rock. I hate nostalgia dudes that say older are better but in this case, yes, older is better. 

To end this: Get most essential dlc and dive in. If you don't get 300 hours at minimum i swallow my words. This is THE GAME.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I thought it would be a game like Civilization or SimCity.  It wasn't either, so it just wasn't my kind of game.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Pretty much everything.  It was also a lot to learn which I couldn't wrap my head around.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I didn't like it, at all.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.

Unfortunately, I'm a Mac user and apparently Paradox does not care much about Mac users in general. The new Mac OS update was released in JULY (!!!) and CK2 has been incompatible with this OS and does not work AT ALL. It's mind boggling that an OS as widely used as Mac is not compatible with the game especially since this game is advertised as being compatible with the Mac OS. So the hundreds of euros I've invested into this game are now worthless because the game does not start at all. Paradox looks like is content with keeping this game broken for Mac users as it has been that way for MONTHS. It's massively disappointing but actually not surprising as we all know Paradox treats their customers like shite. I love CK2 and many Paradox games but I can no longer trust them to provide the products they advertise as shown by this debacle.

One'll buy a game, or be the newer people who got CK2 free. Play it awhile, probably have fun with it. But then the player will inevitably run into an accidental conversion and they can no longer play as that character because they don't have the DLC. So they buy the DLC, it's fun and there's more to do. Maybe more are bought or only when the same thing happens with another religious group or something. But then with some DLCs you'll notice cosmetic changes (particularly for Europeans) and want to get more to other groups because they don't quite look right despite what their actual race or ethnicity is. So you buy more DLC if you can afford it or you decide to say ""Fuck it, i'm not buying more."" which is exactly what I am doing.
Which sucks because i'll either have to drop it entirely, go sailing or just deal with my ""Borian 'Stonewall' De Tyrone"" looking hilariously ugly compared to some of his neighbors or having Africans (which are heavily featured for obvious reasons in ATE) that don't look African, in fact pretty much every non-white character sort of has generic brown face syndrome - I think I have like two different sorts though.

Now let me be clear, the developers should be applauded for this masterpiece of a game. All the people who have slaved hours and hours of their life away on this deserve so much credit. I think that it is the publishers, Paradox Interactive who is at fault since they have split up this game into multiple DLC's. That being said, I would still recommend this game. There are very few games I have played like ck2, and I think that the best way I would recommend playing this game is to focus on your characters story. Feel free to take over a country, poison your brother, take Jerusalem as a christian and then convert to the Muslim faith. Have fun in the game, since it offers a surprising amount of freedom for a game that can at times feel restrictive. For example, I joined a satanic cult (seemed like a cool thing to do at the time) and after murdering the head of the cult, I became the new leader. However I was discovered by someone in my court, and for the rest of my life, I had to bribe the pope so he wouldn't attack me. While I did this, I was constantly attacked by assassins, but luckily I had a ample supply of children to sacrifice in my place... moving away from that, have fun with the game.

Stayed for all the stories you can tell yourselves (as random events keep firing ingame) and ruthless (and sometimes gamey) diplomacy. This game filled a niche for players like me, that liked the ideas behind Total War, but wanted to focus more on the strategy layer rather than the tactics of each battle. Also, many (and some crazy) mods that take advantage of the medieval setting.
Expensive as f*** because, why not partition all the cool stuff they could have implemented at release (or at most in up to 2 major expansions) into a dozen mini-DLCs??!!

PROS:
- Too many to list. I'll just remind everyone of the amazing modding community out there. Game of Thrones, Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, Tolkien's Middle-earth, The Witcher, Warhammer and even Forgotten Realms have mods. Numerous mods that change the map, too, such as NMIH (Japan), Romance of the Three Kingdoms (China) and the wacky After the End (North America)

CONS:
- Too many DLCs (don't get the unit/song packs, edit music/songs.txt and use your own files, I know I did! Also, Sunset Invasion is just for the lolz), but you'll probably want all the rest (maybe not Rajas of India, but they always get you with the added gameplay extras for existing content)
- There should have been more deterministic mechanics and less RNG-based ones (while incompetent rulers/nobles were a real thing, you will always be plagued by the sheer percentage of useless characters generated by esentially dice-rolls. By comparison, the fixed stats physicians that were later introduced were superior in almost every aspect - hence they usually were elected as successors when there was no heir. There are other aspects: you can get lucky and convert a county to your religion in 1-2 years. Other times you can wait for decades and nothing will happen. All because you rolled dice!)
- No naval battles. It simplifies a lot of stuff, but it is ahistorical (I'm looking at you, vikings, merchant republics and the Mediterranean! Also, who the hell decided to tie river navigation to religion? Yeah, that stuff was added retroactively, alright)
- Court intrigue is minimal and there is little power dynamics inside a kingdom if you know what to do (you can literally give entire duchies to nobodies, while claimants to titles need to get lucky to be sponsored by a more powerful liege if they ever want to get something back. Also the JUST DO IT! meme for assassination plots is hilarious - intrigue is more of 1-2 time thing rather than something to focus your entire playthrough on)
- Strong dynasties never really die off in-game (the Carolingians/Karlings being a most egregious example)
- Too many things grounded in the de-jure setup (hence events to shoe-horn in interesting stuff happening. Yeah, the Mongol's success in East Europe had nothing to do with a cummulation of political, military, technological and sometimes personal factors. No, it was because God spawned them at the edge of the map with hundreds of thousands of non-reinforcing troops which they will always run out of by the time they reach Hungary! On that note, don't even get me started on how artificially the Magyars settling in Pannonia is handled... or the entire tribal to feudal transition, for that matter)
- India never really does anything interesting and is more of a memory hog if you are not looking to play/expand there (hence Rajas of India may be viewed as optional DLC)
- Rather simplistic view of medieval history of Europe (and it shows in the lacking historical research for some places) so don't expect to have an accurate representation of your particular country's history. It is a decent effort, but the fact that the CK3 map is already more detailed than the CK2 map is kind of telling.
- Even after all these DLCs, there is no fully fledged random map generator (the things you can randomize with the generator of the Holy Fury DLC is the de-jure setup. You'll still be playing in the geography of Europe, with the same cultures - though who wants to play with Italians in Tibet and West Africans in Pomerania? Thank goodness you can keep the historical culture setup)
- No real mechanics for the evolution of cultures of one into the other. The genesis of the English culture was rather logical if you look at the succession of historical events, but it is not that frequent in-game. Nor is there an alternative provided (which is why you'll get Anglo-Saxon culture a lot when converting to EU4). There is no need for an event that checks for specific conditions here, there should have been actual code here that handles these mechanics seamlessly!",1609428773,1609428773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some things to note: CK2 is extremely incomplete without its DLCs and the real price you're paying for a decent medieval psychopath sim is much higher than the sticker price of the base game. The learning curve is also rather steep - 10 hours into the game and you'll likely still be scratching your head a lil trying to understand the mechanics. This game does not force progression on you, so if you have trouble staying interested in games that don't give you goals, this likely isn't for you. There's also a LOT of micro as the game progresses, although you're able to control this to some extent by just ignoring members of your court whose line you don't want to propagate. Keeping these things in mind, CK2 is a highly replayable and surprisingly deep game once you get into things. You get to screw over the Karlings, become the antichrist, restore Rome, unite India, revive dying Iranian religions... whatever you can think of, really.

If you love history, this is for you.
If you love strategy, this is for you.
If you ever wondered ""How might I have done if I had been born way back then?"", this is for you.

I discovered this game on accident after being the biggest fan of Europa Universalis III way back in the day, and at first this game threw me off a little bit. It felt odd investing so much time, money, prestige, etc. investing in counties, duchies, and even developing entire regions...just to see it all vanish from my grasp from an election that didnt go my way, or through a formerly strategic marriage producing an heir that wasnt mine, or from my chosen heirs simply dying and leaving me with no one from my dynasty left qualified to rule!

HOWEVER, after giving this game a few more tries, and no longer thinking simply in terms of ""What is best for my Nation-State?"" as one would in EUIII or EUIV, I began to understand that I needed to think how a true patriarch of the middle ages would think...""What is best for me, my family, and my dynasty?""...and thats where the real fun began. Years later, while still a major fan of the Europa Universalis series (as my combined many thousands of online and off-line sessions would attest to) I have realized that the Crusader Kings series is much more my style, and leaves me feeling more appreciative of the experience.

If you cannot afford to buy, or your system just cannot play CKIII, then please download CKII. Its free, its fun, and if you find the funds to get some of the expansions it just makes it so much more worth nearly any other gaming experience. Dont bother wasting money getting expansions that come and go like Destiny, which wont be around in the next 5-10 years. Instead, invest your time and effort into a real experience that will keep rewarding you time and again for as long as you would like...much like CKII did for me for nearly a solid decade after I finally purchased it.

I will never be able to recommend this game enough, but if you have the ability to do so then I highly recommend browsing all of the various Paradox studios games. They cover history, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. Games like Europa Universalis, Imperator: Rome, Hearts of Iron, Stellaris, A Game of Dwarfs, and so much more, including the newest up and comer Empire of Sin which focuses on the American Gangsters of the early 20th century!

The price of the full experience(DLC) is too much, before the base game was free it was over £200, for a game that looks like a spreadsheet more then a medieval simulator this is too much.

Yes it's true that the base game is free but i feel that is only testament to how this situation has gone out of control, if the game was only half the price that it is now then i would recommend it. As you can see i have 2000 hours in this game and intend to have 2000 more, the game can truly captivate you and suck you in for hours.

Fair warning though - it does start with a very steep learning curve, and the tutorial is not great, and can often break if an unexpected in-game event happens - honestly, I found the best way to learn was to start as a minor power in Ireland in 1066, and just try to learn by playing.

I like to think so, even though the dlc is getting a little out of hand. But if you like grand strategy it should be a must buy, regardless of the abundance of dlc. I've gotten all of them apart from Sons of Abraham and I must say they were worth every penny, though if you are just starting out with the series, I'd just recommend getting the standard version (or just try the demo). My reasoning for this is that the dlc adds to the learning curve of the game and if your new it could be a little overwhelming.

The Base Game:

So you start the game by picking a nation and family of your choice or creating one with the creator, which tends to sometimes make the game more difficult because you have no existing relations and family when you begin. Once you've chosen your nation you're thrown into the game's main screen, the map. From there almost everything will happen, so don't expect any fancy battles like in the total war series. Though CKII makes it up by putting so much thought into the strategic mode, like for instance diplomacy. It's one of the only games where I've seen diplomacy count as a valid strategy for actually winning the game.  The reason why is because your family will be the most important thing to manage in the game and one diplomatic mistake could even cost you the game and your lineage, be it to a civil war or a marriage.

I remember one multiplayer game where I was playing Lombardy and a friend of mine was trying out the vikings. He just kept harassing me which drove me to the point where I would start a plot. Plots are “diplomatic” ways of achieving something, like killing someone. (you can see where this is going). So after the millionth raid on my lands (and stealing my daughter and only heir) I started the plot to kill of their leader and I succeeded rather rapidly. My friend was left wondering who could have killed him. Now his nation was ruled by a nine year old and a douchebag uncle as his regent who wanted to kill the boy as well. I effectively knocked him out of the game with the use of “diplomacy” and greasing some palms as he tried to regain stability inside his own country.

So, is the game just a diplomatic simulator? Heck no. If you want to crush your enemies with the power of your armies, be my guest, but be wary of the unrest. Your military consists of different brigades of units who are raised in their home province. So for instance, I raise the London army and I'd get all units from the London province in a stack. You can do this for every province you own, thus raising your army. But beware of raising them to long because your vassals could get upset at you or you could go bankrupt.

And lastly, let's not forgot this one: Religion. In the base game it's pretty dull if you compare it with the dlc but it's still better then most other games. Ever wanted to set up an anti-pope, dethrone the existing pope and be the papal controller? Now you can. Or you could just ignore the church overall but beware their dangerous sting in the form of excommunication. Each religion also has their own bonuses and modifiers attached to them as well as a special something like for instance the ability to ask the pope for a crusade on your preferred target or to reform the Orthodox Christian faith.

And last but not least: The decisions! The base game has quite a few events that tend to pop up every now and again, which can make you life sweeter or a living hell. You can also, for instance, pass a no-alcohol law to boost the productivity of your people but at the same time you make them less happy. Almost every choice has a good and bad thing that'll happen. And lastly you've got the mayor decisions which are highlighted in the decisions menu, like form Great Britain with england, once you've conquered the isles.

The expansions:

Sword of Islam:
For starters it makes the Islam factions playable. Once you start a game with them you'll notice a few new things, like the decadence meter. This meter is quite important to manage unless you want a civil war to tear apart your empire. As a Muslim you'll have to manage your family very carefully since you can take up to four wives, which produces a whole lot of offspring and managing a large family is quite hard in CKII. And lastly they also added combat traits for your generals, like an extra bonus to hill defense or he might be a good infantry leader, which opens up a whole new level of military strategy in the game.

Legacy of Rome:
A must buy if you love roman/byzantine history. This expansion has a mayor focus on the Byzantine empire but changes a few base things as well. You can now have factions within your nation, like the court faction or the religious faction. These factions represent different aspects of your civilization and they all like and hate different things, so I usually end up trying to balance favor between the factions as to anger none. Secondly you've got the addition of standing armies, which are armies that don't need to be disbanded in times of peace. This is quite handy if you get surprise attacked, but I find them less useful then just your normal army, because eventually the standing armies will get too small and insignificant to matter, even though they grow throughout the game. But my most liked feature of this expansion is the possibility to re-create the roman empire in all it's glory. Imagine the glory...

Sunset Invasion:
Not much to say about this one... If you like alternate history it's a must-buy. The expansions is centered around the Aztec empire invading Europe, instead of the other way around, which usually provides some interesting and hilarious scenarios. Like for instance The Isles being taken by the Aztecs and them building a giant temple on the banks of the Thames after sacrificing most of it's people. It's also quite challenging to try and beat them back because they have gargantuan armies, so if you like a challenge, you should get this dlc as well.

The Republic:
Ah the republic... I had some great times with this one. The republic adds the trading civilizations as playable nations, like Venice, Genoa and The Hansa. Your task here is to accumulate the most money possible by building trading posts all around Europe and trying to stay the dominant family within your nation. There will be elections, feuds and wars between the traders to be able to establish the greatest trade empire there ever was and ofcourse don't forget the counts, dukes and kings around you trying to snatch your gold away. 

The Old Gods:
This expansion is centered around the viking raiders but it also makes every pagan playable (including the Mongols and Aztecs) and the Zoroastrians. In this expansions they also added a new date to start from to the game: 867 AD, which is a whole lot earlier then the base game. As a viking you'll be able to plunder cities without any mayor reprimand from the nation you're pillaging, since it counts as a temporary war or you could call for an invasion against a nation which, over time, bolsters the amount of troops you can muster. But if that wasn't enough and you'd like a challenge, try playing the Zoroastrian faction and rebuilding the old faith.

So this was my review and thoughts on CKII and it's dlc, I hope you enjoyed it!

I thought that because I was good at Empire: Total War (a game I completely despise now) I could play CKII. However, I found myself unable to comprehend that I needed a justification to go to war and that my treasurey wasn't infinite. It stayed with forty minutes of playtime until I wanted to play it again after constantly seeing its rave reviews. I watched seven and a half hours of a tutorial series and eagerly started to play. All of a sudden, it seemed so easy to get a justification for war and manage my realm. This is the epitome of a grand strategy game. It is so immersive yet so expansive. As I write, I'm blowing off studying for an economics final to watch tutorials for other Paradox games. You can easily lose yourself in CKII; I racked up these 112 hours in the last two months. For those of you who have no experience with Paradox games, it is a must to watch tutorials, or else you'll be lost. This game requires that you commit to understanding it, but will in turn deliver one of the best grand strategy games of all time.

Este vídeo juego queda en mi bibliateca para casí dos años porque no sabía como jugarlo. Pensaba que porque sabía jugar Empire: Total War pudiese jugar CKII. Sin embargo, me encontré incapaz de entender que necestiaba una justificación para una guerra y mi tesorería no era infinito. Quedó con cuarenta minutos de jugar hasta que querría jugarlo otra vez despues de viendo revistas postivos. Ví seís y media horas de un serie de tutoriales y comencé jugar. De repente, me parece tan facíl ganar una justificación para una guerra y administrar mi reino. Este es el epítome de un gran juego de estraegia. Es tan inmersivo pero todavía muy extenso. Mientras escribo, estoy saltando el estudio para mi examen final de económicas para ver tutoriales para otros vídeo juegos de Paradox. Puede perderse facilmente en CKII; accumulé estas 112 horas en los dos meses pasados. Para los que ya no tienen experiencia con vídeo juegos de Paradox, necesitaría ver tutoriales, o se perderá. Este vídeo juego exige que se comprometa a entenderlo, pero, a su vez, entregará uno de los mejores juegos de gran estraegia de todos los tiempos.

You will find moments in this game where your nobles and vassals are absolutely bonkers, and you wonder why you even bother bailing and ransoming them out of prison when they somehow manage to get captured by raiders coming from the east. 

You will spend HOURS on this game, sometimes entire days building up intrigue and a dynasty to span the ages, but keep in mind. Your wallet will build up dust, as you realize you have spent over one hundred to two hundred dollars financing what is really just a glorified torture simulator with extra steps. You will cry, break, or suffer anxiety listening to the thousands of unique death noises as each and every one of your nobles, family, and friends all die horrible deaths.

Come for the strategy,

quit when the same old shady elusive shadow schemer keeps plotting your death, even after you've awarded him nearly every duchy, county, or special title in your demense.

UPDATE
i am now playing a mega campaign after buying eu4 and this game is looooooong, at about 200 years i stared to add mods and use console commands to make things more intressting like placing my uncle as king of spain who loved me but he made ally with britian and france and im allied with wenish empire, byzantine and some nomadic tribes, btw im like hre but made custom empire using dlc and started a war after i imprisoned his daughter who was my cousin daughter. then my second wife assassinated her for no reason then he killed my wife because they hated each other so i got depressed and so decided i was going to war because my wife was genius and attractive this resulted in world war as i installed a mod called chain friendship or some shit and it causes all allies of allies to get the option to join and so a huge war started between me, wendish, byzantine, bulcan, russia, moldovia, lithuania, vs spain france britain italy and one of the sunni empires .

this war lasted 10 years and was pretty even,my uncle had a larger military but i had 25 martial and had high technology, he killed my brother so i landed in his captial kidnapped his family and killed them. then he made a large attack across the western front but stopped at the rhein when he eventualy crossed it was my 30k with reinforcements of 19k wendish and i saw then 40k byzantine stack was close who didnt come to help. but he had 60 k with 7k french reinforcements, with almost double what we had, he crossed and the battle was going baddly but i met my uncle on the battlefield by using increased battle duels mod and we fight, this went on for ages and he dodged i swinged he blocked etc until i killed him and finally won the battle my daughter became the new empereor through incest and she peaced out and iv never had a experience when i cared about a character dying this much in a game and was like game of thrones, and if you like any fanatsy genre buy this fucking game, and mod it to shit to make it your game and what u love, if u need to cheat or mod do it coz this game is great with your own experience and stories

But it's frigging impenetrable. 30 hours put into it, and I still don't [i]really[/i] know what I'm doing. I know, git gud, right? Right. So I've been watching hours long youtube videos, I've been reading articles on train rides, I've been banging on the door, but nothing's letting me in.

I've played this game in two chunks, and I know that, last time I played it, I did get on top of it somewhat and was successfully developing my dynasty.. but whatever I cotton'd on to that time, I've lost it this time. Mumu? Starting isle? I only own one province and my starting levies are a pea compared to the scottish raiders who mount Ireland from the first damn turn. India? Start on present day Sri Lanka trying to capture the sub continent? Too bad, you'll have a warning that you'll lose land on death, your inheritance options are all locked out, and nobody on the interweb has a suggestion for you. They all just say ""change your inheritance laws"".

I've been debating how to review this game. I love this game. The time I've spent failing at it has been engrossing as hell, and I love the historical orgasm that it is... I've bought DLC with stars in my eyes, I've started new families with complex plans... but for real, it's just too much.

Unless you want to study like a demon and get on top of this game, it's a waste of money, and if possible you'd probably get more fun out of playing Empire: Total War. I know, elitists will tell me to git gud, but I tried as hard as anyone and this game just hasn't shown me anything.

The only thing I didn't enjoy so much was the many dlc's that you have to buy but I suppose that only the expansions and such are really neccesary so if you cut out all of the other frivelous things then it's not so bad. The base game is actually very enjoyable on it's own to be honest. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy this sort of thing or even if you're not sure and just want to satisfy curiosity.

Paradox Interactive, the swedish company behind crusader kings has a monetization scheme/system that has them release games where a lot of content is created long after launch in DLC's. Some of these DLC's are well worth your money but most are not, the asking price is just too high sometimes.

Crusader Kings 2 is a game about living through a family/bloodline in the early medieval period anywhere in the 'old world' from europe to north africa to india and the steppes. You attempt to lead this family and the nation/area they control through successful generations through the centuries. The attempt will often fail, as random events or history has a way of keeping you from world domination. This game unlike EU4 and HOI4 is less about the attempt to make your country as powerful as possible and more about seeing what happens. 

Its the journey more than the destination kinda game. The interface and many mechanics leaves me to not recommend this to anyone but the sweatiest of people. Also there is a new crusader kings out now, which might be easier to pick up however I have not played it so I can't say for sure.

If you have many many hours to waste and love family drama shows set in the middle ages then this might be the roleplaying game for you. Otherwise it might be one to skip.",1505662098,1605321220,False,7,0,0.385788857936859131,0,True,False,False

CK2 eats a lot of time, and costs a lot of money because the DLC are necessary.
Most of my hours played are afk, and i haven't finished a game, because i always end up just forgetting it's running. This process usually starts with me away from the game window trying to read forums or wikis for how in-game stuff works.

The inability to set CK2 to sanely pause on many events is it's biggest flaw relative to EU2.

CK2's biggest advantage over other current EU-based franchises is it's story generation.

Games to consider instead:
If you are happy to lose a lot of money over time: CK3
If you want long form multiplayer strategy with character and no added expenses: Dominions 5

An enemy ship destroyed my viking ship after about 40-50 years of doing this and I was completely unable to make more ships or even find out HOW to make more ships.

The incest taboo is one of the most widespread of all cultural taboos, both in present and in past societies.[3] Most modern societies have laws regarding incest or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages.[3] In societies where it is illegal, consensual adult incest is seen by some as a victimless crime.[4][5] Some cultures extend the incest taboo to relatives with no consanguinity such as milk-siblings, step-siblings, and adoptive siblings, albeit sometimes with less intensity.[6][7] Third-degree relatives (such as half-aunt, half-nephew, first cousin) on average have 12.5% common genetic heritage, and sexual relations between them are viewed differently in various cultures, from being discouraged to being socially acceptable.[8] Children of incestuous relationships have been regarded as illegitimate, and are still so regarded in some societies today. In most cases, the parents did not have the option to marry to remove that status, as incestuous marriages were, and are, normally also prohibited.

A common justification for prohibiting incest is avoiding inbreeding: a collection of genetic disorders suffered by the children of parents with a close genetic relationship.[9] Such children are at greater risk for congenital disorders, death, and developmental and physical disability, and that risk is proportional to their parents' coefficient of relationship—a measure of how closely the parents are related genetically.[9][10] But cultural anthropologists have noted that inbreeding avoidance cannot form the sole basis for the incest taboo because the boundaries of the incest prohibition vary widely between cultures, and not necessarily in ways that maximize the avoidance of inbreeding.[9][11][12][13]

In some societies, such as those of Ancient Egypt, brother–sister, father–daughter, mother–son, cousin–cousin, aunt–nephew, uncle–niece, and other combinations of relations within a royal family were married as a means of perpetuating the royal lineage.[14][15] Some societies, such as the Balinese[16] and some Inuit tribes,[17] have different views about what constitutes illegal or immoral incest. However, sexual relations with a first-degree relative (meaning a parent or child) are almost universally forbidden.[18]",1603168710,1603168710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:
- Hard to avoid micromanaging at larger empire sizes, making the late game slow at times.  Power through!
- The bug where defensive pacts break down when you close and restart the game.  I don't want to exploit it, so I rarely close them game (hence the 7597 hours of gameplay).

Plus:
-Unique in that it goes over a long period of time and you play many characters.

Minus:
-Greedy DLC overcharging.
-Base game gets boring and droppable.
-Combat is lame, Total War is more interesting in this regard and a better option if you are interested in tactics over strategy.

It is, in theory, an amazingly deep game based on a level of historical facts that are rarely seen in any video games. But sadly, as soon as you start playing it, it just becomes a big blurry mess in which you are left guessing what exactly is going on?! And when you do figure out most of it, you just realize how random and boring this game actually is.

A great idea for a deep realistic historical game, but which is completely messed-up by an impressive lack of direction, information, and organization. And it is now more than time that we start giving them some thumbs-down, as trying to reward a good 'intent' does not excuse, nor fixes, such a poor execution.

It feels like mad scientists with very weird, complex, and confused brains created a game filled with spectacular data, but which sadly ends-up to be just a blurry mess without any true guidance or structure. 

Have you ever sat in your Doctor's office listening to him explaining you something with very sophisticated words and going: ""Wow!

*Original 2013* If you are a fan of the Civ series (as I was) this will forever ruin that series for you.

WIth the inclusion of the Ironman mode and Steam achievements (taken from Paradox's other great strategy game, Europa Universalis IV) there is even more to strive for.  Paradox has impressed me so much over the last two years that I consider them the flagship for strategy games in our time.  Cannot highly recommend enough!  **Word of caution** This game has a STEEP learning curve.  It does not hold you hand and just throws you into medieval Europe to fight for your own.  Do not let this turn you off.  Watch videos and read the forums, there is a great community out there waiting to welcome you into the fold.  Also this game is hardly about WINNING than it is SURVIVING.  You will lose.  Its part of what makes the game great.  One wrong decision will ruin you and that is what I crave in a strategy game.

Ever fancy yourself the benevolent leader of a nation in the Middle Ages? Do you like intrigue & role-playing a multitude of characters over several hundred years while painting maps in your nation's color and working to put your dynasty in charge of the world? Does the ability to randomly slaughter innocents because they might eventually have a claim on some of your land motivate you? Then CK2 is for you!

Seriously, the game is terrific, and has been lovingly cared after by the developers in its 8 1/2 years since release.
Not every decision has been perfect, and the game isn't for everyone (I'd liken it to a strategic Dungeons & Dragons w/o magic), but the product today is pretty good and FREE.

That being said, once you play, you'll be enticed by the DLC, of which there are TONS in 3 categories: Great near-needed expansions, art & music changes, and expansions that are only of interest after you've mastered & bored of the game.
The first type is expensive but regular sales make them worthwhile if you can catch them. The second are ok if you want some extra flavor in the game. The third...well, you'd really best be a diehard CK2 fan before you even consider them.

I've had this game since it was first released and they will simply not stop releasing new content, it's fantastic! 

There is a very steep learning curve playing paradox games, but once you get past the information overload you won't regret it. The charm of the vast range of storylines you may get will massively make up for the time spent learning the game.

Just buy it, it's great.

He thwarts that assassination attempt as well. My heir, some kinsmen of mine starts a plot to kill me. I ask him to end the plot, he says no. 2 months go by and I'm travelling down a highway, see some ""highway men"", funny, they look like the highway men that tried to kill my husband.

But there is a cost involved, some of the dlc, while not required is a must if you truly want to enjoy the game. And this is my first issue with this game, the time required to learn it and the cost upfront in order to play it. 

I have played catholic rulers and they suck, you have to ask the pope for divorcing your wife if she is old, gets bedridden and cursed by the black death. Screw that, I want to play as a germanic pagan ruler and make my own religion. Playing as a viking in the 867 AD is way more fun than playing some sterile feudal ruler with no claims and it becomes a waiting game to get claims. Every ruler is always free to attack another ruler of a different religion because, ""who cares"" so by playing a germanic you can basiclly attack anyone in the entire game. Because you can subjugate your own realm, say Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia you vassalize. And this is fun, starting out as a nobody and climbing your way up the prestige ladder and becoming a larger and stronger empire. I will say however that doing catholic crusades are awesome and iconic, ""Deus vult, infidel""! 

Pros
+ Game is complex, dynamic and every playthrough will be different enough to keep it interesting.
+ Learning the game is fun and rewarding when you know what to do and when.
+ You can have a horse as a council member and rule the largest empire the world has ever seen.
+ RPG mechanics, play the character however you like.
+ Unlike no other game out there on the market.

Cons
- Game is hard to learn at first, costs a lot to buy the base game and all of the dlc.
- The performance can be bad, even with good hardware, be sure to turn off auto messages later in your playthrough.
- RNG mechanics that kill your character from nowhere with a coinflip.
- Forced autosave system when you play ironman, you can't make more saves in one playthrough and load as you wish. Ironman is required to earn steam achievements but disables loading saves. It's a singeplayer game so it's like why?
- Random peasants with no military training and equipment in a local county declare war against an emperor with the best military and units, yes. Random raiders will constantly be in your realm and raid, there is no way to avoid it other than to give them land which doesn't make sense.

Score
8.0/10.0 (with all the necessary dlc packs)

Pros: -An insanely choice of playable characters and nations, including everything from the most insignificant county ruled by one of the last members of a dying dynasty, to the powerful head of a dynasty that rules over multiple kingdoms, to the powerful Emperors of the HRE, Eastern Rome, and the muslim caliphates
-The ability to rewrite history and change the face of Europe for centuries to come in the 1066 start date
-Decision between trying to survive the wars of the large Empires as a smaller realm or playing as one of those Empires to experience the hilarious snowball effect one can have when playing an Empire with any amount of potential troops ranging between 45k and 100k in the 1337 start date
-Multiple other, but less exciting start dates are also available between 1066 and 1337

(All pros mentioned are ones that can be found in the base game without any DLC)

Cons: -Only Christian Rulers are playable in the base game
-Only three base game character portraits are available (which are all hideously ugly to look at), one for all Europeans, one for Africans (which can only be seen in-game if the free african portrait pack is activated), and one for everyone else

My 800+ hours are just hours on Steam, I've played the game thousands more outside of Steam. I would describe this as turtles, all the way down - there is no end (not one you'll live long enough to experience, at least) to the possibilities unlocked by this masterpiece. Whatever limits Paradox have left in the game, the modding community have stretched to well beyond MY wildest imagination. Stellaris, for instance, started as a CK2 ""total conversion"" mod. One of the better mods out there is the Game of Thrones mod, which lets you ""fix"" things - no Red Wedding for me, no sirree.

I will not be buying anything for CK3 until CK3 is similarly dead, to avoid being stuck in the DLC rat-race as I have been with CK2. The primary reason I will (probably) buy CK3 is that it's likely to be better able to make the best use of higher resolutions.

My favorite parts are the more narrative-driven events and actions and the overall complexities of having to manage both foreign and domestic affairs/political meddling. There's a nice amount of customization if you're like me and want to create a whole new lineage instead of playing off some random guys in history. 
The game can play very differently depending on who you are and how powerful you get. If you first start out as a count/duke, your gameplay revolves mainly around conquering new lands yourself and protecting you and your family from ambitious rivals looking to steal your titles-- not to mention other foreign rulers looking at your lands with a hungry eye. As you work your way up to king, your general gist is the same but this time you get an advisor spot and politics, I feel, are at their highest point with kingdoms. A lot of my Kingdom-title gameplay is bribing, murdering, cajoling, and what have you. 
Empires are where the focus shifts. Once you get a good, sizable empire going with a few or more powerful Kingdoms, you don't have to do much conquering yourself anymore. If you allow external vassal wars only, your powerful king/queen vassals will wage war on foreigners by their own accords for their own kingdom, expanding your empire all the same. 
Politics get easy by this point (If you have started from Count/Duke) because at this point you have a slew of prestige and vassal opinion bonuses from artifacts, Dynasty prestige, titular holdings, and whatever else. You start making enough money to win entire Crusades off of mercenaries. Succession cease to become a worry because your dynasty now holds 4 separate kingdom titles plus an Empire with 60 living members and plenty of heirs. If you choose Imperial Elective, too, you can literally pick and choose your heir. Rigging the elections are not hard once you have gold flowing out your ass and a lot of stacking effects-- and that's just western Europe Christendom playthrough: you can play as a Swede Viking that's way more focused on combat with fuck all to politics, or a nomad that says 'Fuck politics' even harder. Maybe be a merchant prince and deal entirely with politics and money. There's a lot of opportunities for this game, and I have barely scratched starting outside of the British Isles / Ireland, and I'm almost at 600 hours with this game.
 A few things are a bit silly, like empire-tier titles not being able to usurp kingdom/empire tier titles so you end up with a foreign kingdom that's 99% under your control but making you go over vassal limit because you can't give all the dukes/duchess' their de jure ruler, just making the whole thing a fustercluck, or the ungodly RNG system that comes whenever you want to do a duel. 
Besides those and a relatively minor few other things, this game is fantastic and will steal hours from you. Looking forward to CK3.",1597188872,1597190644,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For instance, I played an entire afternoon as the Ottoman Empire, just trying to learn more about the game, etc. As I was probably about 7 hours in and really making progress, a faction finally manages to force ""gavelkind sucession"" on me by giving me an ultimatum. Immediately after this change, the game tells me my character has died at age 44 from ""depression"" (ha, a little too on the nose there perhaps), and everything I worked for got split up among my descendants. I was left with a single holding with no power and the new character I would be playing as was a ""homosexual,"" meaning I was probably going to struggle generating offspring (note: no judgment from me there, but it was a nice additional detail to the whole scale destruction of my empire).

If you like playing as a dragon-king in Faerun, a lord of Westeros, a post-apocalyptic feudal bureaucrat in America, or if you think you'll just enjoy life as a midieval lord Europe, this game is definitely worth its dollar value. The mods provide a huge, huge amount of content and I really cannot understate that. (Also you definitely should get the Performance ++ [by Trexeth] mod if you're going to be picking up this game, it makes the late game not bog down and it's VITAL).

Admittedly, the learning curve was STEEP. Steeper than for other paradox titles I play (EUIV, Stellaris), but it isn't unlearnable. I was initially really struggling with the game, and stopped playing for quite some time, but upon picking it up again after coming upon the Faerun mod, I'm hooked. Some tutorials and just messing around in game was enough to build up a skill where now I feel fairly competent against the AI.

My sister and I are 100 years into a multiplayer game that we've only been playing for only 2 days, and I'd say she has a pretty solid grasp on how to play the game now and she's never played any Paradox titles before at all, let alone any strategy games, so it can't be THAT hard, it only took her 2 days of playing to figure it out after all. There are some good tutorials out there on youtube, they helped me a lot. And ultimately, the game isn't really about winning so much as it is about building up a story, living the life of your characters, following a dynasty through the ages and trying to not go extinct as a family line. It's about the journey less than the end, there really isn't any win condition to the game, there are achievements and there are obstacles, yes, but it's a sandbox.

The DLC is a mixed bag, some of it is very good, others are really niche or just plain unnecessary. The only 'vital' one I'd say is the one with the character designer. Don't buy it if you don't think you'll use it, as a general rule.",1596622689,1596622689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had a happy reign winning battle after battle building my kingdom until one day.. I was named king of Ireland. I did it. I had a happy wife, council, and a wonderful son who I married to the most beautiful lustful slut of the known kingdoms. 
After awhile I started to grow very old and I noticed my son reaching his later 40's had yet to have a son to carry on our greatness. I waited and waited but still no child to carry our kingdom after my sons death so I did the only thing I could think of... I seduced my sons wife and laid pipe on that slut train until....
A SON WAS BORN! Yes I did it I gave my son a son to carry on the kingdom.. No one knew of the affair and my son believed the boy was his and nobody knew the better except myself and his ho wife.
I told my son I would be the gaurdian to the child and the boy had the happiest of childhood and earned every great virtue do a child who was loved until...
My son at the age of 50 finally had a boy. I prayed for it to be a girl, but it was a boy. The true ruler to the kingdom. I panicked and didn't know what to do. I loved the child but the child was not the true heir and the way of his birth was of devil himself.
The only thing I could do was assassinate the child. Two attempts failed and then finally at the age of 9 the childs cart mysteriously had an accident and he was no more.

No two playthroughs are the same, and as long as you ask for it, each new game you start is full of new events, characters, and locations to spice up the game and keep you addicted for hours. 
Crusader Kings has a unique game mechanic, (that I love) which is that you have to keep your dynasty alive. In other words, your family. Without at least one character in your dynasty alive, you lose the game. This can lead to many bizarre, great, and hilarious events that you look back on in glee majority of the time. Because as easily as growing your family can be boons to your success, it can just as easily lead to your current characters downfall. 
Going through incredibly accurate European medieval history, and then changing it and transforming the borders to your hearts content, is one of this game's selling points and one of its best features. 
You feel like you are a part of history. Like you are making an impact to the very world around you. 
The only downside I found (like many paradox games) is that to fully immerse yourself and enjoy the game to its best abilities, you need to purchase a fair amount of DLC. Less you miss out on playing a wide variety of characters, in unique and interesting starting locations. 
Otherwise, if you a fan of paradox games, not afraid of spending a bit of money, are a history buff, or just enjoy strategy games and potentially growing a continental spanning empire with the added twist of murder plots and supernatural events, I would say Crusader Kings II is for you.",1595843108,1595843108,True,2,0,0.52599036693572998,0,True,False,False

In all seriousness, this is a long and engrossing game that has a pretty steep learning curve. The amount of menus and mechanics are very daunting at first, but once you have a solid grasp of them the game really starts to open up. Crusader Kings II is a strategy game that is not solely about your empire and production, but instead your family and the legacy they leave behind. Marrying off children and relatives for political alliances and future claims are all just a part of a game where the test is not just to win, but to survive. This game is what you make it.

Years, in fact, have my soldiers crusaded into India, bypassing the Middle East and holy land entirely, my disease-riddled children learned to fight with swords before learning how to read, and my doctors castrated me against my will in a successful attempt to cure cancer. 
The wild ride known only as [b]Crusader Kings 2[/b] is not a game, but a spectacle to behold to the common man where every single person has their own agenda, and that agenda usually involves sexual relations with your wife. So what groundbreaking changing features never before seen does the game have?

    [*] Incest
    [*] Torture
    [*] Genocide
    [*] Cuckoldry
    [*] Manure-driven assassinations
    [*] Pope seduction
    [*] Lack of racism
    [*] Chess games with death that always go very well. (lmao xd) 
[/list]

This game made me question my sanity. While fervently recommending it to every single person I know, I was laughed at, scorned for daring to suggest a game that isn't Dota. When friends did play with me, I was assassinated by assassins, mobs, manure explosions;  cuckolded without a single giggle, asked how to levy armies for the 50th time, and had player-led independence factions led by them tear my realm asunder. Friends is a strong word, as in the medieval world, the only friend you have is whatever god you choose to worship. Your spouse and children may as well be enemy soldiers, having the hostility of a one-eyed feral cat and the life expectancy of a lemming parkouring a volcano. 

Don't let that stop you from enjoying the key features of the game, such as starting construction of a massive statue. Of yourself. Then getting killed immediately after decreeing its construction, but still continuing to build a monument to a deceased 8 year old for the next 50 years. How about an Aztec invasion that makes western countries completely unplayable? Or the Black Death in the 10th century, only surviving because your 3 homosexual wives took the brunt of the plague for you? Or playing as a 0 year old baby, your predecessor's best friend and lover starting a faction to oust you from power? The choice is [b]not[/b] yours.

 Creating a powerful kingdom is easy, but maintaining it for generations to come is always the challenge. Balancing prickly vassals, international disputes, piety, and autistic wonder construction are all constantly on your mind, but that doesn't stop a portal to hell from suddenly appearing outside your gates, or your peasants from hanging Jews whenever they get STDs (likely from sleeping with your wife). Mongols exist, and god fkin dammit, can they nerf the Khazars? Really nice when they conquer all of Russia at the start of every game lmao.

But works cannot do the game justice, God's gift to man in the simple yet incredible, splendid, ascended game, can only be played to be experienced. Random events and unbalanced nonsense will only make every day that passes that more intense, and there's no excuse not to play it. Everyone can experience the game right now.  Even if it is free, (and all of the DLC can be played for free if you just let me host, for god's sake guys, seriously.... ) that won't stop everyone from refusing to play it.  CK2 is still one of the best games currently on the steam store and earns my highest recommendation. Please play Crusader Kings 2 with me guys.

Overall i have a mixed view on this game. It is extremely unique due to the fact that you manage a noble family not the nation or civilization like in so many other games. So keep in mind that you might start as a king, but then ""fall from grace"" to a lowly count with in a year into the game or a few generations down the line (sandles to sandles in three generations so to speak). Of course the reverse can happen and you can go from a count and claw your way to being a King or even Emporer.

Keep in mind it is more about strategy. you don't directly command armies as a player (your character can lead them but you will NOT be able to command the army like in a TotalWar game). So war is still mostly having the most numbers of men with some degree of tactics like terrain bonuses and unit types( controlled by culture and the type of holdings that sent troops)  Technology and building up your holdings (castles, cities, and temples that provide taxes and armies) and gold tend to come in very slowly.

it all takes time...and like the civilizations games you can suddenly see 5:04 a.m. when you honestly believed it was probably only midnight.

A lot of the events make the game fun. I can tell the writers had fun with some of the event chains which is a major plus for me. Playing the marriage game is a bit frustrating but can be very rewarding(you have to find suitors for...everyone and anyone you want to be married. thoogh the ai will make offers if it is their interests). however it feels like you just do not have much control. and though that is more realistic, it is very frustrating when the ai seems to know what i am trying to do and throw wars. disease, a cheating wife, rebellious nobles, or power mad king ordering i give up titles to land to him.

So CGP Grey's ""rules for rulers"" on youtube is like the cliffnotes version of what this game is kind of like. Most of the time the most dangerous people were the ones inside the kingdom, within the council, or in the bedroom....be careful who you trust...m'lord. and you will have to basically bribe and smooze or sometimes kill people and vassals under you in order to secure things on the homefront before your plans of conquest can begin(usually only 1 county at a time with a few exceptions)

If you have a lot of time and like to learn and watch hours of tutorials on youtube and love medieval politics then go for it. 

Overall i rate the game for what it is as a 8/10.",1488491582,1594563482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT

So my first review was done at 30 hours of gameplay... Well here I am now with almost 3000 hours of gameplay. 

This game is one of the best games out there. You control individual characters with a dynasty through a couple hundred year period and the goal is to progress your dynasty as far as possible. 

You can murder in secret (Or not so secret) your enemies
Reform old religions to meet your needs
War with other characters for lands and other things
Marry off members of your family to gain alliances
Control the laws within your realm
and so much more!

This game is an absolute MUST for anyone who enjoy kingdom management and roleplaying.

Watch as your wife wage wars and amass land in Southern France and Eastern Iberia. You, on the other hand, use your considerable diplomacy to become the Chancellor of England under William the Conqueror. Convince him to grant you lands in the north and receive the Duchy of Cumbria. You and your extensive become the ultimate power couple and most powerful landowners in both England and France and, dare I say, Europe. Marry off your 6 female children to the heirs and future kings of England, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, and Sicily. Arrange a marriage between the daughter and heir of the King of Scots and your heir.
Fast forward to several years, you have become the father of six queens, one king consort, and grandfather to heirs to the thrones of 7 kingdoms. Your wife has successfully plotted to gain independence from France and has crowned herself the Queen of Aquitaine, making you a king. You die at 76, leaving your vast holdings to your son, the King of Scots. Your wife dies almost a decade later, again expanding your son’s lands and titles to include the Kingdoms of Aquitaine and Navarre, the Duchies of Gascogne and Auvergne, and control over the Duchies of Poitou, Bourbon, Aragon, Paris, and Upper Brittany. Years later, you made as a saint, making your dynasty even more renowned than ever. Your son, the current King of Aquitaine, lord over your dominions, and King Consort of Scotland dies of cancer. Your grandson ascends to the throne.
Meanwhile, your daughter-in-law, the Queen of Scots, is devastated by the untimely death of her husband, so she takes her own life. Your twenty-year-old grandson is now King of Aquitaine, Navarre, and Scotland, and lord over the lands that you and your wife have amassed over your lifetime. After gaining enough prestige, your grandson names himself Emperor and is the most feared and respected ruler in all of Europe. This is only the beginning of your dynasty’s story.

It may take a while to get used to the game mechanics but once you do there is nothing stopping you from reforming Rome and placing your Croatian Jewish brother on the throne of Imperial China. 

The only downside is that for the game to truly be 100% as entertaining as it can be you need most of the main DLCs.

The doctor offers an experimental cure, which translates as 'i will cut off your cock and hope you get better!' The experience leaves the ruler a depressed lunatic. He turns to heavy drinking from depression and after one especially wild night he basically drinks the cancer away. So the cure works, in a way. Later, during another late night drink, he is confronted by his court bishop, who offers him to convert to the cult of Satan, which the ruler promptly does. As he progresses to the upper echelons of satanic power ladder, the sorcerer-king starts summoning demons and one of them regrows his dick. The first thing my ruler does is with his newfound manlyhood is fucking a rose bush so hard it bears him an elf child. He later goes on to conquer Jerusalem in the name of God and Lucifer becoming known throughout the realm as 'The Holy'.

 You SHOULD install it!

Secondly, dont watch the tutorials on youtube talking about Ireland as the best place to learn the game. Ireland is a very poor place most of the time and you will find yourself (without game knowledge) not getting any money, therefore no fabricaded claims, therefore no wars for more territory, you are stuck to inheritance. 

Thirdly, there is a great community on steam or reddit about this game, open for beginners and with quite some meme culture.

The Pros: LOTS to do. I'd suggest setting a very long term goal for each campaign to keep it interesting since starting without any goal in mind can lessen the fun. 

The Cons: You need all the DLC (or most of them at the least) to truly have a blast playing this game. Some simply offer fun additional content (monks and mystics for example), while others are virtually required to truly enjoy the game (conclave, way of life, Sons of Abraham, etc.). 

TL;DR: Get the game and the DLC during a 50%+ off sale. The DLCs make the game, but once you have them, it's truly a great game. Mods for this game are also great (highly suggest After the End Fan Fork).",1593894529,1593894529,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example, this story happened just yesterday.

One day my character was chilling in a carriage in his old family lands in Hungary when suddenly he was ambushed and taken prisoner by some weirdo in Brittany. The freak tortured my character with rats. What is worse, I had no money to buy my way out of the prison. At the same time, my lovely new wife became pregnant, and, for obvious reasons, this could not be my character's child. After the first daughter came the second and only then my unwitty spymaster uncovered that the weird guy and my unfaithful wife had an affair! Sadly, due to my liege's incompetency in managing the realm, my lands were constantly pillaged by vicious pagan tribes, leaving me with almost no income. Moreover, the regent that was installed to rule in my character's place was a nice and a charitable guy. He shared all of my petty income with the starving and underprivileged. He did not like my character either and never agreed to anything I asked him to do. 

My poor character ended up in a dark and cold oubliette after his friend tried to rescue him and failed. He soon passed away, betrayed by everyone. He only needed 20 more gold coins to buy his way out...

Soon after the news reached Hungary, king's brother was selected as the new king. Being an envious, lustful and ambitious fellow, he always found his brother's wife to be prettier and more attractive than his own. He immediately divorced and married the unfaithful widow. A few months later, the new king decided to relieve his stress by embarking on a carriage trip to his old family's lands, when suddenly they were stopped on a road by a group of french-speaking hoodlums...",1424559008,1593891472,True,9,5,0.581059515476226807,0,True,False,False

I've observed on three occassions the AI will:

1) Muster a larger army than it's maximum levies
2) Will break truces to declare war without invoking any relationship pentalties with its vassals and courtiers.

My decision to uninstall the game came during an ironman playthrough where I was lucky enough to successfully complete the Immortality quest chain. Shortly after becoming immortal and getting the bloodline I felt very fortunate and was excited to continue the run.

After this all happened I fought a war to install a new king on the throne of west francia and, despite being a free duchy, pledged myself to his kingdom and achieved +88 relationship with the king of france.

A few years later we are in the middle of a crusade and the king of france demands that I cede my duchy to him, i decline and defeat him.

He then demands i cede a county to him, i decline and he breaks a truce to declare war on me but i defeat him again. I am not no longer in a position to continue fighting as my manpower is depleted.

He then demands each and every individual country from my Duchy, I cede to him before realising he will just leave me with one county and decline with one third of my duchy left and surrender. he imprisons me.

While I am imprisoned he forces my regent to cede all of my counties to him, leaving me with the least valuable one and then executes me.

No diplomatic penalties were incurred by the french king for using his army to disassemble an entire loyal duchy and execute its leader in the middle of a crusade.

You play as a dynasty, or a series of related characters. Your characters interactions with the game world are affected by their innate attributes and their traits. These can be affected by extremely arbitrary events that can add or (mostly) subtract from your A's and T's. Amongst the stupid things that can happen to you is loosing your bravery because you imagine being scared one day, loosing you gregariousness because you suddenly decide that you want to be alone, or becoming FAT which leads to the Hard Diet modifier, an extreme disad that last for a ridiculous amount of time. You as the player have no control over any of these, or dozens more equally ridiculous events, that will re-occur frequently throughout the game.

Fighting war is another frustrating aspect of the game. Supposedly, your Marshall attribute, or that of your general's is supposed is supposed to effect the outcome of battles. Numbers of troops involved are also supposed to be a factor, but in my experience general's and numbers rarely factor in, unless it's the AI's general's and numbers.

Now that it's free it is worth a try especially if you are interested in upcoming Crusader Kings 3!",1593444368,1593444368,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Simply put: It's really good. It's not about graphics, or loading screens, or cinematic cutscenes. It's a small game (even with all the DLC), but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in balance and structure. This game is like playing a board game with your friends (even if they don't exist), think DnD or Risk but with less restriction. You create the story in your head, and live it out via pop-up story actions, and meticulous planning. It's the kind of fun and entertainment that only a book can give you, except the story is written by you on a day to day basis. As the times change, and your rulers change, the game is always fresh on each playthrough. And the challenge is never the same.

It's not easy to get into and understand, but if you have a particular interest in games where there is something more at stake than 1 thing/1 place/1 objective this is probably the game for you. There is a new CK3 coming out soon, so this is probably going to be the least helpful review ever as people might gravitate toward that first.

What attracts me to it - and many others I think would agree - is the family politics and the intrigue (clearly the most influential trait in the game).

Like a lot of Paradox games, it's almost infuriatingly complex and daunting if you go into it blind. Looking at wikis or even tutorial videos was a bit tricky: What's a Casus Belli? Why are my peasants revolting? How do I get more money? Why am I losing every battle? You have to dig a little online to find simple answers rather than long essays about every possible cause of any given action. This is mainly because there [b]are[/b] multiple causes to any given action.

So one weekend, I fired up CK2 as if it was the mid-90s again and I was playing a game before the internet was a thing. I played through the tutorial (which is barebones at best), then started a game on a relatively easy difficulty (by playing Petar of Belgium in 936 AD), and just screwed around for twelve hours while making judicious use of quick-saves and save scumming. I'd save before taking a risky action and, if it went badly, I'd examine what exactly went wrong before loading up again.

And man, my eyes were opened in those twelve hours. CK2's biggest problem is its insanely cluttered and confusing interface. But let me be clear: it's cluttered and confusing [i]to the uninitiated[/i]. While some games may suffer general issues with UI (which is always my biggest gripe of any game), CK2 gives you [i]all[/i] the information you need at any given moment. It's just, when you're getting started, you don't know which screens display which piles of information you need for your specific, at-that-moment need. With each risky action I took -- regardless of outcome -- I slowly learned where on the interface I needed to go to plan my moves ahead.

It is your actions, ironically, that should be the end result of your thinking within the gameplay. The overall premise of the game is to increase your family's place in history by expanding your power. So... what do you need to do, [i]right now[/i], to expand your power? Capture a territory? Kill a rival? Convert an advisor to a different religion? Once you decide on an immediate goal, you can then look into which actions can help you achieve that goal. Soon, you'll be able to start thinking multiple moves ahead, and that's when the full impact of grand strategy will hit you, and you too will see how damn brilliant CK2 is.

This assumes you are wired for such a game. Not everyone has the patience for inane nonsense or paragraphs upon paragraphs of flavor text. Not everyone is willing to save-scum relentlessly during the learning process. Not everyone wants to wade through menus with mixtures of numbers and proper nouns to weigh in-game calculations in quick mental cost-benefit analyses. And of course, not everyone wants to deal with European and North African history. If any of those apply to you though, if your personality or preference is among that type of gamer, you will seriously enjoy CK2.

CK2 reflects its age though. It's not pretty, its music is fine but nothing better, and its myriad DLC can feel oppressive if you're wading into the franchise in 2020 or later. However, as I write this (June 21, 2020), there are frequent free weekends as CK3 prepares for release, as Paradox wants you to taste the CK franchise before tempting you with the latest formula in the batch. It's certainly smart from a marketing standpoint, and you'll likely have a chance to try CK2 for free or at least extremely cheap by the time you read this review.

And no matter how CK3 turns out, CK2's gameplay is good to last for a long while. CK2's take on grand strategy is excellent and will survive just as much as the Civilizations or the StarCrafts have in their respective genres. Just watch the clock when you play: it'll be all too easy to ""five more minutes"" yourself into another twelve hours of alternate history.",1592745524,1592745524,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it, and boy was I surprised by the story the unfolded before me. I was apart of a viking tribe son of a warlord and made it my mission to be the greatest warrior who ever lived. I lost my first fight which left me scarred, soon after the man who had defeated me invited me to go hunting for tigers. After that we became best friends. I married his sister and we began traveling the world dueling anyone. I was ruthless to my opponents, when they'd yield I'd give them no quarter and completely murder them. After a few fights I was invited to a warriors guild, and the price of entry was a duel with 3 different men. I defeated the first two with ease, but the third man gave me a hard time we both fought as hard as we could. I ended up killing the man, but he fought hard enough to gravely wound me. 

After my victory I was welcomed by the guild. And slowly I'd rise through the ranks by completing extraordinary tasks. One of which was fighting a bear with my bare hands. After a few years I had a son, but didn't settle down. I began to gather the tribes and go to war, conquering territories as I went. By the time my son was of age I had taken over half of England, a year later an assassin had taken my characters life and my son had become ruler. Not long after it was revealed that his mother had an affair with a tribe leader who had been conquered by my character. Soon after my son was poisoned by his own mother and the game was over.

I'd recommend watching a lets play on youtube before you buy this game at the very least, so you can begin to understand some of the core mechanics behind the game. This isn't necessarily a fault of the game itself, because it being a complicated game is because of exactly what its trying to emulate, but this complexity still means I would never tell someone who wasn't already set on buying this game to get it.",1592228210,1592228210,False,0,1,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,False

Compared to that when in comes to CK2 I'm still a beginner, despite my hundreds of hours of play-time. I've started several campaigns and taken them to varying lengths, but I've only actually completed one (though quite successfully) and I've never dared try ironman or frankly played much outside of Western Europe.

That aside this game is magnificent and I am in awe of it, and frankly while EU4 might be more my cup of tea and I love it I actually consider this to be the better game. When it comes to fidelity of design and of concept it is unmatched. You play a character. You do shenanigens of varying levels of bastardry (including killing bastards). That's about all you need to know. Sure, there's conquest through the sword and the bedchamber, but the meat of the game is the interaction between your character and his or her subjects and the other characters around them. EU4 is a game about conquest, but CK2 is a game about survival. And while EU4's DLC has been mostly good, it's been fairly schizophrenic in terms of focus due to the nature of the game, but this game has always focused on fleshing out those core aspects; it lets you get to play new kinds of people, and you get to interact with people in different ways and have your character do new things. It just keeps getting better while never deviating from its core thesis.

All in all, this game is one of the most personal and personable games on Steam, and, as weird as it may sound, is also probably the platform's premier game about family. In EU4, I will be happy to see a 6/4/5 ruler because it is advantageous, but in this game I can have a great time with a Shy Arbitrary Cruel guy who owns a backwater county in Scotland because as much as he may frustrate me his journey will still be engrossing, thrilling, terrifying, and hilarious. And that's what makes this game so wonderful.

It also has one of the best game soundtracks I know of.

I can safely encourage anyone who has even a passing interest in the strategy genre, or in history in general, or frankly who just likes enthralling, character-driven stories, to buy this game. It really does have something for nearly everyone.",1516969279,1592153288,True,0,0,0.498652279376983643,0,True,False,False

If you are interested in history, this title is for you, and if you are interested in alternate history, then this will probably be one of your favorite games of all time. It is infinite. And I mean that. The possibilities for CK2 practically never end. But I have to start somewhere with this review, and so I will start with the world. CK2 puts you in the midst of the middle ages, spanning Spain to India, and Iceland to Egypt, even China has a role to play off-screen. This world is compellingly alive, with hundreds of characters populating it, all with their own agendas on their own journeys for wealth and power, and in order to succeed you must contend with them. The random and scripted events also lend a sense of breathing history to the world of the game. It is a world where you are certainly set for one hell of an adventure. When it comes to the art, it is very well done. The atmosphere is spot-on, and everything has been aesthetically thought of, even down to the UI changing depending on culture group, government, or a myriad of other factors. Of course, heraldry has been thought of, and features heavily as well in its own role. The sound design is fantastic for this kind of game- the music is grand and just varied enough to keep monotony at bay, the UI sounds are staisfying with their clicks and paper shuffling, even the sounds of battle or minor events imbue CK2 with a vibrancy not found in other games, especially not other grand strategy titles. The gameplay, while itself featuring a pretty steep learning curve to those new to the genre, itself provides the perfect vector through which to influence the world and the events therein. Once you take the time and get the hang of things, the controls and functions of the game will feel like a mere extension of your will. Fantastic, and I think the relative complexity makes getting good at the game that much more rewarding in and of itself. As an addendum, mods can make this good game great. The community is active every day, and things like HIP, GoT mod, and a thousand other things can transform it into a true magnum opus. Overall, 10/10, one of the best games I have ever played, and by far the highest replayability value of any title in my steam library.",1592069561,1592069561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started playing this game a couple of years after its launch, and boy has it changed. It would be WAY too much for me to catalog and explain all the changes, so I'll try to keep a short and sweet message about what this game is, and why I recommend it 100%

Crusader Kings 2, to me, is basically a role playing game, using grand strategy as the medium. Pick any noble from a lowly count to a powerful emperor, and basically try to keep your dynasty alive. Learn to manage your realm, deal with scheming nobles, aggressive neighbors who want your land for themselves, war, rampant disease, rebellions, murder, cults, etc. Basically, roleplay as a lord in an alternative timeline of the medieval world. It's especially great for history buffs or anyone with a passing interest in history, as the start of a game is as historical as it can be. A lot of things can happen that shape your dynasty and probably the realm you look over, and overall its a really fun experience. I honestly can't express in writing how much I love this game. I've tried *similar games* such as EU4, Stellaris, and (arguably) Civ, in terms of being a ruler of a nation and leading it to victory. But what stands out to me about Crusader Kings 2 is that there's more of a personal touch to it. Since you control and interact with characters with varying personality traits and skills, its easier (in my opinion) to get invested in your dynastiries naturally unfolding story, and the alternate world around you.

Sadly, the best experience has been locked by DLC, such as being able to play as Pagans, Muslim, more flavor events, and so on(wait for sales if you want it). Still, I can personally say I started the game with no DLC WAY back when the game had more basic features, and still found a way to enjoy myself. 

Its free to play now, give it a shot and from there decide (with your wallet) if you think everything else is worth the investment. For me it was, and I'm glad this game is still alive to date.",1591343404,1591343404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This without a doubt is the best game you'll ever play if you're into roleplaying, simulation, and most importantly the freedom to do whatever you wanted in the confines of the game. The DLCs although many and considered to be a little expensive for few, are definitely worth purchasing once you get bored of the base game. They add that little bit of flavour and provide an overall better experience to CK2.

You add the many DLCs with a very active and dedicated Steam workshop community and you'll find yourself modding your own game to further enhance/improve upon the gameplay. This alone offers endless hours of even more material and more hours of playing time. You'll never get bored of this game because there is always something new to do, a new conquest, a new approach, or a new play style to test out. 

I suggest getting into CK2 first before CK3 launches, so that way you can hit the ground running and the learning curb we'll all experience once CK3 drops won't be as massive or as steep to climb in comparison to an individual jumping straight into CK3.",1591310196,1591310196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But if you, as a new player, really want to play this game, you should find helpful tools, the community of this game is super friendly and each gamer has very different ways to play it, I would recommend you to look for some short tutorials on youtube, the youtuber btrekkie has a couple of videos that are short and very easy to understand, all of this so you know what it is the game about. Do not play the game's tutorial, you should try to play on Irland first, since it is basically the non official noobie island of the game.

If you are still interested in the game you will find your own enjoyment during your playthroughs, that is the jewel of this game, once you understand the basics and enjoy the game, you will experience these incredible stories based on the medieval politics, you can do anything, there are no specific goals in the game, except to have an heir of your own dynasty to keep playing, but you could try anything, to be the king of France and win the 100 years war, unite all the kingdoms in the british isles, found a norse pagan empire and submit the christian kingdoms, just to mention a few ideas.

I still recommend the game even with all the cons that it may have because it becomes so immersive once you know how to use all the tools the game offers you, and if that is not enough you could try some mods, some are unbelievable good.

- Tons of DLCs. (Developers seems more like fishermans than game developers.)
- Basic starts options are locked into dlcs. (Preset characters too. The length of the game as well.)
- Achivements are locked into dlcs too. xD (That's adorable stupid system) :D :-*
- Makes ""De jure"" (or some siht like that) looks sometime bugy :D (rly...)
- Sometime one person (your vassal) got claims on more lands in other county. But in option you can start only one war due to one land. And then you have wait 10years (time in game) till peace ends (if the other king are still live) ... Thats really bullmess...^^ It should be able combine for start one war!!! (Stupid siht....)

Some tips a tricks:
> Inheritance rules should be... „Primogenitura“ (i use also Agnat-Kognat) Thats most sustainable for me (idk...) 
> And you should make full centralization soon as posible for better control of your land and others...And for future holding... (Thats bit important i think. So you should check also legalism in research...And do not make tons of vassals.. ;D)
> Looks exacly on vassals opinions (move your mouse over it and w8 little bit) if you have problem with them... (You shouldnt..You should avoid it... Mostly is enought just give some dukedom to your son. ;D ) 
> Do not give much land to only one your vassal...And when you have to, better prefer your heir... (Because that will be you so it is like you give it to your self :D later.. ) idk... :D 
> Try have allways +500,- (it can save your ass if you know where you can hire mercenaries.)

This game is a gigantic feudal dynasty simulator, allowing you to pick historical figures from interesting periods to play as, minor nobles or even custom characters. Simply put, it's an alternate history generator as you play through your chosen dynasty and time period, and can lead to many interesting stories or moments. One of the coolest features is that each character that is based on a real historical figure will have wikipedia links on their character sheet so you can learn about the actual person they are representing.

This is grand strategy at its best, forcing you to take into account an absolutely mind-boggling amount of variables in order to achieve your goals. There is no ""win"" state - you play however you like, trying to get done whatever you want to get done. For example, on many playthroughs I started as a count in Ireland and attempted to unify all of the UK under an Irish banner. I've even taken over Africa and parts of Western Europe as Aztecs, invading from overseas in the ""Sunset Invasion"" DLC.

You can play as a wide variety of cultures, religions, or government types, each with options to customize your realms particular traditions for completely unique experiences each time you play. There is just... a lot. There's a lot to this game, and you'll likely never run out of content to try out.

That being said, it's very hard to learn and not for the impatient. If you aren't a fan of grand strategy, turn away now and find something else to play. But if you have a taste for crushing enemy armies underfoot and the raw nerves of steel necessary to do so, then give this game a shot.

But anyway. Crusader Kings is a grand strategy game where you take on the role of a medieval Dynasty, one ruler at a time. You basically take on the role of a count/duke/king whatever and make decisions about who you and your children marry, when to go to war, who to make friends with, who to appoint to various offices and the like. It is a very non-traditional strategy game. You could literally conquer and forge a kingdom and then lose it all because you messed up your inheritance laws or bad event happens. You are not a country, you are a person/family in that country so do NOT get caught up in ""map painting"" as that isn't really what this game is about.

This game is complex, there is a LOT going on and the game is terrible at telling you what is important and what isn't. Watch a tutorial it will help, and when you get it you will realize it isn't that complicated after all. You basically make a few decisions (and most of them are non-decisions like ""appoint the guy with highest diplomacy as my chancellor because I have no reason to pick anyone else"") and then wait for an oppertunity to open up or an event to happen. Pause, make decisions, play. 

You can guide your family in a direction, but the fun is really in the events and happenings rather than conquest or goal achieving. I can't tell you how many times I would browse through some relations or plots only to go ""wait, that's my wife!"". Like ""looks like someone is plotting to kill me... wait, that's my wife!""

Sounds like fun right?

But unfortunately just like other grand strategy games , Crusader Kings 2 suffers from mid-/late- game lag. In other games it usually happens ONLY in late game, but in Crusader Kings 2 it starts quite early. The reason is the game have to tracked so many characters either dead or alive so after 300 years or so it starts to lag. The expansion packs make it worse by introducing new mechanics, hence new data to be processed. If you think your computer is strong enough to never have any lag, you'll be wrong. Crusader Kings 2 is a 32 bit games and it's RAM usage is capped to 4 GB, so it WILL lag.

So my verdict is YES this game is great, but lower your expectation because it is unlikely you'll have your fantasy of your own long running dynasty fulfilled due to lag.",1562755607,1590485694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OMG.  I've played games with steep learning curves, but this is just ridiculous.  Even with the help of the tutorial I still had problems and apparently even players feel the tutorial is not up to the job it's suppose to do.  I see it has a very positive rating, tho I cannot for the life of me figure out why.

Combat is horrible!  You can't even select the exact number of troops you want - this becomes a logistical nightmare when you have to get them onto ships!  Who thought up this broken mechanic!?

Don't even get me started on how to to move troops - especially across a stupid straight of water!  I wanted to scream!

Gifting money is another broken mechanic - you have NO control over how much money you gift and they usually auto allocate an insane amount of money that your treasury weeps tears of blood over.

Sorry, but after trying 2 times to learn how to play this game, the only thing I walked away with was utter confusion and loathing.  Any enjoyment was completely ruined by the game mechanics (and lack thereof) and the endless button searching trying to figure out how to do anything!

I just cannot recommend this game.  I suppose if you like this style of gameplay, go on and give it a try  - and I hope you have better luck than me, but otherwise it's just not fun.",1590385523,1590385523,False,1,3,0.437329113483428955,0,True,False,False

This is a pretty unique take on strategy gameplay that injects tons of roleplaying and emergent storytelling that I cant really compare to any other game. While it is hard to learn at first, this game has more personality and replayability than any other game Ive ever played. If you are a fan of both strategy and roleplaying games you owe it to yourself to at least try this game on one of the many free to play weekends. It gets a glowing recommendation from me as far as actual gameplay is concerned. 

The biggest drawback of this game for a newcomer is the same one that effects every Paradox game: DLC. The DLC list for this game is expansive, and while some are definitely lower on the list of necessity than others a good percentage of them are pretty much required to get the best gameplay experience. This can drive up the buy-in price of the game considerably, and is one of the main things that lead other reviewers to rate this game negatively. Luckily these days, especially with the incoming CK3, this game and all its DLC is routinly on sale with deep price cuts. I managed to get the game and all of the highest rated DLC for still cheaper that a new game and eventually picked up the rest at a later date.

So, as long as you follow the advice to buy on sale, this game and its DLC get a purchase recommendation from me.",1590100373,1590100373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel this game is seperated from other strategy games because it isn't as flat as games like Total war or Hoi4. The game isn't necessarily about the nation you rule but more the dynasty you create. It's set in the middle ages so your family and succession is the main focus and about how your family survives in this historical feudal world. This game is about making your own story and you truly feel like the master of your own world in this. The complexity of court politics makes the game really interesting once you get the hang of it.

It has potentially the deepest gameplay of any game I know of (with the possible exception of EVE Online), but you don't necessarily have to know about all of that depth. Quite a few of my friends find the RNG of events in CKII to be infuriating; I find the realism rewarding. Playing conservatively is essentially mandatory--CKII punishes the typical greedy expansion of strategy games mercilessly. You can easily build an empire quickly, but if you do you will lose it within a few generations unless you have both luck and excruciating patience and attention to detail on your side. There are endless things to manage and to do--NPCs to keep happy, to manipulate, to assassinate, to sway or seduce or bribe. Your own dynasty is both crucial to your survival and one of your greatest threats. Diseases are the great opportunist; better be prepared with a long line of potential heirs! If you are prepared, you can often get some of your enemies' lands on the cheap, as their realm passes to an imbecilic six year old twice removed. CKII's RNG is brutal and that is what makes a tall, conservative playstyle viable--though still no guarantee for success. And while it can be frustrating, at least the majority of the RNG-based events are based on real-world events we have little control over: spread of disease, outcome of battles, pregnancy and childbirth.

Overall, CKII remains one of my two favorite titles. Its recently-announced successor, CKIII, will hopefully keep the gameplay mechanics and fix the convalescence of this eight-year-old game with some updated UI and fixes for multiplayer stability.",1589905747,1589905747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game remains basically buggy with Paradox not fixing the game but every expanding it.

Somewhere between 100 & 200 years into the game, the save game will crash. Before that, you'll start getting the message that the game refuses to save.

Every game is annoyed by irregular pause pattern:
The game auto pauses and then sometimes clicking the pause button prevent it from automatically restarting and other times doesn't. You never know. Late game the pause madness steadily gets worse.

Finally, the raiding countries have to be individually stopped. Your lords, who are being raided will do nothing, nope instead you have to manually send an army down to stop them...each and everyone.

See those ultra rare achievements, the reason only 2% gets them is because they takes weeks to play to get one which means if they got more than a couple, you can probably guess they cheated because of the saves turn useless before getting that far.

Further end game issues including whether you go to war for a city, county, duchy, or kingdom, you'll have to wait 10 years between peace deals. AND you can't enforce them all at once which means attack someone for a city...wait ten years (which is hours in game).

UI needs so many obivous tweaks that one wonders if Paradox made this game or the inventor Excel after a crack smoking binge.

This is a a typical paradox game and has the usual steep learning curve trying to understand the depth  and breadth of the game play.  The first thing I would say to new players is - don't expect to win. There is no real way to win the game, its really about the journey. 
Before the game had achievements  I used to spend my time trying to build a game from being the count of a little province to becoming a duke, then a king, and so on - fighting, intriguing and marrying your way across the politics of the high middle ages - doing everything from re-founding the Roman Empire to founding a Shia caliphate. 
If you can get through the first few games you will find that CK2 becomes infinitely re-playable. Every play through is different, history changes every time.
The one piece of advice I would give new players - be patient. This is one of those games where you can lose a bit of land or a  title, and then 50 years later you end up a king somewhere else.
This is a fun rewarding game if you can give it some time to learn (there are quite a few youtube tutorials that are helpful).",1588994086,1588994086,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all -  it is pleasant to the eyes and ears. It is very immersive in its style.

My first 80 hours or so were without a single DLC, never had troubles, nor did I feel restricted in any way. Nor did I feel that I exhausted the base game capabilities. But hey, don't take my word for it - base game is free, so just try it.
Yes, it is only ""middle"" Middle Ages and only christian rulers. Guess what - game is called Crusader Kings, what did you expect? Between wars, securing your succession, forging alliances, plotting murder of your enemies and competing for influence over Pope, there's a lot of fun to be had.

Regarding DLC's - they add a lot to the game. None of the are essential, and each can be played without the rest. As for me - each one is worth getting.

Like most massive strategy games, it suffers from poor AI. You will find yourself cursing the names of your allies as they are leading their forces to certain doom, or abandoning your troops in your time of need, or failing to declare rebellion when the time is ripe. There are also a number of miscellaneous but crippling bugs such as inexplicably losing your vote in the imperial election. The next class of annoyances is from some of the strange mechanics in the way that wars are declared and won; you may find yourself abdicating to your son because the rebellious noble you seek to imprison is besieged by foreign armies waging holy war rather than by you, or controlling a completely different son and heir than the one you've been preening for succession because his brother suddenly inherited a distant county.

The game's engine most realistically works for 10-13th century Catholic feudal kingdoms: brothers are invariably enemies rather than allies, Catholics and Greek Christians consider each other infidels, crusades can be waged against heretics as well as foreign faiths, and sieges are more effective than open combat.

All in all: it's a fantastic game that splits the difference between RPG and RTS, and a must-play for history buffs.",1588742047,1588742047,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

The trait system is good but sometimes makes no sense regarding certain traits you have and particular event and actions available while having those specific traits. The portraits are great as you would only know a person by there drawing and not somehow know what the pope looks like from other side of Europe when you have not actually met them basically it makes no sense to have characters as actual people you can see.

The military is in my opinion good and basic so you can pursue other areas like claims and managing your realm.

I believe the birth/marriage system is satisfactory although sometimes makes no sense especially when you child gets inbred trait or some disability even though theirs no incest happening at all could just my bad luck when it comes to children.

Also there should be some loyalty system set in place as not everyone was extremely disliked in medieval era i mostly got that idea from every time i was betrayed by a family member or important person in my realm.

Also graphics are great for this type of game could do with better upgrade names in holdings.

But the main bad thing about this game is lowborn parents children create a dynasty after denouncing them so really they should have 0 connection to nobility but obviously someone didnt think about that during development.

Out of all the 100+ achievements only two of them are common and the rest are rare.

The tutorial is awful. The game is complex with innumerable options to tune, tweak and generally EFF with, but the tutorial covers practically none of it.

I prefer ck2 to EU4 or HOI4 because in Ck2 there is roleplaying and a story that you write, and that is something that is not in EU4 or any other Paradox games.

Also the mods are great, if you want to see some ""quality"" mods check loverslab that has the best mods for this game in the whole world.

Also CK2 has always changing difficulty, not like in EU4 where its always France and the Ottomans who will become the huge blob, here its different.

Like when I did the 7 century achivement run I ended up seeing a medieval great war between the reformed africans and me  as a reformed soumonesko pagan fighting against eachother in the middle of Poland, while the remaning Christians were doing religious battle royal on the British isle.

The only 2 downside for this game is that very late game it runs like shit, the Black Death would help your performance by killing off a lot of people, but if you play a long game most of the world has built good hospitals.

It shows you the power of setting ambitious long term goals and persisting through the inevitable setbacks along the way. It teaches you that if you work hard, you can get what you want, if you can come up with enough bullshit justifications to convince other people to go along with you. It shows the importance of being a good parent, but also to be kind and not blame yourself if you give birth to the Antichrist.

I initially bounced off the game back in 2013 due to the tutorial being nowhere near complete. I eventually figured it out by watching Arumba and quill18 on YouTube. On my first successful game, I started as a small count in Western Europe and ended up conquering most of the continent in my pursuit of ridding it of the Karolinger dynasty. I also managed to inherit the Byzantine Empire after many years of planning. Then the Horse Lords patch came out and corrupted my ironman save. I keep backups now.

Recently I've been playing as a Ghanan ruler with the 769 start date. In previous attempts I was conquered by the much stronger caliphates I had for neighbours, but this time I managed to get a hold of a few coastal provinces and Canarias and began funding myself through raiding. I reformed my faith to be Unyielding (high defensive bonuses) and Sea-Bound (cheap ship maintenance, for easier raiding). The Totem-Guardians doctrine specific to African faiths contains the Religious Tax doctrine, which allowed me to ironically tax Muslims for being infidels. Together this gave me enough funds to defend myself, but once I had defeated all the smaller rulers, I was still too weak to deal with either the Umayyad or Abbasid caliphates which were my only remaining neighbours. Then the Abbasids declared a holy war for Canarias. I initially managed to beat them back, but then they dropped a huge army on the island and I had nowhere near the ships to deal with it. I didn't want to give up. Decades of skirmishing followed. I assassinated multiple caliphs, sent councillors to cause chaos and slowly started to encroach on their territory. One of the caliph's vassals hated him so much he sent me money to aid in my war against his liege. The AI kept asking for a white peace, and I kept declining. If they had to surrender, they would have to pay me most of the money they had left. Because so many of their armies were tied up dealing with me, it also made them weaker against revolts and other attackers. Eventually after 35ish years of continuous war, the holy war ended due to the casus belli becoming invalid. This initially felt anticlimatic, but then I noticed the reason was that the entire caliphate had fallen apart. The vassals had become independent and much easier to deal with. Crusader Kings 2 is great for allowing these kinds of stories to emerge at a large scale, but it's equally capable of telling a more personal tale like becoming the homosexual son of Satan and conquering most of Eastern Europe with your friends Circe, Jezebel and Morgana.

If I had to offer criticism, it would be that human players are maybe a bit too advantaged versus the AI. If you know what you're doing you become difficult to stop. Teleporting commanders all over the map feels a bit like an exploit. Way of Life micromanagement when you have a lot of offspring can get a bit tedious. I actually like the DLC system because it has allowed funding continuous development on the game for 7 years after it was released, and it's not necessary to get all of it.",1587741584,1587808896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are trying to maintain your rule and if possible to grow it. There are a lot of tools to help you get there.

That leads to what might be seen as the biggest downside to the game. This game has the biggest learning curve of any I have played. There is a lot of effort needed to master all the tiny details. I would recommend playing with a friend who has played before if possible.

This is, without question, one of the best strategy games ever made. Start as a humble count or earl and forge a dynasty that will one day rule entire continents... One day. But road ahead is long and beset on all sides by rivals, assassins, heretics, plagues, wars, crusades and SEX. Lots and lots of sex. 

if starting low down doesn't sound like your thing then don't worry. Literally any medieval figure features as playable, from Henry VIII to Otto of Wessex. The map stretches from India to Iceland. The scale is breathtaking.

ONE BIG CON
The sheer amount of DLC you'd have to get to have the same experience as me is outright stupid, I admit it.
However we need to remember that these DLC's where added after the games full completion.
India was never intended to be on the map when they released it, however they added it.
China was never suppose to be interacted with but they did that too in a later DLC.
While having all these dlcs might look bad for a person who gets the game today, and want to enjoy the same experience as me, these DLCs have been added throught the years of the games life.

And it has nothing to do with the care Paradox took to represent succession laws, cultural groups, overlapping political jurisdictions (though all that is extremely impressive too). Rather, the brilliance of this game lies in this: it lets you inhabit a single person, and only a single person at a time, and through that person forces you to interact with a world populated by hundreds (thousands?) of individuals, each with his/her own interests and opinion of you. It’s this deeply personal (or interpersonal) mechanic that is missing from other nominally ""historical games"", all of which boil down to mere the glorified chess games (Civ et al.) or laughably thin economic simulators (Total War et al.). CKII is a masterpiece in historical simulation. That sense you have when playing CKII of interacting with personalities, of swimming in an ocean of competing and incommensurate interests, and of small decisions leading (often unpredictably) to significant changes in politics and power dynamics -- it’s the only game I’m aware of that actually comes close to simulating what it’s like to be a person living in history.

TL;DR:Hands down the best game I have ever played! The base game is good but the DLC really make it shine. The dynasty system is a great idea and really helps with immersion and roleplay, no other game like this.

Side note: there's a really good fanbase for this game so if you have any doubts or queries just ask on the facebook let's play group and people will be more than happy to help.

Pros:
-User interface: this is a bit overwhelming at first, but you'll find everything is a click or two away when you get the hang of it
-Multiplayer: you can start of grand strategy campaigns with Friends or strangers that can last days or weeks if you so wish. Should someone quit, you're still able to pick up where you left off in the singleplayer mode
-Leveling system: This is one of the best I've come across, although you can't level your character per se, The countless ways you can upgrade various parts of your holdings/realm/laws/etc, all have a large impact.

Neutral:
-Graphics: Nothing to write home about, but this is not the reason you buy the game
-Features: Although the base game is already able to suck away hundreds of hours of your life, certain gameplay styles and features aren't available untill you get the countless DLC

Cons: 
I will never get back the 1000+ hours of my life that I have lovingly committed to this game and my various characters.

P.S. If you're thinking of getting the game/DLC, or have any questions, feel free to ask me anything.",1586709031,1586709031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What it is: a grand strategy game mixed with RPG elements. In CK 2, you will be commanding armies, engaging in diplomacy, and managing the economy on behalf of a medieval polity (be that a western european kingdom, islamic sultanate, pagan tribe, etc.), but you don't just play as the polity itself. You play as a dynasty, with one character at a time through the line of inheritance as each one of them eventually perishes. Each of your characters has a wealth of traits, making them feel unique, and the ""country"" that you control changes based on what your new character inherits (or what they don't).

Gameplay: Will feel familiar to all people familiar with Paradox, the developer/publisher. You play on a world map divided into provinces (think Risk). You control a certain number of provinces, and your goal, such as you have one, is to keep the provinces you have an obtain more. Each province in the game world (Europe, north Africa, the Middle East, India, and Central Asia) has a ruler. Playable characters in CK2 are divided into tiers: from lowly counts to regal Emperors. A ruler of a higher tier can have lower tier ruler as a vassal. You can play as the top ruler in a realm, or as a vassal with another character as your liege lord. 

The game is a sandbox, with no set goals. Victory is determined by the dynasty that has the most ""prestige"" (a measure of how famous and respected you are based on your achievements and your ancestors') at the end of the game, but ""winning"" isn't really important. In wartime, you raise armies from your provinces (at the beginning of the game, you have no standing army and need to raise levies of peasants to fight for you in wartime, though that changes with time) and attempt to defeat enemy armies in the field and capture enemy provinces in sieges. Battles are AI-determined based on troop numbers, traits of commanders, and RNG. Sieges are basically parking on an enemy province and waiting for a timer to run out. Most provinces have multiple settlements, all of which can be sieged and captured.

At peace, you're tasked with managing your realm and conducting diplomacy. You can ally with foreign rulers by marrying your family members to theirs. You can develop your realm by spending money constructing buildings in your provinces. You can manage unruly vassals by bribing them with money and titles or inviting them round for a beer. You can go on a pilgrimage to a faraway holy site. You can plot to kidnap or murder your rivals and they can do the same to you. There's way too much that you can do to describe everything here, but for the most part it boils down to reading flavor texts in popup windows and making choices, with an RNG determining the outcome.

I find this game absolutely engrossing, but I understand some people will find it boring. It's thrills come more from seeing a plan decades (in game years) in the making finally come to fruition or successfully seizing territory in a war, not from heart-pumping action or visuals. This type of game is often called a map-staring simulator for a reason. However, this is a particularly good map staring simulator. The RPG elements of representing a particular person add immensely to the immersion. Some of the best moments in this came come from making the decisions your character would make, not necessarily the ones YOU think are best. There are very few other Grand Strategy titles out there that nail this at all, and none as well as CK2.

Recommended for: Any grand strategy fans that want a personal touch to the gameplay, and who don't require real time battles to have fun.

So why the down vote? it's level of depth is it's undoing- I simply don't have the time to spend learning the game. While that may not be fair to the game itself, for me it's a deal breaker I just can't get into it. I think if you get past the learning curve it could be a very enjoyable experience.

203770,66642779,76561198844209116,0,8,87761,8,33035,1708557754,"The young prince was born only two weeks before his father was killed in battle with a neighboring kingdom. He grew up, learning the ways of war, until when he was 14 years old, his regent, the spymaster of England, had him imprisoned on false charges so he could rule in the young king's stead. The king languished in prison until he was 21, when he broke out, exacted revenge on his spymaster, and took control of the kingdom that was rightfully his.

That's just one story from my many hours of playing Crusader Kings, a game that let's you control the military planning and court intrigue of a medieval noble, from lowly count to majestic emperor. It gives you the chance to live out the lives of royals, making choices that might just affect your character, or could have ramifications for your entire realm. You can forge alliances through marriage, or forge a new bloodline to rival that of the Karlings or Alexander the Great. You can peacefully spread your religion by sending missionaries, or spread it by the tip of the sword. The choice is yours.

I only have two major complaints: The user interface and controls can be very complicated, especially for beginners, and to get the full experience, you'll need to fork over a lot of money on DLC. When you start playing your first Paradox game, it wouldn't be surprising if you took a moment to soak in everything on screen, unsure of what is important and what is just quality of life. The tutorial does a little to help with the basics, but the only way to learn is to play, and try new things, and to make mistakes. And the game will give you plenty of chances to make mistakes. And losing your kingdom to have to build it back up again is just part of the experience.

But back to the other main issue with this game: the DLC. The only good time to get the DLC is when it's cheap and on sale, and if you're not a nerdy medieval fanboy like me, don't bother with the cosmetic packs. While many of the components from the DLC are in the base game, they can only be utilized fully with the DLC. Most of the DLC is worth it though, and if you can get a good deal on it, I recommend them all.

All in all, if you like the sounds of playing as a medieval king raising a family while doing their best to take over the entirety of Europe, while also being maybe a bit of a lunatic, then this game is probably for you. It takes persistence to learn, and doesn't fit everyone's style. Watch some videos of the game and decide if you like it. If you do, well, get ready to build your kingdom, outsmart your rivals, and take your place in history!

(As a note, they've also announced Crusader Kings 3, which will come out soonish. If you'd prefer to wait and get that, be my guest. I personally feel like Paradox games aren't complete until they start making DLC, so I'll be waiting a bit to get it, but that decision is up to you.

Try it, it's free. I bought the game and refunded it the first time around because starting out was overwhelming... but giving it another chance a few weeks later when on sale again it became my favourite game I've played, beating every other game I've played by leagues.

However, once you have mastered the game mechanics, and understand how all the game mechanics are suppose to work, this game will make you so annoyed and plainly just pissed off.

The game is simple enough to get into, but complex enough to make you feel like it is complex and challenging.  However, start delving into that complex game play and what you really find is an AI that acts like a spiteful, obstinate, 5-year-old.  It's not challenging you with a thought-out (or well-programmed) strategy in mind.  No, the AI just does not want to do what you want to do.  If you want to do ""x,"" the AI will allow everything else but ""x"" to happen, even at the detriment of the character(s) that AI is controlling.  This behavior is so persistent in the game that it will do some simply unbelievable things to make sure you can not attain ""x.""

When you require the AI to do something else besides being a stubborn brat, it falls on its face.  I struggle to find reasons to allow AI armies to fight on my side.  They usually either run off and do not contribute to the war in any significant manner, run headlong into the enemy in a suicide attempt that helps the enemy win the war, or they wander about aimlessly and again, not contribute to the war effort.

Worst part about all of this is, the developers have known about the AI behaving horribly for years.  However, instead addressing it in any relevant and useful manner, the devs decide to keep adding on new pieces to this Frankenstein.  This reference is to the movie Young Frankenstein, however.  In that movie, the assistant uses an abnormal brain, ruining the body of work just like the AI ruins the body of work here.

Unfortunately, a DLC that reworks the AI is not considered flashy, and is not something they could charge the player base $15 - $30 for.  Players would expect a fix to the AI to be free and, well, the devs just cant be arsed to do that much work for free....so polishing this turd with flashy new things that do not address the base problems of the game will continue.

I just can't put another hour of time into this game.  The problems are glaring and because of how the game works, they only snowball into bigger and bigger problems until you can not ignore them any further.  Until they do a SERIOUS rework of this AI, do not put any money into this game.

TL;DR: The AI does not make the game difficult, but it's behavior is obnoxious, and it makes the game so tedious and UNFUN to play.",1551035337,1585237262,False,7,6,0.488035500049591064,0,True,False,False

It's also one of my favourite games.
Crusader Kings 2 is not for everyone. It is built for a specific subset of weirdos like me, and I don't know how many people are gonna be able to get into it beyond that. But it is brilliant for what it is. Crusader Kings 2 allows you to play as a ruler in the Medieval world, and presents you with a challenge: attain power, outwit your foes, and ensure your dynasty lasts. To make this happen, a dizzying array of mechanics are given to you, turning this game into a fusion of a 4X strategy game and an RPG.
Yes, the game is deliberately unbalanced, but this is part of the fun, and can be understood as a difficulty setting; certain rulers are gonna have an easier time than others. Yes, the game is reliant on randomness, but that makes it interesting, and forces you to change strategies (or allows you to exploit openings) to survive. Rarely does this game just become checking items off of a list; you need to adapt to what the world is throwing at you, and one big mistake can send it all tumbling down.
I will confess: this is not an elegant or accessible game. The learning curve is steep, which is a shame, because I want to bring as many people in on this as possible. But if you're willing to push through the complexity, you'll find the delicious caramel centre at the heart of this game: the ability to make absolutely bonkers historical narratives come to life between deeply flawed people trying to guide the ship of state.

Primarily, I got it out an already established interest in historical grand strategy games, but my love of this game was intensified once coming across the fan-made A Game of Thrones mod. As a result, I became a fully fledged addict of this game, and have actually deleted this game completely from my library once, only to buy it once more again... #firstworldproblems

After establishing a somewhat healthier relationship with playing this game compulsively, I am now able to give my opinions on the game, hopefully as unbiased as possible.

This game is incredibly detailed on its historical accuracy, to an impressive amount. Figures both important and incredibly minor all appear and often with extensive personal histories themselves. It's very possible to trace a lot of historical information from characters and it be more or less accurate to the real historical situation (this is true of vanilla as well as the AGOT mod).

Mechanically, the game has ironed out a lot of the kinks over the years, having tweaked old mechanics and continued to introduce new ones that keep people excited (the most recent example would be 'Great Works', and independent system for building and managing buildings of major importance in the world) and it now provides a very fluid experience with a lot of content to play with.

And that is where this game truly shines; its content. There is so much here that players can sink their teeth in to; seemingly endless story arcs for every character, who will be uniquely built every time you play as them, and constant challenges and threats from those who covet what you have or who seek to thwart your own ambitions. It's a constant struggle against your enemies, your friends and yourself when playing this game, and the presentation of all of this makes it extremely easy to roleplay any type of character you may wish. You could be a pious man of God who hopes to keep the peace between his neighbours, or an utterly devious lord of ambition whose only desire is to achieve as much power as possible, or something in between. Or perhaps you could even have a character make such a transformation in the space of their life; all it takes is for a mad Greek emperor to cut your balls off for a little bit of harmless scheming and suddenly you've gone from 'paragon of virtue' to 'Glitterhoof enthusiast'.

The directions in this game are endless, and that gives it an incredible replay value that I've found is very difficult to match in any other game. With the ultimate goal of furthering the interests of your own dynasty at the forefront of your mind at all times, and taking the game gradually generation by generation, it's easy to get lost in this world as you fashion your own stories around what you're doing. Sure, sometimes ridiculous things happen on the map that you'd never expect, but it's all a part of that endlessly unpredictable wave that life itself is a part of too.

What I'm trying to say is Crusader Kings 2 ruined my life. I love it.",1435705790,1584893250,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Okay you know what, we're not just gonna make a meme out of this.

Crusader Kings II is absolutely one of the finest strategy games on the market, in that it's... also basically a pretty decent RPG as well. Considering that the base game is free now, it's much better to play the game itself and see exactly what sort of stuff you can get into! The number of completely ad-hoc story generation is amazing, and... frankly, I'd suggest to just play. Also, modding! Extremely moddable, with many amazing settings from existing IPs to completely new things for you to govern and rule and die horribly to plagues.

Negative: Without the DLC, huge portions of the world are unplayable, leaving you with just (at this point) stripped down versions of Catholic and Orthodox Europe, and some of the DLC still have issues with them that were never fixed. Some mechanics are broken forever in some fashion, especially from older DLC, the merchant republics from The Republic are hard-coded messes that only barely function and are even less fun, and the nomads of Horse Lords... well.

The DLC are all great, the only one I do not have is legacy of Rome and only because I do not like how everyone can have a standing army, I feel like only a Kingdom or a Empire or the highest liege should be able to have a standing Army during the middle ages. If I want to reconquer the Roman Empire then I play as the greeks. I renamed the Byzantine Empire to the Roman Empire anyway. This is my opinion.

Religion plays a big part and is varied with the big ones such as the Muslims and Christians being there along with obscure ones such as Zunists. The modding community is huge, and the mods themselves can transform the map, religions, and cultures into pretty much anything you'd want from Tamriel to Azeroth. The only downside is how greedy the publishers are. If they can monetize even the smallest new feature, they will. Other than that the game is great for those who love player freedom.

Once you do that, the political squabbling of the middle ages (or today) makes much more sense. A state isn't a machine and you don't drive it like a racecar. In CKII your aristocrats pursue their interests within it, and diplomacy is an extension of internal political squabbling. Sometimes that involves expansion and building nice things ... and sometimes it means tearing countries stuff apart. It also makes the honours and mechanics of courts and feudal family politics real game mechanic material instead of decorative fluff.

The endless amounts of replay ability this game has is endless and playing Multiplayer is a must do. Its free now at least and CK3 i feel won't be much of an improvement. It has a play style for anything you want to be, there is a mod that make theocracies playable at least, so u can pretty much play anything.

When I see the store page, and see the grand total of 300+ euros for the full package, I understand why people complain. But I must disagree. I have spent about 125 euros total on this game + DLC's (I have almost all functional expansions) and will gladly recommend the (almost) full functional package at that price, no question. There have been plenty of sales and I could have gotten it all even cheaper if so inclined. So price to me is not a con here.

What remains is one of the best games, if not THE BEST game I have!

Some reasons why:

1. My main amazement with CK II is the fact that I have felt friendship in this game, and have felt glad to have a friend. I have felt kinship, and have felt the need to protect my own. I have more or less understood love and hate between characters, and the intrapersonal dynamics of power that fuel it.

All these things have been of great influence on how I perceived the world through my active character, the choices I was presented with, etcetera. I cannot remember playing any game ever that pulled this off.

2. The scope of the game is incredible, as is the way strategic hidden gems are just lying around waiting to be found and taken advantage of. The greater whole of all the systems running in this game create a very vivid environment which is simply fun to interact with and analyze.

3. The King is dead, long live the King! What can I say? Living the lives of your Kings and Queens can be an amazing experience. There will be heroes, there will be failures. Quite often not where you expect them. CK II does a good job at throwing life at your characters. The passing of a heroic warrior King is not something to be taken lightly.

5. Excellent UI and presentation- I thought the game was very accessible if you consider the complexity of it's systems. 


With CK III in the making, I believe this game is a landmark still worth buying. And I believe it will remain so for a while.",1542228688,1583668723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game isn't about a grand ""You Won!"" victory screen, but the journey that brought you there. Want to roleplay as a worthless, imbicile lord who's just been lucked onto a throne? You got it. Want to be a king who installs their trusted horse as a chancellor of the realm? That's cool too. 

When you're tired of playing in Catholic Europe, there are so many possibilities that are fleshed out for the Islamic and Hindi world as well. Unfortunately, those are thrown under the DLC-Bus that Paradox is known very well for. The good news to that, believe it or not, is that Holy Fury is the last DLC for Crusader Kings II, so it is effectively a finished product. 

If I was going to buy CK2 today, right now, I'd HIGHLY recommend at least Way of Life. Conclave and Monks+Mystics are a strong second choice, but every other DLC can be added as needed, if needed. Holy Fury is fun, but if you LOVE playing as medieval India, a lot of the content in that DLC will be worthless to you.

Graphically there isn't much here which for the price and amount you have to spend on DLC content, I expected better for my money.  Granted strategy games don't have much need for them but compared to others like Civilization V it really is lacking in that department. 

As to game play firstly there isn't a tutorial at all and there is also a lot of menu interfaces that a player will have to navigate. It really does force you to click on each one to figure out how what the menu does. Notifications the game gives also aren't helpful in getting to the correct menus so what was the point.

Another annoying thing about the game play is the unwritten rules each grouping of cultures and people have in place. For instance if you play as a Christian nation like England then you have to come up with a Casus Belli or ""Cause for War"" to go claim another territory. Something like that should be as simple as bigger army crushes little arm and gains spoils of war is made cumbersome when it shouldn't be. 

Additionally to learn more of this game enjoy reading a sizable wiki just to understand the basics. Sorry but basic content of a game should be made available in game. Not having to do more homework just to figure out basic features. 

I have spent a fair amount of time on this game to truly give it a chance but after the frustrations of having to research just to understand what basic features and mechanics are there was no enjoyment. Also be ready to fall into the Paradox trap of shelling out a lot of cash for DLC content that really doesn't add much more to the game.

A very fun game I've spent over 1000 hours and I can say for certain if you enjoy medieval map games and your own EXPANDING *or declining* realm this game is for you.

Look forward to micro-managing your bloodline! Family first after all!
Oh what my son is planning too kill me again? Oh that silly lad!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Never part of any clubs or cliques at school?
Well we got secret societies always looking for new members! 
(Burning to death for heresy may apply.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Or perhaps you are a more religious person? WELL WE GOT YOU COVERED, Deus vult my friend!
 We got Catholism, Orthodoxy, Islam, Hinduism, Buddism, Tengri! THAT RHYMES WITH ANGRY! (And many more)
Oh the wholesome fun we will be having slaying those infidels of the wrong faith!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps you wish to be other government types other then feudal in a medieval game? Well I don't know why the hell you'd want that but HEY! we got that too, enjoy playing as a neo-feudal republic where you get to rig the elections for generations, kill tons of old dudes! They've lived long enough anyhow! and money spam till your computer dies! Being savages! excuse me *Tribal* is also an option too! but hey maybe you want to downgrade even further? Well we got you covered kiddo! ever want to ride horseback in the great steppes of Mother Russia? Neither have I! but its an option none the less! Nomads! enjoy annoying mechanics and an unstable realm! We got it all here folks! (Except theocracies for some reason.)
---------------------------------------------------------
I'm too lazy to go on just buy it or don't 
The DLC is pretty expensive honestly and some of it should be in the base game
Overall its a good game though even in vanilla due to the mod community (Game of Thrones) (Romance of the Three kingdoms) (Avatar) Tons of variations to have fun with see ya.

the basic DLC pack will open up just enough of the game that you can click on a lot of new feautures, only to be told its part of another DLC you don't have. Its dissapointing because i've always wanted to get into ck2, EU IV and vic II but I can't justify spending the equivalent of a console on these tittles just to play the game as its meant to. 

I'm not sure how to write this without sounding irrationally bitter, its hard. The DLC is good in that they do add a lot to the game, but only a few of them add something that feels like it shouldnt just be included for free. Sunset invasion? I don't own it, but it makes sense to me. It adds a mayan invasion mechanic that totally forces you to change how you play and plan. Cool, no issues with that.  Reapers due? a 17 dollar DLC to incorporate the plague into a game set in mideivil times? That should have been a no for me dog. To expand on that example,  The reapers due DLC also allows you to build hospitals to prevent diseases in your territory as well as adding some new diseases to deal with. With only the base game you will still have disease out breaks (they just arent called plague) but you won't be able to build hospitals, nor will your neighbours so you will be at the mercy of that mechanic without the DLC.  There is the option to build a great wonder , and use two feauture slots to build something that helps with disease resistance but the most you will get is 5%. for new players, a wonder will cost 10X what the hospital does, will take 11- 20 years to build, and using the feauture slots for the disease resistance is kind of a waste compared to the other perks you could build into it. The base hopsital building gives a better disease resistance and is affordable in the early game and can be upgraded.  This is what makes me tap out on paradox as a dev I do business with.  The way their DLC interacts with the main game makes it seem really obvious that these are feautures that were removed in the development stages, not an innovation to the game. there are numerous other examples like the reapers due. If you dont buy all of the DLC pertaining to islam, the islamic factions will either be crazy overpowered while mainland europe is struggling to make flame consistently, or they'll be a punching bag for crusades. Without that DLC Spain always fell to to islam, then they move into france/ italy and create a large enough muslim force that no crusade being called can stop it. Because usually only the UK will avoid it, but they'll be getting plugged by vikings if you don't have the DLC to balance them out, and even if you do, theyre just really god damn strong like vikings were.  This was cool an dynamic the first 15 times it happened. Then I buy some DLC, the islamc factions get the decadence mechanic and a few others, then they function like a legitmate counter balance to the catholic and unorthodox church. Just another example of  them forcing you to buy DLC that just makes the base game work as it should. Does paradox expect me to believe they didnt run test play throughs and watch the same 5 outcomes happen everytime? Historic Mongol invasion that for sure happened as DLC? Is this a historical sim or not? Want to create a character and plug him into a tittle and have your own version of history? DLC. the list goes on. And when you get curious about EU4 (you will) you'll see that it is not free, with the same DLC model.  Along with all other paradox tittles. Paradox can make a fun to play game, no argument here but I put my Footdown at 100$, and I take the time to write a review at 250$ -300$. There is nothing  game dev can do to make CK2 or EU worth that much, sorry. Were talking about a game that has been around for like a decade, get real. I believe in paying for products I like and supporting dev's who games I enjoy but fuck off. Bundle all of this into a 100$ then sure it'd be worth it. the base game, the DLC that shouldn't be DLC, and the actual innovative DLC for a 100$ would be reasonable to me.

The other thing worth mentioning is there isnt a whiff of a tutorial. they say there is, but there isn't. The tutorial teaches you how to get annexed by islam. the base game is free, so its a minor complaint but you will find the same thing in EU4 and Vic2. I personally dont mind learnring strategy games by loosing at them for a bit, but someone new to strategy games isn't going to figure it out. I swear this is because they don't want to explain to you how little is happening in your DLC free experience. Before you comment that I must have just ""not figured it out"" I did. I was fabricating claims, creating my tittles. setting up my succession and so on, it just got stale real quick, and I dont think charging me another 20$ to have mayans come and take a big shit on my playthrough was the answer for it getting stale.",1581891498,1581891498,False,1,0,0.456140369176864624,0,True,False,False

Fabricate a claim on your neighbor's county, declare war and conquer it, ransom his children back to him, plot to and then later assassinate the Baron who ruled over you both, start a political movement to usurp the kingdom as your own, then personally lead a massive army to conquer the neighboring kingdom and declare yourself Emperor shortly before you die from a burst blood vessel while yelling at your council and the sons you had with your concubines tear the empire apart into their own kingdoms because you forgot to change the inheritance laws to primogeniture.

Do all this while avoiding plagues, assassins, envious courtiers, maladies, and even old age, while the game keeps it light with often humorously-phrased text windows and obscure pop culture references. (Not to say that it's a comedy game, just that it's not overly dramatic.)

Unlike Spore, this achieves what it wants to be, though there's many many DLCs (which do add quality content) that Paradox put out to keep the lights on.

PROS

- MASSIVE RTS, THis shit is on some Crazy THIC lvll. so much shit going on impossible to keep up with everything. Even if you keep the game on pause for 20 years.
- Open ended game you can do whatever. Example: You wanna create the Antichrist. well you're in luck! go on and get the achievement for it. OR build a mercenary army do you some proxy war mongering, you sly devil you... Create women's rights in the 14 Century, keep that wife happy, smart move.
- Events that keep the game interesting. To say the least.....
- Map is big and alive with all kinds of cultures and dynasties 
- play almost anyone from duke to king or emperor.  They even have important people that actually lived.  POGU for those history fams out there.
- Many mods on the steam workshop and mod database. 
- CK2 Community is actually really helpful and kind
- Game is repeatable 
- This type of game you can play while you multi task doing something else like netflix. so yay for ADD

CONS

- AI are so damn dumb. ruin everything imo. if your character gets possessed trait well its a rap for he or she. Allied factions spend their waking days trying to drag your ass in wars non stop.
- Learning curve is HIGH and takes quite awhile to learn. BE patient <--- thats a trait in CK2 FYI. not the best for powerful leaders
- This game is expensive AF!  buy when its on sale AND only buy the expansion with content, fuck all the music BS or superficial skins. 
- I get a lot of online desyns when i try to play with people online. It might be me... idk",1580986089,1580986598,True,19,2,0.614410400390625,0,True,False,False

If you, as I, enjoy watching a map for hundreds of hours, thinking up one master plan to conquer the world after another, this is your game.

Also, you can (and should) kill your wife because she's to old to produce an heir and doesn't have nice big stats like that new courtier, although you could also just ask the pope for a divorce, you'd probalably have to bribe him, unless he is your vassal of course... Anyway. You can also see Poland get ruled by a midget; have delusions that you are a werewolf and accidently kill your perfect trophy wife; ransom your prisoners; recreate the roman empire; focus on debouchery; accidently leave your heir in a city with typhoid fever; not so accidently have your sick heir lead a very small army in a very hostile place; and have 3 concubines if you're the right culture.

With the last expansions you now have a council that makes ruling your realm an absolute nightmare, you can also get way more diseases, torture peope in detail, and join a cult of devil worshippers if you should so fancy. And when the Caliphate is proclaiming it's 8th jihad for Jerusalem and my council disagrees on absolutely everything I want to do, I do. I do fancy some devil worshipping and torture in the morning.

2: The game is more fun with friends(self-explanatory)
3:The modding for this game easily adds hundreds of hours and stories onto the already extensive game.

Opinion:
1:Its a good game when it is not working, it is a great game when it is working(this is somewhat a joke i have not encountered many bugs that could not be  solved by restarting the game)
2: Optimization is somewhat hit and miss
3: DLC is EXTENSIVE and EXPENSIVE so I will list my personal favorites(In no particular order except Holy Fury it is by far prob my favorite)

Pros
- Unique experience. I don't know any other dynasty building game that also allows you to conquer realms, create kingdoms and duchies.
- Hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay. You can play as any count, duke, king or emperor from 1066 to 1337. The game itself plays on until 1453 and with Charlemagne DLC, you can start in 769 AD, leaving you almost 700 years of gameplay.
- Trait systems add interesting flair to each character, as they impact their relationship with their vassals, the amount of troops they can raise and they prowess at commanding armies and fighting duels. Striking a balance between marrying women with strong or genius traits to increase the odds of your own heir being strong and quick, or forging alliances.

Cons
- Rather simplistic combat system. You raise some troops, march them against the enemy. If you have more troops you almost always win, unless the terrain is not in your favour. No real tactics to develop
- Rather simple strategy game. The simplistic combat system makes it such that planing your conquest or survival mostly hinges on checking how many troops you have vs how many the enemy has. Since you almost always win if you have more, the strategy element is mostly missing.
- Supply system makes no sense. Castles just make sieges last longer. They do not protect or shield anything, which is what castles were used for. No matter how big a castle you raise, with enough time the enmy will capture it. There is no logistics mechanism in place. You can walk all over your enemy's land and the only thing you have to fear is their army larger than yours. 
- Map is crooked. Maybe not an issue for some but for someone with mild OCD like me, it drives me nuts that Crete is closer to Egypt than Athens, or that Sicily is south of Tunis. Arabia and North Africa are disfigured in relation to Eurasia. Historical Immersion Project (HIP) corrects this mistake but it seems such an easy thing to fix. This is mostly an OCD thing and doesn't impact gameplay at all but I hate playing in the Mediteranean because of this.
- Vassal system is in general very good. The more a vassal likes you the more troops you can raise from him. However, When raising troops from your vassals, your vassal retains their own troops. To put it another way, You have 4k troops in your demesne, and 4 vassal dukes, with 1.5k troops each. When you raise the 6k vassal troops, your dukes still have 1.5k troops at their disposal. What? Where from? It's like the duke clones his army and lets you use his clones that die when you disband them. 
The other major flaw with the vassal system is best shown in HRE and the Byzantines, and blobs in general. Because the HRE was composed of 7 (I think) core duchies plus other kingdoms/duchies incorporated into it, the game shows the HRE as massive with plenty of vassals. This is true but what happened in real life is these dukes were virtually independent, and the emperor could rarely muster a very large army. In CK2, however, HRE can raise anywhere up to 30k troops, which is kind of absurd. France by comaprison, really seems to struggle mustering more than 10k. This leads to HRE becoming totally OP in the game and the ''ally the HRE'' as a war winning move meme. Byzantines suffer from a similar problem whereby they always survive (1066 start date) and expand. There is no mechanism for unblobbing. Once you get enough vassals you are basically immune.

You control a character for the duration of their rule and proceed onto their heirs through the centuries. Note that these characters are not just idle collections of stats but they have personalities that will evolve as you play them and as semi-random events happen to you and give you choices that really get you roleplaying.

In the base game, you can play as any christian ruler between 1066 and 1337 and, due to the nature of feudalism, you are not limited to playing powerful kings or emperors but you can choose a minor count or duke and work your way up within your realm through scheming and strategic marriages. You can expand on your choice of playable characters with DLC but more on that later.

While it is very appealing once started, the game does have a bit of a learning curve to it, especially if you haven't played Paradox games before. My suggestion is to start as a count in Ireland in 1066 and slowly get used to the gameplay by exploring the notifications that pop up and dealing with new mechanics as your realm expands and you will take on further responsibilities. Everyone has a game where they don't know what's going on and that's the best learning experience.

If the setting is not your cup of tea, you can entrust yourself to many wonderful total conversion mods that will have you live many lives in the worlds of: Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, the Witcher and further original settings.

You may have noticed that there is a significant amount of DLC for sale. Most people get overwhelmed by both the scale and the price but rest assured that none of these packs are necessary to play. Each of them is themed around a particular aspect of the game so I would suggest that you try and play the base game (it's free so why not) and, if you enjoy it, you can buy DLC that either give you more content or unlock Muslims, Nomads, Pagans or earlier start dates. The price will start to seem like a steal when you play hundreds of hours and you've only had to pay a few cents for each hour of entertainment.

Crusader Kings 2 is a game that keeps on giving even after hundreds of hours. There is such a huge amount of content and possible starts that you will struggle to find boredom in it.

Part of the fun of the game is simply learning the way the game functions. I'd recommend watching a number of tutorials on something like Youtube before you spend too many hours wondering how to accomplish almost anything.

Have had the game since launch, but left it alone for quite a while, coming back to it every now and again.

I was a big fan of Paradox back in the day. I had the original Europa Universalis 1 and 2/Hearts of Iron 1 and 2 and could put up with the game breaking bugs at launch waiting months for them to be fixed, due to them making great (niche at the time) games.

Now that it is free i can't recommend it enough if you enjoy sandbox/role-play style games. People will moan about the DLC's and, tbf, they have a point-you don't need every DLC but if you do it can cost a pretty penny. Saying that, there are tons of free mods which masses of content i.e. LOTH, GOT, WOW, relics, werewolves/vampires/zombies/Santa Claus etc etc so you don't need the DLC's if you get bored of the Vanilla. I, personally, have purchased the majority (most relevant) of the DLC's but that's because I've put in a 1000+ hours into the game. Even then I've only ever purchased them while they are on sale. 

Beware, there is a massive learning curve to this game and I strongly recommend watching a crash course tutorial on youtube before starting as it can be REALLY off putting if you don't know how to use the UI and the in-game tutorial is pretty shitty tbh.

It is by far the worst paradox grand strategy game and this is for a number of different reasons. The first reason is due to the fact that i don't enjoy the way that the different nobles in your country are able to brake away when you ruler dies, when this happens it makes me feel like i have wasted a lot of time for nothing, the second reason this i cannot recommend the game is due to the base game feeling so unfinished. This is due to you only being able to play in Europe meaning that you have to buy DLC in order to play half of the map. While I tried to get into the game the reasons listed really put me off the game.

While i think that the time period and the dynasty customisation have a lot of potential and the crusades are fun to take part in, overall the game is just not fun for me to play.

Combining the grand-strategy nation-building of Civilization and Europa Universalis with the personable character-driven role-playing experience offered by titles such as New Vegas and Warband, Crusader Kings II offers diverse gameplay experiences which one can easily drain thousands of hours into. The dozens of traits, cultures, and situations the player could potentially finds themselves in spawns thousands of different special events, and hundreds of event chains, which keep the game from ever getting lethargic or stagnant. 

The modding community, much akin to most other Paradox titles, is vibrant and flourishing. The critically acclaimed A Game of Thrones Mod, much like HOI4's Kaiserreich, is widely considered by many players to be one of the greatest modifications ever made, and in addition a complete overall improvement upon the base experience. Considering around 1000 of my hours on CK2 have been on this mod, I'd be hard-pressed to disagree. 

However, I will not blindly give this game a full 100% recommendation, despite my great affection towards it. Crusader Kings II and Paradox both have a myriad of substantial issues, all revolving around DLC policy, which could prove as game-breaking for CK3 as they were for Imperator Rome.

Paradox's DLC policy is infamously miserable. Most of the material added could easily be implemented through updates, but instead are bifurcated and repackaged in the most inconvenient of ways so as to make the most amount of money as possible. This leaves the base-game feeling incomplete, and thus, not nearly as enjoyable as it was in years past. Crusader Kings II is by far my favorite strategy game of all time, but I'd be lying if I said it was worth the hundreds of dollars Paradox expects their customers to sink into their finally finished product. 

Not every DLC is horrible; I consider Holy Fury to be the greatest DLC Paradox has ever released, and a fitting final installment which breathed new life and hundreds of hours of possibilities into the game. The Reaper's Due is definitely worth the purchase, and The Old Gods is too, while being slightly overpriced. However, the vast majority of DLCs are, despite adding enjoyable and worthwhile content, thinly-veiled cash-grabs which I would only recommend accruing in the event of a Steam Sale. These DLCs, constituting the vast majority of CK2's downloadable content, should have either been:

a) included in the base-game (Ruler Designer, Customization Pack, The Republic)

b) included in an update (Jade Dragon, Legacy of Rome, Sunset Invasion, All Content Packs)

c) combined with other DLCs to form one fantastic DLC worthy of a $15 price tag (Sons of Abraham, Monks and Mystics, Way of Life, Conclave) (note: this would regularly cost OVER 50 US DOLLARS)
 
d) reduced in price by 33% (Sword of Islam, Horse Lords) to 50% (Charlemagne, Rajas of India)

The result of this revised DLC policy would still cost the player around $75, which is already profitable and expensive as fuck, and thrice the cost of The Witcher 3's DLCs. Shockingly, this revised $75 DLC price tag is 3-4x cheaper than the current one. Just by looking at these numbers, anyone with a modicum of common sense can easily discern Paradox's blatant greed. 

All in all, I definitely recommend trying out the base-game, the A Game of Thrones mod, as well as some of the better DLCs. CK3's impending launch will definitively show the world Paradox's true merit as a game developer. Whether it will be a phenomenal, innovative, and inspired sequel to CK2, a great game plagued by impending avaricious economic decisions, or an EA/Bethesda-level stripped down clone of its predecessor remains to be seen.",1579225058,1579225058,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

She has 17,000 troops while i have a measly 9,000 troops coming fresh from a holy war . She ALSO has the duke of Milan as an ally so that means another 12,000 troops on deck. I manage to get mercs and win two (2) major battles. After the second battle the mercs turn on me and declare an invasion. the battle cost me 2,000 troops im sitting at around 6000-7000 men. I make an alliance with France and they enter the war. meanwhile the franconians have an endless supply of money and hire MORE mercs. another 8000 so they are sitting at about 11000 with some more of her vassals showing up. I know france is my only hope. Two weeks after entering an alliance, A massive french civil war breaks out and they decide not to show up for the war. the pope, before the war began called for a crusade and the crusade started at the beginning of the war. Pope gets pissed because i didnt show up when im in the middle of a bloody war keeping my kingdom together. But then, Lithuania shows back up they want piece of their land back. i wouldn't just give those pagans my land but they had about 13000 men. I managed to forge an alliance with Lothungria, but they enter too late. Even with the Franconians never winning a battle, not one (1). they besiege enough land to win the war. I managed to get enough money for more mercs, dangerous i know but i wouldnt go down to these pagans without a fight.  The Day before my troops were set to arrive in a major clash of two armies...the mercs betrayed me. the moment my bank went negative they betrayed me. i fought for as long as possible but lost the combined forces of Lithuania and the mercs beat me.

===  I only own the base game, no DLC's unless they were provided free of cost.

+ the game is fun.

+ It is at it's heart a strategy game with very little tactical elements beyond generals' assignments based on their skill and terrain considerations.  It's about strengthening yourself by marrying to strong houses.  And conquering or vassalizing weaker neigherbors.

+ I enjoy this game, but i can definitely understand why some ppl wouldn't like it as much.

============
My suggestions to improve the game:

It would be nice if there were much more event style interactions between characters which show and develop their personality.  (Your vassal invites you to go falconing with him, but you'd already promised your wife a romantic row around the swan lake.  What will you do?)   ...options that allow you to choose between developing relationships between 1 or more persons; or between a relationship and your own skills.  So I can actually shape my ruler into something rather than being pretty static.  This should occur for all characters, not just the one the players is controlling and lead to small, medium, or large changes in relationships.

As it is, you wait 5 years to raise a too-low skill a few points through a mundane interaction you've probably seen before.  Just feels like it needs a lot more spiciness in this area in my opinion.

Maybe there is a setting to change the frequency of random events.  If not, i wish there was, with options being:  weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, bi-annually, annually, every [x] number of years.   With it not being 100% guaranteed, but somewhat random heavily weighted to occur at said interval.",1578443541,1578446229,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is fantastic and should be bought if it is seen on the market.

There is but one issue I have with the game and it is that the amount of DLC in the game is absurd. Now this goes with all paradox games, but so far I have bought 16 DLC/Expansion packs for CK2. The second most DLC I have would be for EU4 coming in at 8.

It's kind of like Europa Universalis 4 more character driven cousin - with its ""create your own story"" aspect of the game is which makes the game.

You can get all kinds of insane and... ""fun"" events - like your 17 year nephew trying to shag your 60+ year old ruler. Or like marrying a Duchess that is a widow and killing her male children to gurantee that your sons will inherit the dutchy, or instagate a rebellion against your king. Or start worshipping satan in hope that he will restore your ""crown jewles"" after castration, just to take a few examples of my own games.

The posibilities are truly endless with this game. The downsides are the complex mechanics you'll need to learn - like how inheritance and de-jure laws works and the extra DLC that you'll need for some parts, but if you enjoy the game I recommend picking up the DLC you find most interesting for the kind of gameplay you enjoy after spending some time with it.

This is not a game about conquering the world as the king of France or the like (though it certainly is possible) like EU4. This is a game about crafting your own story about your dynasty.

Over 6 years, and not only is this game still kicking, it's still getting massive content updates, like the recent Holy Fury.

Yes, I probably sank 200 bucks into this game and all it's DLCs by now, but take it like this: How many AAA titles at a 50-60€ price range can keep you truly occupied for a year and a half? Because that's what CKII did.

Paradox Interactive is one of the, in my humble oppinion, best game developement studious out there. They use the Agile Developement Manifesto, they listen to community input, they regularily patch their games and pump out new, free content (which is financed by selling DLCs alongside that).

The only 'negative' about this game is, that it's complex, easily overwhelming, deeply intricate, ruthless and slow. It's a very specific niche of Grand Strategy you may or may not enjoy. And if latter is the case, there's no helping it, this game isn't for you.

However, if you aren't sure, go ahead and check out some Let's Plays, and then grab the base game, which ranges from cheap to FREE (yep, they recently gave it away for free), and give it a try. And if you like it, rest assured that every penny you spent buying the DLC goes to people who actually deserve it.

The problem comes down to a single mistake can lose you a battle, which can lose you the war, which can lose you a kingdom. Which is great if the game mechanics weren't counter intuitive at times, and undergo changes over time. Meaning you might think you can do something, only to find out you can't, or you might have been able to do it before an update changed the mechanic, but now you can't.

If you are not playing on Iron Man mode it may not be a big deal so long as you are saving often. Just reload the save and try something else. The thing is, I like Iron Man mode, I feel like reloading saves to bypass tough areas is kind of cheating. The biggest issue though is that the RNG will kill you in completely BS ways every single time. You can play the game perfectly but sooner or later some BS will happen. Like you just won't have any children and all your other heirs will be killed or die of illness. It happens. More common though is your ruler will die randomly, and then everyone will declare war against you at the same time. Many of my games have ended with my ruler dying and than 3 wars starting within a year of his death.

Most recently I have been a victim of even more outrageous BS. I started on an the island of Socotra. After several generations I had the most advanced tech in the world, had successfully become a Sultan, and had just won an offensive war against the Caliph. I could call up over 2000 levies from my single county island alone, having built it up as fast as I researched tech. I had almost 1k gold stockpiled, and even though the game kept killing my family members with murders and illness, I had a heir, and things looked promising....

So what happened? Well, first of all I used the assign titles intrigue option for the 15 new titles I took from the Caliph, which then were assigned extremely poorly and only partly so, as It seems the person assigning titles assigned one to himself which then canceled the process unfinished. Almost immediately thereafter, my capital county becomes heretic, Completely random event which I had no control over and almost immediately after it becomes heretic it rebels....with 9000 men. At this time I can at max raise 6k men, spread all over the place. However, because the heretics emerged on the island, the over 2k men I can raise there are suppressed and I immediately lose if I try to raise them. Here comes one those mechanics that really really pisses me off, and part of the reason is it is counter intuitive, and part of it is because it didn't always work the way it does now. 

I have 9k rebels attacking my capital, I can raise an immediate 2k, and ship in another 4k. I wouldn't win with that, but I have nearly 1k gold and can hire the two companies in range giving me over 10k men, with high level commanders I almost certainly will win....except the game mechanics have been made/changed in such a way that it can't be done. Any mercenaries I hire get hired at my capital, now normally if the capital is being attacked it doesn't place the mercenaries on that county, but because I am on an island...guess what. On top of that, they made it so mercenaries start with 0 morale now. So I could drop in 4.4k mercs but they would instantly lose the battle because they have no morale, but what if I put my fleet off shore, and give them the command to retreat to the ships. Well that doesn't work. Apparently someone decided that you can't retreat to ships unless you are raiding? So I have 1k gold, and can't use mercenaries. Great. So now I lose my capitol because I have nothing to contest it with. That is not the end of it though. While my capital is under siege about a third of the counties declare a war of independence, including those I just gave counties to. 

Wait, it's not over, right after they declared for independence a nearby sheikh declares an invasion. I end up losing the war of independence despite winning every battle, because I don't have enough men for a conclusive engagement, and they just need to hold their counties until the timer runs out, which they barely did as they retook one as I was about to take another, and instantly went from me winning to 100% in their favor and them automatically ending the war in their favor. I easily defeated the sheikh despite that, then tried to reconquer those that declared independence, but I couldnt attack all of them because I didn't have a casus belli to do so....Meanwhile. I lost my capital because I had no way to retake it, but because it is an island the rebels can't leave as thy have no fleet, so they just sit there in a perpetual war that blocks me from ever hiring mercs. I tried playing past that point but, I realized I couldn't hold on to my kingdom with my capital locked out, no mercs, and constant wars erupting.

Essentially my gold was useless, I only had access to an increasingly smaller portion of my troops as the game killed my rulers off one by one, couldn't use mercs, and over all the game wasn't fun anymore. The problem is this is just a different version of the same ending I get every time I play. I can play a perfect game, but it does not matter, because sooner or later events outside of my control kill me. It wouldn't be that bad if game mechanics weren't designed so poorly. Why are mercs being hired into combat with no morale? How come I can't retreat to my fleet? For that matter why are rebels on an island not given ships? If they had just left the island I could have bought my 4.4k mercs, retaken the island, then sailed off to win my other wars, fight a war of attrition against the rebels, and eventually won. Instead I ended up in a position with no ability to win due to no error on my part.

Edit: Almost 2 years later and finally corrected the horrendous amount of typos in my original review. I think spell check died after the first paragraph and I never read through the original draft before posting. Well, it is fixed now.

I changed my review from negative to positive, for the simple reason that I complained on the official forums about the gameplay issues I experienced, and played a few months later to find they had been fixed in a patch/update. You can now safely hire mercs when your island capitol is under siege, as they will spawn in another territory you control. I also believe the automatic assign titles function was fixed, although I don't know if it is still possible for it to stop partway through due to the person assigning titles assigning one to himself and halting the process.

Developers responding to feedback to fix bugs and unintended issues in a timely manner, instead of just ignoring player input, putting it off for years, or using any number of excuses like ""it is intended gameplay"" is a pleasant surprise in an industry that often only bothers to look at in issue if a vast number of people complain about it or excessively documented it. The game mechanics still change with updates, but as long as problems are addressed and gameplay is intuitive, I will continue playing. The last couple times I have played, I felt the RNG was smoothed out somewhat as well, where incredibly unlikely events didn't happen one after the other.",1519153428,1577495000,True,0,0,0.479876399040222168,11,True,False,False

UPDATE: 9/4/2016
I still play this game at least once a week for a couple of hours. With the advent of each new DLC the game expands to reveal even more depth and gameplay. Its a game I would recommend trying and slowly gaining the dlc over time becuase if you like it you will keep playing it. Each new DLC adds something new that you have to figure out and learn how to deal with and manipulate. This game has a steep learning curve but one of the most unique aspects of this game is that losing is truly fun. You enjoy the story and are always curious as to what might happen next. I would avoid anything that says, CONTENT PACK and only pick up things that add features when buying dlc. Don't be in such a rush to buy all the DLC at once unless they are all on sale because it will take time for you to learn all these new features and I found it was alot easier to learn one system after figuring out how the last one works. This is a true simulation and as such, it will not hold your hand. But if you have the patience and determination to learn from your mistakes then you will enjoy this game for many years.

The game is infuriating. The UI is a nightmare. The RNG will constantly fuck you over. And learning mechanics is still unintuitive and requires a wiki. But I keep getting an itch to come back to this game.

The base game experience from what I've heard is extremely bare compared to the experience with all the content expansions. But the game has kept me playing for 7 years with a steady drip feed of deepening mechanics, an expanding map, and expanded game play for different areas of the map. If you start playing this now and start to slowly purchase content as you learn systems, the game has an almost limitless replayability value. You can even randomize the world for more replayability now.

It's a beautiful mess.  It is an optimization problem with just the right level of degrees of freedom to be catnip to my brain, with enough RNG to both amuse and piss me off on a regular basis.  

But in the unlikely event you're reading this, here's something actually useful: the ""starter""/""tutorial"" campaign is garbage.  It is the equivalent of tossing a toddler bodily into the deep end of a pool to ""teach"" them to swim.  This is not a game you're going to learn via the in-game introductory campaign; it is a game you're going to learn by spending hours reading the wiki, or if you're really patient, watching Let's Plays/tutorial videos on YouTube (though literally every CK2 YouTuber I've watched to date has actually been almost infuriatingly bad at min-maxing the game).  Do ""Noob Island,"" aka Ireland (Petty Kingdom of Mumu) in 1066 first.  That's the best low-pressure intro to the game.  After that, research succession law on the wiki and then go nuts.  

Essential DLC (after you've played the base game and decided you like it enough to spend some money):
- Way of Life: way more control over your ruler's development as an adult
- Monks and Mystics: societies are great

Conclave is kind of polarizing; I've never played with it and don't intend to, YMMV.  In terms of gameplay variety, The Old Gods (pagans! 867 start date!), Holy Fury (even more pagans! and also bloodlines), and Charlemagne (769 start date!) offer, in my opinion, the most bang for your buck.  Sword of Islam (play as Muslim) and Rajas of India (play as Hindu and a few other eastern religions) also, but to a lesser extent overall, in terms of novelty of game mechanics offered (but culturally those two are immense).  Sons of Abraham is small but annoyingly vital for certain precarious starts (as it offers the option to borrow money that you can then either pay off or... not).  The Republic is also pretty important in a lot of cases because of retinues.  (Ruler Designer is very meh to me; other people consider it essential.  I have no experience with The Reaper's Due, Jade Dragon, Horse Lords, or Sunset Invasion.)

ANYWAY, this game is great if you like fiddly grand strategy, which I definitely do.  It will not hold your hand.  Read the wiki.  A lot.

To them games should have more graphics than features. To me its the other way round.

So it should come as no surprise that I'd pick up ck2 as well which has tons of more features around the same core gameplay of ck1.

quick summary of game. I'd say: Think sims in medieval world. you manage marriages between nobles, princes and princesses but for political gain or alliances. there is also wars for land so it has strategy aspects and its real-time, not turn based (no end turn button to click). Game also has mods for instance game of thrones or Witcher kings or lord of the rings if you dont like the vanilla world.

edit: why the downvote now in 2018? Well, read the other reviews, dlc's are becoming a huge problem. Imagine having to 'pay' for each mod on any game and you should see the problem fast. You get sold half a game, and to 'unlock' all the features you need to pay for dlcs. Want to play a certain nation in this game? no problemo, just pay us $$ and we unlock that for you on the game that you 'already' purchased. Want your character to be able to grow a beard? - here, pay for this customization pack..

My thumb down means that I don't personally like this game. I can see other people like it a lot, but have gripes about DLCs and cost. My beef with the game lies elsewhere.

Over the years, I have bought Paradox games like Hearts of Iron III and the Victoria games. And then this. Paradox games look interesting on the surface, and if they're on sale, I often feel like buying them. And then... what happens then is that I might even install the game. And then I might play it a bit, during one evening. And then it gathers dust and I tell myself that yes, someday I should play it some more since I bought it and all. And maybe after months and months, I play again a bit. And soon years pass, the games untouched.

The Paradox games look appetizing in the store. They look nice in your list, give you a kind of intelligent air of an armchair strategist and a general.

But when it comes to actually playing them, thats another story. Wouldn't it be better to play, well, I don't know... Mine sweeper? Hello Kitty Adventure Island? Anything? Watch a cat video? Grind a piece of gold in some MMO?

It is very difficult to put a finger on the reason for such a feeling. Every time I touch the games they seem rather to turn me off than excite me. 

Lets think of some old great games in the same genre, like Civilization I, Master of Magic and the very first Master of Orion. What these games have in common that you have offensive units. You move these units, you destroy the enemy. Destroyed, the enemy is dead. What belonged to the enemy is now yours. Its the ancient secret of steel. With those games, you can utter a satisfied ""Crom!""

Not so in Crusader Kings 2. You don't annex land by wiping the tile clean of resistance. No, you need casus bellis, excuses. A Nietschean will to power is not sufficient. Whatever you do, you don't live forever. You have all sorts of scum hanging around you, trying to get a piece  of your pie. No, I don't mean the other countries. I mean your vassals, your relatives, your children. You have to think of marrying, your offspring, their marrying, you have to manage the whole soap opera of relationships (so its a dating game), the laws of inheritance, how your kingdom will be split into splinters after your passing. And this passing can happen any day when you step on a banana peel! You just get a popup declaring you died. And no, you cannot choose your steps better to avoid the peel. Oh joy, after your death you get assigned some of your offspring as the new you to play, and a pitiful shard of your previous kingdom as your new property.

CK2 serves you a kind of socialism where you as the player pay the inheritance tax for your own death. This death cannot be avoided. But you can try to avoid the taxman as much as possible, and I suppose this is meant to be a part of your kingdom management. Perhaps some people find that interesting.

The three other games I mentioned above are simple, childish power trips, where you become He-Man (or She-Ra if you like), essentially a Master of the Universe, your power growing with a satisfying soundtrack of 'muahahahaa'. Master of Magic pretty much explains your ascendancy to omnipotency in its wonderful end-game monologue. Paradox games, on the other hand, seem to me explorations into generic feeling of impotence, difficulty and having to react to all sorts of random garbage that happens. And in the end, death by old age is the reward for your kingdom building efforts. This death will happen soon, as your medieval life span is quite short to the hundreds of years the game itself can span. Why did you bother to do all that work in the first place, since as a king you got the served the same fate as the lout in the gutter? For a while, more of the map was marked in your color, some number was saying you're doing a good thing. For a while you had bling in your coffer. Then, the worms have their meal.

In the end I feel it is the complexity, the management overhead, the random event crap, and inexorable death,  that makes Crusader Kings 2 an unappealing experience.

Hello Kitty doesn't die during Hello Kitty Adventure Island. Hello Kitty is not ripped apart by 
relatives. Minesweeper is over faster.
