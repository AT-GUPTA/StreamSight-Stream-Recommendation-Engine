It's all free, too! There is something like 20 multi-episode story arcs, where many of the episodes are around 30-45 minutes long. There are a bunch of characters from the shows that are voiced by their original actors. A lot of this looks and feels like Star Trek, which is quite a pleasant surprise.

Mostly you can just ignore the whole MMO part of the game, but you might have to follow a guide to help set up your equipment for the more difficult missions.

Technically the game fine but not great, although it holds up pretty well for a game that is over 10 years old. 

Outside of the single player content, the game is just set up as an extremely aggressive attempt at taking your time and money. There isn't really that much to do except grind for some currency or the other, and many QoL features are predictably locked behind premium currency and exploitative lock boxes. you can in theory convert in game currency to their premium currency, but you are limited in how much you can earn in a day and will probably have to save up for years if you want to buy anything remotely nice.

So overall I am having fun with the game, and I am almost done with the story content. Not sure if the rest is worth sticking around for.

Edit another 3000 hours in: More experienced with the game, everything I wrote was pretty correct. Outside of the story, the MMO parts of the game are pretty bare bones and trying to part you from your money at every turn. Post game isn't really a thing, though there are things that the community has come up with to compete with each other, mostly PvE benchmarking. There is PvP, but it is almost dead and very expensive to do well in. Other than that we just sit around and try to decorate our ships, captains and crews. Either that, or grinding for trace amounts of in-game currency to trade for premium currency at a hefty conversion rate.

New story segments are added a couple times a year, which is nice. The community can be very nice, too.

This still scratches that Star Trek itch for me, which is why I keep playing it. And also why I still recommend the game to fans of Trek, even though my review doesn't really read like a thumbs up.

I have traversed the galaxies of Star Trek Online for a lot longer than the standard five year mission. I was there for the inception of the digital universe of Star Trek Online since its early days under the Perpetual banner. This was long before the cosmic shift when the Cryptic Federation took command, and before the Perfect World Empire transformed it into what can best be described as a ""profit-driven space station.""

During my virtual voyages, I've sporadically docked with the game to savour the infrequent narrative content. I've never fully committed to the social atmospheres of the online quadrant, nor have I obsessed over acquiring the shiniest tools in the fleet. My true satisfaction? Embodying the quintessential Starfleet captain. Navigating my own ship, participating in narrative journeys inspired by a beloved galaxy - that was the essence of it all. And yet, the game's design and recurring ""financial incentives"" often made me wonder if, somewhere in a corner of the Alpha Quadrant, a group of enterprising Ferengi are the ones cooking up more schemes to acquire wealth from its players.

One can't help but notice the wear and tear on the game's interfaces and systems. Each subsequent log-in introduces yet another nebulous task designed to impede my course or tempt me into depleting my stash of gold-pressed latinum. At times, it mirrors a mobile game with baffling overpriced ""microtransactions.""

While many in the galaxy of 2023 continue to engage with it, mainly due to the scarcity of alternatives, whispers among the fandom suggest an appetite for a more contemporary rendition of this digital adventure. But, in the unpredictable world of today's gaming nebula, can anything truly surpass our celestial expectations?

Other spacefarers have echoed my sentiments in their transmissions: the pleasure of navigating this Star Trek realm persists, but the antiquated systems, astronomical pricing for simple amenities, and incessant obstacles can make the journey feel more like a chore. The initial thrill of warp speed soon fades, and one can't help but grapple with the realisation that the cost of enjoyment may eventually exceed one's comfort zone.

When STO launched in 2010 it had its problems; the Klingon faction was entirely PvP oriented, the graphics were poor, and the missions were bland and boring. Levelling a Federation Character from level one to max was a slog of grinding missions, meaningless combat, and poorly written missions. Levelling a KDF character to max level was even worse. Still, the game had some fun exploration missions for the Federation, even if some became rather repetitive after a while. STO suffered from poor sales with its WoW style monthly subscription, coupled with its grinding issues and poorly balanced factions it soon found itself struggling, despite the strong brand behind it.

STO went Free-to-Play in September 2011. With this came a plethora of gambling mini games using ""Master Keys"" to open various lock boxes in the hopes of winning an elusive, and oftentimes powerful, Starship. Though some of STO's graphical and gameplay issues resolved over the years, some of the better elements disappeared completely. Exploration and First Contact missions gave way to bad-guy-of-the-week combat missions and poorly rendered cut scenes. It expanded its voice cast to many fan favourites, but that does little to pave over the cracks created by just how Ferengi the game itself feels.

I would not recommend this game. I bought a Lifetime Subscription before launch, so feel more obligated to play it than an actual want to play. It's a mindless grind through a game with the depth of a puddle which barely wastes a chance to prompt its players to gamble on the latest lockbox for a ship people would be more than willing to pay for out-of-pocket.",1695809580,1695809580,False,2,0,0.52213519811630249,0,True,False,False

There are a lot of series actors who have done voice overs for the game and most of the story missions are interesting ""episodes"" for fans to enjoy. For players who like complexity in their character build options that is here too, but therein lies a problem. There are a lot of build items (ships, traits, consoles, etc.) that are completely, or very nearly so, unobtainable to new players. Ships from past special events cannot be obtained anymore except through a ""Phoenix Prize Pack"" which is an RNG loot box with a small chance of getting what you want. Even if you don't want to use the ship itself they may include a player trait or console that you may want for a build. Other ships may be tradable among players but can trade for extremely high prices making them nearly unobtainable, or completely unobtainable of none are up for sale.

As a long time owner of this game I've played it periodically when there's new content but there's just not enough to hold interest for too long. The game is still rather buggy even after several years of it's existence. Character movement and button clicks can be far less responsive than what I'm used to from other games.

Ok. This is a grindy, PvE pay-to-win game with horrible ground combat, decent space combat and the Star Trek license. I am saying this as someone who purchased the box version when it came out, is a Lifetime Subscriber, been through multiple publisher swaps, seen everything from the ground rework to the lootboxes. The devs basically got screwed from the start with a short development time and CBS breathing down their necks. If you're thinking about getting this due to there being four Star Trek shows out and having an interest in more Trekkin' I'd skip it. Bridge Commander with mods or Starfleet Command are better. You can find a little fun here but at the end of the day there's better choices out there. 

There is a very egregious cash shop. Ship bundles that are massively overpriced (seriously some are priced to be worth a few AAA games) and the power creep over a decade of wanting players to open up their wallets it just ends up being bad feeling. Don't even get me started on the botting issue and bad exchange rate of premium currency to free. It all leaves a bad feeling to me. 

I've done the grinding, the mass spamming of random dungeon queues for reputation marks, and the gear grind to get to game breaking levels of damage. Literally a few dungeons will not end if I go all out due to breaking triggers for next objectives. Now this is just a little toy for some space Barbie. I enjoy logging in to look at my ship or just fly around Sol for a bit then leave. Some of the arcs (think story chapters) are ok, some are great (Victory is Life) and some are really boring. This game needs a massive shot in the arm of money and a massive overhaul down to the core/engine like Final Fantasy 14 had.

If that's the case, then the space battles are great (though they get a bit ridiculous with a billion skills to press - many with multiple minutes of cooldown) by the time you reach endgame and the disparity between new players and old players (especially whales) is awesome (though you can play on Normal difficulty and still manage if you aren't doing the newest content that is clearly being balanced vs. good builds with endgame premium ships). They've also stream-lined the story to avoid some of the most heinous and poorly made quests (though you can still find them if you want to play them, many of them have been removed from the official episodes list).

Having said all this, I think they are in a great position to create a sequel. They could start it on a new timeline that begins around the time of Discovery and they could rebuild the combat to have fewer buttons and long cooldowns but to instead have fewer abilities with short cooldowns that create strategic and active gameplay (as well as keeping the current power and shield arc gameplay). The game could have active story-telling where NPCs discuss the storyline WHILE you play instead of interrupting play - and/or have those exposition-rich interruptions be with cut scenes that can use the camera in interesting ways rather than just a view-screen OR use the view-screen, but have the exposition voiced and off in a side window that doesn't interrupt play. It would be great to hear about the next mission while you mess with duty officers, Admiralty, and are heading to the mission starting point.

Whether you're a die-hard Trekkie or a casual fan of the franchise, Star Trek Online has something for everyone.

One of the standout features of Star Trek Online is the attention to detail that the developers have put into the game. From the faithful recreation of iconic starships like the Enterprise to the accurate portrayal of alien races like the Klingons and Romulans, everything in the game is designed to make you feel like you're really a part of the Star Trek universe.

The game's mechanics are also top-notch, with intuitive controls and a wide range of customization options that allow you to tailor your gameplay experience to your liking. Whether you prefer to fly a starship or explore strange new worlds on foot, the game offers plenty of options for you to choose from.

Another great thing about Star Trek Online is its community. Whether you're playing with friends or joining up with other players online, the game's community is always welcoming and supportive. This makes the game even more fun to play and adds an extra layer of social interaction that is often lacking in other games.

Point:

Originally this game was developed by Cryptic Studios which had nothing but pure enthusiasm, creative ingenuity, and an overwhelmingly supportive userbase. 

Cryptic Studios created STO in was published by Atari in 2008 with a launch in 2010. Everything was great. 

STO broke ground with a new take on the Star Trek universe, although, releasing some years after MMOs became niche there were some shortfalls. Namely the UI, controls, and engine limitations. Even with these issues players managed to thoroughly enjoy the game universe for many, many months. Unfortunately Atari decided they no longer wished to pursue MMO gaming and then STO went through some major challenges.

The game was sold, ableit a short time following launch, in 2011 to Perfect World. Perfect World had good intentions with taking on this project, however, the lack of creative drive led to this game suffering for many years. Slow fixes to lasting game issues, lack of support for Lifetime subscribers, a complete change for in-game markets and monetary programs, etc.  On a lighter side STO received many ""quality of life"" updates, new expansions, and a continually growing user base. But core issues still persisted, and some felt like they were expanded on. Ground style game play was still clunky and felt less than intuitive and the change to ship and crew systems left much to be desired. Though.. It was still Star Trek and thus the love for this game was hard to supress.

With all these struggles (from my point of view) the game still managed to scratch an itch that was left following TNG, DS9 and VOY TV Shows that the new universe never really sated.


Summary:

As a new player I feel that you'll either love or hate this game. If they allowed space exploration and engagement on its own rather than forcing a ground element that in my opinion just isn't that great then I'd come back for sure.  Getting to pilot your own ship and visit nostalgic systems and stations is very rewarding. And the story arcs do have some fascinating plots. I may be biased toward how the game shifted from the original style (pre F2P), limited loot boxes, low immense screen clutter to bring overly slammed with all of the above to the point of nearly erasing the magic of Star Trek completely. Again, for new players this will just seem like buiness as usual so probably not a huge issue.. I guess.

But what am I saying, you can visit Quarks Bar on DS9. That's enough for anyone to play this game.",1674586283,1674586283,True,28,1,0.754538059234619141,1,True,False,False

ST:O Has seen a bumpy road and changed publisist more often than I have underwear. But they were pretty much all the same. ST:O is a cash wh*re being passed around and exploited for the franchise. OK, OK profit is what companies make but I've never seen such a bad p2w concept in my life! PVP is completely ruined and dead because of it. Plenty of PVE crap being pumped into it though so if that's enough for you be happy and rejoyce. Also open up your wallet!!

Instead of pumping in 1000s of items no one can keep track of anymore and half of which are out of lockboxes, oh yeah ST:O loves its lockboxes, they should have simply sold new chapters for a few bucks. ST fans would have happily paid a few dollars every 2 months to play a new chapter and not have to worry about spending 1000s of dollars to open lockboxes just to get that one new console or bridge officer to keep their build viable. It would also have left the pvp scene alive. The game was balanced at launch, not just the PVP side of things. Even the best ships still had to coordinate and perform in a group to get things done. As mentioned PVP is dead cause there is no balance, and PVE is following fast. Certain ships and builds make cooperation completely obsolete turning this game into a single player experience. Someone needs to explain to ARC the concept of rock paper scissor... lizard spock?!

I bought a lifetime sub and regret it. The benefits from it are worthless now. Extra xp what for?You reach max level in a week without it. The 500 zen a month? who cares, packages go up to 15000 zen, 500 wont get you much unless you wait years.... The ST franchise has seen many things Roddenberry would frown upon, but for this he will turn in his grave!

It's a real shame cause the game does have one redeeming factor. Though a little far fetched at times, the story writers are hard at work and with original casts voice acting the chapters are enjoyable. But get overshadowed by the frustration you experience in this endless item grind p2w game that is simply buckling under it's own weight.

Gameplay wise it is no better, due to ever expanding consoles, ships and other more OP system than the previous OP system the game has rapidly slipped into an old school WOW MMO. Meaning that half your fecking screen is filled with buttons you don't even remember what they do!!! And still there is the 2 sec cooldown between skills preventing you from using them effectively in the first place. Instead of it being a good fight requiring team coordination, knowing your ships/enemies/teammates and their abilities, it's turned into ""who can make the best (keyboard/mouse) macro"" competition, or simply who can mash his keyboard the fastest. No more skill involved no more challenge, no more need for coordination. Just endless grind ruining an otherwise great concept. Sometimes less is more, take a look at Guildwars for example!

I secretly log in once in a while to see if they started a Tabula Rasa, a clean slate. Cause that is the only thing that will save this game. But I greatly fear it remains an idle dream. As ARC (oh look now its Perfect World) is known for turning everything they touch into one of those Chinese grinders.",1469838803,1673116401,False,5,2,0.473801583051681519,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- You can play for free with no nonsense, end-to-end
- Totally solo friendly, and most optional group content is not frustrating to PUG
- If you do the very frequent events, you can get lots of great free stuff. They are pretty generous, even if there is a grind with these events
- Great but often janky character customisation. Lots of stuff you need to buy with real money, but there are thousands of costume options which are free
- Very authentic Star Trek experience (if you gloss over the fact your character quickly becomes a mass murderer, routinely blowing up ships with thousands of crew on them)
- Community is generally fine, if you avoid the chat at Starbase anyway
- Loads of build variety! It's really, honestly fun to experiment with different character builds
- Despite being an older game, the space sections look really good
- Space gameplay is very nice, a different experience to most MMOs, more comparable with the likes of age of sails type games

Cons:
- Ground zones looking ass these days. It's a older game, and it's not awful, but it shows badly in some areas
- Ground gameplay is awful, and far too frequent in story missions. I suggest you build cheesy to get through these sections really fast
- Grindy as hell with so, so many thinks to unlock. It's not quite mobile game level nonsense, but pretty close, and quite frustrating when levelling up secondary characters
- Annoying gacha notifications. You can turn them off, but comeon, why is this a  thing???
- Parts of the game are janky as hell, especially old content. Is the New Romulus warehouse fixed yet? No. No it isn't
- It's absolutely pay to win if you care about min-maxing, but PvP is an optional joke mode so don't worry about it

I have over logged in over 3500 hours into this and spent over a thousand dollars on this with the membership, game, keys, credits, ships, equipment, and other microtransactions.

PRO

- The game has tons of content within the Trek universe.  Lots to see and lots of missions to do.  You can follow the story or go on your own (if you do at a low level, you will likely get wasted by the various aliens who are much above your level)
- They've improved the ground combat with different abilities and  equipment
- Cool effects
- Special events are fun but they're really just grinds to get that special ship/console

CON

- Sadly, with the new content, it's pretty much the same thing: blast every enemies in sight to get your next power-up widget.  You will keep doing the same mission/puzzle in order to get the 2nd variety of the new widget. Keep doing it until your fingers bleed.
- More lockboxes to gamble your money on.  I can say of the hundreds of dollars I've spent on keys, I've managed to get only 3 ultra rare/unique ships - even during the promotional periods
- You're better off buying the Zen (in-game special credits) during their 10% promotional periods (which comes every few months) and buy their ships during ship sales 
- Lots and lots of Fed ships from level 1 to 60.  Most ships from Captain or less or just useless but you still buy them because you need their consoles
- Grind grind grind the same mission over and over again
- Only up to level 60, it's been like that for years.  When you hit that, there's nothing really much to do and the story line just ends
- The PvP was boring, same 5vs5 arena deathmatch or capture the flag. When it was available, you get wasted with the mini-max'ed guy who wastes you with their ultra high DPS and super fast ships.   However, it's even worst now since PvP is pretty much dead

After a few years of this, the game has become dry and monotonous.  Even with the new seasons in September or new mid-seasons in Spring, it's becoming boring.

This game is like if you took an Alpha and only got it half done, then released it. It is consistently buggy and ridiculously so narrow in quality that the only thing I found enjoyable was avoiding 75% of the game and staying in space as much as possible.

Their F2P model is atrocious. Anything worth a damn is behind pay walls and not to mention some of them are HUNDREDS of dollars for fluff and garbage. Used to be able to make something of a character with some grinding, now you get useless events with useless rewards. Their social media team is so inept that instead of answering questions/criticism they didn't like they were blocking people, myself included.

If/when Perfect World/Cryptic gets their heads out of their own rear ends and make some real content like they used to maybe this review will be updated again. But currently? It's just a big waste of time. You get something to do once, maybe twice a year.. and then nothing. 

Oh and their 12th Anniversary event? Nothing but pathetically recycled content. This game, and this company are the biggest jokes in gaming currently.

I am also still incredibly furious over the removal of the Foundry. When we had the Foundry we didn't even NEED Cryptic or PFW to add content for us. We had a whole plethora of amazing, creative, fan stories to play through as your captain. Some of them were absolutely phenomenal; amazing designs with extremely limited and neglected tools, stories that hearkened to the golden age of TNG, Voyager, and DS9.. It was fantastic.. and they threw it away out of pure damned laziness.

Yes, I've played this game for a long time (from the very beginning in fact; I even pre-ordered it. Believe me, I WISH it was still good). Yes, I still play it mostly out of habit and to check in on old friends. But no, I absolutely DO NOT recommend this game, even for free.

I have no issue with game companies wanting to make profit, but I do have an issue with those companies that mislead customers who have spent a great deal on their games, in both time and money, and publish erroneous material and then will not accept the responsibility of their mistakes. Such is with Cryptic Studios and Star Trek Online.

By my hours played in this game, it is obvious that I am not making these comments frivolously. I have spent well into four digits on this game and played off and on since its release. During this time, there have been many times where I had lost something in the game due to bugs, improper information by the game, etc. I guess this last one was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

I enjoyed this game for many years even with the ton of bugs that every veteran player knows about. In the early years, things were pretty fair in the game and people who claimed it was Pay-2-Win were often met with players defending the game because one could obtain nearly anything in the game by just playing. This has, in recent years, proved to be less true. I can without a doubt now state that STO is very much Pay-2-Win.

To achieve this, Cryptic decreased the chance of upgrading gear and have made it so it is very expensive. I can recall recently trying to upgrade a Mark XII Very Rare item to Mark XV Epic and it too about 80m EC worth of upgrade manuals and 500k of Dilithium just to accomplish this. This is an increase of only 3 marks and two grades. You can buy Dilithium from other players by paying real money for Zen. Of course you can. They have also created an ""Ultimate Upgrade Manual"" that will instantly produce an Epic XV from any piece of gear. How do you get these? Buy them with real money, of course. 

Now you no longer have to grind Reputation every day trying to get to Tier 5, you can just buy it will real money. Don't have the time or patience to participate in the many special events around and in between holidays? You know, those events that require daily participation for 14 days to achieve? You no longer have to, just drop some real money and buy the event progress. Did you grind hard on that captain and wish you had one from another faction so you could fly their cool ships? No worries, just buy that ability. Cryptic will make more money selling you those ships.

Again nobody is forcing you to spend money on the game as I've said, I've spent a great deal. But what has really soured me from the game is the greedy and unreasonable company behind it. There was recently an event known as the ""Red Alert Event"" where the event consisted of a number of daily missions to receive a couple of items as a reward. I noticed the event in the launcher and realized I had missed the very beginning by a few days. I clicked the link and read the webpage about the event and noticed that it read:

""After you receive five daily progress, you‚Äôll be rewarded with a package containing the following, once per account:

    An Ultimate Tech Upgrade
    A Specialization Point

For Captains on PC, playing the two week version, they'll also be able to grab an Experimental Ship Upgrade as part of this package.""

Great, this meant that I could still get the first two items but I did not have time to complete the 2-week version. Again, you can buy this out with real money, but I began running the event and finished the five days, and then? I did not receive the rewards. I submitted a ticket to support and was told that it required 10 days, not five. I sent them the URL and even a screen shot, but this did not matter. They made the claim that they ""could no manually reward the items and the event was over"", which is B.S. because I have hosted MMOs before and know for a fact that the server can give or take any item to/from a player's inventory. This isn't rocket science. Just in case they remove the URL, here is the screen shot:

https://i.imgur.com/Gk4wFb5.png

This is more about the principle of the situation and not the value of the items. I do not want to support a company that does not respect its customers and isn't willing to take responsibility for their errors, especially when this would not cost them a single penny of revenue. It's purely greedy and a stupid business model. I encourage you to avoid games published by Perfect World or developed by Cryptic Studios.

 On the plus side stories have continued to evolve, more voice overs from original cast members that were recorded just for STO also improve the game a lot.

 The minus is the game is extremely expensive and very little has been done to update the engine graphics for 10 years and while not extensively buggy it does have enough to give the presence of a unfinished product.

 When I say the game is expensive it's very expensive: 
*The lockboxes are a dollar each and have terrible odds
*The latest ships range from $30 to $200(for the pack of stuff you don't want)
*Ships have consoles that are powerful which you probably want
*The older ships run a range from $12-$25
*You need to buy a service to have more than 2 million of the in-game currency
*Retrain tokens cost money
*There's a post 65 level and it costs money.
*You can level up your ship, this costs money.
*There's a second hidden store called the ""Lobi store"" you buy lobi with keys so lobi cost money
*For some reason there's something called ""Mudd Market"" part of the store which is supposed to have ""frequent sales"" but I have yet to see one so what it is actually is an excuse to mark up the price on random items(As much as $400!!) and claim it's ""because these items aren't on sale"".
*Finally, to top it all off, there is a way to earn store currency in game THEORETICALLY. The system is like a stock exchange(for some reason) where you need to sell your in game currency to other players for the store currency except nobody wants to trade the store currency for the in-game currency so it doesn't work.",1636474851,1636474851,False,4,0,0.51522374153137207,0,True,False,False

I came back in 2012-13, and played some more, liked it better, but not having much time and not wanting to get into a big fleet, I left again. I've come back in 2021 and I think this game is just great. The TLDR would be: It is rare to see small-to-moderate sized MMO last over a decade and get better, not worse.

What I enjoy most about the game is that the IP is really used well. So many story elements are utilized, and the number of actual Star Trek voice actors is kinda surprising. And it's not like they show up and record a cut scene. Worf (Michael Dorn) and Tuvok (Tim Russ) actually play along with you (or Denise Crosby as Sela against you) in different story arcs. Not to mention that from day 1 Leonard Nimoy voices pieces of the tutorial and much of the standard messaging in the game.

I also really enjoy the variability of the game. On the one hand, you can skip missions without abandoning the whole story. As you play (and play again if you want to), if there are missions you don't like for any reason, you can skip it and move on without penalty, and when you've finished, you can replay any segment of any mission.

Further, I like that there's the main gameplay elements (space and ground missions), but the ""minigame"" elements make sense and are fun and rewarding. Working R&D (crafting) or Admiralty and Duty Officer assignments (kind of like trading card games) make sense in terms of the story and game. If you run a ship, your crew needs to be working, right? If you are an admiral, you need to command your fleet to do missions. For me it's very enjoyable.

The game is not perfect. The graphics are very dated. They aren't so old as to take me out of the game, and space battles are very forgiving graphically, But some might be turned off by that. Also, if you aren't as excited by the Star Trek universe stories as I am, some missions--especially ground missions--might feel really repetitive. (Personally, I don't mind the repetition, but wish they were a little more challenging). I've played some of the biggest MMOs over the years, and personally I don't think these ground missions are any more repetitive than gaining 100 levels by killing 10 of these or gathering 10 of those. But to each their own.

I should make a note on the cash shop. There's so little PVP in this game, pay-to-win arguments aren't valid, and pay-to play isn't true. BUT, if you want a certain ship or uniform or larger crew sizes, it's not necessary to play and have fun, but it will cost money. I'm not a fan of the lockbox system that requires about $1 for each key to open a box to get a random item--sometimes a great ship, but usually nothing all that great. It doesn't effect me directly, since I don't do it, but when I hear how much money people have paid for keys, it doesn't make me feel great.

BUT, I do use the cash shop for things that help me immerse in my story in STO, and I think that paying something is responsible. There is a whole team that keeps delivering content and maintains the game, and I think they deserve to, you know, get paid for their work.

Since returning and playing daily for weeks, I've not run into anything that puts me off significantly. I will probably be playing basically daily for some time to come. I'd say, sign up, find a good fleet, and start having fun!",1633356172,1633356172,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So lets talk backstory. STO takes place in 2410 years after the Dominion War that we got to see on Deep Space 9 and Voyager finally returning home from the Delta Quadrant, and things went to crap in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants sometime after. We have the Romulan supernova shown in both the 2009 Star Trek and lead in's with Picard. The Klingons started getting more aggressive more so when a Klingon by the name of J'mpok slays Martok and takes control of the Klingon Empire and ends up starting a new war with the Federation. The Romulan people now have a civil war breaking out.  Species 8472 or the 'Undine' are starting to screw around in the Alpha/Beta Quadrants. Leftovers from the Dominion war are screwing around, and oh yeah the Borg launch another attack on the Alpha/Beta Quadrants while hints that the Iconian's may not be full gone start to show. Throw in the normal Time Travel shenanigans and well... Welcome to STO!

You dear player at the start can decide what 'faction' you want to be part of. You have the modern day Federation with you starting out as leaving Starfleet Academy. An officer in the Klingon Defense Force who are now open to a few more races besides Klingons. The Romulan Republic a break away from the Romulan Empire that gets along with Starfleet and the Klingons. A Federation Officer from 2270 aka the time of The Original Series or one from 2256 aka the 'Discovery Era' and finally you can decide to be Jem'Hardar serving the Founders and Dominion. Note that Jem'Hardar start off at level 60 so you may wanna play the other sides first. Also Romulan's and Dominion pick if they want to be allied with Starfleet or the Klingons.

So after picking a faction, making a character and after picking a career path (Engineer, Scientist or Tactical) with an insane amount of customization to pick from, I'm talking everything from face, body, stance, uniform, there's a ton of it. You'll do some missions to get you used to the controls for both ground and space. You'll find yourself in command of a Starship and sent off to the final frontier, to seek out new life and new civilizations... To boldly go where... Well okay where a ton of people have gone before as you'll be screwing around solving all sorts of issues in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants. Also that 'new life' and 'new civilizations' you'll be most of the time firing at. 

Gameplay comes in two forms, you have ground and then you have space. Ground can be played in two ways, you have a normal MMO style of combat much like you would see in games like WoW or SWTOR. Or a third person shooter like mode that's much more 'action' based like ESO or Neverwinter. Whatever career path you picked lets you use powers from a 'Kit' Tactical Officers get powers that let them throw grenades, buff themselves and those around them. Engineers can drop a number of Turrets or Stations on the ground along with some buffs. Scientists can throw out heals or what I can only proclaim as 'space magic' that you throw out at your many enemies. Weapon wise you have a crap ton to pick from, everything from beating someone with your fists, to Bat'leth's, Phasers, Disruptors, Plasma Cannons. 

The Space game is however the big over all game if you will and I'll warn ya right now it's not for everyone. STO is not Star Wars, you are not going to be flying around dogfighting unless it's in a Shuttle, and even then it's not something you'll be playing Danger Zone on Spotify while doing it. Ships come in a number of forms however the three basic are Escorts, Cruisers and Science Ships. Escorts are ships like the Defiant from DS9, small, fast and packing a ton of firepower. Cruisers are bigger, slower and can take more of a beating think the Enterprise. Science Ships are somewhat middle of the road, and are more about throwing out space magic via the Defector Dish, it's Voyager where you kill enemy ships via technobabble powers. And note there are other ship types too, everything from Raiders to massive Carriers that launch out wave after wave of Fighters and Shuttles. In general you can set up a ship however you want.

Now you do all of that via your Bridge Crew. Remember you are the Captain of that Ship or well Ships... So you get Officers from each of the career paths that give your ship powers. Each ship has 'seating' for those officers and as you rank up you'll have Ships that will have more seating and more powers depending on the rank of the bridge officer. You'll really want to see what type of seating a ship has before picking one. Still in general a ship like a Defiant Class will have more room for tactical officers and powers, where a Galaxy Class will have more room for Engineers. And yes those Bridge Officers are also the 'away team' you'll take with you. So much like SWTOR you have companions that will follow you around, 4 of them most of the time!

And that brings me to the big thing of STO, customization, customization and customization! A joke STO players tend to have is that the true 'end game' of STO isn't raids or epic dungeons (I will talk end game in a moment) but 'Space Barbie' is the end game. Want a bunch of Bridge Bunny's who are all wearing the TOS Short Skirt Uniform? You can do that. Want everyone looking like they are part of special forces? Yep you can do that too. You have an insane amount of Uniforms to pick from, even off-duty clothing. The Ships even have that as well, you can even 'kitbash' together a ship if you want. Take a Miranda Class and throw on the Warp Nacelles from a Centaur Class. There's just an insane amount of customization that you will spend hours screwing around with it.

So now let me talk end game. Unlike games like SWTOR, WoW or others STO really doesn't have the normal do dungeons, raids, repeat sorta end game. You do have Special Task Force missions along with Battle Zones. STF's tend to be the 'dungeons' of STO if you will. Battle Zones are areas that in general you can just warp into or beam down into with areas of the battle zone having objectives to take control of the area and in the end a big boss will pop up. Doing these missions can reward you with items, but also reward you with Reputation Marks, Unrefined Dilithium and some type of 'special' item. Reputation Marks are spent in a Reputation system with six ranks, each rank unlocks some passive skills you can take and items from the Reputations store. You'll spend an amount of Marks, Refined Dilithium and sometimes one of those 'special' items on ground and space set items. You can speed it up for alts when you hit rank 5. 

You also have daily things as well from the Duty Officer and Admiralty System. Think of this as a almost card like game where you have those 'lower deck' officers or Ships you own along with limited use Ships going off on missions. These can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a full day or two. You also as this is an MMO have Fleets you can join up with, Fleets are pretty much the Guilds of STO and slowly unlock a Starbase along with smaller hub areas that have Fleet Gear and Fleet Ships you can buy.

Now to time talk about some of the cons of STO. If you are a hardcore Trekkie who lives and dies for the canon of Star Trek? You may hate this game as it does break some things with the canon, And STO is microtransaction heavy, you can buy Zen with Refined Dilithium. And there is the dreaded loot box. But you can get things for free as well.

STO isn't bad, it's one of the better F2P games out there in my eyes. Again with the space game? It's not for everyone but hey if you wanna see pretty space areas and blow up Borg you'll like it.",1618802957,1618802957,True,19,0,0.701772451400756836,0,True,False,False

The crate system and promo $ p2w end game is a bit anoying, but you don't need that to succeed, or you are a pro raider and can afford it. 

Still, I still wonder how in all those years nowbody was able to fix ground combat. The engine is working great in space, but on ground it is laggy, buggy, async and not smooth and feels uncomplete. If you play it long enough you blend in to that and it annoys you less, but still there are so many games able to manage that and the engine should be capable of getting the job done. Fixing the ground would make the game perfect.

So, I can recommend the game for it's excellent foundry system which allows player-made missions, the great story and content which gives you a authentic Star Trek feeling and last but not least the solid character customization and good reputation system.
Cons from my point of view are the clunky controls and interface on ground and the cash shop items, which are very powerful and more on the pay2win side of the quadrant.

There is also a great deal of documentation, and the playerbase is very helpful getting new players up to speed and helping old players get back into it after being gone for a long time.

I have joined several fleets, usually a new one every year, and had great experiences. It is a very international community with a good number of French and German speaking players.

Nach ein paar Jahren und nunmehr fast 800 Spielstunden (die meisten bevor das Spiel auf Steam verf√ºgbar war) muss ich das Review dann auch mal updaten.

Star Trek Online geh√∂rt zu meinen Lieblingsspielen wie SWTOR, Assassins Creed, Cities Skylines etc. Ja, zugegeben, die Grafik k√∂nnte nach ein paar Jahren dann auch mal geupdated werden, aber am Spielspa√ü r√ºttelt das nicht.

Es ist wirkich sehr spa√üig, vorallem als Trekkie, sich seinen Sternenflotte-Charakter zu erstellen und in sein erstes Miranda-Klasse Schiff zu steigen, um den b√∂sen Jungs so ordentlich auf die F√º√üe zu treten. Und Orte zu erkunden, wo noch kein Nerd zuvor jemals gewesen ist!

Star Trek Online ist Free to Play, es gibt einen Ingame Store mit teils unversch√§mten Preisen (25 Euro f√ºr genug ZEN, die Premiumw√§hrung, um ein T6 Schiff zu kaufen). Hin und wieder gibt es mal Rabatte, das kommt selten vor. Aber diese Schiffe k√∂nnen alle im Auktionshaus gekauft werden. Sie kosten dann zwar einen Haufen Schotter, aber das zeigt, man muss keine Harten (T)euronen einsetzen, um zu bekommen was man will. Die Premiumschiffe lohnen sich aber, daf√ºr mal etwas auszugeben. Ich habe mittlerweile 10 Premium T6 Schiffe gekauft, zwischen denen ich st√§ndig wechsel, je nach dem, was ich machen m√∂chte und welches Schiff ich gerade Cool finde.. :) Ich hab sie mit echtem Geld gekauft, aber erz√§hlt das nicht meiner Frau. :D

Die Storyinhalte sind absolut erschlagend umfangreich. Als Anf√§nger habt Ihr f√ºr wenigstens 200 Stunden Content, wenn Ihr alle Fraktionen durchgehen wollt. Das bietet Euch bisher KEIN anderes F2P Spiel im Steam-Kosmos. Und der Wiederspielwert ist sehr sehr gro√ü. Ich habe mittlerweile 3 Sternenflotten-Charaktere und nebenbei fange ich jetzt noch einen Klingonenkrieger an.

Ich dachte am Anfang auch, das Spiel ist alt, die Grafik ist alt, mit Wlan zu spielen ist wahnsinnig nervig, zumindest bei mir, denn es laggt ohne Ende. Aber ich habe schnell erkannt, das nicht die Grafik, oder die Aktualit√§t die st√§rken des Spiels sind, sondern sein Inhalt. Seitdem bin ich s√ºchtig.

Die Community ist... Interessant. Ihr findet da jeden Horst und jede Jana, jeden Kevin. jeder spielt anders, aber wenn Ihr nicht gerade PVP spielen wollt, spielen alle durchaus zusammen. Als Leonard Nimoy starb, hat man das sofort im Spiel gemerkt. Im Chat wurde viel √ºber ihn gesprochen, die Leute waren traurig, es gibt mittlerweile ein Monument zu seinen Ehren im Raumdock der Erde. Zeigt mir ein Spiel, das auch mal so emotional sein kann, wenn einer der Schauspieler stirbt.

So, ich hab genug gesabbelt. Seht zu, das Ihr in den Captainsstuhl kommt und besucht Orte, von denen Ihr nicht mal zu tr√§umen gewagt habt. Weggetreten Lieutenant!",1487779037,1606770842,True,1,0,0.41447564959526062,0,True,False,False

Pro:
- Solid Gameplay
- Good Storyline
- Top notch voice acting
- Overall controls were great for the time of the game's release (see below)
- Solid AI & NPC interaction
- The graphics and sound still hold up reasonably well
- A very active player base, even after ten years
- Free to play, which is appropriate for a game it's age
- In-game purchases can give players who pay some advantages without making it play to win
- New content comes still out
- The worlds are very detailed for the time & still hold up 
- Inventory and crew management is comprehensive (see below)
- Character & Ship customization is quite good (see below)

Mixed and Con:
- Spaceflight is more limited than I'd personally like, but that's more of a product of the time it was made.
- Ground combat and controls are outdated, again a product of it's time.
- Can be grindy, but it's still far from the worst offender there.
- Graphics hold up, but are outdated
- Both the old and new content and storylines are available at the same time.  It can make things a little confusing at times.
- Inventory and crew management is annoyingly complex
- There are a TON of screens to manage and information to manage.  I haven't found a way to play on two screens.  One with the character and one with my management (Inventory, Crew, Ship status, Map, etc) screens.

Edited to further flesh out my deepest thoughts on this game and better represent it:

Star Trek Online is one of those games that started off pretty bare bones in terms of content. It was a passable MMO game with the Star Trek theme thrown over the top. Since then, they have added several new factions with their own unique storylines alongside well written cinematic adventures and hundreds of new ship designs and classes. They have also added many new races and customization options that stretch from hair and clothes to unique skins and effects for your ships and shuttle crafts. Even the ground combat and crew systems have been overhauled for greater depth so that you can truly customize who is on your crew while fighting off hordes of pesky Borg. It truly is a really fun game, whether you play it alone or with some friends.",1595547875,1598249008,True,3,0,0.548006355762481689,0,True,False,False

Played this game shortly after its release and I feel like gameplay hasn't improved much, not enough to be significant and interesting again.

MMOs need renewal, rejuvenation of their aspects or they become tame, this one has better graphics and probably writing as well, 6 factions is a lot (even though half of them are just other time periods).

I didn't feel any kind of renewal unfortunately, inventory management is still pain and seeing ads in EVERY loading screen is also not putting me in the best of moods.

It's kind of messy to play, with all the active abilities, you can win pretty much by clicking every cooldowned skill. UI is still cluttered even though you can move it around.

I gave it a go after all these years but I wasn't that much into the plot, the TV show is good but the game takes too much energy from me to :
1 follow the story of the mission properly to be engaged 
2 deal with all the active skills and strategy (especially during space fights)
3 pay attention to all the secondary challenges and currencies that are just shoved into your hands with the game expecting you to go, understand and do all that stuff

I installed it, took the time to give it another proper shot and failed miserably.
Leaving this sector, warp factor 8.

==========
- Quests/Writing/Voice Acting
- Visuals are very well done.

Bad Points:

- Very bad keyboard support for a complex game system. (Similar to old Starfleet Battles tabletop game)

Some good mechanics and Ideas, lore rich with a well written narative. Had alot of fun with it with friends in coop. Nice range of ships and races to play. Horribly monitized with a huge chuck of the features behind paywalls with alot of forced grind and a huge amount of pay to win features and ships. So much so its more like a hidious mobile game with predatory slotmachine like lootboxes, so those of you who at risk with gambling or have small children who want to play, then this game is not for you. I have put alot of hours into this game and have enjoyed alot of the elements and if it wasn't for all the lootboxes, would likely recommend

For those of you still reading, thank you.

Pros:
*Excellent Story elements with a nice enough blend of the different series enough to please most fans (Unless die hard)
*Nice ship choices with some good refitted models for those who love their chosen series
*Well designed and plentiful loot options (Excluding pay to win items)
*Graphics have been updated well over the years to still warm your gpu up despite the aged engine
*Enjoyable mechanics with some excellent but rather simple gameplay for the space combat
*Great range of abilities for each of the specialisations with good build options for your character
*Huge range of choice when it comes to factions you can play which matching shipsets for your chosen race
*Good range of cosmetic customisation, rarely see two alike.
*Devs do sometimes throw you a bone with some free items, which is always nice
Cons
*For a free to play game, its incredibly expensive with some packs costing as much as ¬£300 for a couple of ships. Owners are whale hunting hard.
*Lack of parental controls to block in app purchases on the website
*Much of the best loot to be got is from lootboxes which have slotmachine like random chance drops so those of you with a gambling addiction or have younger kids i recommend you steer clear
*Alot of fear of losing out mechanics used here, Waving it in your face that the guy stood next to you just got an epic ship you can only get through a purchase of such an item or a ridiculous grind.
*Ground combat mechanics are incredibly clunky and without any polish since release
*Ground missions also just feel like busy work, just grindy variants of actions that just take time (""Go here talk to him, walk here press this and then come here stand on this and kill these"")
*Confusing number of currencies, alot of which are not interchangeable and some which can only be acquired through lootboxes.

With all thats good about this game, from its amazing stories and wide range of choice for things. Too much is spoilt by the greedy store. With all the talk about regulation laws coming to lootboxes I think this game could potentially suffer in the future as they rely too heavily of the lootboxes for everything.

There are scores of missions both in space or on land, the story arcs are different enough to keep you interested, and if the fights aren't greatly challenging, they are dynamic and visually engaging. The microtransaction offers are discrete enough to not interfere with your playing, 

For the average player : all in all, despite the age of the game, it's definitely still worth a try, especially if your graphics card allows you to run it with all options on maximum.

For actual Trek fans : it's one of the very few Trek games of our era, and it's actually not bad at all. Good production values, scores and scores of different ships to fly including all the most iconic, voice acting by the actual Trek alumni that can transport you back to when you discovered the shows for the first time. 

My personal advice : don't start spending cash until you get to the maximum level. Then you'll know the game well enough to know if you're likely to keep playing it or not. Oh and also, don't spend the dilithium you'll get as part of the mission rewards. Stockpile it for laters.

Due to an issue on their side i can not post or reply to anything on the official ARC forums the options are not there, they dont show up in the launcher, any browser ever, i have opened ticked after ticket with ARC who always tell me to email Community@crypticstudios.com as they handle forum issues, i email Community@crypticstudios.com and never get a reply to my issue, tell ARC this they refuse to help , they refuse to escilate the issue, they refuse to take the issue up with Cryptic

they wont even give me a phone number to call for support

First I would like to start saying, I've played this game much longer and many more hours on ARC. But also have gone months without playing it. Yes the game has as some players calling it P2W. I am against games that are P2W, but I do not believe this to be necessarily true. To begin there is very minimal PVP in the game and some of the items are cosmic it. Also if you are smart about it you able to buy some of the items that are sold through the store on the Exchange with Energy Credits. In Star Trek Online you also have a chance to change your account, ships, uniforms and on top of that you have a chance to do this FREE. You also have a variety off missions you are able to complete through out the game and after the you complete the mission you get rewarded with items, for ex. ship items, weapons (personal or ship), dilithium, crew or even duty officers some you must choose between items but can some missions you are to multiple times. Now they added were you are able to TFOs every so often and receive coupons for a FREE Tier 6 ship, how can you not like that. There is just so much to explain that it would take hours to filled in the information. One more thing if you play and you got this game down and then you stop playing be careful you might not remember how to play the game and will need to re-train yourself when you come back, because they keep changing stuff  lol. It's a fun game and if your a Star Trek or Sci-Fi fan or just a gamer wanted to try something different you will really enjoy this game a lot.

CONS

As with any game it has its issues not one is game is perfect. To me the most frustrating part is down time during maintenance on the game, that takes 3 - 4 hours but I guess if you want the game to keep running it's worth it. We also have some the rubber banding, misspelling and a few other things. 

So yes Augustus512 approves this game.

A creation followed with much interest during its initial announcement back in 2005 had the unfortunate curse of being born during the great MMO craze in which every online game was ""like World of Warcraft but......"" followed by some gimmick a marketing company had sworn was the real reason behind WoWs success.
Star Trek Online was therefore born devoid of any true originality as much of the new and experimental concepts behind it were dropped in favour of the same bland safe option being pumped out by every other MMO at the time.
Nine years of development and now within a market to which WoW is no longer King, would expect to see some of these older concepts realized as many other MMOs experiment with gameplay and features in an attempt to keep themselves relevant. Star Trek Online has proven to be unique is doing the exact opposite.
Nine years of development have not been kind to Star Trek Online and the game now represents a Frankenstein's monster of star trek-ish concepts lumped together into a game so riddled with bugs it makes Fallout 76 seem a well-polished game by comparison.
The game is unapologetically top heavy, with end game users expected to shell out up to $120 for high tier ships and ship packs, some of which are only obtainable through a loot box system, in order to stand a fair chance vs the end game enemies or compete in PvP and PvE tournaments and events.
That said, the premium end game content is accessible to anyone and though users who opt to keep their free ship may suffer a nail-biting frustrating experience each time they are forced into combat, it does showcase an array of masterfully created maps, photorealistic characters and well-written dialogue that is only let down by the voice actors themselves (more on that later).
This is in stark contrast to the games early and mid content in which first-time users can immerse themselves into an experience so laden with bugs, graphical glitches and popping artefacts one could be forgiven for believing they were playing a pre-alpha build.
The graphics of the early content is more reminiscent of the PS2 era, missions and quests are so bugged they frequently have to be replayed multiple times in order to complete, several cutscenes are either missing or distorted beyond all recognition, NPCs switch between bad lip sync and static mouths depending on camera angles opting instead to simply bob their heads to the words as if they were rocking out to a particularly heavy metal anthem.
The remainder of the game represents a rollercoaster of ham-fisted bugged experiences overlayed by consistent connection issues with at least two disconnections per hour considered the average.

Various characters from the Star Trek franchise are shoe-horned in without context, in several cases replacing previously existing NPCs to which the players bridge crew will still often refer to, the dialogue never having been changed due to, what I can only presume is, laziness on part of the developers. Such issues are so common that NPCs throughout the game will frequently refer to events that have not happened, characters that do not exist or referring to the player character as the wrong faction, species and gender.
The addition of characters from the television series, as voiced by their original actors, is designed as a nostalgia fest for fans, but comes over more as a rather cringy attempt worthy of a fan film, with the only real difference being that fan films typically have higher production values than Star Trek Online.
Players are forced into missions which revolve entirely around these characters, the most significant example being the Dominion player opening quest line which features a who's who of characters both main and re-occurring from the Television Series Deep Space Nine, most of these characters feature little relevance to the plot other than to deliver exposition to the player and many are clearly phoning in their performances.
Special credit must be made to LaVar Burton who's ham-fisted performance where he delivers each line of dialogue in such a monotone way you could be forgiven for believing him to genuinely be on the other end of a phone reading off a card. His special mission encompasses exactly 5 minutes of gameplay and during its debut STO ran an add campaign showcasing a series of podcasts LaVar Burton was in, in which he proclaimed his character 'Geordi La Forge' was gay and it was only because of ""the oppression by the white man"" could the audience not see this.

The rest of the game is Star Trek by name only, it is sad to see the game in such a sorry state as it has become clear the developers are only interested in pursuing the creation of end-game content and over-powered 'premium' pay-to-win packs for the small percentage of players who will buy them.

There are too many cool things to do/explore to miss out. Spend some time with it see if you like it, I mean its F2P, why not. I'd give it until your first ship upgrade or two to give it a fair playthrough. Storytelling is great and uses the voices from the actual actors on the various shows which is good because just like WoW, I need a really good reason you're making me gather all the pie ingredients one at a time! From a nerd perspective, getting to walk around inside my ship in space and look out the window is pretty cool, seeing a planet and then beaming down to explore it has to be done at least once (try Risa). From a purely gameplay element the space combat is the highlight. Still being actively updated and worked on, voice actors and story progression after all this time is evidence of something good at the very least, right?. 10 years in and the game is showing it's age obviously with the some of the graphics (I think space combat still looks great but I'm a fan so I'm biased) but mostly by the outdated MMO tropes from WoW and the like. I stand by what I said about STO earlier this year. If you're a new player with any interest then you have to try it out. If you're a returning player, just come back for the updated storylines/factions or if you miss the space combat.




Earlier Review this year:
In 2019 this is still one of the best MMO's out there. Still stays up to date with the most recent shows. Space combat is still great. Ground Combat didn't age well but tab targeting feel similar to WoW even with all it's ""combat mechanics"" facelifts. If you're even slightly a Star Trek fan, I'd definitely give this a solid play through on your favorite faction. It's FTP, and there is no reason to spend a dime. If you're not a Star Trek fan, the space combat is the highlight, haven't seen anything come close to matching it.

Star Trek Online is a game I have sunk many hours into, I have played the game (sometimes intermittently, sometimes continuously) over the course of almost a decade. The amount of hours I have in this game is, suffice to say, embarrassing. So embarrassing that I have stopped running the game through the Steam client despite still actively playing it, there's a bit of sad trivia for you. No, approaching this without a bit of bias might be as impossible as quitting this game for good is, but let's try! I think I can explain. I enjoy it, really. But I don't think you will.

In Star Trek Online, we are offered the playground of the beloved science fiction franchise in its entirety! But that's a lot smaller than you might think. We can create a Captain from (as of the time of writing) six faction options, nearly a total of thirty species - but they soon coalesce into just functionally two: the Federation and the Klingon Empire. Want to join the Starfleet from the 60s? Yeah, you can. How about the one from the fandom's controversial Star Trek: Discovery? Please do! A Starfleet officer or Klingon warrior from the game's own plot-line? Absolutely. There's some Romulan representation, too! And you can even be part of the Dominion if you really want to. Starting to read like a bit of a melting pot, huh? Something for everyone, to serve every flavor of Trekkie.

So why do I say No?

Where do I begin? It's.. big. Flush with content if you're into just playing through the mission episodes. There's a lot there and it might easily overwhelm a new player who just starts out now, and that might even be a plus to some people. But it's an MMO and relies too strongly on practices that haunt this genre of game, it's repetitive as all hell and boils down to either shooting something, one of maybe three mini-games that you'll grow to hate, or a mercifully brief 4-second interaction with your mission target. We're not using space exploration to illustrate an analysis of the Human condition here. That's fine, i'm reviewing a product, it doesn't need to be deep, it needs to sell to an audience. It's functionally identical to many games of its ilk - with a few more 'moving parts' behind the space combat sections, attributes you might expect from other games in the medium, like strength and endurance, are painted over as energy damage and hull capacity. It plays much the same, though; focus on buffing one or two statistics (usually your critical chance & damage, if your play-style is shooting things) and that's most of the superficial depth and difficulty out of the way already. Get used to shooting things, too. What's that? You joined Starfleet to explore things? Well, too bad. They patched most forms of that content (i.e: exploration clusters) out of the game a few years ago, so you'll just have to make do with the mission episodes and system patrols.  But, there's a more immediate red flag than that - Trek Online wants to form an intimate attachment to your wallet, know what I mean? It wants you to invest. There's a psychology behind these recurrent microtransactions - and the way they affect this game in particular - that I just can't condone. But it might require some explanation...

This game has loot box lunacy. Yeah, let's call it that. It ties some ships that are not inherently more powerful than other ones, per say, behind the 'master keys' and their boxes. Some of these ships are fan favourites, ones you might wish to own. You might buy these keys, or you might grind the in-game currency with a roster of many characters to do such, then maybe you can crack open a box or two a day, it's capped and limited like that - or you can buy your keys and ships with credits, that being your uncapped currency, but I hope you brought MILLIONS, or hundreds of millions if you wanted a ship. You can only hold ten million credits without an ingame purchase to uncap yourself, too, so maybe that warrants mentioning. There's a catch about these ships in the boxes, by the by, they are more powerful. The abilities a ship can slot and use vary per ship, as do what you can equip on it (number of fore/aft weapons, number of consoles that buff X skills or grant an ability that does Y, some do both). A ship from one of these premium boxes will come with a unique trait that is unlocked through playing around with the ship for awhile - and a console that can usually be equipped on any other ship you might happen to own. These two factors can change the entire game. Some are comparatively useless and entirely forgettable; but some clearly demonstrate the disparity between an 'investor' and a free player. I just cannot in good conscience recommend this to any progression orientated player - for placing ships, or any item that can give a feasible advantage over another player, behind gambling mechanics (yes, it is gambling by the way) is just wrong. Many ships are also available for direct purchase with equally beneficial consoles and traits in the game's cash shop, too, and it's very likely that you will feel compelled to buy one when you hit the level cap. That must be an daunting choice by now, the amount of ships in the final level bracket is immense. The amount of ships with useful traits is considerably smaller than this. There's limited room to manoeuvre with a play-style, and you're probably going to end up buying more ships to their collect traits and compensate for an uninformed earlier choice. That is, if you aren't spooked away from the game already. Then maybe you'll buy a couple more to fill all five of your starship trait slots up, see where i'm going with this? Then before you know it, that's a couple hundred dollars that just slipped through your fingers and into the corporate maw.

The game's also showing some worrying signs of fatigue from the longevity of its development life-cycle, too. It has added a veritable mountain of content since I began playing, changed development studios and gotten a strange fixation with streamlining what had been added before. Maybe we're getting more than we're losing, though, maybe Trek Online isn't in the state of decline that I think it is. What's been lost can be seen in the gradual homogeneity of every faction as the mission storylets progress. They begin relatively distinct, but are soon all ham-fisted into an awkward alliance for development convenience, with the written mission text given some VERY subtle rewrites from faction to faction, that's if you're lucky. We can use the popular metaphor of a theme-park for the solo content, when you've been on all the rides once? That's kinda it. And, well, I can't talk about missions without mentioning an elephant in the room. If ever you grew bored of the game's episodes and same-ish 'save the day' plot threads, there was the foundry; the amazing, but increasingly neglected and broken, set of construction tools in which to create and share your own missions, able to remedy any content drought - another mountain of content that was right at your fingertips! The possibilities were almost endless. But they got rid of it, unfortunately. Lamenting might be crass and pointless, especially in my review of all places, but it's important to understand it was a source of incredible creativity, home to stories that, at times, outshone the game's own writing staff. You wanted to play your Klingon warrior and actually feel like you were taking part in a story engineered for that particular narrative? Take a nice break from the rota of PvE queues and content? You went there. It was great.

That's it for the time being. This story's over. Maybe I'll append this later, but this is real close to the text limit, so probably not. I am of a mind that this game's days are coming to be numbered, with MMO's I feel this is kind of a given - but I could be wrong? If you've made it this far, thanks! And I hope you understand a bit more about Star Trek: Online.

In other words, they went through incredible amounts of effort to make their modern game with good graphics look like a low budget 1960's tv show, and succeeded wildly.

Used to be pretty geared in this game prior to the level cap increase.
I took the free handout instant 10 levels for one of my chars, and then started doing missions as well to catch up to some of the newer players.
The main issue with this game however is it has 2 of the most unforgivable sins of free to play games.
Any game with this on free2play should simply not be played.

1. Money cap unless you pay for increased wallet size.
This only serves to lock players out of the market, and even hurts players trying to sell more expensive items because less people can even save enough to afford it, it's pointless and is 100% just to make extra money, any dev who does it is being greedy and should be punished for it.

2.Max level is not pay walled, but top tier ships are.
To get any top tier ship in this game you have to pay money.
Someone might come up and argue that you can farm crystals and turn them into currency to buy a ship, but if you've done the proper math this would take literal years to accomplish even farming the absolute maximum amount, because there is a cap to how many crystals you can refine in a day.
It's possible to raid end game content with a tier lower ship, but solo play you are severely hobbled.
I had an extremely hard time going through the delta quadrant missions, even the starting ones in space.

The game was good, but it's sort of over stayed it's welcome.
I'd love to see a newer Trek mmo get made, something with better visuals, tighter ground combat, ect.
The ship combat in this game is actually pretty fun, directional shielding and bridge officer abilities are all neat ideas.
But this game is a sinking ship that is dying.
I'd of recommended it 4 years ago maybe even 3, but atm it's not really worth it.
Maybe if you're just deathly bored you could max out a single character and do all the missions.
The voice acting and story is pretty nice, and as far as mmo's go it's actually a decent leveling experience that gives you some sense of accomplishment along the way.",1551837401,1551837401,False,7,1,0.512544810771942139,0,True,False,False

**************************************************************************************************

For this review, I'd like to do something different and talk about experiences.

What does Star Trek mean to you?

If you're like me, then you're a middle-aged Star Trek fan, who has seen every episode of every series. You didn't set out to make that happen, but you like the franchise and realised, one day, that you literally had run out of Star Trek, because nobody was making any more.

If you're not like me, then you don't care about what Star Trek represents, then you are essentially viewing Star Trek as Star Wars: a simple space opera. And as much as I hate this fact, both our viewpoints on the series are equally valid.

If you're like me, you won't just be disappointed in this game, it will actively depress you and make you mourn (Morn? Ha!) the loss of a great franchise, which is clearly well and truly dead by this stage. Oh, sorry, I mean ""alive in name only"" which is, of course, completely different and totally not the exact same thing.

If you're not like me, you might like this game.

If you're young, I don't think you can even 'get it', because there's nothing else like it in the modern age.

Dark Mirror, MAYBE. Yes, I just compared ST to DM. Because both are (or should be) at their core, a uncomfortable look at 'what humanity could be in the future' vs 'what we are now'.

While one may say that about any Science Fiction series, that's kind of the issue - Star Trek ISN'T SciFi, just llike Star Wars isn't. They're both Space Dramas with a SciFi flavour. Star Wars concentrates on conflict, and Star Trek concentrates on resolution.

Well, it DID. Once upon a time. A long time ago.

There's nothing else like it now, because everyone is all grimdark because idiots mistakenly think that darkness equals depth. That is certainly true of the oceans, or of holes in the ground. But not entertainment.

So, everyone reading this is probably thinking the same thing: ""oh, boo hoo, we have one less talky game in the world.""

If so, you've misunderstood completely.

Would you be happy if you downloaded a Batman game and got a My Little Pony one instead? Because that's my experience here.

(CAVEAT: Even Bronies must surely be like ""Hey, this is great, but where is that other game that I thought I was getting?"")

Free to play? No. NO games are f2p. They all cost something, either time or money. And STO is greedy with both.

*************************************************************************************************

I only wanted ONE thing from this game:

The ability to experience the Star Trek universe in the same manner as it is seen on TV or film. The ability to explore. The ability to affect the universe by my actions. TOUGH moral decisions which would teach me something about myself and/or the world around me.

This is what I got:

A shooter, where I sometimes talk to people but I can make literally no decisions about anything, because the text is all railroaded, a la Fallout 4, and also the space combat isn't in 2D or 3D, but some bastardised version of both - there are no real manuevres you can do here. A loop-de-loop? Nope. Not even as a special ability. You CAN do a very small corkscrew roll, but it will literally take you about 40 hours to earn and can only activate once every few minutes.

Now, being a Star Trek shooter is no issue in itself. It was great when Elite Force did it, because it was a good game and marketed itself as a shooter. Same with Klingon Honour Guard.

But that was nearly 20 years ago now.

And STO doesn't market itself as a shooter.

***********************************************************************************

STO, in reality, is a poorly-made linear adventure game with all the trappings of mobile games. Proprietary resources limits, more powerful gear for real money (or stupid amounts of time), gambling in the form of lockboxes. Further, we still have bugs from launch - that's over 7 years ago.

In closing, I would like to state that this game is poor, even as a franchise money maker. They don't even want our money. Well, they don't want specific amounts of money from me.

I want to buy the Intrepid bridge, because I've started watching Voyager with my daughter, who has started showing an interest in the game.

She can buy one. I cannot. It doesn't even appear in my store.

And what is the reason for this?

Because I already own some of the ships.

Let's examine that.

Because I financially supported the game years before the Intrepid pack was released, I am ineligible to buy one of the most famous bridges in Star Trek history.

I'm going to say that again, because that really needs to sink in:

""Because I financially supported the game years before the Intrepid pack was released, I am ineligible to buy one of the most famous bridges in Star Trek history.""

This is the level of greed and/or incompetence on display in this game. They don't even try to hide it. The reason is apparently because of CBS, but Cryptic simply refuse to answer it whenever I've asked them.

This game has worse support than an earthbound hammock, but at least an earthbound hammock won't argue with you by sending you *a link which proves that you're correct*.

I am utterly disgusted that this company is continually allowed to do their part to destroy the Star Trek franchise, one shitty shitty patch at a time.


*************************************************************************

VERDICT: 
If you like Star Trek, *play Star Trek Timelines instead*.

It doesn't lie about being a mobile game, and it lets you buy what you want.",1408890648,1548681999,False,2,1,0.542597413063049316,1,True,False,False

Steam says 1900 hours, but i bet its like 2200 already without the Steam Client. i played it from the beginning, not constantly , but now and then with friends. Is it old and feels a bit clunky? Yes. Could it use an overhaul? Yes. Is it good? Hell yes! 

Even with its outdated graphics and technology, this game is still somewhat addictive and fun, especially when you play it with friends. It is a free to play model, that is true. But most content (also endgame related content) is free and you can gain it via missions and work. The so called ""grind"" is something that you can do on a stand-by, since its literally getting some simple ressources (5 - 10 min work) and then clicking on ""earn reputation"" , and wait 20 hours to complete the task. That is literally all you have to do for ""endgame content"". No hours and hours of hard work with repetetive fighting and gathering. 

While the graphics isnt something everyone likes, this game gives you a very good executed story with hours of voice-overs, interesting missions and complete customization. You want your crew to wear a special uniform? Go for it! You want to customize your own skills, your crew skills and the weaponry of your character, your crew (away team) AND your ship? Go for it! You dont like Starfleet? You would rather play a deceptive Romulan with their cool ships, or a warmonger Klingon with a massive dreadnought? Go for it! This game has massive customization options, hundrets of ships, and an interesting take on ""Quests"". 

You hate being send to get some random drops like wolf-fangs or bear-claws with your task being slaughtering hundrets of monsters to finally get the drops to your npc? Well, Star Trek Online has NONE of such quests. Every single mission is literally a story, with you and your crew flying through the galaxy to distant planets and fighting huge battleships with torpedos, phasers and disruptors, but also holstering your guns and rifles and beaming down to get into dangerous close quarter combat in an enemy base to rescue hostages or find artefacts. True, they could have done the controls a bit better, but if you are able to literally adjust your controls and keymapping  to your liking, you will have alot of fun. I only say: ""Switch to shooter mode!"" , and turn your mmo in a third person shooter. 

If you are a Star Trek Nerd, you even can write your own log files. Oh, you have done all the story missions, and raids and fleet actions are nothing for you? How about you play one of the ten-thousands of missions of the foundry? Its a pool of community created missions that are mostly checked by the developers and being rated by players. Even there you have voice over. There is literally ""endless ingame content"" if you are searching for missions and quests en mass. And if you are a munchkin who likes to jingle a bit with numbers and calculations about the best gear, visit the Star Trek Online wiki and loose your mind about how much you can learn and do here. XD

Dont let yourself get tricked by ""only"" 3 classes... engineer, tactical or science. The class choice is literally only for selecting your base-abilities of ""you wanna do damage"" , ""you wanna heal or control"" or ""you wanna have a mixture of both"" . You can be a tactical player with grenades, supressing fire and damage buffs, while also flying a science ship or a cruiser. You are not bound by class, and you can literally choose your skills freely. 

All in all, i can promise that the game offers many options and gameplay mechanics that may be unusual for an mmo, but if you can overlook its age and the sometimes little technical problems, you will find a gem that can literally brighten up your day. Do some ships or species cost money? Yes, but honestly, this game has potential to entertain you far more than any actuall tripple A title with their usual 20 hours of storyplay, so you can honor the developers hard work with a few bucks to spend on this game. If i am generous with my calculation and even say a tripple A title would have 30 hours of entertainment in storyline, i would have had to buy 66 games to entertain me that long like Star Trek Online did. So yeah, have my 20 bucks for a nice endgame ship and let me play some more. ^^",1543277793,1543277793,True,1,0,0.501242280006408691,0,True,False,False

Specifically, the gameplay is still fun, but if you're picking it up for the first time in years and you prefer to solo (i.e. you don't want to join a fleet), you might find yourself in a ship with obsolete equipment and no reasonable path to upgrading it.  Acquiring new equipment is potentially worse because you still have to upgrade it, and depending on where you left off, that might be more time intensive/more costly.

1. Exploration, the core of Star Trek, is absent. All you get are linear missions that are repetative, some just involve running round from A to B from B to C and back again without anything else to them. Back in the day you used to have uncharted areas that would provide random missions but those where axed after Perfect World got a hold of the game.

2. Ustable server. You'll frequently find the game loses connection to the server while loading an instance with a time out error which breaks the flow of the game and can get quite irritating.

3. Cash grab of the most unsavory kind. I'm sure we can all agree that a buisness needs to make money to survive and that it's perfectly reasonable to microtransactions to be present to that end, however I am also sure we can all agree that there are fair and respectable ways of doing so. When I buy a ship with a token I was rewarded with for reaching max rank I DO NOT expect to be told I need to spend ¬£10 to unlock half of it (mastery, which unlocks passive perks for the upper tier ship as you gain XP with it are locked behind a ''upgrade'' wall that costs 700 zen, 500 zen costs ¬£4.50). This is sickening, sure you can very very very slowly grind dilithium to convert to zen, but you are limited to 8k delithium per day and 1 zen costs an average of 250ish dilithium, fucking rediculious. If you get a ship as a reward you should get that ship, in it's entirety, not just another god damn pay wall. They want to charge for cosmetics? fine, they want to charge for novel species? fine, but you sure as hell should not be forced into more grind or payment.

4. Reliance on user created missions to add any amount of variation. When they have such unsavory business practice with their microtransactions you would at least expect them to do their job and fund better development of the game, nope. Absolutely disgusting. If you want to play the game go for it, but for the love of all that's good in the world DO NOT PART WITH A PENNY, perfect world are theives, play the grind and give them the middle finger, don't waste your hard earned/finiate money on them, it's not going to make the game better it's just going to make them richer.

Well, it is a Star Trek themed MMO...  

+ Tribbles
+ Shiny space combat
+ NPCs to fill your party
+ Crew/party customization
+ Freely re-customize your character from the hubworld
+ Graphics Engine.  While the graphics and performance are passable, the amount of options, and the way they're instantly applied without any negative impact, is very nice.
+ For a free2play game, it doesn't seem especially pay2win or pay2fun.  Only a handful of vanity items, many of which are already available for free.  Though I haven't reached endgame, so who knows how it goes. 

+- Small single-player semi-unique quest zones
+- Graphics and performance, passable but not impressive
+- You can freely customize your uniform, but most equipment doesn't have a visual impact
+- Fully auto auto-attacks.  This helps prevent the staring at hotkey-timers problem that most MMOs suffer from, but target switching can fail between kills

- Global chat is cringeworthy
- PvE queues have cooldowns
- Difficult to locate quest objectives
- Can't tell which doors are openable
- Uninteresting, overcomplicated skill tress, which just provide stat boosts
- The bridge of your ship is just a novelty, and not an integrated part of gameplay
- PvE Qs don't seem balanced at all, joining low level players with max level players
- Selling items is a nonsensical mess, and can't be done directly from the inventory
- While there are occasionally dialogue choices, they don't seem to have any impact
- For a game so old, there are still quite a few bugs, typos, and general unintuitiveness
- Seperate sets of controls for Ground and Space.  These would be better as an optional feature, since for the most part, these modes function identically

There have been periods where Star Trek Online is fundamentally evil and obviously run by a company that does not care for its players, and there's been times where the company has actually put in some effort and been a half decent group in favour for the players. 

The game content shifts in regards to this-when the company is headed or run a particular way for whatever period of time it runs that way for, the game content and the stuff available to do either improves, worsens or stays roughly the same.

At current, the game is good, and the TOS content/missions/ships added is amongst the best I've personally seen in years. Some of its a bit odd and fanservicey, but this is a Star Trek game-who cares if Scotty is magically on the same station you're on? It's Scotty!

Overall, this game has some highlights. I'd say if you're going to play this game, play it for the space combat and the smattering of missions that have a Star Trek feel. If you're not into Star Trek, this game is bearable and fun with friends, as you can build your own space station for all of you; alone, though, this game will hold little entertainment for anyone not invested in the Star Trek universe.

It's still the best star trek space sim we have out there, in my opinion, and the best star trek game still in circulation. It's also the only star trek game of its kind.

Play with friends or if you're a fanatic; otherwise, unless you really like the space combat and *shudder* the ground combat, you're not going to get the most out of this.

7/10 in recent times, could fall as low as 5 or 4/10 depending on what content is currently being released.

I recommend any Trek fan try it out. I'd also recommend anyone who enjoys space combat give it a shot. The story arcs can be enjoyable and include quite a bit of fan service. Building out captain skill trees and ship gear can lead to some real fun in space. 

I don't think most people who try it out in 2018, though, will stick around long. The developers have done wonders with the clunky old engine the game is built on. But clunky and old it is. Graphics in space can look quite good but character models (and movement) tend to be on the scary-side. These are minor gripes, though and I enjoyed the game despite them.

The real problems with STO, in my opinion are far more troublesome. Allow me to elaborate...
[list]
    [*]Content fragmentation - STO has instanced PvE queues as one of it's primary social play modes. Over the years many have been added to the game, which is great! What's not great is that the vast majority of the population only plays a handful of them. Most of the dozens of queues in game never fill enough to launch. You'll essentially not be able to play that content. This is a huge deal to me because I want to play the content which they bothered to make. Not to mention how these queues relate to the whole reputation system...
    [*]Reputation system - Much like queues there have been many new reputations to level up added over the years. As of this writing there are about a dozen. Each of these requires ""marks"" which are earned primarily through the aforementioned queue system as rewards for completion. Reputation rewards are mostly tied to specific queues, so if you want to advance a reputation you need to play the queues. There are other ways to earn these marks but getting enough together for all of these reputations without queues popping falls somewhere between hopelessly grindy and impossible. Why should you care about reputation? Because much of the best/most interesting gear comes from having maxed reputation. 
    [*]New ship cost - You can obtain some great end-game ships in game without spending much or any money. Mostly this is through holiday events that take some, but not overmuch, grinding. These are cool, but only happen a couple of times per year. If you want a good ship any other way you're either going to have to grind your little heart out (I mean this) or you can open your wallet. I've spent a whole lot of dough on this game over the years so I don't have much room to talk but damn - the ships you can buy in the store are great and EXPENSIVE. Thirty bucks and up for a ship. One you'll get bored of flying after a while. Yeah, you can wait for a sale and do other little dances to lessen the impact but there's no way around the fact that ships are endgame and you're going to want new ones. 
    [*]Dilithium - I'm starting to run out of steam here but let me just say that the Dil grind is real. There's a limit to how much of this you can ""create/refine"" per day. You can max out a bunch of characters and do it on all of them every day but that takes real time. And you still have to find ways to earn the raw stuff all the time. Admiralty and Doffing can help, thankfully, but if you want to become Dil rich you're gonna burn out. What is Dil for? More or less everything of consequence. It's the real currency of STO, in my opinion. 
[/list]

There's more that I could gripe about but I remembered that this is a ""recommend"" review. Why drop all of this negativity on a game I recommend? Because, as I mentioned, if you like Trek and/or space combat I think you should try it out. Play through the story missions which are mostly quite good. I also applaud the devs for frequent content additions. 

I don't play the game anymore but I enjoyed it while I did. I would love for these devs to reboot the game. I like them and I think they've done great work with this legacy tech. I don't even mind the lockboxes ;)",1525737712,1525737772,True,50,0,0.84974592924118042,4,True,False,False

The engine the game runs on isn't great, and there are some bugs, but the space combat is really quite fun. Ground combat is weaker than space combat, but you can choose between playing the game like an FPS or more of a RPG style. Personally I prefer the RPG style combat but it's nice you can switch between them.

The end game loot system is one of my favourite things about the game. Instead of hoping that one bit of loot drops from a boss and praying that you roll high enough to get it, at the end of every STF (STO's term for Instance/Raid) you get reputation tokens that you can then swap for gear. This means that you can always get the gear you want and ignore the pieces that you don't care for.

The F2P/P2W elements of the game aren't terrible either. Most of the best ships and items in the game can be sold on the exchange, and while there are certain ships that you need to pay money for they are not neccesarily stronger than the ships that you can buy with in game currency. You can also get the premium currency in game through refining a secondary currency, dilithium, but this is a slow process and you need to be dedicated if you want to earn premium currency this way.

Even if you don't get the premium membership, STO is the most open and accepting to Free-Players of any F2P title I've owned, and via dilithium mining and other events you can easily exchange for the Zen needed to buy anything that cash would earn you.

It looks great, the story is fantastic, voice acting is well done...but, there are some huge flaws in this game that at the moment I have to bring up.

First and foremost is end game. Sure, there is aplenty of end game content, but not nearly enough, and not readily accessable. It can take a while once you reach max rank to figure out what to do next, how to get the really cool stuff you see other players with. The end game is obtuse and needs some expanding on and explaining.

Further, the PvP in this game is srorely lacking. Many, MANY times the Devs have been told that there needs to be some form of a map, or area that players can fight for control of for their respective races and to make sure that controlling that area gives a big buff to the side controlling it.

Back in the days I played Klingon fighting proudly for my faction. The crafting system is fun and also the Officer missions. You can send your crew to get recources for you or even different currencies you can spend for equipment. The stories are really cool and I can recommend the Missions which take you back in time to experience old star trek episodes. 

I recently joined again to see what changed. They implemented a lot of new features, quests and events so a PvE player might be very satisfied BUT if you are looking for PvP you should look elsewhere. The entire game changed from different fighting factions to a bunch of excel sheet reading damage maximizing grannys in pink pyjamas. 

They only maximize their gear to get better gear and to sit in their space stations dreaming of big fights which will never happen as nobody ever plays any PvP. So if you look for a complex game with seasonal events and story you are at the right place but you will never use your gear in player combat ever again.

This is one of the few games I was dedicated to  playing even before I got steam.  When a glitch occured that stopped steam from realizing I was playing STO through it, I didn't play any other game until i solved the issue.  I've spent more than twice the time on this game than my second most played game. I've spent literally more money in this single game than the rest of my steam library, and I'm willing to spend much more.  

However, what made it be my favorite game if all time? Well first of all, it aged very well for me. There were of course times where I took breaks to play other games, but no other game had me come crawling back as quick or kept me around for as long. Content is always coming out whether it be the actual developers producing a new episode or event to keep me occupied, or the immense community that is constantly pumping out new and custom-made missions, some of which last for over an hour and some that have an entire series to be played.  

There's also so many different ways to play the game. You can craft any career to do practically anything within the game's limits, and I've over 20 characters in the game, each with their own unique build, or at least their own unique twist on one. And the cahracter customization's the greatest I've ever seen in my life. Over 20 different species, spread over 3.5 factions and each species having their own unique ingame traits and character design options.  There's even an option to create your own unique species, if you want to take the time to do so.  

Another thing that's kept me around for a long time is the Roleplay Aspect.  While this is more personal subjectivity, Not a lot of games I've played give the freedom and room to create your own entire roleplay series, which me and a few friends have taken as much advantage of as we can.  Of course, this'll only apply if you wanted to roleplay.  

Another great thing about it is that the game is completely free and not at all pay-to-win.  You're given full access to all the story and gear, and if you had enough time and resources, you could theoretically buy everything that would normally be bought with actual money through ingame currency alone.  The stuff you DO buy with real cash however can be costly, however I never regretted a purchase I've made in this game (Probably only because I'm dedicated like hell) 

The game's also been pretty faithful to the official Star Trek universe, so much so that the developers have brought in actual actors from the series to voice their respective characters in game, Including the legendary (R.I.P) Leonard Nimoy. 

The gameplay is also something I've always enjoyed. While a lot of my friends jopke about the ground combat, I didn't have any trouble with it personally. For the SPACE COMBAT however, it's been universally praised as engaging and loads of fun, which is something I have to agree with 100%

Ultimately though, most of the content is only subjectively good, and this is all about Star Trek.  If you don't care for the series,i can't say whether or not you'll like the game, This is because despite actually having a lot of content from the Star Trek universe (Including many of the actual actors reprising their roles) This game doesn't entirely follow the core ideas of Star Trek.
I've always been a huge fan of Sci-fi in general, so if you're a general fan like me I'd say it's at least worth a try. it's completely free to download and play through, No story or gameplay is locked behind any paywall, only gear and stuff to either extend your immersion or improve your gameplay.  Again, i'd say it's at least worth a try, you've got nothing to loose, and so much to gain if you find it enjoying.",1488232686,1490398457,True,29,1,0.744086623191833496,2,True,False,False

I'm sure there are many people who consider this to be fun, but for me it has gotten quite tedious and has limited my ability to enjoy the gameplay. In addition, PvP is dead, if you want PvP, go somewhere else, it's all PvE in STO. If you like that, then great.

No, the real frontier awaiting exploration is the vast array of choices you can make, from designing a ship & character, to changing your destined route through different verbiage or a vernacular of missions peering through an almost unveiled veneer of polished textures on older models.

Now, to start the real review it goes without mentioning that the user interface is hectic and as a UI designer I would love to be part of the team that built it so I can fix foolish placement and bad design. Not being an option the next best route is the tutorial, which explains the nuances displayed by most of the engine, leaving your curiosity to work out the quirks without making the player feel dumb. One piece of the game that is certainly lacking though is the ship combat controls which can be hard to maneuver when there is more than one enemy, having to disengage and focus on fighting but move far enough away as not to be affected by the blast of a destroyed enemy vessel.

I would like to see this game receive a new launcher, some improvements to its UI, and polished cut scenes made on the current version of the engine before it receives an overtly high score, but I feel it's deserving of something above the middle ground as not only does this game try to draw you in, holding you hostage in tense battles for hours at a time, but it also returns a nostalgic feeling, one I last felt on the launch of Old School Runescape and a feeling I long to continue experiencing as I delve full time fervently further into the fabric of ths formerly forecasted foothold, frequented by funny but frustrated friendly men seemingly of fraternity fraudulentity.

*Though I did end up waffling on, oops. So read on for the full waffle otherwise...

Pros' - Free, Trekkie, Story, Ground & Space combat.
Cons - Pricey, Grindy.

If you like MMO's, which in gerneral I don't, then you'll probably like this. Theres is plenty of busy work, as I call it, stuff to grind at to unlock better stuff and when you get to Level 50+ you unlock even more busy stuff to keep you busy for litterally hours as well as the usual events that these sort of things have, such as the recent Christmas event, which I joined into too late, so I ignored it.
A big word of warning though, the game does a really poor job of explaining most of these mechanics and you'll be left asking the community questions alot.
However I have been taking part, mostly, to the 7th Anniversary event that is currently on as of writing. Which again is very grindy and not really my thing but like I said if your into MMO's you'll probably love this, as its abit different to others that I've tried over the years, it has the 3rd person combat, that seems to be most MMo's style but also the space combat, which is also 3rd person, so basically the same combat mechanic really but it does vary it just enough to keep things aleast abit more interesting.
However, if your not into MMO's but your either a Trekkie like myself or maybe a fan of RPG, then I would suggest giving this a go as well. As if your a Trekkie then, its a chance to be your 'own Captain', which four different gaming openings which do really good job of drawing you into the story of the universe on offer. However its got too be said that once you get past the opening intros, then it really just sidelines you into either the Federation of the Klingon paths and even them do have cross over stories with each other.
But saying that, if your not a Trekkie but an RPG fan, then you probs still like this, as the stories aleast on the first time of playing through are interesting to keep you play.
Like I said, I'm not a MMO fan but I am a Trekkie and a RPG fan, so I've been playing mostly just through the story, ignoring all the padding and I'll probs stop playing once I've finished the main game story, treat it just like an normal RPG in essence rather than MMO.
And lets face it is free, so why not? However like most games of this time, the in game purchases are rather expensive. To buy a first Tier ship (the first class of ship you can unlock), its basically ¬£5, with the second tier being a ¬£10. And it keeps climbing to tier 6. So obviously I havent spent a penny on it, and at these prices I won't be either. If the ships cost say ¬£1 each, regardless of tier then being a Trekkie I would be more tempted. As you unlock more ships after every 10 levels, luckly you are given a free ship every 10 levels as well, so as you upgraded to a stronger class of ship requirement, the game does let you keep pace without spending money but your selection for a free ship is at most a choice between three, so as a Trekkie your always saying, awww but I want that ship! But given the choice I'd rather spend the money of an actual physical model, so developers making it cheaper if you want my cash!",1486901064,1486901064,True,2,1,0.516170799732208252,0,True,False,False

Among all the many and varied story missions, there are fewer than half a dozen which even begin to feel like fetch-quests, and nobody ever asks you to make their special stew recipe.
The combat is fun, especially in space, where you can choose and equip your ship to your own personal preference, providing room for incredibly customized tactics, specific to your own build. The Borg, once you meet them, are a terror, adapting to your weapons on the ground and stripping your shields in space with laughable ease.
Yes, while you can, technically, get all the cash store stuff without paying, it requires a truly monumental amount of grind for even the most basic item. But. Honestly, if you like the game, if you think it‚Äôs worth playing for several hundred hours, or far, far more, actually paying the devs is hardly a great and terrible sacrifice. If you dont like it, well, you get to play through to the end without paying a cent or being negatively effected by it, so it's hardly an issue.

There are a number of prizes one can get from opening a lockbox and of course a top prize but the trick is that in order to open one you need to spend real world cash to get keys. They are reasonably priced, but the chances to get the top prize in a lockbox are nearly a thousand to one. For most people, you're either extremely lucky or rich enough to keep throwing money at the game for more keys to get the prize you want.

My biggest issue is not with the concept of lock boxes, but rather that the devs development of the lockboxes has seemingly overriden development of normal cash shop items, like ships and other items you can just buy instead of gambling on.

Otherwise the game is fantastic, my steam profile only shows something like 153 hours on record but I assure you I've been playing since beta before they had even moved to steam. Space combat is solid and fun, ground combat's a little less polished but still quite amusing. The story arcs are well written and especially some of the more recent content, even touching.

They have single handedly ruined the MMO genre. Instead of buying the game like Guild Wars 1&2, or paying a monthly fee like WoW, it's considered totally normal now to be nickel and dimed to death while you play a shoddy bug ridden game until the developer abandons it to go make another WoW clone and start the process over again. It's even leached into the single player market with needign day one DLCs to play the damn games. All these free to plays should have stayed sub based with unending trials, free accounts limited in level and gear, or should have gone the buy to play route. Thats said, nothing I can do about it, the market is what it is, here is my review of STO:

I've played this game off and on since launch, before it was on Steam and went free to play. It's gotten quite grindy at endgame, but what MMO isn't. You'll probably love this game if you like Star Trek. Ground game is decent, ship combat is a lot of fun. Character creation is very good also, as per any Cryptic game, play as any of the iconic races or an alien of your own creation.

Very fair free to play model also, imho one of the fairest. Expansions are all free. Everything in the cash shop can be earned ingame with time. The cash shop consists of mostly cosmetic items, along with ships for every tier, and quality of life upgrades, such as inventory and bank space. The only must buy item would probably be a tier 6 ship for endgame. Up until then, you get a free ship every ten levels. I only say must buy because you will hit max level long before you have saved up enough to buy it for free.

They do go on sale, and the in cash shop currecy ""ZEN"" will go on sale once in a while also. But, you can wait and save dilithium, the main ingame currency, for a few months and trade it for ZEN to buy a ship. Why not wait til a sale, drop 20 on the game, and buy a ship and a costume? You've paid more for games that only provided 20 hours of gameplay I'm sure, and the developers really do deserve money for their work. 

Now, about the pay to win calls claims from people..

Yes, it works the other way and you can also trade ZEN for dilitium, which is used in upgrading your gear. It's less ""buying"" gear, and more about speeding up the upgrade process. The thing is, it's not required. You can do all endgame with the highest available MK gear without upgrading it. It makes it so you can do daily mission and reputation grinds a little faster on alts and it makes your wee-wee feel bigger. But really, why spend real money so you can upgrade all your gear to max, skipping most of the game, to then cry you have nothing to do in game? The grind is there for a reason. Don't like the grind? Maybe you should rethink playing MMOs.

Call it pay to win if you want, To me, pay to win is paying cash to obtain items that can't be earned in game, or buyign gear that is locked behind raid progression. That's not the case here, but whatever. If you think speeding up what is basicly crafting pay to win, I will never be able to change your mind. Stay away from the game.

I think there should always be something you have to pay for in a free to play game. See the games that try to be super fair and only put comsmetic stuff in thier cash shops? They are either suffering from no income or already dead, because if people don't have to pay, most will not pay. Since when does free to play mean free to access all content anyway? Why would a company make a game and then expect nothign in return? Yet, when they do want something in return of thier product, they are villianized by cheap spoiled children. If that offends you, stay away from the game.

They have single handedly ruined the MMO genre. Instead of buying the game like Guild Wars 1&2, or paying a monthly fee like WoW, it's considered totally normal now to be nickel and dimed to death while you play a shoddy bug ridden game until the developer abandons it to go make another WoW clone and start the process over again. It's even leached into the single player market with needign day one DLCs to play the damn games. All these free to plays should have stayed sub based with unending trials, free accounts limited in level and gear, or should have gone the buy to play route. Thats said, nothing I can do about it, the market is what it is, here is my review of STO:

I've played this game off and on since launch, before it was on Steam and went free to play. It's gotten quite grindy at endgame, but what MMO isn't. You'll probably love this game if you like Star Trek. Ground game is decent, ship combat is a lot of fun. Character creation is very good also, as per any Cryptic game, play as any of the iconic races or an alien of your own creation.

Very fair free to play model also, imho one of the fairest. Expansions are all free. Everything in the cash shop can be earned ingame with time. The cash shop consists of mostly cosmetic items, along with ships for every tier, and quality of life upgrades, such as inventory and bank space. The only must buy item would probably be a tier 6 ship for endgame. Up until then, you get a free ship every ten levels. I only say must buy because you will hit max level long before you have saved up enough to buy it for free.

They do go on sale, and the in cash shop currecy ""ZEN"" will go on sale once in a while also. But, you can wait and save dilithium, the main ingame currency, for a few months and trade it for ZEN to buy a ship. Why not wait til a sale, drop 20 on the game, and buy a ship and a costume? You've paid more for games that only provided 20 hours of gameplay I'm sure, and the developers really do deserve money for their work. 

Now, about the pay to win calls claims from people..

Yes, it works the other way and you can also trade ZEN for dilitium, which is used in upgrading your gear. It's less ""buying"" gear, and more about speeding up the upgrade process. The thing is, it's not required. You can do all endgame with the highest available MK gear without upgrading it. It makes it so you can do daily mission and reputation grinds a little faster on alts and it makes your wee-wee feel bigger. But really, why spend real money so you can upgrade all your gear to max, skipping most of the game, to then cry you have nothing to do in game? The grind is there for a reason. Don't like the grind? Maybe you should rethink playing MMOs.

Call it pay to win if you want, To me, pay to win is paying cash to obtain items that can't be earned in game, or buyign gear that is locked behind raid progression. That's not the case here, but whatever. If you think speeding up what is basicly crafting pay to win, I will never be able to change your mind. Stay away from the game.

I think there should always be something you have to pay for in a free to play game. See the games that try to be super fair and only put comsmetic stuff in thier cash shops? They are either suffering from no income or already dead, because if people don't have to pay, most will not pay. Since when does free to play mean free to access all content anyway? Why would a company make a game and then expect nothign in return? Yet, when they do want something in return of thier product, they are villianized by cheap spoiled children. If that offends you, stay away from the game.

8/10, Probably a 7/10 for non Trek fans, but it's free, so at least try it. Only game I know with ship to ship space combat that isn't Eve.",1485885118,1485885639,True,43,2,0.702873766422271729,1,True,False,False

There isn't a single ounce of content within the game you can't unlock without playing the game and putting forth a bit of effort and time. That being said, all the story content is always unlocked and free to play and enjoy. Wether you just poking in from time to time to enjoy the new episodes the go live (often featuring voice actors from the shows and movies themselves), or committ the long haul and build up a fleet, build a starbase, and other assets and grow a mass armada. Star Trek Online can provide a nice enviroment to jump into and enjoy wether you're a trek fan in the slightest or not.",1479997833,1479997833,True,14,1,0.592227518558502197,0,True,False,False

I bought the lifetime sub at launch back in 2010, which I've more than gotten my value out of. Though my roommates soundly mocked me at the time (and still do). Anyway, the game is overall pretty fun. You're a Star Trek captain flying through the galaxy, exploring strange new world, seeking out new life and civilizations, and becoming the largest mass murderer in the history of the galaxy,  committing genocide on a scale untold. Seriously, you are probably responsible for the deaths of millions, possibly billions of people. All because they know people like to shoot things.

The space combat is FAR better than the ground, though ground has come a long way since launch. This is an MMO first and foremost, and to some extent it's pay to win, but as a F2P you can still do everything. The game has been well maintained by the devs over the years, seeing active development and updates. I highly recommend anyone who starts the game to check out /r/sto regularly and join a fleet, specifically the Reddit Fleets are great to start and the RedditChat as a chat channel which isn't filled with garbage, it's actually pleasant and social. 

I enjoy the game, would recommend it to any Star Trek fan, and anyone that wants a fairly low skill space MMO.

There's just SO much content for a Free-to-Play game.  The soundtrack is sublime.  The Cryptic character creation (present in Champions Online, as well) is the hands-down, absolute BEST around...even with a 6+ year old engine.  The duty officer system, R&D system, and (in the later game) the Admiralty system provide alternate ways to advance your character (which, IMHO, definitely add to the RPG aspect of the game).  The Foundry (player-generated content) allows for even MORE free content.  Finally...the space battles are SO much fun.  The action is engaging...not quite frenetic, but definitely keeps you on your toes.

Weak points, now.  The ground game is probably the weakest point of the game...if you don't like MMO-style combat, you'll be uncomfortable here.  There is the option to switch to an FPS-style control scheme, but it's not really a full FPS...hovers somewhere between MMO and FPS combat.  You'll die a LOT more in ground missions than you will in space stuff.  Also, while it is certainly not pay-to-win, you'll probably need to spend a little money at some point to fully enjoy the game (remove credit cap, ship upgrade tokens, etc).  Endgame can get kind of grindy, having to repeat the same space battles to earn marks.  But...if you enjoy those battles, you might not even care.  Crafting isn't very engaging.  It's just another thing to grind...certainly doesn't have the depth and entertainment value of other MMO's.

Bottom line...this game is fun.  For a F2P, there is a LOT of content to explore.  The storyline is engaging, and the combat is action-packed and entertaining.

I've been playing since closed beta. I've logged quite a few hours over a long span of time. Going FTP promised us so much, and for awhile, things were good. For a brief, brief time.

Now, this game is just a giant grind. It's not even fun; just repetitive and uinteresting. And that's so sad to me, becuase I love Star Trek so very very much.

Perhaps most disappointing is how bad DS9 still looks. After so many years since launch, they still haven't gotten right the one setpiece I love the absolute most in all of Star Trek.

I've been to conventions, I've seen every show and movie multiple times, I've played damn near every Star Trek video game out there, and I was even at the Vegas Star Trek Convention when this game was originally announced (back when it was still being developed by Perpetual Entertainment). If Star Trek Online was going to appeal to anybody, I think it's fair to say that I would be at the front of the line. 

And for a long while after Cryptic released the game, it did. Star Trek Online started off as a very decent piece of fan service to the core series. No, the stories were never the same level of quality that was seen in the TV series, but it didn't have to be. The game succesfully hit all the right buttons to be a succesful Star Trek MMO, and Cryptic legitimately seemed like they wanted to keep improving the product they had released. 

Then came free to play. I have nothing against free to play as a general concept, but so many games handle it incorrectly in an attempt to increase revenue. That didn't happen immediately for STO, but after Cryptic Studios was purchased by Perfect World Entertainment, it sure didn't take long. Perfect World is very well known for churning out game after game with obnoxious freemium systems, so I suppose it shouldn't be to surprising that they did the same with STO. And that's exactly what happened.

All In all, there's still a part of STO that's good, but it's covered in so much money grabbing BS I just cant' recommend the game to anyone anymore. I would love to be able to revisit the game I played for 1000+ hours (I played on the standalone client before switching to the Steam client), but it's just not there anymore.

I started playing STO about a year after its release. Back then the game needed a monthly fee, and frankly, it just wasn't worth it unless you really really liked Star Trek. PVP was terrible, the game has a fairly large line of bugs, and the game engine was dated even when the game came out. Since then, the game has become a lot better. Numerous content expansions, additional features, solid story content for fans and not fans, and the ever present stream of quality player made contnet makes STO worth playing. 

This game is best in PVE, and if you're a Roleplayer there's a load of tools in the game to enhance that experience (you can write custom captain's logs and supplamentals in your journal for example). The Foundry has great content, much of it better than what the devs put out and what the devs put out for storyline isn't bad. There's a lot of group content, but most of it goes unplayed due to the lack of rewards to make them worth playing. That might be a deal breaker for some, because very much STO can feel less like an MMO and more like a Single Player game with other people running around. 

The game is very imbalanced... Except it's not really going to hinder you outside PVP.  PVP is bad, but I'm not gonna put on rose tinted glasses. PVP has always been bad. I remember no point in time of playing STO that it wasn't bad. If you want a PVP space combat game try Fractured Space or Eve. They're better and you'll get a lot more out of the experience. Cryptic's current business model isn't very endearing. Many of the best ships are hidden in lock boxes, and cost way too much in game currency or real money to actually obtain. Which is why I highly advise new players not to bother. It's honestly going to suck you in and kill the fun chasing that magic dragon.

And yet, despite its flaws it's still worth playing for fans and even not fans. It's FTP, and at its best when you just relax and let yourslef go from one little project to the next (and the game has lots of little projects). Don't worry about being the uber player, or being top tier. There are better games for that in this genre (Eve). Play STO because you want to feel like you're going on an adventure. You'll find that here in spades.",1449806106,1449806106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Space is vast, huge, unimaginably large.  Space in Star Trek Online is not so much.  The game takes place mostly in our Galaxy, with the Alpha, Beta and Delta quadrants split up into three largish maps.  Once you hit level 60, it'll take you around five minutes to get from one side to another on the largest of these maps.  You can transwarp, which is like teleporting, around which greatly reduces your travel time.  There's also a sprint option for getting around.  Basically, there's a large space to fly your ship around in but it does not feel endless.

[h1]These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.[/h1]
This is where the game shines, in my eyes.  Like most MMO's, you get out of it what you put in.  Star Trek Online is unique wherein you don't just work to level up your character, but your ships and bridge officers as well.  With the inclusion of Duty Officers, it's like managing your very own star ship crew.  The Duty Officer system lets you build a crew and then send them out on little missions that will last from fifteen minutes to days on end.  

Your voyages are a big part of Star Trek Online as well, with a large campaign on both the Federation and Klingon side and a medium sized campaign for the Romulan faction.  These campaigns are broken up into 'episodes', each segmented into different categories.  The writers certainly know their stuff, with little nods to the series littered throughout the campaigns.  A lot of these missions really make you feel like you are helping your faction though hard times or discovering new things.

[h1] Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds. [/h1]
Missions in Star Trek Online are heavily instanced, with a lot of the more recent content not playable in groups.  This can make it a little harder if you're trying to play though the lot with friends and there's no really easy way to tell which missions are single player only.  There are quite a few queues once you get towards end game and most of these are a mix of challenging and entertaining.  They range from fighting off a Borg advance to pushing the Terrian Empire back into their own reality.

[h1] To seek out new life and new civilizations. [/h1]
Seeking out new life and new civilizations is something that Star Trek lacks a little bit in it's core gameplay.  Luckily, we've got the Foundry for this.  The Foundry is an easy to use mission creator inside Star Trek Online with the intention of pushing your missions to the live game.  These missions will be playable by everyone and with some creative thinking, the sky can be the limit with this tool.  People can donate in game currency to your account if they really enjoyed your mission, so creating something of great quality can be benificial to yourself as well.

[h1] To boldly go where no one has gone before. [/h1]
Star Trek Online is five years old now.  People have been here before, aside from Foundry missions, you won't discover anything new here.  Though, I'll take this time to quickly talk about the Free to Play model.  There's been some argument over the 'Pay to Win' status of this game.  While you can sink real life cash into Star Trek Online to fast track yourself to the top, you don't have to.  In fact, with a bit of time, you can actually earn in game currency and covert that to currency to buy items from the cash shop.  Obviously, Star Trek Online is geared towards wanting you to spend money and there are some brazen attempts to pull some out of you, but with some self-control, you're able to enjoy all of the story and locations without spending a dime.  Premium ships and gear is locked behind a pay wall, if you're happy not having this.  Not one single cent needs to be spent.",1446710710,1446710716,True,163,21,0.870508968830108643,0,True,False,False

Some of the missions are brilliant fun, and some times it's like being part of the universe - good voice acting can bring you into great immersion, fun space fighting can be tense and exciting and other times it's even better because they do things in the game they couldn't pull off in the shows... but...  for every amazingly mind blowing fun adventure there's a couple cardassian trudge fests too, and for every breath taking battle with amazing space scapes in the back ground there's a another mission where you go to point A, kill 3 things, then do that again for point B, C, D, say something different at point E, then go back to kill and move for F and G. 

Is it worth checking out? Absolutely. Should you expect everything to be awesome? No. 

But there is Awesome in there, and if you love the series, it's worth joining the adventure for a while and doing the ""seasons of episodes"" (the quest lines) and if you're lucky, then along the way you'll find a nice fleet and get the other possible awesomeness from all this - there's some great people in there too... just not in the newbie zone =)

And it's worth saying twice - This game is genuinely getting better over time. The developers work on new content, on improving what's there, and adding new game play options as well. If you get bored and take a break for a year - it's a whole new game when you return.

I don't remember Star Trek being about blasting away and taking out villains on every mission. It can even feel a bit excess for the mirror universe. There is no exploration or diplomacy. It's all about combat. There are some missions that try to appear to be about other things, but it's just poitlness talk to these people or go scan those things. And while completing story missions does get you fancier ships, you can also just buy them. Because that's how it works in Star Trek.

With missions they are all just dictated tasks. All just a list of things told to you by your crew or admirals or such and you just follow along with their directions. No real thought or choices here. Lots of story but much of it feels overly simple or done before. This is not a trek, just to-do lists.

Space combat is probably the most fun in the game. But even there it's rather basic and mostly about hitting the abilities when their cooldown is ready. You do have to keep your shields up and move around at least, it's not the bore that ground combat is. You may have a team when doing ground combat but they just flail about shooting away on their own. And you just stand there, firing away and using skills. No cover shooting like in the shows & movies.

It has the look of Star Trek and even some of the actors doing voice work. But the game itself, besides looking rather old, just feels more like a reskin of a totally different game. There doesn't even feel much need for it to be online. So many times I kept thinking 'I should save here' and then remembered this is an MMO. 

So I tried it long ago and tried it again recently, but besides some fun with space combat there wasn't much to find here that isn't done much, much better in other games/mmos.",1441589647,1441589647,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I used to like this game and I will always be a Star Trek fan but as much as I wanted this game to suceed it has always fell short.  One it's left many promises unfulfilled even after years and the fans asking again and again doesn't matter.  What made the game good was it's stories which made me feel like I was in a interactive Star Trek episode but they have now all but stopped the featured episodes in favor of these large exploration zones, that would be alright if a player felt like they were accomplishing something but for example the Dyson Sphere your given a general objective clear out the enemies you do that and the enemies just keep respawning beind you in the same place making it feel like you're accomplishing nothing, no sense of progression.  There is no real attachment to your crew or ship, this is one of the unfullfilled promises from the developers, other than the bridge variants the rest the ship is exacty the same no matter what class or size ship you are in, there is nothing really interactive or things to do inside the ship and doors and hallways are disproportationaly large making it feel off.  One of the worst things they implemented was the Doff system which makes the make feel like Facebook's Farmville where the player has to constantly log in every few hours to re-que missions to earn better equimplent and skills.  These Doff missions also require resources which require grinding of a few missions hundreds of times to det top tier, this gets boring real fast.  The game has severly suffered from lack of PVP, it's in there just there is no real point to it and it's not really fun with no real rewards to playing it.  One of the worst is Cryptic won't let you post any negative feedback on their forums about game improvement or critiques doing so will get the person a warning or banned.

There is constant updates and new missions, but there is no startrek diplomatic or scientific missions, like those you see on the show; unless they are player built. All missions seem to be shoot them up, space lazer operas of no diplomatic possability. 

You can get the biggest and best stuff simply by playing a lot, which is great, considering the market design and functions of the game are based on free-to-pay additions; new content in the form of ships, interiors, pets, species, acocunt upgrades, ect. Honestly, I love how they do things, and although the ship prices are steep, they do provide ways to have such tier 6 ships simply through investing your time and intelligence; a beautiful consideration to the general player base.

sound is amazing, and often there is voice actors from the show(s) making apperences in the new release miussion content. Space battle - although a strange auditory concept and impractical possability - are great. I love the sound of battle in this game. Likewise, the score is great. The music really makes the feel of the missions.

The graphics are great. A tad cartoonish, granted they could make this game feel a little more realistic and gritty, it still provides an adventuristic sense; like the original series innocense that keeps the game psychologically positive, and you the obvious good guy.  The worlds are well done and there seems to be a pretty good adherence to startrek universal cannon in their design. The space battles are amazing light shows. This game was graphically made to be played in the space regions and in ship-to-ship battle. Here, unlike when 'on the gorund' or as an ""away team"", there is a dark gritty feel to fighting. Space battle starts to feel merceless, with hardly any quarter asusmed for the 10 thousand ships you will destroy over your carrier in starfleet. This game also renders PC wallpaper or generally artistic screen shot of one's ship or space combat. The graphics are brilliant in this realm of the game, and over all, good througout the game as a whole. 

Hints: go tac captin for captin abilities. Always pick an alien race for the efficiant and other space based bonuses. Save money for all ""efficiant"" crews and build a ship with a high priority for damage dealing. DPS is the god of this game, where cruisers with survivability to certain energy types implimented into their deisgn comes second. PVP is a buyers market, where you will be crushed by those who bought better ships/gear/gold unless you are a master captin in skill and timing, or a cloaked oppertunist who can swoop in and kill fast.

In Star Trek Online, the Star Trek universe appears for the first time on a truly massive scale. Players take the captain's chair as they command their own starship and crew. Explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations, and boldly go where no one has gone before in this ever-expanding online universe. - Highly Recommended!

Let's start with the basics: it's an MMORPG.  In a lot of ways, it's a very conventional RPG; a levelling system, more grind than a flour mill, regular bug-filled updates (which, to be fair, get fixed pretty quickly - the big, noticeable ones, at least).  It's also got two and a half factions which don't like each other, and since it's F2P, it's loaded with microtransactions.

It marks itself out with having both space and ground mechanics, being almost entirely instanced, and through being Star Trek.  Let's face it, if you're here, you're almost certainly a Trekkie to begin with.

The cons:
1. 'Micro'transactions.  This game is not cheap.  I've played over 400 hours and not bought anything from the C-store, and I don't feel particularly helpless, but endgame ships will set you back around $40.  Admittedly that's a one-off payment, and any future characters can use that ship without restriction, but it's still a fairly large investment.
2. Endgame balance is horrible.  The Special Task Force missions (read: raids) have almost dead public queues due to horrific imbalance in capability between a newly minted Lvl 60 player and an experienced and well-equipped endgame player; we're talking not a difference of 25% or so, but in the order of 1000% or more.  This has a few nasty side-effects for obtaining important gear; not insurmountable, but certainly frustrating.
3. Complexity curve.  The game itself is relatively simple, but there are a lot of behind-the-scenes mechanics that are not even slightly self-evident.  These aren't a big obstacle to gameplay until lvl 50 or so, but it can make the experience feel sluggish and frustrating.  Browsing of the STO reddit is highly recommended if you want to stick with the game.
4. Ground combat is subpar.  I personally don't think it's as bad as some people make out, but it's not nearly as fun as space stuff.  There are a few exceptions (personal cloaking devices combined with plasma flamethrowers are immensely entertaining) but it just doesn't feel as polished and developed.  Fortunately it's also a lot more forgiving in general.

With that in mind, let's get to the reason why I keep coming back to this thing.

1. Space combat is excellent.  Once you get used to the interface (I know some people find it awkward) it's very fluid.  As a long-time Eve Online player, I can honestly say that I prefer the STO mechanics; managing flight controls, a wide variety of offensive and defensive powers, and wrestling with keeping the enemy lined up with your weapons while keeping your shields boosted is a wonderful challenge.  It's also pretty as sin and really feels like Star Trek.  Diving at a Borg cube as the Defiant with all cannons blazing or seeing phaser fire bloom off your Galaxy as you maneuver at a stately pace around a hostile D'deridex is a great feeling.  Some of the powers also really give a suitably epic feel.  Using Torpedo Spread engulfs entire enemy squadrons in fields of photon torpedoes, while Fire At Will will make every beam you have fire at every enemy in range.
2. Flexibility.  When making a character, you pick faction (Federation, Klingon or Romulan) and a 'class'; Tactical, Science or Engineering.  In World of Warcraft, that would be it: you'd have just picked your playstyle for the rest of the game.  Not so here; your class only governs a set of basic powers you have, and what powers you can use in ground combat.  You still have the full range of ships, weapons, secondary powers and equipment available.  Just because you picked an Engineering 'tanky' character doesn't stop you from flying glass cannon Defiants, and a high-damage Tactical can use the resilient, sluggish Galaxy.
3. Events.  This is the one saving grace for all the high-cost real-money ships; on a regular basis, you'll be able to grind for special limited event ships.  These are high-end and very effective; one of the recent ships is considered by some to be one of the tankiest ships in the game.
4. The story is actually pretty good.  MMO storylines tend to turn me off; they're clunky and ignorable.  While that certainly applies to a fair amount of STO, there are some excellently crafted set-pieces and missions.  Being kidnapped and brainwashed, seeing friends massacred after a peace conference goes wrong - and let's not forget the Romulan tutorial, where everyone you know is killed or kidnapped as you barely escape in a rusting hulk of a warbird.  Mass Effect it ain't, but I've been pleasantly surprised.
5. Speaking of which, you can tell that it's written by real Star Trek nerds.  Despite an incredible range of enemies, locations and concepts, just about everything can be tied into one of the episodes or movies.  Two of the endgame enemies are spun off from a couple of stand-alone episodes of Voyager, but they feel in-character and match up with what we saw of them in the series.  The Elachi, a recurring enemy for Romulan players, were designed from a single episode of Enterprise where we barely saw them, but the elaboration works perfectly.  Creepy bastards.  You'll also hear some very familiar voices - Worf, Sela, Harry Kim, Tuvok, Spock (RIP) and a fair number of minor characters from the series have lent their voice talents.
6. Levelling is fairly painless.  I remember attempting to get through WoW and giving up around Lvl 40 (Lich King era).  By comparison, STO has far fewer missions, and you can get a character to Lvl 50 in a week's casual play.  50-60 is a lot more tedious, but it's a lot less noticeable; you've unlocked all the important things, and it would be fair to say that the game really starts at 50.  Everything prior has been a warm-up tutorial.
7.  Endgame gear.  Many games require endless farming of a given boss in the hopes of a drop.  STO completely drops this idea; endgame gear is all obtained from Fleet (guild) equipment or the Reputation system.  Endgame content merely provides the means to afford this equipment.  It's entirely predictable, and I personally would prefer to [i]know[/i] that I need ten runs to get what I want, rather than roll the dice of potentially getting it first time, but likely needing to run fifty times.  I get enough RNG nonsense from Warframe.

In conclusion... STO is by no means a perfect game.  That said, I would be comfortable in saying that it's one of the better offerings on the market.  Give it a week, and you'll be pleasantly surprised - or at least, you won't be bemoaning your lost time.",1428536513,1428536513,True,8,0,0.509909272193908691,0,True,False,False

It was awesome to fly these awesome spaceships I grew up watching and walking around on all these different planets and such then.....the newness wore off as you can pretty much make lvl 1-50 1 lvl a mission and you can only replay so many times before it just gets boring. There is alot to do when you first reach max lvl(which is 60 but will take you longer to make 50-60 then 1-50) you have the PvE missions for marks to advance thru your rep systems and crafting and patrols but again after awhile of the same thing every day it gets old I guess but prior to this in Nov of last year I said what the hell and dropped a huge chunk of change to go lifetime as I was liking the game so much and had invested real money for ships and whatnot so it was all good....then.....Delta Rising came out and suddenly everthing was different, they revamped main mobs to make it really hard in the PvE missions to win without dying 30 times which is ok to a point but then people started leaving....and more people....and do not let cryptic fool you STO does not have one of the largest up and coming player bases just the opposite. So, both my fleets (fed and kdf) both crumbled as mass people left the game due to unstabilities, bugs and the fact that it seems the devs are not concerned with fixing the current issues instead, they pump item after item into the zen marketplace (real money) trying to bleed people dry. If you plan to just play here and there and love the sto world then I say go for it but do not look forward to investing your time to make it your primary game however, to each thier own and you like others may not agree with this review and thats cool. Overall, STO is not a wothless game and with over 2k hours I can say I have enjoyed the hell out of it till late and hope that cryptic changes their ways before its too late because I would love to see this game regain its former glory! [/i]

[u]SPACE COMBAT[/u]: The ships are nice to look at though the fed ships tend to all sort of look the same they are awesome to look at with the renderscale turned up. Combat is functional and easy to pick up using main attacks combined with abilities aquired by different bridge officers. One of the recent changes I do like alot was the ability to train a bridge officer with all the skills they are able to learn and change them on the fly rather than having to have multiple officers with different skills. each shi[ has 4 sided shields guarding its hull unlike eve and whatnot with a single shield that drains from all damage no matter the facing. Groups on the Federation side are still relitivly easy to get for PvE mark missions. I do like how you can go to the bridge of  your ship and look around and on most fed ships can go to the different decks and such.

[u]GROUND COMBAT[/u]: Here I feel there is alot to be improved as you fight either in 3rd person targeting each target manually or you can go to FPS mode by pressing B allowing you to aim and get more involved. there is quite alot of different gear you can equip giving you different abilities and skills. I do feel that there is somthing missing from combat here and it feels kind of rough in fights. There is a battlezone where after 50 I think you can go and fight dino's with lasers and the ability to call down orbital strikes lol but they are fun to fight.

[u]OVERALL[/u]:[b] Until the devs step up and fix some issues and start listening to us the players I can not recomend this game at this time[/b] . Try this game out if you dont plan on spending any money or dont plan on it bieng a primary game, if you are a trekkie you will prolly have some fun at least going and reading the planet lore for system to system : ) .

Even before the Delta Rising season, the grind was pretty intense just to get to decent equipment or event items.   After Delta Rising, there was a simultaneous heavy double-nerf where raids and queues were increased in difficulty by large measures, while simultaneously slashing queue rewards.

The grind, especially after level 50 just to get decent equipment is huge and extreme and the rewards underwhelming.  Pair this with the fact Cryptic and PWE aren't able to clearly communicate even basic information to the user makes for a very frustrating experience for new users or users that expect basic competence from a development entity.

The game is slowly dying, Delta Rising itself has seen a pretty big downturn in users, and most of the late game mission queues are never populated as they are too difficult to complete for the rewards.

Due to the way the player run economy works, you can grind for cash shop items by converting dilithium into in-store currency, so technically you don't have to pay a cent and still get access to everything in the store.  It'll just take a good long while.  It's a good skinner box like that.

Barely any content on the Klingon side. Buggy. Very little to no high end content on the Federation side.  I stopped playing after my 'freebie' month ran out.

Fast forward to a November 2014. Decided to give it a shot since its FTP now. 

Wow. What a game! HUGE amount of content. More than enough to get you to maximum level, but with the content designed so that you play through story arcs... as if each arc was a season of a TV show and each mission is an episode. It works unbelievably well. The Romulan story in particular is gold-standard stuff. Among the best & most interesting online game mission/quests I've ever done since 3d online gaming started. Especially the Vault mission. You have to fly a shuttlecraft inside a star base, sneaking around, being clever.. Great stuff.

This game will cost you money and time. You don't *need* to spend cash on it, but I can almost guarantee you'll want to. My advice would be to give it a shot for a couple weeks. If you like it, pay for a 1 month sub. That'll give you a load of permanent bonuses, and a bunch of 1-time stuff. From then on in... well, it's up to you.

New damage types and combinations for your ship and ground weapons. New Fleet Starbase expansions with new special items to purchase, such as Ultra Rare Fleet Tactical Consoles with additional crit rate stats.

The game is a solid casual F2P MMO that at most times adds to the lore of the original/next generation Star Trek series. I started playing STO, back when it was first released in 2010 with a subscription fee up through the move to F2P off and on. The game has grown nicely and evolved over the past four years, improving the over all presentation and the developers had been listening to the feedback from the player base.

Unfortunately times are beginning to change and head in the unpleasant direction most F2P MMO are going. Signs of ""Pay to Win"" are starting to appear in the game. 

With the release of the new Delta Rising expansion, the price of the new Tier 6 ships has risen to a $30 per ship and there are no free ships given to players past the Upper Admiral rank (3 ranks below cap) which is a major disappointment. Also only ships purchased from store can be upgraded from Tier 5 to Tier 5-U. 

While the typical F2P MMO player base complaints that come with change are currently populating the STO forums, there is a valid growing concern by players that Star Trek Online is heading toward the wrong direction.  

On the upside, you can experience three different factions (Federation, Klingon and Romulan) with three different career types (Tactical, Science, or Engineering), up to the old level cap of 50 (Vice Admiral rank) with out spending a dime in the game Zen Store and there quite of enjoyable story driven content to be played through.

While you can play through the game without spending anything purchased ships and items have clear advantages over the ships you aquire  through regular means.  Ground combat is hidiously designed and clunky as hell.  You'll find there are significant delays between ordering an attack and executing it.  The game offers a choice between ""RPG mode"" which does all the aiming for you and ""FPS"" mode which allows more action oriented combat, but there's almost never a reason to leave the aimbot mode.

Locations are generally uninteresting, and the game often doesn't reward exploration of any kind.  Puzzles in the game are often too easy to be considered interesting, and too long to be considered anything other than extremely annoying.  In fact, so much about away missions is annoying that you'll find yourself skipping as much text and dialog as possible just to get back in to space quicker.

The redeeming feature of this game is the space combat which is well executed and visually pleasing.  It's possibly the only interesting part of the entire game.

Like many other people, I figured this game would have a strong PvP element.  I chose to play as a klingon because the idea of engaging ships in raw comabt was appealing.  However as it turns out PvP queues are almost always empty and the likelihood you'll get to try PvP is almost nil.  I asked around about why PvP was so dead and .. SURPRISE: it's because the game balance is broken, and every experienced player knows it so they only play PvE.

Missions are mostly wooden and uninteresting.  Sometimes you spend a lot of time annoyingly running between two points.  90% of the items sold in the game require currency that you either have to pay for, or is difficult to figure out how to acquire.  The currency you get the most of (energy credits) is mostly worthless for anything other than buying items which won't be better than the drops you get or speeding up travel which can be very slow over long distances.

This game had the potential to be something special, particularly with the space combat which will suck you in - at least at first.

They've been working hard on new content and we are now seeing the fruits of that labor.  With the help of a new production company we can now see this game take its rightful place among MMO's with a well known and grounded universe.

Besides its FREE!  You don't need to pay to play.  You get a new ship every rank except LVL50....the max level. And even then the last ship you get at lvl40 is still strong enough to do the LVL50 gameplay.  Ground combat is improved...not great but improved. Just simply it works and gives you sense of having fun.  

Go on!  Give this a try!  Many fleets to join to increase the fun and increase your XP!
Higher levels can set to match lower levels so they fight at your level!

So go take your rightful place in the Captains Chair!

I am editing this review as the state of the game has changed.

The game is still free...to lvl 50.  After lvl50 you will need to spend money to participate in the new tier of content for up to lvl 60.  You are FORCED to pay an large sum of money to continue or what you have cannot participate in that content.

Perfect World has done everything to make this game a cash cow and force grind after grind into the game. I am now being FORCED to spend more money instead of deciding if the new content is worth it.  Many of my fleet is walking away from the game and others are too. 

Do not support STO.  I am at a point where I hope this game dies very soon.  They are insulting the Star Trek universe( I will quote picard ""We have evolved beyond a need for money"") I'm not saying a free game should not have a store or make money.

Cryptic keeps pushing out content patches, new ships, and the class costumisation is one of the most in-depth I have ever found in any game. It's heaven for theorycrafters. Every so often however, Cryptic might release a new skill or item that makes one type of build the flavour of the month and in one case it can shadow all other builds, which are left in the dust.

That's always the risk in a game where every class can access virtually every skill.

The game merges two types of gameplays, the ground combat and the space combat. They work and feel different and you are able to concentrate only on one if you don't like the other. While levelling you might need to do a little bit of both, so depending on your tastes it might be either welcome variety or a minor annoyance, until you get to end game and are completely able to pick what kind of content you want to play.

The ability to walk around your ship and starbases also allows plenty of opportunities for RP if you are into that. Talking of which the character costumisation in this game is on par with games such as Aion, if not better. The graphic style is not Asian, but when you can pick things like the length of your fingers, you know you can do almost anything.

The game isn't necessarily pay to win, although items from the Zen store do have their advantages. If you have the time to grind, you can exchange in game currency for Zen (which you can buy with real cash) but the process is considerably slower.

Klingon not finish no story line in klingons also pvp based. And the lag disconnection issues account that was so bad i even cry a little because i love star trek.

The Free to Play model is fine its not pay to win because you`re doing more pve than pvp at the end pvp is not worth looking for in this game so ignore that one. Still you can pvp but its cheesy bad that you think Elder Scrolls Online is better. 

However there is a downside to everything like every mmorpg the end game is really the endgame you can farm special items or crew or whatever you want to do. So thats the downside of the game however there is also a more elite missions you can do or turn your story line to elite to get better loot.

You can change everything not only your ship or you but even your crew your deck of the ship and even costum your engine increasing it at your taste. There are cookie builds on the net to squeeze the maximum of your char and ship. But thats your taste of gaming.

Why you might ask....Well becuase its one of the few actual free to plays that doesnt treat you like a second class citizen.  I will try to give you a balanced view of the game.

Pros: Large player base, active community, Foundry system, True free to play/earn to max out system, Major content patches rather quickly, Awsome space combat, Decent graphics, Lengthy PVE content with dozens of hours of gameplay, extremely involved Fleet/guild Starbase build up group projects. Few bugs, and smooth gamepaly. 

Cons: Not a alot of pvp(few maps and no reputation as of yet),  No end game raiding(there are elite stf and hard content, but no large scale raiding), Lock boxes(almost a pro becuase they can be opend by ingame grinding, but if you spend money to open them you will blow throw a weeks check trying to get a ship), Ground combat(I know they are updating it a bit, but its so far where space combat is, still i am hopeful)

So yeah the game has expensive stuff to buy and its hella shinny, but all of that can be bought with in game money.  If you just want to grind a whole lot you can get everything.  Now thats not to say I havent dumped a few thousand dollars, over the life of this game, on this company.   Its really nice and they make so much money now that the updates come every few months.  Also, the content is very well done. Hours and hours of gameplay with no grindy feeling. The company is also pretty generous and lets the players have alot of stuff free that others would charge out the ass for.  Its not a big pvp game right now, but give it time and I think that that will change drastically. Possibly later this year. As I said major updates and content releases are every few months. Honestly it doesnt even feel like a free to play except i dont pay a monthly fee.

This company also has a unique way of pulling you back in to play it with updates and events.  I lose intrest from time to time or see another shinny game. When all the sudden, Bam I get that email about some crazy update or ship being given or droped that I just have to have, and there I am back into logging in every day.  Happend more times that I can count over the years this game has been up. 

Also, this game is so not pay to win. Are the ships in the boxes nice. Sure. Are there alternatives that are as good or better for grinding? Yes.  Most of the box ships are more like status symbols than a I win button.  I cant tell you how many Jem'hadar attack ships I have popped in pvp or out dpsed in Elite stfs. Its more of a ""I have a shinny sword"" rather than ""I have a sharper sword""  Even the new Voth bulwark battle crusers is (IMO) out classed by the fleet Federation dreadnought.  That can be being in a decent fleet and doing a bit of grinding.

I can say without a doubt that I was excited for this game when I first pre-ordered it. And then I played it. It wasn't the worst MMO I had ever played but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations. The ground combat was clunky, the early story and missions were boring and there was little to no voice acting. About the only thing I did like was the ship to ship combat. But that couldn't save it for me. I just couldn't bring myself to buy the full version. 

Now, 4 years later, I find myself picking it up again after hearing about how many changes have been made. It piqued my curiosity so I began to play last week. Trust me when I say, this isn't the same game that I decided against buying 4 years ago. Pretty much everything has been revamped. The game is now in it's 8th major update since launch, so there's quite a bit of new content. 

Starting out, the first thing I noticed that the whole intro has been scrapped and is now completely different. Instead of finding yourself in the middle of a Borg attack, you are now an Ensign at Starfleet Academy, who has just graduated and been given his (or her) first assignment. You have been chosen to be the First Officer aboard a not-so-new Miranda Class ship. Your first mission is to go out and collect some data samples with your cadet crew. Then things go wrong.

The story is engrossing from the very first moments. It's a major step up from what used to be. 

Then there's the C-Store. Currently, the game is Free To Play, which is good for someone like me, who's on a budget. Usually I hate the Free to Play options in games because I feel like my version is severely diminished. That's not the case in Star Trek Online. As a matter of fact, aside from some nifty cosmetic stuff and things like different styles of ships, I haven't really seen anything different between the Free to Play stuff and Paid subscribers. There are a few things, such as more costume slots or extra Duty Officers, which are nice but not necessarily hindering you if you don't have them. 

What really impresses me about the C-Store is the ability to buy Zen (the currency used in the Cash Shop) with in-game Dilithium. Admittedly, it's at a pretty steep cost. About 125 Dilithium per 1 Zen. That means that if you want to buy the cheapest item in the C-Store, you'll need about 31,000 Dilithium saved up. Which is going to take you quite a bit of grinding. But still. The option is there and that's more than most other games will give you. 

Overall, I have been having a blast. Currently I've only made it to Level 20 (Commander) and I have yet to join a Fleet but that hasn't stopped the fun from rolling in. 

The only thing I could really ask for is some good PVP or better PVE Instance queues. But that's not to say I wont keep playing. 

At the moment, I am going to give it a 7 out of 10. I've seen some bugs but those are nothing that can't be fixed in later patches.",1390524270,1390524270,True,2,0,0.54703831672668457,0,True,False,False

It is one of the poorest quality games out there in terms of bugs, both minor and game breaking, it has the most basic endgame, and pvp has never been, and likely never will be balanced. The graphics are overly taxing for their quality, and lag issues plague a percentage of players constantly. The only good things that I can say about this game from the view of a gamer, is that the free to play system is tastefully done. One does not need to pay a single penny in order to play and enjoy the entire game, but it is worth it if you do wish to pay. You can acquire credits for the real money store by just playing the game, so even though some of the items offter a small advantage, they are obtainable for anyone willing to invest the time (most notably end game ships). The other thing I find great about this game is that it is always adding new content, while not super amazing it is enjoyable for a time, and features some great voice acting talent, who would be familiar to anyone who knows Trek.

This game becomes better from the standpoint of a fan of Star Trek, and is very much worth it to play if you are one. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to have fun with Star Trek, or for a casual gamer who just wants to have fun in general and does not care so much about overall game quality. I do not recommend this for a pure gamer just looking for another game to try, or for a unique gaming experience, because you will not find that here.

I do feel it is fair to note that the game has lately increased in quality, while it does not yet change my opinion of it, It might become better in the future.

It is free to try, so, why not?

The setting is nice and you'll find yourself saying ""Kirk or Picard? Nope, I'm better!""...up untill the Borg have you for breakfast in your first Elite STF. Which brings me onto one of the main things that you'll need to know. Progression/Endgame.

The race to max level can be done very quickly, but without finishing all of the story arcs in the game, which sorta leaves you away from the generaly well-designed missions (Some are a bit goofy, and a couple are nothing more than the old kill 10 rats thing) and not enjoying the full story. This ends up dumping you in an endgame in which you may not understand why such and such a thing is happening, not to mention the practice you get on deciding how to setup your ship. You'll get gear througout your missions (Which you can replay to get better versions) that you can (And should) experiment with so you can set up how you like at the end. This does bring me to a slight pont of controversy - The dreaded C-STORE! (Or cash shop...whatver you wanna call it.)

Whilst you'll hear ""Oh god, it's a cash shop! It's Pay2Win LOLz OMGBBQ ect, ect"" You can very easily match up with the best captains with everything you earn in game. Yep. I've seen it myself. You can (and will) get an edge with the ships and crew on offer, as well as the lockboxes in which you buy your keys from (Either C-store or from the exchange for high amounts - You are warned). These can make a bad captain semi-decent, but you'll die alot anyway without the skills and gear to back it up. Whilst it sems to be slightly on the steep side for these edges, this is made better by the fairly often sales that are thrown on. Or, by earning Dilithium (A premium currency), you could get it all and pay nothing! ..With a bit of work.

One last thing to mention is that the game still has it's bugs. Some from right at the start, sadly. As well as ""bugs"" which turned out to be quite useful and conferred no real game bonuses, which were fixed while these still exist! The bugs and somewhat bad UI (As a Science officer that wants to heal.....ARGH!) can make this game a bit of a nightmare for the newer player. 

In time, I found that the setting and the gameplay has outweiged the bugs and issues I've ran into. Others may not agree, but you've nothing to loose by giving it a go. If it's not your thing, then no problem! Leave your own review and say what got you. If you like it, then great! I think you're playing a good title. Not perfect mind!

Outer space is open world and you can go to any planet at any time.  Not all planets are exploreable.  Many planets have missions.  All the usually MMO stuff PvP,PvE, and etc.  The game has a basic crafting system that allows you to upgrade a standard device (weapon,armor, or etc) from common to uncommon to rare and finally very rare.  Upgrades are pretty linear for example each new level engine is +5 on the speed.  You start with 50 engine speed and you can get as high as 115-120 in increments of 5 per level.  You can create or join a fleet so you can eventually get ultra rare mark 12 gear.  It is better to join an existing fleet as upgrading your starbase, mine, and etc take a long time unless you have dozens in your fleet.

There are a number of good missions that are really fun.  If you have a good video card you can set the graphics high enough to look really good.

Each season that progresses with this game it seems to add significant more details and features. While the MMO features a few insulting tropes (crates, horribly imbalanced PVP, Loot systems) It manages to maintain what it wants to be: an exploration of all things Star Trek. If you want to explore things in your own ship, have a few fun star trek themed missions with friends or even by yourself (since some actually DO that apparently), The game adapts to your tastes. you can have a crew of NPCs that serve as your bridge officers (and powers in space) that can reasonably supplement human players. So long as you equip them right. It's regretful that ground combat is ultimately shallow and immensely dull, as there are only so many planet types and spaceships you can stomach before it gets old. what REALLY makes the game shine is the space combat. It's a logical evolution to what Star Trek: Legacy was from long ago. Instead of four vessels, you pilot one extremely specialized craft. I've tried nearly every ship type, and cross classing, meta-building, as well as customizing are highly encouraged by a fairly straightforward user interface. I bought this and played it way back in beta release. It's a delight to see cutscenes, textures, classes, ships, everything transform this game. Seeing as it's free. why not give it a try? you might find yourself enjoying trophies on your bridge.  My only reccommendation is avoid PVP. Starfleet is extremely underpowered against both romulans and klingons, and very little has been introduced to counteract the cloak ambush. Honestly the PVE missions against borg, the crystalline entity, and the dominion are an absolute delight when you see massive high level vessels backing you up. At the very least, give it a try.

STO for me, is an MMO that was quick to dissapoint. The space combat was awesome, as was the customisation, as seems to be the thing with Cryptic games. However everything else soon got dull. Even with the latest update release, Legacy of Romulus, it's just more of the same. It's a game I play sparingly, and it often gets uninstalled off my system.

If you're here for RP, you'll be dissapointed too, since despite being constantly told there is RP, and asking in the chat channels where it is, I have -never- found any.

All in all the game looks nice, plays well, I never encountered any game breaking bugs, unless you count the very early days,  but it quickly gets boring, and I believe even solid Trek fans would have problems staying the course and sticking around.

Sure, there are some neat goodies you can buy (and I often do) but they aren't game breaking and you can get to max level and earn in game money just selling off parts of the ships you blow up or from mission rewards. For example, you are rewarded with a new ship each time to earn a rank (evern few levels) OR you can spend some money and buy the same ship with a different skin and an extra officer slot and a fun console (grappling hook, low damage auto turret, etc.) but the ship reward is just perfectly fine to go out and blow up bad guys with.

The community is top notch and (as would be expected) are a Star Trek lovin' bunch. Lots of great fleets to join as well as all level of RPers.

Character customization is top notch (as you would expect from Crypic) and the ability to customize the look of your crew is a big bonus. From Borg to Ferengi, hell, throw a few Pakleds on your bridge crew. Most of the major races are represented as well as a few of the lesser known ones. Or just make up your own with the character creator.

Ground combat and exploration is fun but the game really shines in space combat. You can level in PVE, PVP or let your crew do the work and send your duty officers and crew off to do assignments. It's up to you.

Ground combat with your away team has improved vastly since the early days.  Beam down (with your bridge crew of course) and fight with phasers and batleths.

Good ambiance.  It has the Trek look, feel and sound.  Powers are named like the technobabble in the show: reverse polarity, fire a tachyon beam, divert power to shields.

Still need more? Phasers, photons and space ships and things blowing up. Everything Star Trek is without the boring drama parts.

Finally a MMORPG game that isn't mindless farming and confusing libraries of equipment and items.  Oh it's got choices, but it at least it doesn't need an encyclopedia to catalog everything.

Enjoy everything that is Star Trek and gain items and rewards from playing the missions.  You don't need an axe, just a phaser and a ship, everything you need will be rewarded to you as you progress.

Visit alien worlds! Destroy any enemies of the Federation or The Klingon Empire!
