Life seemed to move at a darn slow pace and gaming time felt unlimited. So yup, DQ11 captures the essence of that long-gone era and brought me back to the good old ""young kid"" days.

+ Simple but heartwarming story.
+ Nostalgic JRPG gameplay including turn-based combat and simple/clear leveling pathways.
+ Did I mention how relaxing it is to play turn-based JRPGs now when basically every other franchise has moved on to real-time combat.
+ Finally a game that rewards you for exploration with better gear @ that level. (just like the good ol' days)
+ Grinding levels is not necessary.
+ Not a live-service game. It just welcomes you to finish the game and move on.

- First 2 hours are slow. But things pick up after that.
- Not all text are voice-acted (small thing?)

It appears that this game is heavily influenced by Suikoden IV.  The protagonist, at least, is very similar to the protagonist from Suikoden IV. I noticed many similarities between Suikoden and HunterxHunter in the first act. While not delivering the depth in story writing, enormous amount of characters, and side quests of the original. The second act appears to draw heavily from Berserk, which is where I stopped playing. TLDR: It lacks depth and relies heavily on tropes from older Japanese anime and JRPG classics. (Which makes it really tedious if you are already familiar with the originals)

It stands shoulder-to-shoulder with timeless classics like Final Fantasy IV or VI, and even surpasses predecessors such as Dragon Quest III or V. The game offers an abundance of quality-of-life features, a vast expanse of content, and stunning visuals that truly shine in 4K at 60fps. Additionally, its optional 2D mode provides a delightful retro experience. With commendable voice acting, a well-crafted script, captivating character and monster designs, and extensive exploration and customization options, Dragon Quest XI S leaves little to be desired.

However, the only aspect where it falls slightly short is in its music. While the soundtrack pays homage to the series' roots, it lacks significant innovation and feels somewhat repetitive, possibly due to a limited OST. Despite this, the game's brilliance far outweighs any minor musical shortcomings. Dragon Quest XI S is a masterpiece that shouldn't be missed by any JRPG enthusiast, even if its soundtrack doesn't quite reach the heights set by Nobuo Uematsu.

Moreover, I would advise against heeding the opinions of ""professional critics"" who claim the game is too traditional. Without Dragon Quest's steadfast commitment to the traditional turn-based JRPG format, titles of such high quality in this genre might not even exist today. It's fitting that these classics continue to see releases in the modern era, and this is precisely where Dragon Quest excels. While Final Fantasy has dramatically shifted away from its roots since Final Fantasy XV, distancing itself from long-time fans of the SNES, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 eras, the developers of Dragon Quest have remained loyal to their fanbase, prioritizing homage over chasing fleeting trends in Western game development. You won't find flashy action combat mechanics akin to Devil May Cry or barren open worlds here, and I fervently hope that the developers ignore the opinions of ""professional critics"" urging them to alter their approach.

I don't really mind the random combat RNG, but i also don't hate the enemies visible and you can choose which battles you take now, actually i think it would be amazing if you could choose just like this one, you can choose playing 2D or 3D, amazing choice and i will prob play again in a different way because of this

The story is rather simple, but the characters are very interesting, its always the high point on Dragon Quest, the party is always very interesting imo, I only played in the OG language, Japanese, so i cannot tell you about how the Dub is tbh, but i never heard anything bad about it. There are plenty of very unexpected surprises in the story, with most of them being genuinely well written and well delivered, it had a few fake outs for and end, but the plot twists were not that bad, so i didn't mind that much, and in general, even if the game does overstay its welcome a bit by the end, it feels like a fun adventure with ancient mysteries, i am a big fan of how you keep in touch with the previous luminaries and stuff

Dragon Quest XI (S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition) is a fantastic game and an experience worth of your time. It does many things perfectly right. It looks good, sooooo good, and even better, it feels good.

Def recommend for those individuals that enjoy the superior tastes of a TURN BASED RPG, they still live out there, go save the world!

1295510,157511653,76561197989807190,2267,590,4809,0,4809,1706749796,"So… I’ve never played a Dragon Quest game before this one. It’s a bit odd to think that, given how important for the development of Japanese-made RPGs the game was. Even if it itself originally drew inspiration from Wizardry and Ultima. But yeah, I’ve played almost every Final Fantasy game, but never Dragon Quest. So I’m glad that DQ XI became my introduction to the series as I do see why it’s often called one of the greatest examples of the genre.

Being not personally familiar with older entries, I can only speak from what I’ve seen and heard from others in terms of how similar or different the DQ XI is in comparison. But as I understand, most of the titles in the franchise (just as it is the case with Final Fantasy) are completely disconnected, only sharing some similar characters, themes, monster designs and basic concepts. But gameplay-wise, they all feature the more or less unchanged oldschool approach to turn-based combat, combat encounters that have it’s own arena space, rather simple, but epic adventure story, great music, exploration in both locations and in the overworld and incredibly memorable and fun monster designs. In DQ XI in particular, you can see encounters on the map (at least in 3D mode, I’ll explain later) and you can attack first to deal damage before the encounter starts, but once it starts there are no special checks for if you were the one to initiate the fight – you may still be “ambushed” and lose the first turn. Additionally, this game in 3D mode has overworld only for travel via other means than on foot or via a horse, with big handmade locations covering the space between the towns and dungeons. And you get additional traversal mechanics like jumping, climbing and stuff like this. It’s like getting just the perfect amount of open world, without the tedium that usually follows.

My mind was also absolutely blown by how brief and fun the battles can be. Almost every single example of a jRPG in 3D that I’ve experienced up until now felt like going into the battle and out of it takes a painfully large amount of time. But in DQ XI it’s just right. And since you can set most of your partners to behave automatically, based on a rule, it also means that you only need to take control during harder fights and boss encounters. It’s not as deep as the fantastic Gambit system from FF XII, but it doesn’t need to be. Mechanically, it is a rather classic turn-based affair, but there are some tweaks and a super powered mode reminiscent of Limit Breaks from FF, without it being super important most of the time. Oh and I’m so glad that in this game enemies much weaker than you just straight up run away, which is usually a good indicator of you becoming over-leveled for a particular part of the game.

The story is rather simple in terms of the plot, but the characters and storytelling are good. Same for the English voice acting and especially the fantastic localization that has an incredible amount of personality to it. There are plenty of very unexpected surprises in the story, with most of them being genuinely well written and well delivered. And in general, even if the game does overstay its welcome a bit by the end, it feels like a super fun adventure with ancient mysteries, saving the world and all the good stuff.

But I’ve played the game in the 3D mode and that requires some explanation. So, the original release of the game from 2017 had two versions of the game – the one the 3D mode is based on for PS4 and a different one for Nintendo 3DS. The 3DS version used its 2 screens to deliver a game in 2 different styles – a 3D model style reminiscent of the (terrible, in my opinion) DS remakes of older Final Fantasy games, and a 16-bit like 2D style. While the story and most of the content of the 3DS version was same or similar to the PS4 version, the location layouts and some mechanics were different. For example, this version had classic overworld exploration between towns and dungeons, instead of specific locations and in that overworld all encounters were random. The fights also followed an even stricter oldschool turn-based rules. Including the old conventions of those rules, where you’d get one combat update line at a time. So if you kill 6 enemies with one hit, you’d get “enemy 1 damaged for X damage, enemy 1 died, enemy 2 damaged for X damage, enemy 2 died…etc”, with one update per line. This makes the 3DS combat feel far slower than the PS4 combat.

The Definitive Edition of DQ XI has “2D mode” that is emulating the 16-bit screen version of the 3DS game. It is a completely separate mode (since maps are incompatibly different) and while you can switch to it from within 3D mode, it’s not seamless, requires a separate save and you can’t go back once you’re in. Being based on the 3DS version, it also lacks a lot of quality of life things like quick menus that are available in the 3D Mode, because, as I understand, they were added with the Definitive addition. It seems like this edition in general made a lot of things much nicer and many things I thought of positively when playing seem to have been either added or improved upon specifically for this version. Though it also removed one mini-game which, as I’ve gathered, had a lot of negative feedback about it. So maybe it’s for the better.

Sadly, you would still need to deal with the quirks and slowness of 2D mode when playing the whole game in 3D mode if you want to 100% the title. There’s a bonus location that used to be in 3DS added to the Definitive Edition, but it’s only available in the 2D mode. Which, presumably for technical reasons, requires you to save the game before you transition there and you can’t save or do some things while you’re in it. That whole area is based around, as I understand, revisiting areas and characters from older DQ entries and, honestly, I liked that whole bonus questline the least. It essentially hits all of the worst things I tend to dislike about jRPGs and even has one level being a hard to decipher vague maze. And yeah, random encounters, of course, which are very slow, as mentioned. But that whole thing doesn’t really add to the main story, so if you find it tedious, you might as well skip it.

That said, even though I was absolutely loving the game for most of my rather long playthrough, the whole last 1/4 of the game (maybe even longer) feel… unnecessary? Because, they are a continuation of the story, but play like optional post dungeons and super bosses you’d normally have in a game like this. So, after dozens of hours of well paced and fun varied dungeons, the game loses any semblance of pacing and requires some grinding even. Due to which, by the end of my playthrough I was glad the game is over. Whereas if it ended around 20 hours earlier, I might’ve even considered a replay at some point.

Nonetheless, Dragon Quest XI in the Definitive Edition is a fantastic game and an experience worth the time. It does many things not just right, but almost perfectly right. It looks good, it feels good. It sounds good, both in a more synthesized soundtrack and the surprisingly amazing orchestral soundtrack that, unlike so many other orchestral soundtracks, doesn’t sound have the “boring cinematic music” feel at all. It keeps all of the quirks of the classic synth-based jRPG music in its sound just like Pixel Remaster soundtracks for FF. It’s great if you’re a fan of jRPGs and if you’re not – this might actually hook you in. I mean – I tend to get bored of turn-based combat games with huge worlds and long runtimes very quickly, and yet I decided to 100% all story content of the game. And loved the vast majority of my playthrough, always anxious to get back to playing after each working day. Guess, now I would have to check older entries in the series, huh…",1706984711,1706984711,True,33,1,0.782559037208557129,1,True,False,False

Because there's a few negative points worth mentioning like : making the original version of the game and the definitive edition separated, using lower fidelity textures in the definitive edition compared to the original version (and still somehow running worse, I had a smoother experience with the old game),the game not even using the hardware as much as possible but still somehow lowering frame rate, and also before the release of the game telling people that this game was NOT going to be censored. 

To Square Enix this apparently means censoring the game during development and giving that version equally to Japanese and global fans, especially with clothes it's so evident they were censored it's funny, like the Divine Bustier yet again covering Martina (Jade)'s legs more than necessary like in DQ VIII with Jessica when they made the 3ds version or most skirts being excessively long, and most probably not for a ""design decision"" .

We're in 2023 (the Def Edition came out in 2017 for the first time but my point still stands since they kept that version) and we still get pointless censorship, dishonest lies about it and stuff that modders have to fix, which is pretty sad. If the points I listed don't bother you and you like JRPGS you'll probably have a good experience with the game anyway. Now all that's left is waiting for DQ XII, crossing fingers there's less bullshit with that game, though I doubt about it.

Edit: Nevermind, the upcoming Dragon Quest Monsters The Dark Prince's newest trailer has shown characters badly censored again, there's no hope for modern Square and their braindead ethics department... Imagine getting paid to butcher entertainment for no reason whatsoever. Giving people options in the game to play uncensored or not based on their preference? BIG NO!

Works perfectly on Steam Deck, so that's always to play on the go.

It's a great traditional Dragon Quest game, gameplay is identical to any DQ since ever. So, if you like DQ series you'll be to heaven if you don't you probably should try something else.
Even if the game is great and enjoyed playing it, they should have made some improvement. The inventory management is the same at it was 40 years ago... 

Besides those minors inconveniences, music is splendid, story is great (that a DQ so you know the drill, you have to save to world and your friend will help you), graphics are really nice.

Overall, I loved DQ11. Wonderful game with a great story and likable characters.

Are there some moments you can just immediately guess the next story point in a minute? Yes, but some of these moments lost absolutely nothing from being able to see it coming. Lots of the story points that had impact were great, with my favorite being from my least favorite act - the third act.

Reaching for the sword and knowing [REDACTED] is about to [REDACTED], only for the Hero to [REDACTED] was absolutely delicious.

The only complaints I have; Having to hit level 99 on everyone to 100% sucked, the Secret Final Boss being required to 100% sucked, Wheels of Harma sucked, Act 3 making virtually all of Act 2 null and void was absolutely HORRENDOUS, and I genuinely despise Veronica.

Veronica has no redeeming qualities, even going into Act 3. She had no development to make me like her, her issue was never resolved outside a single plot moment and then the game went on as if it never happened, and her bratty attitude never toning back felt awful. I've never genuinely been thrilled to get another party member to replace someone before, but Veronica won my heart by being the first character I actually was happy to never use again - outside, of course, Wheels of Harma. God, time trials suck.

The game has awesome cut scenes with full voice acting except for the side quests which are usually boring personality devoid fetch quests.

You can play the entire game in 2D or in 3D but you can't quick switch between them. It creates a new save at a recent story point. So, if you wanted to traverse the world in 2D and play cutscenes in 3D you cannot do that.

I held off on buying this for a few years because of Denuvo's draconian online-only DRM. DRM like this is UNACCEPTABLE in singleplayer games and I refuse to buy any game that has it like Armored Core 6, Persona  or the Resident Evil games. I only recently discovered that Square finally removed that garbage from DQ11 S DE in 2021. Woops. Either way, it's finally doable and I grabbed it for $25 on sale. I'm loving it so much!

I had played the original non-definitive version on PS4 back in the day with it's better graphics, limited by it's awful Casio keyboard soundtrack. PS4 went boom so I never got to beat it. They ported it to Switch with lower poly/texture assets and then ported that Switch version to PC and newer consoles but never swapped back the original models, textures and shaders. I always hated that I had to choose between batter graphics and better sound. Now there is the Project Rebuild series of mods that fixes this and gives the best of both worlds! You just extract the pak files and drop them in the game/content/paks folder and you are done. A HUGE thanks to those mod creators for giving us this! I owe you a kidney and some cookies.

Look for these four mods to get as close to the original PS4/PC graphics as possible: Project Rebuild NPC Character models, Monsters and animals, Environment objects and equipment. With these installed, it truly is the Definitive Edition of Dragon Quest 11, and it still hits 144fps on my old GTX 1070 at 1080p, so no worries about it's performance impact. It did have weird frame pacing issues in borderless mode, but going fullscreen fixed it and still lets me tab out unlike some games. The Switch video files do look pretty chunky, but there is a 4K upscaler mod that may fix that.

On to the regular game review, it's great. Finally having this orchestral soundtrack is just glorious. Some tracks like Sylvando's theme still use the Casio keyboard setup, but they are passable. Performance even with the graphical mods mentioned above is nearly flawless, only giving the usual Unreal Engine stutters every now and then. Nothing too bad. Controls are great on an Xbox Series controller or on mouse and keyboard.

I MASSIVELY prefer games like Dragon Quest, Pokemon or Persona with pure turn based combat over something like FF7 or FF13's horrible hybrid combat. Turn based menus in a real-time scenario just felt awful, like getting punched in the face repeatedly while trying to read a fancy restaurant menu. It just doesn't work. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of Dragon Quest staying traditional. The story (As far as Iv'e gotten with a surprise ally back in the day) was amazing, and Jade... Come on... Jade... I was a simp for her in 2018, and I am in 2024 all over again. ""I'll take ten."" - Patrick Star

If you like RPGs and somehow haven't bought this yet, stop reading and buy it! The garbage DRM is gone and mods restore it to it's former glory. Now to go look up Jade in places...

This game is kinda like what you would expect from DQ universe ( albeit the freaking HERO char design what is up with that!!! .. honestly out of all DQ series I hate this char design the most) . That being said what kept me going was storyline and gameplay and honestly some of the grinding which is not needed that much at all if you are causal player but I like pummeling enemies with one hit lol thats why there is a bit of grinding involved. 

If you are new to the DQ universe, give this game a chance and play. You will definitely find something worth your time here in this game. This game literally have everything like to sink your time in. 

In my personal opinion, I would put the game series rank in this order of which I enjoyed and invest time in.

1. FF series, Trails of steel ( legend of heros) series (just put the series cus things wont make that much sense in story if jumped in randomly), Tales universe
2. Star Ocean series, trials of mana, DQ universe
3. YS series, Scarlet nexus, and some other standalone game that I dont wanna put in anymore for this review.
 So yea you got the gist of what you are getting into. This game is good and fun enough to enjoy and without knowing it you already put a lot of times in.

PRO

The story line is really interesting and captivating for me. There are also some twist and turns they took and surprised me a lot. This game is one of the lengthy one. Without knowing you would already spend like around 25-40 hours just completing ACT 1 and they have 3 ACTs.  

The character design are also kinda unique to DQ universe. There is also some fun element they put into the game from Real World. ( e.g. Saikiki beach, which actually made me smirk a bit). 

The battle is generic JRPG turn based with a touch of freedom on movement depending on your battle mode set up in option. But whichever option is the same. JRPG TURNED BASED OLD SCHOOLED.

The graphic are also pros and cons .... This edition have lower graphic quality than the vanilla edition which is not detectable for everyone but for me I actually set every single game of mine to optimal setting I can get with my rig and I can actually feel the difference and in some case it can be a let down for some. But it is minimal. Most of the time you wont even feel the difference while immersing in the story unfolding.

CON

Graphic as I said before it was a bit painful for me to play this edition after playing the vanilla edition twice. Although minimal, I can feel it. That being said the game still ran perfectly in every edition. No performance issue.

The game is a lengthy one. Somewhat slow paced in some part. This game actually remind me of Dragon ball a lot ... first time finding all those orbs in DB took a long time and the time after that it took like what 5 sec in real time lol. kinda like that which made me feel like an idiot for investing emotionally and timely to all those 1 st time.  

The Hero char design man for me is the worst of all DQ series. I just cant stand looking at him. So I put on the ARMOR costume in game( dun wanna spoil ) just to hide his face as much as i can and that actually made me bearable to his design  and it looks way cooler. 


CONSENSUS.

So yea I do enjoy playing this game. You guys can give this game a go and I can assure you. you will find something in game that would charmed you. That how vast this game system is. This game have content comparable to the game that i mentioned in the ranking 1. Crafting, gathering, grinding for mats. which is optional if you chose to. 

The only reason i put this in rank 2 is just because of the battle system which is really old schooled like PS1 era or actually the era before that.  That just might be my opinion. I do like fast paced Real time Action system but nevertheless this game actually have option for the battle to go fast and auto with semi gambit system so most of the time you are literally auto piloting while grinding for mats. This actually saved my day. 

SO GIVE THIS GAME A GO and you will definitely find something to enjoy.

Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Dragon Quest series, offering a captivating and immersive RPG experience that spans generations. Square Enix has masterfully crafted a definitive edition that not only brings the critically acclaimed original to new platforms but enhances the adventure with additional content and quality-of-life improvements.

Visually, Dragon Quest XI S is a stunning masterpiece. The art direction, character design, and environments showcase the signature charm of Akira Toriyama's style, creating a world that is both nostalgic and modern. The game seamlessly transitions between lush landscapes, bustling cities, and intricate dungeons, providing a visual feast for players.

The narrative is a classic hero's journey, but it is executed with such finesse that it feels fresh and engaging. The protagonist, known as the Luminary, embarks on an epic quest to uncover the mysteries of his destiny and confront the forces of darkness. The story is well-paced, with compelling characters, unexpected twists, and a sense of grandeur befitting a classic RPG.

One of the defining features of Dragon Quest XI S is its turn-based combat system. While traditional, the battles are dynamic and strategic, offering depth through character skills, Pep Powers, and the ability to switch between party members. The inclusion of the ""Tactics"" system allows players to customize party behavior, adding a layer of strategy to encounters.

The Definitive Edition introduces new features, including the option to switch between 3D and 2D graphics, orchestrated or synthesized music, and the ability to visit past Dragon Quest worlds. These additions enhance the replayability and provide a delightful nod to longtime fans of the series. The character-focused side stories, fleshing out the backstories of the party members, add emotional depth to the overall narrative.

Dragon Quest XI S excels in creating a living, breathing world filled with memorable NPCs, each with their own stories and quirks. The sense of exploration is rewarded with hidden treasures, secret paths, and charming interactions, making every corner of the world feel worth exploring.

The orchestral score, composed by Koichi Sugiyama, is a standout element of the game. The music perfectly complements the epic scale of the adventure, evoking a range of emotions from excitement to nostalgia. The voice acting is also commendable, breathing life into the diverse cast of characters.

While Dragon Quest XI S is a near-perfect experience, some players may find the game's adherence to traditional RPG elements, such as random encounters and a linear progression structure, to be less appealing if they prefer more open-world or non-linear experiences.

In conclusion, Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition is a crowning achievement in the RPG genre. With its timeless aesthetics, engaging narrative, and refined gameplay, it not only pays homage to the series' roots but also sets a standard for modern RPGs. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer to the Dragon Quest universe, this definitive edition is an essential and unforgettable journey.",1703649591,1703649591,True,3,1,0.563145339488983154,0,True,False,False

The game is deceptively simple for its first act but continues to build on its mechanics and story, like a true RPG should.  Many modern ""RPGs"" these days are normalized and sterilized to fit into a treadmill model, where you are grinding but never feel like you get anywhere, or worse tempting you with microtransactions to distract and exploit you.

Instead, this game leans heavily into its roots and gives you a real experience based on true progression.  If you can stay patient with it to the very end you'll be rewarded with one of the best RPG's of the generation.  I also recommend playing on Draconian setting ""Super Strong Enemies"" if you really want to lean into the progression and rewarding gameplay even more.  Yeah it can be a bit difficult but you'll walk away 10x more satisfied if you can stick through it.  You can always turn it off down the road, but I suggest just sticking through it unless you're really just impatient.

Anyways, I got a few gripes, but they are overall pretty minor, generally speaking this game is great.  I can easily recommend this one.  Plays nearly flawless on Deck too if you have one.

Basically all the negative reviews are reviewing Square Enix, and not the game, and that is a major problem with Steam reviews now-a-days. Someone gets their pants in a knot due to a publishing decision that don't even impact the game itself, and instead of spending their time reviewing the actual game, which is what the steam review section is for. You end up getting a bunch of brain-dead individuals writing some complaint that has nothing to do with the game, and instead is complaining about the Publishing practice..

The game itself is amazing. I've never really spent much time playing JRPG's in the past, and I've never played a Dragon Quest game, but I am heavily enjoying this game. There is just so much to it, and so much polish put into the game it's crazy. I don't even think I'm half way through the game yet, and I'm 21+ hr's in, and in no way have I started to feel bored. In fact it's quite the opposite. The more I play, the more I want to hop back on to play the next day. The story just continues to pull you in, just like Dragon Ball. (Not DBZ or Super they got a different vibe to them)

If you are a fan of Dragon Ball then I think you'll love this game. It's very light-hearted and deep at the same time. It almost feels like if Dragon Ball, and One Piece combined as far as the worlds and people go, but had a different aspect of what power was. It's simply been a very enjoyable experience so far, and the game just continues to gain depth and anticipation the more you play. 

The turn based Gameplay in this, is one of the best I've ever played. There are also numerous setting to adjust how it plays too. If for instance you needed to go grind a bit of money or levels, you can speed up the combat, and tell everyone to just attack with everything they got, and the game basically becomes an Idle game for awhile. Then you just switch it back and enjoy some challenging boss fights that your now better prepared for. 

I really had an urge to play a turnbased game, and enjoy a fun and awe-inspiring story, which seems to be pretty rare now-a-days(with the major exception of Baldur's Gate 3) and I ended up getting this game sort of on a whim. I'm very glad I did, it's been a pleasure to wake up and play this for a bit every morning with my coffee, before starting my day. 

The game is basically like playing and watching a full 80s/90s anime series. It's the perfect mix between Storytelling, and Gameplay.

The only bad thing I'm left with in hindsight, is the slight depressing sense that I haven't played a Dragon Quest game before now. 

I'd encourage anyone that feels like they'd enjoy anything I mention above, to pick up the game, even off-sale. Totally worth full price, especially in-comparison to all the half-a**ed (under developed) crap that comes out now-a-days.

Just when you think you're right, the game throws in a twist you never would have expected, leaving you surprised and more engaged in the story. As for the content, the game rewards players for exploring by providing small advantages, including potions, recipes, materials, equipment, and more. I never felt the need to farm for materials or experience because the game has excellent level scaling, and most of the materials you need can be obtained simply by progressing through the game. The graphics are great; obviously, they're not as good as the original PC version, but they're still impressive. The story and content in the game make the graphics seem irrelevant. The only problem I have is the significant FPS drops in cities; other than that, everything else is fine.

Regarding the characters, you will never be bored with the cast of party members you are presented with, as they are an integral part of the game experience. They are enjoyable to venture with and have distinct personalities that complement the party and the adventure aspect of the game.

The orchestral soundtrack is wonderful and the fact that you can play the game in 2D speaks to the retro-RPG fanatic in me.

There is some streamlining and altering of the story that left me scratching my head and feeling like I was taking crazy pills as my memory of certains parts of the game clashed with the new version. I also do not care for the updated battle system where turns happen in a semi-real time fashion. Also the decision to make the camera act as if I was playing an MMO was very strange and the camera angles and distance in general was pretty jarring. All in all it feels like the definitive edition does a little too much hand holding and even with the extra content I found myself constantly missing the classic version of DQ XI.

While in the previous Dragon Quest games you mostly had to imagine how the game world would look like in more ""true to life"" graphics, creators managed to bring those imaginations into reality with good graphics and a beautiful and unique art-style. The locations are also well crafted, each one having its own ""individuality"", key characters and story/events related to them. You could just savor the landscapes and city/town atmosphere for hours long.

The characters also contributed to the game's immersion. Characters' designs, their backstories, their development throughout the story; all of this played a major part in making the game shine. There were some developments that I'd hoped to happen, but they didn't. And that is fine, since it didn't ruin the game or the enjoyment at all. It only made the experience better.

The story is truly another impressive aspect of DQ11. The introduction and the further developments were well done. I was never tempted to quit the game because I was bored, but only because it was time for sleep. Attention to the details brought the storytelling to a whole other level, compared to previous iterations (which were limited from a technical point of view). The characters played a vital role in making everything connect and encourage the players to keep asking themselves questions and inventing scenarios in their heads, only to have some captivating plot twists or shocking revelations that only elevate the complexity and enjoyment of the story.

And what is Dragon Quest game without good soundtrack? This time they nailed the music perfectly, again. Town/city, ""overworld"", battle, all of these had incredibly beautiful soundtracks. I'm gonna listen to this soundtrack for a long time. 

Dragon Quest 11 didn't meet my expectations. It exceeded them! I am grateful to the developers for such epic experiences in all the previous series and now in Dragon Quest 11 as well.",1698340243,1698340243,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]TL;DR[/h1] 
Gooreat game that oozes charm. DQ XI is a contender for a jelly adventure on any list that will stick with you for a while. It glibbers with the power of the past, yet it is not a master of Nu’Un.

[h1]Lets talk Dragon Quest[/h1]
“Dragon Quest has somewhat of a legacy” would be the understatement of the day. The problem:
Its power and might are somewhat limited to Japan and only the roots reached the west. 
But how popular is DQ in Japan? Everyone knows it. Dragon Quests power reached a level that the series is too big to fall and will always remain relevant. 
Two games are the reason for this:
Dragon Quest 3, a legendary game, that cemented JRPGs are their own genre and casted a shadow that is still felt to this day. And Dragon Quest V which is just a masterpiece (that I still need to play). The other games range from great to amazing. 
Dragon Quest does not fail, it only varies between levels of success. 
There is no Dragon Fantasy XIII: Slime Returns, the series is just too focused and consistent to make such a mistake. 
And that makes Dragon Quest so enjoyable, you know that you are going to have a good time. 
Japan knows the concept of Karōshi (death through overworking), yet this dark place has created a fundamental piece of relaxing atmosphere and genuine happiness which got captured in a game.
[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/box5k3/dragon_quest_helped_me_when_i_needed_it/] The power of Dragon Quest at its best.[/url]

[h1]“DRAGON QUEST® XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age™ - Definitive Edition”[/h1]
Why should I play this one (and I am also asking why the title is so long, I feel like I lose life time whenever my brain recalls that game by name)?
The simple answer: this is the only mainline game that is on Steam and also it is quite good. 
DQ XI is a spiritual successor to DQ VIII that has been popular for years and builds upon that, A clearly defined cast with strong personalities, lavish landscapes which are pretty detailed for their time and a long overarching story that has been divided into multiple arcs.
The structure of DQ XI is simple, but extremely effective. Over the course of the game everything will become extremely familiar and the lively animations of the monsters, places and music manage to sell this world as a genuine place that has its own logic and rules.

[h1]Individual Qualities[/h1]
Dragon Quest XI captured me like a net, I did not sleep, I needed answers and to see how it will play out. The individual pieces of DQ XI are so strong that there is almost no downtime on anything, they managed to make (almost any) second count. The character arcs are strong and meaningful which has been supported by massive amounts of dialogue. “Show me, don’t tell” is an important rule for telling stories, but games are extremely long at times and talking to someone establishes the character over time. DQ XI intends to build these people, the rules they follow and how they will behave if confronted with a problem. The game succeeded to say the least.
The other thing that Dragon Quest is known for:
Grinding. I hate Grinding at times and think it is a boring filler task that nowadays only serves as a background activity, if you are casually talking with someone else. XI toned that way down, grinding is mostly optional and in total I grinded for maybe 5 hours to reach the max level. 
If you are stuck at a certain boss that really wrangles you: Thee shall sail to the east and find the precious metal and slaughter it with ferocious will. 
Not to forget:
Especially the visual design and animations of the enemies should be praised for their level of detail and vibrant moves.

[h1]“Negatives”[/h1]
DQ XI has no distinct weaknesses, but it has lackluster areas.
The combat is relatively simple and most of the time reducing the enemy defense and buffing your attack stats should be enough for most encounters.
Some sections drag a little and feel like mandatory concepts which are needed, but will not surprise or even interest the player.
Another thing that I disliked was the character of Jade. The green clothed designated sexy character of the game is not really well developed most of the time. She has like the lowest stake of anyone/the least development, yet the game features her for too long (relatively).
The action sequences (“in game rendered fighting scenes) are visually not that impressive and feel tacked on. Most outcomes are extremely obvious and anti climatic.
And for the love of god: Change the OST in the settings from Synth to Orchestra. While DQ XI lacks variety (relative to its length), the orchestra versions of the songs are pretty good.
Last but not least: This is a version of the game that includes more content, but it was ported from the Switch. Visually it is less impressive than the PS4 version, but the quality of life changes are just too good to miss out. It is the best version of the game, but not “definitive”. It will take a lot of time till mods will replace the models to improve the quality. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
DQ XI is a superb experience and one of best JRPGs in recent years. It offers everything the past DQ titles did, but adds in many aspects. While Square Enix played it extremely safe, DQ XI is more than worthy of its title and finally made the series a staple in the west (at least I hope so).

When I started playing I was not a fan of the game. The gameplay controls are terrible if you don't have a controller and don't immediately change them, but even if you do change them, the controls on screen still stay as the original controls so you have to figure out what the X button and Y button are lined up to in your control scheme. That was very annoying and took a while to adjust to. Additionally, the story starts off incredibly slow and it took until you gain the full party (minus the last one, which you don't get until Act 2) to start getting into it all. It doesn't help that they give you the worst companion, story wise, to start off with. 

However, once you get the full Act 1 party and eventually when you get to Act 2 (At least after the fish simulator), then the game really starts and you get very into it. In Act 2, I was fully committed to the game and was actually considering 100%ing it. However, after Act 2, you have the option to go for the true ending in Act 3 which is completely worth it. This is where the final bit of complication comes in. Act 3 is fun and very challenging, but I would argue too challenging at times for the average player. There is a lot of tedious grind to get everything you need, and even after the final boss, there are still 2 more secret ""final bosses"" to find and defeat. It felt like a chore in Act 3 and I would have to say that my max fun happened in Act 2 and the beginning of Act 3. 

Nonetheless, this is a very fun game and well worth playing it. The story is interesting and a throw back to the old days of playing Dragon Quest as a kid. If everything I said didn't turn you away, then you will like this game, and I fully recommend it. If it gave you pause then I recommend waiting for a good sale. And if it is something you hate then give the game a pass. However, I would still recommend everyone to give it a try, it is a good game.",1695512357,1695512357,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon Quest XI is hands-down the best JRPG I have ever played. Not my favorite, but the one I perceive as the absolute best.
If you are new to JRPGs this is an exceptional entry point, and if you're a veteran there is plenty of JRPG bliss to be found.

Highlights;
-The Dragon Quest artstyle is timeless, and gives so much personality to all the people and creatures of the world
-The graphics make me want to lick my screen in some places
-The story was done so incredibly well. I really want to stress this too. A JRPG with a great but NOT convoluted story. Most often it's one or the other, DQXI does both. Blue Dragon was kinda ehhhh with it's story at places, and Bravely Default did get a bit wacky at some parts.
-The characters are all well fleshed-out and engaging. Veronica's English VA can be a touch grating, but I played the game dubbed, another option the game allows. Otherwise the English voice acting is quite good all around, and notably Rab's English VA brings me to tears with his performance.
-The gameplay is like a pizza. It's simple on paper, but then they just add more and more toppings and it's just so engrossing. Suddenly your dinner isn't just dough and tomato sauce, you have a full-blown meal. The gameplay should* be too simplistic, but it's really so much more.
-Party Members are numerous, varied, and feel like a team. You can switch them out even in battle, and it feels like they compliment each other well, while all still providing their own utility.
-With the varied party members, your Hero can also be built in a variety of ways. Jack of All Trades? Two-Handed Terror (my first choice)? Master of Magic? You can build him in particular a myriad of ways.
-The world feels organic and it's fun to traverse. You have a jump button that actually works, and you often find interesting mounts. Not to mention getting a ship and the FREEDOM to get your ass kicked
Minor Gripes
-Personally I have never liked the magic in Dragon Quest games. Most everything that doesn't target all enemies feels underpowered. Frizz, and Zam feel the absolute worst so meh
-Stealing is so damn annoying in the early-mid game. I didn't even bother my first playthrough and I didn't miss *too much
-Silent Protagonist. Feels really bad having all of these interesting characters, some of which are VERY close to you, and not being able to do much besides nod and smile like a dork. And let's not even mention younger you
-Music feels very *good*. It's all orchestrated now (thank God), but Dragon Quest in general doesn't wow me with the music all too much. It fits really well and there are some stand-outs, but compared to other JRPG OSTs like Bravely Default, Blue Dragon, Persona, and Final Fantasy, it doesn't do it for me.

Regarding the graphic, if you wish to tinker a bit, you can mod the game, and ultimately, you can make it look better than the original, while also running it at an increased frame rate (1440p 144hz on my system (3080))
The collection you need to install is called Project Rebuild, and is available on nexus website.

The game play is better, because you can set the battle to fast or ultra fast mode, which is incredibly useful in itself. The also removed some bonus content from the original (crossbow mini-game removed, the gift from the start are different, and a lot more things) The way you can forge is also different, you can forge from almost everywhere, you can also buy missing materials from the forging menu. They mostly updated the game from a game play perspective (this is debatable and subjective) but I like it more than the original.

TLDR : worse graphic, can mod to make it look better, better game play, so overall a very good game, but has it flaws when played vanilla.

Review Update: Since I first reviewed the game, I have played the game another 2 times and am now on my third. The game as I said in my first review is very good. My personal favorite single player game of all time. It doesn't do anything revolutionary per say but it does everything well and with draconian settings each play-through the game-play changes (though not drastically). What once may have worked in one play through doesn't always work in another, making sure the player has a strong understanding of each character and can make characters underutilized in one go around become a staple in another. This keeps subsequent play-throughs not necessarily fresh but with a new feel in strategy and mindset. The story like the game itself isn't game changing but is solid. There is a specific scene where you learn of something and it makes me cry every time, maybe I am just a sob but the story though cliche at times has a strong sentiment to it, mostly due to the cast of characters you meet and adopt into your party. If you are looking for a good turn based jrpg with solid foundation in every aspect DQ11 is the game for you.

***

[World building] - 9/10

***

[Music] - 9/10 I just wish there was more of it.

***

[Combat & Leveling] - 5/10. It's functional. However, it's just not as enjoyable as it could be. 

() Combat is turn based, & it is often long, tedious, & boring so much so that when grinding levels in the late game (Act 2), I set the game to fast auto attack. Sometimes, I was so bored of the combat that I would deliberately run around or away from the monster to avoid fighting it. Additionally, I would use Holy Water so that the weaker enemies would run away.

() When entering combat (in most cases), you may try to flee but often you won't be able to. The game states that the enemy has cut off your escape. I dislike being forced into combat just because an enemy gets within a certain radius or touches me (however it works). As I stated above, combat is boring.

() The game is grindy. For the first 100+ hours of the game, I fought nearly every monster in view & completed every quest in Act 1&2. However, I was often not strong enough especially for the big boss fights. Because of this, I had to grind out levels so that the boss fights wouldn't be impossible. Even so, the main character would either frequently die, wipe out with the party, or die & I would be left with only 1 party member (not the luminary) to finish the fight if at all.

() The game could do a better job at teaching players mechanics, how to use their abilities effectively, explaining buff & debuff symbols or using text as an alternative, explaining abilities & effectiveness against various enemy types, indicating when a boss is immune to a certain type of attack, & with communicating strategies or indicators to improve one's chance at defeating a boss (especially on lower difficulties).

() Because of the lack of communication as you level, you will often have to research via the Internet for boss strategies, explanation of abilities, explanation of gear & weapon bonuses, for quest help, & more.

() As you level up, your list of abilities become bloated & many of them are obsolete but still remain on your list. However, they may still be used if you are low on ""mp"" or for variety or RP sake.

() MP & Health do not auto regenerate between combat. You have to either rest or use abilities or potions. This is not a con by itself. However, with enemies respawning quickly, & if having to go through a bunch of them in an area to reach your objective you'll either have to rest more often or take extra potions with you.

() The ability trees are not balanced. Some trees are effective & more enjoyable. Others are weak. If you play a ""weak"" tree, you will die more often & or take longer in combat.

() The big boss fights seem unbalanced with the boss being able to easily wipe the party or kill off the Luminary. Just to be clear, I'm not against hard boss fights. I'm not against dying & starting over. I've played many LoZ games & others & I have won many boss fights. All I'm saying is the boss fights should be more fun, intuitive, & heroic.

() When you start combat, the game spawns additional enemies that were not present before initiating combat. So you'll not only have to fight a group of enemies but when you are done with combat, you will probably have to fight another aggroed enemy that is less than a meter away which also spawns another group of enemies that also weren't previously present in the game world & so on & so forth. Why couldn't I just fight all the visible enemies at once within a certain radius of the player instead?

() While completing the ""Tockle"" / 2d content, there are invisible enemies on the map which will attack you. This means that every x tiles (in 2d mode), you will be forced to fight monsters. Why can't these monsters be visible on the screen in 2d mode? It just makes the ""Tockle"" missions more tedious. That said, ""Holy Water"" does solve this problem.

Note: the ""Tockle"" missions are also not intuitive & may require one to look up a guide to complete. I know it's suppose to be retro. However, I would have preferred these to have been done in 3D.

() The monsters that you slay respawn too quickly. It makes the game less heroic this way & like you aren't making a difference in the world.

() The pep combat system is interesting as an idea but executed terribly. It's especially terrible when having to grind it out as part of a quest, & especially when having to wait or save it up (but can't do anything other than defend/waste your turn) while waiting for other characters within your party to pep up.

() Personally (for me as a player), real time combat would have been more enjoyable & better than turn based for this game or a combat system with pause capability similar to Dragon Age Origins. However, this is just a matter of preference & by itself is not necessarily a true fault/con as many JRPGs though not all are turn based games. Even so, the game could have made their turn based combat more enjoyable.

***

[Controls] - 5/10.

() The game is made for a controller. Though keyboard & mouse work great, some controls don't seem to work at all or at least work better with a controller (ex: accessing abilities and menus). Although you may rebind the keyboard controls, some if not all of the controller keys can't be rebound.

() To exit out of the game, you have to press Alt F4 on the keyboard. Why is there no proper exit out of the game menu?

***

[Other]

() NPCs & NPC designs tend to repeat over & over throughout the game. Nevertheless, this is how it was for LoZ Ocarina of Time & I still love that game to this day. Therefore, I don't fault DQ11 for this much. Even so, DQ11 was released 19 years after Ocarina & more years later if you count the release of the 11s version. Note: computers & game consoles have a lot more disk space & RAM these days compared to a N64.

() Outfits & gear for companions should have been more practical & realistic & less sexualized. After all, DQ11 is supposed to be a T rated game for kids. However, if comparing this game to other JRPGS, thankfully DQ11 seems to be more conservative by comparison. Even so, this doesn't mean that they couldn't have made the game more kid friendly in terms of outfits.

() The forge crafting could be improved. Ex: able to buy all ingredients, more fairness / no randomness, with improved organization & gear comparison.

() The casinos are a pointless & tedious grind. They will waste hours of your real world time all so that you may earn tokens which you may use to buy items for your characters.

() Those who bought the original DQ11 on Steam (especially a year or less before the release of DQ11s) should have received a complimentary / free upgrade to the 11s version or alternatively a large discount. However, they did not. If they had done this, & also not removed the old version with better graphics from the Steam store, I think people would have been happier.",1637979126,1694863770,True,1,0,0.521801590919494629,0,True,False,False

The characters are actually interesting and well written, and every usual JRPG story stereotype you would expect, such as the ""choosen one must destroy evil lord"" trope for example, even all that stuff they pull it off really well, it's a pleasant story. Each city you will visit will make you feel like you're actually travelling the entire world instead of going from a village to another where everything and everyone look the same.

It's like padding for xp/gear grinding as the storyline becomes less interesting since it's basically just an even more basic version of the first two acts and your companions become less interesting because through a story mcguffin at the end of act 2 they lose a great deal of the character development of act 2. What bothered me greatly as well was the severe rehashing of old areas I've already gone through and the same old monsters, even during content that's supposed to be new.

All in all though all of the above doesn't take away from the fact that when it comes to gameplay I think this is the best Dragon Quest game I've played yet and most certainly the prettiest. Can't go wrong with Toriyama's style. My previous favourites in the series - Dragon Quest VIII & V definitely have the edge on the story department though. Something else that gives this game extreme bonus points for me is its DRM-freedom. Excluding downloading and installing the game you won't need Steam at all.

DQXI is mechanically sound. I didn't encounter any bugs. It's well assembled and fine-tuned. It offers a traditional 2D style of Gameplay, if that's your bag. The 3D mode is pleasant looking.

The only flaw in this entire package is Tockles. Finding the Pastwords and going to Tickington. Traversing the different connected chapters and clearing those 2D only quests. It's annoying. They aren't difficult, but they are tedious...and there's no fun to be found within the Tickington quests. The [i]Saviour of the Tockle's Scriptures[/i] exists?

What Dragon Quest XI does is present a charming world filled with fun characters, and it gives you the tools to see this world in a satisfying way.  Sure, it's not the most complex.  Sure, it's not even all that difficult.

But is it fun?  Is it satisfying?  Yeah.  Absolutely, without a doubt.

It even manages to do things that surprised me.  There's a couple twists in there that I wouldn't really expect a more standard RPG to do.  Also, Sylvando's entire character.  What a shockingly excellent storyline.

The combat is shallow. All boss fights follow a loop of buff your main damager, attack, and heal. Non-boss encounters are just clicking the attack button, which is whatever.

The world is surface deep. Locations are pretty to look at, but offer little reward for exploration.

Characters in this are what i thought a unique character would be if i was 5 and never played an rpg, minus like 2-3. Also, worst of all, not every armor piece has unique models, unlike in DQIX, SENTINELS OF THE STARRY SKY. Thats just sinful.

The story is about as interesting as a glass of water. Its just a generic dark vs light plot

The story gets sidetracked into what feels like filler content every few steps. There is almost no progress towards your goal at all, instead you must help a lonely mermaid find love, or a prince scam his people into thinking he's better than he is. These plot lines last a long time and I did not enjoy any of them. Every time one was over and I thought we'd finally make progress on the plot, some other dumb side story shows up.

The music is terrible. This is one of if not the worst OSTs I've heard in a game. Every single track grates on my ears and there is no variety. The Definitive Edition redid the soundtrack orchestrally instead of MIDI, but that does not save the compositions. Having played both versions, Definitive is only very slightly better.

Usually I'm a big fan of turn based games but this is not a good one. It's the absolute most basic Final Fantasy I combat system. There is no ATB, so there is no threat. If you're at all good at RPGs you will fly through this one. 

The only two things I was enjoying during my playthroughs were the voice acting, and the art style. It's a pretty game, although downgraded from the base edition to fit on switch. On top of that all of the different accents for the characters were fun.

Overall probably my least favorite RPG I've played, at least in recent memory. Won't be touching Dragon Quest for a while.

 [b] Dragon Quest XI S [/b] is a game that is as strange as it is charming. As complex as it is simple. A game that sticks to its series' 30 year-old roots and doesn't shy away with doing so. Every aspect from the visuals to the story is exactly what you'd expect from a modern entry of a legendary long-standing series such as this.

[b] Series Consistency [/b]
 Dragon Quest XI S stands out when compared to the modern entries of some other long-running legendary video game franchises. Not in terms of quality mind you, but with [b] consistency [/b]. So many franchises go on for so long to the point where they forget about why they were beloved in the first place and instead change the series formula drastically and forgoing staple series quirks in an attempt to sway the modern mainstream audience and to act as the video game equivalent of [i] Oscar bait [/i].

 That is why even though Dragon Quest XI S is a big budget, AAA, Unreal 4, massive Japanese console game, this entry still prides itself over all the retro bells and whistles that the 10 previous main titles have established from the past several decades. The game takes all the series staples such as the turn based combat, characters, story, music, and [b] heart [/b], and used the modern hardware capabilities to make them shine brighter than ever. Rarely compromising on anything presented to the player.

[b] Technicals [/b]
 As previously mentioned, the game was developed using Epic Game's Unreal Engine 4. And Dragon Quest XI S is one of the best Japanese games that make use of it. The engine's capabilities lend well to this title's overall art-style and lighting. Never once do the semi-realistic environments ever distract from cartoon-y designs of all the humans and monsters.

 Speaking of which, Akira Toriyama returns to lend his blessing for the character designs of Dragon Quest XI S. Never have the characters and monsters looked as clean and expressive as they do in this game. And to make them stand out more, the game has lent them fantastic voicework from a full cast of talented voice actors. Not just from the accents, but certain characters way of talking from others also help to establish a vast world full of cities that have developed with their own personal histories.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
 As you may have pieced together so far, Dragon Quest XI S can be described as a retro and classic JRPG with the coat of paint of a modern big title. Everything from the way its story unfolds, the overworld exploration, party recruitment, and combat flow screams traditional JRPG. So in turn, anyone familiar with the genre can hop into this game without much problems.

 The game being traditional isn't a minus at all as what I have learnt from the having beaten it is that as long as the execution of a game's features are done expertly, you can still get away with providing the players a fun and memorable experience. And Dragon Quest XI S excels at that, more-so than other dedicated retro callback games.

[h1] || All in all... || [/h1]
 How they even got away with making this games still baffles me. Dragon Quest XI S is the perfect example of sticking your guns and your dedicated fans, while providing meaningful tweaks and improvements to the series experience that helps it stand shoulder to shoulder with other excellent games of today.

After playing Dragon Quest XIII on the PS2 and Dragon Quest IX on the DS, this game brought back so many memories about them. I like how the Dragon Quest series has its own unique style, gameplay mechanics and soundtracks. These are very well integrated into the game.
I remember so many things like the soundtracks, sounds, items and the enemies from other titles of the series.
But this game isn't just for nostalgic fans of the series, it's also for new players. 
Each title in the series has its own story that is unrelated to the others, so you can start this one without knowing the other Dragon Quest stories.
This title has a lot to offer. The feature where you can switch from 3D to 2D style is something I haven't seen in any other game. The story and characters feel so alive and interesting. There is so much to explore through the adventure, like visiting different places, dungeons or the sea and the fascinating main story.
The story has a lot of depth and the quests in this game have been very well designed. The side quests are not superfluous, because there aren't many side quests, so they can't overwhelm you. But you can always find 1 to 3 that you can do, or some harder side quests that you have to spend some time on.
It has many details, like sailing across the sea or riding on different mounts through the huge world.
It combines the main points of many titles in the Dragon Quest series in one game, just as you can play scenes from other titles in the series in this game too.
You can collect mini medals for great rewards, just like in the previous titles.

You play the hero, a silent protagonist running through a standalone story that is easy to follow with a few neat little twists that did catch me by surprise and kept me coming back for more. And by more, yes the story is long. Best not to get this game if you want to play for 30hrs and be done with it. At 30hrs, the story is only just warming up and more twists are to follow. There is an illusion of choice in the game such that yes/no options have little bearing besides extra/different dialogue. To my knowledge, there is no content that can be missed due to story progression. 

The game difficulty is reasonably low, there’s no significant cognitive investment required. My go-to game when I'm feeling tired. I haven’t felt a need to grind in this game. The two occasions I was met with defeat, it required a quick investment into gear, or skill respect. You do need to battle for experience to fight bigger and strong monsters, but in general, you can see the monsters on the world and pick and choose your battles. The loop is one of defeat monsters, get gold and get materials, then either craft or buy new gear at the next town to then defeat harder monsters while filling out a skill tree to bring new character buffs and skills into battle. If you put the game down for a few months, there’s a handy recap to remind you of where the story was going, and if ever stuck, it’s possible to talk to the party members who will give some clues as to where you should go. 

The world is culturally diverse with immediately identifiable real-world cultures. There’s some adult style humour and references, but nothing too obvious. Character models are nice, especially with the monsters, and the artists used the full extent of the colour palette to create a bright, charming world. Yes, that also means “harder” monsters are just recolours of the easier models, and that’s fine. It didn’t feel overdone or cheap.

The good:
Production values overall are stellar. Everything looks great and runs smooth as silk.
Fantastic voice acting (on the Japanese side, anyway).
The Toriyama character designs look fantastic. And the characters themselves are all memorable (though admittedly tropey).
The world looks great, has a variety of biomes and feels sufficiently inhabited (though not quite reaching the immersion of the Trails series).
Ultra wholesome story sprinkled with harmlessly bawdy humor like huff-puff and Sylvando's over-the-top flamboyance.
I finished the main quest in 66 hours (on easy), and that was really the sweet spot.  And no ""fake-out endings"" (I'm looking at you Tales series).
There is post-game content if you want it (maybe I'll try it later).
Classic turn-based combat.  Love that I have complete control over how automated I want things to be; I usually put most of my companions on Fight Wisely until I got to crucial battles where I took control of everyone to strategize.

The meh:
The symphonic music is simply phenomenal BUT there just isn't enough variation in tracks.
This is a very on-rails RPG.  I quite enjoyed the linear nature of it, but others may wish for more freedom.
This IS another ""chosen one"" story, so you'll have to deal with that trope.
You being the ""silent protagonist"" is just kind of silly.  It really limits the story, and doesn't allow for choices that could lead to alternate endings or romance options.
Things did begin to drag in like the last 15 hours or so.  Yes, it did provide some story beats for your companions that kind of have to pay off, but I really had to soldier through them till I got to the end.
You do need to do a tiny bit of grinding if you don't want to be guzzling items in the late game.  Pro-tip: whenever you are in a new city, check the armor and weapons store.  If you don't have enough cash to upgrade everyone, go outside the city and grind till you do.  It usually only takes like 20 minutes or so, and you'll usually be able to get money and level up to where you're supposed to be to tackle the next questline.
The final fortress is kind of anti-climactic; it's basically an exercise in sneaking by 80% of the monsters to get to the final bosses. A couple more mandatory mini-bosses (with save points) would have been a bit more satisfying, I think.
The translation is (ahem) very loose.  If you don't speak Japanese, you will never know, but I'm just saying.  That said, kudos to the localization team for their inventiveness.

The bad:
This really needed separate inventories for crafting items and consumables.
Although it's not realistic, I think it would have simplified things for there to be one item bag for the party. But that's just me backseat game-designing.

The verdict:
This is a rousing, old-fashioned JRPG masterpiece. Smash every pot, follow every sparkle, check every closet, read every (red) book.",1688981616,1688984325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well,

This is my first time with Dragon Quest series and wow, what a game!

Several npcs/enemies/main_characters remember specific DB and DBZ characters, the point is not just the Toriyama style.
It's a real tribute for all fans of Toriyama's mangas/animes.

Highly recommended for all RPG players that never tried Dragon Quest Series!

I have finally purchased the game again on my PC and will now play it again... If they could resolve the problems in this edition such as not having it based on the switch port, and/or if these features in this edition such as the orchestral music, Japanese voiceovers, etc could be added into the original game, or if players that bought the original game like myself could receive an upgrade path, discount, or refund after buying this, then my score would be much higher.

I'll try to revise this review if I feel differently after completing this run...

Anyway, I enjoy this copy of DQ11 as it has orchestral music from DQ8, and I can finally listen to Japanese voiceovers and not have to listen to the imo terrible voices of the English game which contributed to me hating the character development, plot points, and story on my first playthrough. I'm wondering if the names of places and people were actually revised and it was a translation and not localization if it would also help me feel much better. I really did not like the story and was not attached to characters on my first go. Notably, I still hate the design of the hero, especially as he is so bland, has no real identifying features or personality, and is quite androgynous. It was certainly nice to use Japanese voices and hear that they mainly just call him hero and not some pretentious thing like luminary as least so far.

Gameplay wise, it's fun. I still like turn based rpgs. It's nice being able to control a camera or not in the battles, and it's nice being able to change speeds. I can see some design elements when playing that remind me that it, at least in the beginning, is not an open world type and is quite linear and uses several hallways. I remember not realizing this on my first playthrough in 2018, but right now, I really despise some areas as they look great visually but have nothing there or are just hallways. I'm reminded of FFX and FFX-2 when in these situations. 

I haven't tried the 2D mode but will probably spend a longer run again with 2D if I am still captivated or motivated to finish this run in 3D because I remember I really didn't like some characters or plot points and found a lot of it to be boring. It's hard to hate this game as I loved being able to freely create a character in DQ9, and the worlds in DQ8 were so fun. I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous games, especially 4, and I hope that 12 will be a much better entry than this one.

Certainly, this game is fun to play and excels at being a visually pleasing turn based rpg. It's just not able to live up to its hype, legacy, or what it should even be doing right now. I would recommend it if you've never played it, but I would advise you that it may become a monotonous grind at some point, and you really might not enjoy it. The characters are hit or miss in my opinion as well. I definitely do not recommend buying it if you already have DQ11 unless you are looking for a better experience than what you have, do not want to patch anything, do not have a switch, and do not mind purchasing again. Please buy it at a discounted price though and do not give SquareEnix more money than necessary. I really wanted to just sail the high seas for this, but I support Dragon Quest and feel obligated to buy each entry. 

Rating - 2/5

After playing for about 20 hours on the ""new"" one, I definitely agree with my comments above about the voices and the translation. If it was not a localization but a translation, or I had the option to play in Japanese alone, it would be great. For example, I find Greg to be a better fit for Hendrick, and it's just nice having the hero simply be called the hero. Additionally, It's amazing being able to hear the voice actor that played Kiryu in Yakuza and one of the villains in Tales of Symphonia play one of the main villains in this game. It's a shame the copy of the game I already nearly completed did not have Japanese voices as it definitely had a higher resolution and better quality cut scenes. Maybe I could see myself giving it one more point, but I'm still frustrated I had to buy this again...",1688284590,1688497465,False,96,15,0.533803701400756836,0,True,False,False

I will say it wasn't my favourite part of the game - The fights are much longer and the interface that's mid makes it less enjoyable to play. The overall game is otherwise super fun, the crafting is pretty fun as well and the game itself has some component making it kind of difficult. Basically you kind of have to be a ""Google gamer"" To complete the later Side quest which are a bit more complicated and grindy to finish. I finished with ease the last bosses at level 60-67.

Like many here based on the reviews, my first DQ game was 8 and it's probably my favorite game. So seeing all these people saying it's much better than 8, I was excited. They are either trolls or retarded.
-Party members: too many of them and mostly boring. Veronica and Serena are your typical women portrayed by japs, where one is passive and the other very acid and moody. I dont think Erik and Hendrick even know each other. Probably, if you put them together in fights they might ask who is who. Rab is the only interesting one, and the only one with good character development. Either way, after the time traveling shit (lol, time traveling is always a good idea guys, never created plot holes) a big part of the game and character development gets erased.
-World setting: boring. The protagonist was pretty much a tourist, visiting Italy, Spain, Japan ( they all speak in haiku, so quirky so funni). No place was interesting or felt special. Even a town like Farebury had more character than all of these. To make things even worse, you have to come to these cities multiple times because now a new door or area is unlocked. In 8 you visited one city twice, Alexandria. Everything else was special and evolving: Ascantha changing after you deal with the king's sorrows, Pickam a town full of romanians, Baccarat that has the casino and the story of the family that owns it, Argonia changes when you come back, unlocking the bazaar with many incredible items and making this game/world feel lively and realistic. In 11 you get a city where people talk in haikus, nice.
-Difficulty: DQ isn't known for being hard, just grind some levels and gold and you are fine. But here it's even easier. Campfires. They are everywhere. At least in tough and long dungeons you had to manage HP and MP because you might go unprepared against the boss at the end of it. Here? Just rest at the campfire, reset all HPs and MPs and might as well save your progress. Absolutely insane. And I don't care about Draconian mode. Developers fixing their mistakes by creating tougher modes just by changing how much damage a monster deals isn't good game design.
-Economy: One cool thing about RPGs is money. Farm gold so you can buy better gear. When you visit a new city, the first thing you do is visit the shops to improve your equipment. Here? Just use forge. Apart from that cat outfit for Veronica and some equipment for forge recipes, I never bought anything.
-Time traveling: lol.
-Sylvando: looool.
-Laziness: The S version on PC looks shit. I had to download ini files to improve the graphics because even at everything at max was blurry.
-Laziness 2: The last, secret, boss is a reskinned version of a previous one. It's gold now and deals a bit more damage wow. Imagine if Der Richter in FFX was a different version of a previous monster you defeated.

Shit game that is liked by weebs (just search fanarts of this game, its just veronica (it's not pedophilia by the way, shes 20 or something ahahahaha weebs) and jade) or DQ fans that are scared of not seeing another game come to the west. Maybe previous games are better, but as seen with KH still being on Epic store, Square doesn't like money, so no mainline games on steam to play.

Act One and Act Two definitely deserve a perfect 10/10 rating.  The first two chapters are so good that this game truly is the most enjoyable JRPG I have ever played.  Unfortunately, the issues arise in Act Three. Due to its terrible ending, I can only give Act Three a 7/10 rating. Overall, Act Three isn't bad if we don't consider the ending, but it is still quite disappointing compared to the previous chapters.

I guess the developers didn't have enough time for Act Three, as it feels somewhat incomplete and hastily done. 

Firstly, the side story in Act Three is much shorter and lacks the same level of immersion compared to the previous chapters. For example: If we look at [spoiler] Miko's quest at Hotto [/spoiler] and the [spoiler] mermaid's story with Kainoa [/spoiler], they are just much shorter and lacking details. They simply can't compare to what we get in Act 2.

Secondly, the game no longer guides you through the entire world in Act Three. I constantly had to search for guides and walkthroughs on the internet to ensure I didn't miss any important side quests.

Thirdly, the terrible ending.  [spoiler]  After defeating the final boss, the hero decides to give Serenica the sword so she can travel back to the past. It's like, WTF? Doesn't that mean Serenica will reset the timeline and erase everything we did throughout the entire game? The plot here simply doesn't make any sense at all. The developers could have allowed Serenica to go to heaven and reunite with her loved ones, instead of erasing all our hard work. [/spoiler]

Finally, at the very end of the Act 3 ending, there is a noticeable difference. In Act 2, you actually get to see where all your party members go through these nice little cutscenes, which is very satisfying. However, in the Act 3 ending, those cutscenes are no longer shown. The party members simply disappear! This is the most unacceptable aspect I have encountered in the entire game. You don't get to see all your party members at the end! They just vanish! Damn!

For new players, I still encourage you to play through Act 3. You should at least rebuild your village, complete Drustan's Trials, and get the marriage option. This way, you can achieve a happy ending for your hero and somewhat complete the story plot. By stopping at that point, you will be able to keep all your good memories and hard work on this game. But don't even try to beat the final boss,  as the only thing you will get is disappointment.",1687546422,1687931821,True,0,0,0.433070838451385498,0,True,False,False

I only played the Definitive Edition, and as I understand the story from the originals was incomplete, I have to recommend that one.  The story is fantastic, though the overall goal is fairly standard for this type of game.  However, the road to that goal takes a lot of interesting twists and turns.  I always wanted to see what was going to happen next.  

This can be played it in 3D or 2D format, though I must recommend always leaving it in 3D, as the landscapes are almost universally gorgeous, and the monster models look exactly like the original pixel art brought into 3D.  Great overall art style.

The cast of playable characters is fantastic.  Every character is memorable in some way.  They each have their own fighting niche, and supplement each other well.  They also each have their own sub-stories.  I'm not entirely sure about the grid upgrade system as a gameplay mechanic, but you can eventually fill it out entirely if you want.

It’s a classic fantasy adventure featuring memorable characters, an engaging narrative, and a massive world to save. It’s one of the best the overarching series has to offer by far, and will no doubt get new players interested in seeing much more. Plus, it’ll let you indulge in that retro gaming-hungry side of you that so many new games just can’t quite broach. This is easily the best version to play Dragon Quest XI.

PROS:
✓ All new orchestral score
✓ An engrossing journey filled with memorable characters
✓ Colorful visuals make for a fantasy world that’s great to explore
✓ Engaging turn-based combat that gracefully balances depth and accessibility
✓ New 2D mode is an excellent
✓ Expressive character and monsters designs by Akira Toriyama
✓ Hundreds of hours of content
✓ Engaging story
✓ Still a JRPG masterpiece
✓ The voice acting is great 
✓ New side quests that will challenge the heartiest of DQ veterans 
✓ Plenty of new costumes over vanilla version
✓ Crafting is significantly streamlined with changes to the Fun-Size Forge

CONS:
- A noticeable downgrade in graphics keeps Dragon Quest XI S from looking as sharp as the original
- Not all of the new story content feels consequential
- Added new content should be a DLC to vanilla version (people shouldn't pay twice for almost the same game)

The gameplay is still very much a Dragon Quest game (I played the original AKA ""Dragon Warrior"" on the NES as a kid), with a few new little bells and whistles here and there for quality of life. The protagonist is an uninteresting chosen one, and most of the other characters who join your party are rather cliche or simple, without much of a character arc to speak of. 

The storyline is very much a ""chosen one to save the world"" plot without much in the way of twists or turns, and something happens a long way into the game that splits the party and really throws off the momentum. I only managed to keep going for a few hours after that, but the game just never felt the same after that party split, and most of the locations you visit after that are just revisiting places you've already been, and collecting party members you lost, taking several hours to do so. I had almost the entire team back when I finally quit, but I just became terribly disinterested by then.

While the game has a very basic story and I did get bored and quit, it's still better than much of the entertainment the west has been pumping out of late, so - even without finishing the game - I would still recommend this title to either diehard Dragon Quest fans, oldschool JRPG fans, and even people with some excess money whose curiosity is nagging at them to play this game and see what it's like.",1686880468,1686880468,True,10,0,0.62872612476348877,0,True,False,False

I would strongly recommend anyone this game. Like previous JRPGS that I've loved it has started off a bit slow and seemingly being predictable, but slowly pulls you in to a world that grows on you until you are sad to leave it by the end.
There is a nice attention to detail in the world, and the locations of the world itself being memorable as they are beautiful (the snowy scandinavian area, the venice inspired italian area with gondolas, the hot arabic inspired area, the chinese and japanese areas etc). The characters grow on you which is just as well since the protagonist is a bit underwhelming (and a bit stupid in some scenes). The combat starts off easy but gets hard and quite advanced. The forging minigame is fun and more engrossing than the recipe hunting/cooking minigame that Tales of Arise had, but overall I think if you wanted a JRPG with more mini games of good quality I would suggest ninokuni 2 as that had by far some of the best side games in any JRPG. However I also didn't care so much for the cast of ninokuni 2, but I did care for the cast of DQ11. 
The music is wonderful and though it could have some more variety, some of the tracks are so good that  I find myself listening to the tracks on youtube later. There are two endings in this game (you can choose to go for a 'true' ending if you so wish but can also choose not to and end the game where you are (if you know you know) and I like this a lot as such a move stands or falls on the strength of the writing, and the writing for the most part here is very good. It does have plotholes, but not enough to break immersion or ruin the overall experience. I played this game after finishing Tales of Arise and though both were good, Dragon Quest was better overall. Also I kinda like that Sylvando's personality and the Puff Puff girls triggered work games 'journalists'. Based japanese JRPG ftw :)",1686729584,1686729584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When playing this game sometimes it feels like being back in the '80ies when TV changed the hell out of everything that came from Japan.

as for the game i liked it even though there was a few issues. the fact you get a 3d and 2d version is just nuts even though both feel very different and the first time you swap over takes a bit of getting used to. they could have easily sold both of these or made the 2d dlc and for that i commend them though it still don't excuse what they did to loyal fans. anyway the games weapon system feels a lot like DQ8's. they also have the pep up system something like what 8 did but in here it's random when you get it but on top of giving you a state boost it lets you use team up attacks. there's a lot to do here and you can not out level the some end game bosses. not saying this is a + or - but end game bosses lean a bit to the cheap side though i did beat everything but some took a few tries. i understand this was so players could have a challenge but these fights will teat your skill and gear.

some minor grips i had with the game:
-the game reuses content. it's not really backtracking but you play the world 3 times then a dungeon reuses some of the dungeons. you can skip a lot of the 3rd acts content if you don't mind missing out on the story and the reuse of dungeons is fine i just felt it needed to be said.
-the main character is dumb as hell. mainly the start of act 3 he is a brain fart but i don't want to spoil anything.
-act 3. i like the added content but it's the weakest part of the game. i feel it was done because they are trying to tie up the DQ timeline. this game leads into DQ3 but i also think it leads into DQ4 and possibly another of the miss placed titles.
-i feel like there are to many weapons. yes you don't want to go a long time with the same weapon but replacing them every 10min seems excessive. i would have liked a few of the end game weapons to have had about the same states but with different buffs/debuffs.

if you're a dragon quest fan or into rpg's this is a great game but i just can't give this a thumbs up do to the anti consumer practices it pulled on fans.",1686082853,1686082853,False,5,0,0.491940200328826904,0,True,False,False

Over a year and a half, finally finishing up 11s I can easily recommend it to any JRPG fan new and old. Definitely worth the investment. Streamlines just enough tedious elements known in this genre to not feel like your hitting various roadblocks. It's a very charming romp through a classic fantasy setting with memorable characters and a compelling plot with only a few minor complaints here and there. The music is all solid though I would argue it's the weakest OST of the series, luckily there is a nice music compilation mod that adds various tracks from all of the games so once the main OST gets stale you can spice it up. S version is a graphical downgrade compared to it's original release & does run slightly worse for some reason. Thankfully there are some mods to restore the older higher resolution textures & models. Plus .ini tweaks to make it look as close to the original as possible.

The game stays true to itself with the classic turn-based combat that I can never get tired of. The characters have different backgrounds and very likeable, especially Sylvando. And the characters are designed by Akira Toriyama himself so don't be surprised when someone suddenly turns Super Saiyan God mode in your playthrough. The story is simple yet it keeps my interest in check throughout the 70+ hours I put in this game. A small flaw was that the intro spoiled me with the real look of a character that was supposed to be hidden in the game but nonetheless, the appearance of them in the game still surprised me.

I can sink dozens of hours into running around and talking to every single NPC, taking in all the little fun dialogue bits and connections they all have to each other. I have multiple aspects that will be discussed and dissected in sections :) For the record though, if you already have this game (not Definitive Edition) I would say skip this one, while it adds quality of life additions and a little more content - I wouldn't say its worth buying the game twice.

      The story!! 
If you're a person who loves optimism when it comes to games, you'll love DQXI. Even with its twists and turns, it's Dragon Quests usual balance of dark, mildly existential storytelling with refreshing quips and wholesome moments in between. There's also the wonderful dialogue! Its just, classic dragon quest, and that's just neat :) I personally think that DQXI did an amazing job at making characters lovable and alive, and I absolutely wish that there were more interactions between all the party members. I could replay this game again and again just to relive the endearing storybeats and overall optimistic outlook of the game!!!
      Act 1 and 2 are nearly perfect, developing every character exceptionally well (except for jade, she's relegated to femme-fatale and mostly objectified even in storybeats that exemplify her positive character traits - which is a shame!! a crime!!). If you are attached to/satisfied with how the story wraps up after act 2, it's your choice to continue on with Act 3 - which can be fairly decisive depending on your outlook. However, I personally think that the optimistic message of the game is amplified with it - even though my heart was heavy with the previous character moments and interactions of act 2.

     The gameplay! 
Again, typical Dragon Quest gameplay - with old fashioned manual save states in specific areas and all. While there's autosaves, they may not catch everything - but they're still a great safety net. Combat is also similar to previous installments and other JRPGS, so I can't say anything new about that either. I also find the general quality of life and menu navigating of this game to be pretty good. The open world gameplay is honestly fun, even though there are a few spots of clunky geometry - the amount of interactivity with the world and NPCs is satisfying for me - as well as all the little collectable mini medals. There are also no missables, besides a fun item-doubling glitch you can do (which I did not, because I found out about it after my first run) which is unnecessary/doesn't count unless you REALLY want to maximize your damage.
     Act 1 and Act 2's story pacing coincide nicely with the players natural level gain, although in act 3 there's just a good bit of grinding/strategizing - which wasn't horrendous. Overall, the first two acts can be beat with just intuition and little to no guides (unless you want to find everything) - while act 3 throws a few more endgame hurdles at you, basically like a game reset (with all enemies as hard as they will get) that lets you wander around and complete everything available in the game.

      Sound design and graphics!
It's a pretty game, while its landscape aesthetics aren't groundbreaking or exceedingly mystical and stylized (besides a few beautiful areas like Nautica and Yggdrasil) - the character models are solid. Generally a wonderful (and faithful!) adaptation/extension of the Dragon Quest artstyle. While the lipsync is a little jarring and the animations are a little stiff, their goofiness is charming. The orchestral soundtrack is also stunning, although it tends to reuse a LOT of older soundtracks - with only a few original pieces. Whether or not that's disappointing is up to you. 

 Overall, a step outside of the usual Dragon Quest - but still similar enough to be a comfy experience. I can't help but love this game :)))

Nothing about this game is going to jump out at you as overtly technical.
It's a simple game to play, it has a simple story, But very well  written.
Characters are Enjoyable. The monsters are hilarious and fun.

The writing team for this game. Is top notch. All of the comedy and writing is meant for All ages. And it shows. at no point did I feel this was more a kids game than adults game. It rides the line perfectly.

The combat is challenging if you want it to be, but also simple. There is difficulty settings that can dramatically change the challenge of the monsters your fighting if your the type of player that prefers tough battles with possible losses.

Nothing in this story can be missed or perma-lost. Without adding spoilers. Its Very easy to follow along with, But amazingly it does not feel like the game is holding your hand.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of classic JRPG's or even RPG's in general. If you have a deep seated love for titles like Final Fantasy 10 and 9, 8, 7. I promise you will thoroughly enjoy this game. And it'll trigger all those happy nostalgic memories.

The story comes off at first as simplistic and predictable but after the 2nd Act. it really starts to throw some unexpected curve balls and gets really intriguing and well written even for an adult player to enjoy.

This is as good as any fantasy trilogy I've read on paper.

having been and continuing to play the cursed king for years now on the ol' ps2 i waited until this hit £20 price tag before purchase. i'm not tight with money but i had heard a few things about this that made the lower price worth the punt that the non-sale price made it less worth the risk.

it plays just fine so expense is worth it on the technical front, as this is not a usual bodged steam port.
however, the game itself is annoying in some ways.
 the first character i met who joins as a companion is english voiced by an over actor. it is so fake i had to switch to japanese to bypass it. my gods it was poor. does not even match the character.

then we have a story that just boggles the mind at how simple it is. kids could write it, which would make sense in that, where cursed king was targeted at all ages, this one seems to have been written for youngsters only.
it's just lazy in some places and so far, seems to be a shorter game than the previously mentioned.

to highlight this, i went to a new town to meet someone and instead of a quest route to acquire a much needed object, it was handed to me instantly.my immediate reaction was ""really? that simple?"". there have been other times where the story immediately spoon feeds you explanations before you even have a chance to need one. just lazy writing/game design.

the switch between 3d and 2d is annoying and pointless and just feels like a production cost cutter badly veiled.
hence why i waited to buy. why would i ever pay today's prices for decades old graphics?

the rest of the game is pretty much the same as the rest of the series with a few enemies i have not seen before and though the combat system is not really new, a real bugbear for my gaming buddies, it is nice that all the enemy are visual on land instead of being random. it just needed to step up from the old style of combat as it's already feeling dated.

needed more time on the storyboard to have been a money spinner but an enjoyable addition to the series, just not, i suspect, a favourite.",1683161118,1683161118,True,0,0,0.463040709495544434,0,True,False,False

Yes! I'm from the Xenosaga and Final Fantasy fandom, and my god is this game GOOOD. I avoided Dragon Quest, thinking it was a bunch of RNG bullshit, but DQ... is amazing. Characters feel alive, and child like.
Akin to the classic movies with all the knights in shining armor. It's great. I can highly recommend this game to anyone. If you're sick of FF and want a fresh new take, *play this game*.

I haven't played a Dragon Quest game since the Gameboy Color, but after seeing Hero in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, I just had to give it another go. I was delighted to hear the same level up sound, spell sounds, and see the inclusion of the 2D mode. 

The soundtrack for this game is wonderful. Fully Orchestrated sound tracks will always be better than traditional video game music, but the attention this game brings to it's wonderful score really helps set the tone for entire game. 

The character art is reminiscent of old 90's Saturday morning anime, combined with a charming cast and a cute story, this game does not disappoint. Highly Recommend",1681137723,1681137723,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game comes close to being a parody of the genre, which it is well aware of. It's not so on-the-nose as to get annoying, and at times seems completely oblivious to its own corniness. The game will make fun of genre staples, tropes and stereotypes one moment, then ask you to take the story seriously only seconds later.

For the most part the combination works. There aren't that many jarring tonal shifts, though it may be a bit confusing for people outside Japan. It took me a while to decipher, but my theory is this: the game pokes fun at itself and the Dragon Quest franchise. However, adhering to the stereotypes and cliches found in Japanese media is not part of the joke. To the Western observer it might be easy confuse the two.

Completing the main story took me 130 hours. The demo alone was 20 hours. The latter must be complimented. It is truly a comprehensive free look. They are not afraid to show you what they're selling.

Whether you get 100+ hours out of DQ11 depends on your playstyle. I explored every region, tried to ""collect"" each enemy encounter, spoke to every NPC, found those little secrets all over the maps. Here, the game shines. More often than not there is a reward for exploration. It's one of those ""the game wants me to go left? I better go right first"" type of games.

Even when there is no item or consumable to be found, discovering all the dialogue in the world is a reward in itself. The game is bizarrely well written. When I say that, I mean the quality of the translation. It's better English than most games originally written in English! Maybe I'm just used to fan translations of obscure hentai games, but many Western AAA games have writing that's simple and littered with poor grammar. Not here. It also helps that the flavor text is kept short. Books and NPCs have a few lines each. You aren't suddenly dumped a 1000-word document for searching an item locker. The story can be a bit nonsensical at times, but it's not the fault of the language.

The tone is surprisingly dark. This is not a children's game despite looking like one. There is no graphic violence - hitting someone with a sword causes sparks to fly out. But the game doesn't shy away from topics like death, war, substance abuse and even suicide. There's also a fair bit of ""accepting your fate"" which usually translates to dying with honor. I lost count of all the orphaned children I ran across, some even describing the deaths of their siblings. Yet the monsters that supposedly pillaged these local villages and left the children to starve to death all look like Pokemon. 

The gameplay is what it is. It's open world exploration with four-nibbas-in-a-line combat. You're best to enable the ""extra tough monsters"" setting when starting a new game. I did, and the game was still easy. Some of the areas could be more expansive, but on the other hand there's very little menial backtracking, and a great deal of visual variety in the locations. It's quality over quantity. Which is rare for a 100-hour game.

I did not complete the Tickington extra content. I might come back for them at a later date. Other than that I did most side quests. They have very little to offer beyond fetching an item or killing a certain enemy. Luckily you won't have to go out of your way to complete them. This is a fairly linear game and you're meant to follow the main story line. There is not much decision-making outside of the items and skills you want to equip, or which party members to use in combat.

It should also be noted that the game is exceptionally polished. I had zero bugs, freezes, crashes etc. in the 100+ hours. Every menu feels snappy and responsive. The sound design is excellent. It's just a well made video game, even if the graphics aren't that complex. Which isn't a bad thing. A consistent art style trumps level of detail any day. Oh, and select the Japanese voice acting if that wasn't obvious.

TL;DR It's a good game. You'll probably like it, but don't take my word for it. The demo is free and contains the entire first act of the game.",1637823047,1681087985,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

The localization is astoundingly good with amazing VAs across the board. The story is nice and doesn't go off on any crazy lore dumps or one-offs that derail too hard. Lots of comedy and character, also some heart wrenching moments so you get even more invested.

The combat is your classic turn-based RPG where each character selects their move, does their thing and then move on to the next, which is a big simplification of the combat, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. There's plenty of abilities, spells and equipment that make building characters interesting and I really like how each character is ""locked"" into their archetype where the MC is always going to be a sort of front-line damage and healer or Erik will always be the rogue that does big damage.

I completed the game 100% on steam, beat the final final TRUE FINAL superboss, and I wasn't overwhelmed with the endgame grind like some jRPGs have. EXP grind in this game is probably the easiest I've ever done in any jRPG and it really helps you finish all the endgame content much faster.

As for plot, I was really invested into it. It starts off generic, but it picks up really well - especially once you get to Act II (Out of three acts).

You are the darkspawn, the child of pure evil.

In your quest to darken the corner of every room, you corrupt the sacred traditions and heir to Gallopolis, vandalize a sacred crypt in Hotto, and conspire against the Kingdom of Heliador.

I played and enjoyed all the dragon quests up through 6 or so, and was wondering what they were up to these days... wondering if the series survived the journey to 2020~. I'm gonna say not really.

What this game has is a fairly enjoyable basic anime story and presentation. Characters look nice, there are cute anime characters flipping around, and the lovable slimes and etc are still in the game. I overall like the scenes despite their being totally cheesy. What the game does not have is almost anything else. 

Certain UI stuff that was done better on random super nintendo rps, like comparing equipment without pulling your hair out, are somehow worse in a handful of ways. Personal inventories per character is fine in concept, I think, but the menus for moving stuff around is a hilarious failure that ruins it and creates meaningless chores. SO much about this game is stupidly clunky and does not respect your time. I know there is much more I'm forgetting but I haven't played in a few weeks.

 The challenge available at the point I got to was approximately zero. My grandma could probably get where I did without trying that hard and she isn't even alive. I don't consider the ability to self-limit and add handicaps in a menu a respectable design choice for creating difficulty. No, I don't want to close off several of the game's systems or reduce the experience monsters give me to artificially create more hardship...what the heck. 

I was initially excited about skill trees, then depressed in seeing there is about zero investment at all in any choices you make the entire game because you can spin it around at the drop of a blue slime. There is no reason not to put most everything in the same skill tree because of how it's laid out. Kinda of like ffX sphere grid, which gives you nearly no choices despite looking grand (until very late game FFX with unlocking things). 

Long-term planning is close to totally meaningless. It never really was a part of the classic DQ games, but this game pretends you're making decisions yet none of them matter at all. This is a gross attempt to adhere to modern rpg sensibilties without even trying to make it matter. A check box of character growth and decision making but really just a facade.

Enemies are no threat to getting through a dungeon or across the overworld. Or even if they are, you can walk around basically every single thing you see out in the world and in dungeons. It's really weird. It isn't even that you're sneaking by... you stroll by like a four year old not even watching where he's walking and avoid anything you want to. Why would anyone want to play 2d/classic art mode when it just slows the game down and reintroduces random battles for some reason? It's an entirely different game like this, so it's weird to be able to toggle it and cause more than visual differences. Not only does it make the game weird, it makes getting around take 8 years in comparison. Further the 2d mode battle UI painful to look at, eye straining and all around horrible. Yes worse than in the originals. Being retro doesn't mean everything has to look and function like crap.

Finding items strewn around is never exciting, it's all junk, almost always. Why are you suggesting we walk up to all these shiny pots, with a slow stupid animation, and filling them all with junk? Just remove them from the game and stop wasting my time making me thinking something useful will happen. Do not put literally useless excess crap every six feet, what is wrong with you?

There are not enough songs. Every town has the same song... overworld song doesn't change at least in my 30 hours...really? This really damages an environment and makes it more obvious everything in the game is no different from the rest.

Compared to the originals, this game added so many things. And every single one is time wasting fluff. In the end I played around 30 hours and couldn't stomach the boring gameplay grind any longer. I was interested enough in the storytelling and characters, but every single thing about the rest of the game screams babby's first rpg. It's a little deeper than Final Fantasy Mystic Quest though : )",1678780985,1678829607,False,14,0,0.587058961391448975,2,True,False,False

Not recommended for fans of Dragon Quest 9 (possibly also the other ones).
Not recommended for fans of strategic turn-based combat. Rare in this game.
Kind of sexist: almost all young adult women are sexualised to death

I didn't finish it because it got tedious but I have 55hrs without idle
I had a great time for 35hrs or so.

I wanted: heartcrushing stories, many funny and creative enemie designs, great music, strong party members with creative attacks.

I got: 
-few good stories; those that were good were really enjoyable but they really focused on the main story which isn't as engaging as possible side-stories because the main guy does not communicate or feels feelings in any way. His friends are great, but there's not enough interaction between them. 

-enemies i've already seen in DQ9, many many recolor-and-reuse enemies (in the second half of the game they reuse every enemie once again and add red eyes)

-really good music, yet very few tracks

-the party i wanted, but some spell animations feel less strong than in DQ9. Also there are way too many instances of solo fights, without your party in this game. These don't make any sense to me, because there's no strategie at all. There are ""weak point attacks"" too, which don't make sense either because why doesn't ""metal slash"" do extra damage to a scaleton made out of gold?


This game killed some time and was really enjoyable in the first half, but then it got tedious. Everything takes so long in this game: fighting, menues after fighting, speaking to people (then they tell you to go somewhere else where they too just speak to you and send you somewhere else again). 
Also why is automatic combat turned on from the start? As well as free movement in combat which does nothing?
And why can't I see the clothing I put on ingame. A real shame. Ruined the roleplay for me and it was already done in DQ9, so why couldnt they do it this time.

Really enjoyed the whole game. 

And what's more, unlike most JRPGs that spams you with fan-service and bobas just to sell the game and gain players, this one doesn't have much. It doesn't have much romance and flirting too. IT DELIVERS REAL ADVENTURE, which made me an instant fan.

DQ 11 starts off VERY strong. I still believe that DQ 8 was the best in the series, followed by DQ 9. I feel like DQ 11 is a little bit overrated, but it's not a bad JRPG.

The good: The first act of the game is overall pretty excellent. The combat system is strategic and challenging. The graphics are gorgeous (get the 4K textures mod). The characters are likable. The voice acting is excellent. The story is pretty good. The double combat speed is a lifesaver. In fact, I would never be able to finish this game at default combat speed. Who has time to waste on that??

The bad: The areas start off nice, but become boring and a little bit corny. I don't mind fantasy games taking some inspiration from real-life places but this feels more like a theme park of Earth culture. And some of the locations are just downright cheesy, especially Phnom Nohn and Lonalulu (seriously?) They reuse almost all the same areas from Act 1 three times! Act 2 and Act 3 are just Act 1 areas all over again with boring quests. End game is not great. DQ 8 and DQ 9 had better endgame. The trials are nothing more than boss arenas or copy/paste of dungeons you already did (there is seriously so much copy/paste repetition in this game it's not even funny). It's almost TOO easy to get to 99 due to the Electro Light ability. You can just summon 1 million XP worth of metal slimes and level up from 60-99 in a few hours. Also the music is by far the worst in any DQ game, I guess the composer went senile. But you can switch to some old DQ themes, which helps. 

The really bad: Tickington is stupid. It's so painfully bad that I couldn't even bother. I get that they were going for retro, but my god could they use a half decent combat interface? After 2 levels I was done. No way I have the patience for hard boss fights in that place. 

Overall, I had a good time, but once I beat the final boss of Act 3, I had enough. Act 2 and Act 3 were just not the greatest due to the fact that it feels like you're doing the same thing you just did, two more times.",1678320350,1678320350,True,12,0,0.572116374969482422,0,True,False,False

The story reuses some of the great storytelling themes that Square is known for, but it does it quite well. If you've played other Square games, you'll recognize where it's retelling a similar story as a past Square game. But they do it well. It's an homage to those games, it's tastefully done, and while not QUITE as good as the original, it's still the right mix of nostalgia, good storytelling, and a fun game.

At the end of Act 2, there's a point where you have to choose to put down the controller. You have a very clear chance to say ""I'm done, I've beaten this game, the next step is clearly something I don't want to do"". Stop there.

There are no missables. If you are a completionist, then you can find and do and finish everything you want to do to 100% complete the game in Act 3. It's fun... It's not a massive chore or grind like a lot of games do for that. But... it's definitely not as impactful or fun as Acts 1 & 2.

As a long term Pokémon fan, I've always admired Dragon Quest from afar, liking the cute enemy designs, silly names, and quirky visual style.

Early on, I figured the game was a really refined JRPG.
You've got a bunch of open areas to explore, quick turn-based combat encounter to plow through, and some really cool skill trees for each character to unlock new abilities.
Everything about this game spoke to me as the ""Peak JRPG"" title, with all the modern-day fixings and quality of life improvements the genre has adapted to and refined over years and years.

Then I booted up Dragon Quest IX for the DS and realized that the series has been like this for a long time now.
Open world, quality of life options, minimal grinding, etc.
Dragon Quest truly is the JRPG to end all JRPGs.
It's fun, lighthearted, not terribly difficult, and easy to sink hours and hours into.

My only issue with this game is that it really Dragon.
...er, sorry, it really drags on, I mean.
About 5-7 hours into the game, the main questline starts to develop and you get your quest to go get ""The Thing.""
About 20 hours (no spoilers, these are examples that don't happen in game) later, you finally get the thing, you just also helped the town over with their Troll infestation, did the laundry for the Queen two cities over, and hunted down your long-lost brother only to have to slay him in combat, leading to a 5 minute funeral cutscene.
If you pick it up and play about 2-5 hours a week, not a problem, makes for a fun gaming experience where the main goal stays the same but the adventure is constantly changing.
If you binge play it like I did, it'll start to get a little old.

Not even a fault of the game, really, I just really clung to it, put too much of my time into it, and got burned out halfway through.

This is weird cause my first DQ game was Builders 1, which is a ""what if"" game to the original Dragon Warrior/Quest game. For all intents and purposes, XI is my first mainline title. 

Anyway, going into it, I knew that DQ in general was more of a traditional approach in regards to jrpg. From it's initial setup and premise, you know what exactly to expect. And that's the best part, is it uses that as it's biggest strength for many unexpected twists and turns as the game progresses. I can totally understand people bouncing off it in it's beginning hours, for me I was instantly hooked due to the characterization and how alive the world feels. The dialogue is charming, engaging and overall fun! I always wanted to see what an NPC had to say, (and revisiting them after events occured) as well as using the party talk function - which is completely optional, but those that use this feature will find a lot of stuff that overall adds to the experience and the characters that join your party. I probably missed a lot of unique dialogue myself, it's there though for those that wish to partake.

Moving on the the presentation, make no mistake, even though this appears to be very simple, a lot of effort went into the production and especially the TL. This is a full fledged AAA jrpg with a lot of care put into the localization to ensure every region, town and NPCs feel fresh compared to their JP counter-parts. Hell, there's even an entire town where it's populace speaks in haiku. That was very awesome to experience. Visually, the definitive version ""S"" was made originally for switch, so when it was ported back to PS4 and PC, it kept the lower res assets without putting them back. A shame really, considering the original release was very beautiful. This can be most fixed on PC using a community enhancement project, which is exactly what I did since I played on steam. Audio is great and includes a total orchestrated OST, which was not found in the original release due to the composer being a douche. I'm not going to go into details about this person as they have passed away and no longer reside in this world. Feel free to look them up though if you're curious and read about it.

Well, what about the gameplay? It's not the most impressive combat system ever, it's fun enough with a lot of options to build your characters, using the character builder. You can craft your own builds and choose your playstyle, making classes on the fly. Early game you'll want to stick to a single spec, but later on you'll be able to branch out. Respec options are also provided for you, so you'll never have to lament your skill points. It's cheap as well to use. Being able to switch equipment out during battles is very handy and you can even use weapons as items during battle, provided they have an ability that lets you do so. There are tons of tag team attacks/abilities with very nice animations for you to enjoy.

As for the world itself, it feels like a genuine adventure. You'll want to explore every nook and cranny, see everything, and uncover the game's many mysteries. Seriously this is a densely packed world. If you just want to focus on the main experience, no issue there. You're afforded with as much freedom to do whatever you want. 

Storywise, it's not the most complex or crazy thing you'll experience. It does do something that I found to be VERY interesting though. Can't go into details about it ofc, it's just really cool. 

And there you have it. DQ is a long running series that's huge in Japan, and I finally understand why. They have perfected a formula that while on the surface, seems generic and basic, but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded with a delightful experience, endearing characters, and alot of fun along the way. I have clocked in about 200hrs, doing mostly everything, and never felt burned out. That's a rarity for me personally, take that how you will. 

Final verdict - I award this game a 9.5

Will go down as one of my favorite jrpgs. I probably left a lot of stuff out I could have talked about, probably.",1675721373,1675721373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Each playable character in your party has tons of character building, and none of them feel like a drag to read or listen to. The dialog feels very real between the cast of characters, and they each have distinct personalities that make each character feel fresh.
Game-play wise its about as I'd expected. You can roam throughout the 3D over-world and manually fight the spawning enemies. It can get repetitive if you grind a lot (as I did), but its not nearly as bad as it could be due to the amazing soundtrack. The synthesized tracks are really good, but the orchestral tracks are just too good, with not a single track I've gotten tired of (even the generic battle music that you listen to for hours on end!!)
The story is also very enjoyable. I cannot say how much it holds up to the other games, but its exciting to see what happens next and there are plenty of twists and turns to surprise you.

One small complaint (and tip) that one can fix in the settings, the menus and keys are not taking into account all the classic PC games or PC RPG assignments. i.e. Esc to go back or go to the main menu, ""I"" for inventory etc. and at first it feels like a controller is mandatory, (it isn't). instead Backspace is used to go back from the menus etc. There are a couple of other similar small issues that make someone who will pick this absolutely ""must play""game feel a bit awkward at first.

It has an engaging story, fun gameplay, and looks really nice, but it's a pretty standard turn-based JRPG. It does the basic formula for these kinds of games well (in fact, Dragon Quest as a whole pretty much invented the gameplay of JRPGs), but it doesn't do anything terribly interesting with the formula compared to other games once you get past its art style and love for puns.

At times, the game's tendency to respect traditions associated with the game can even be to its detriment (such as the fact that either you or the monsters you face can have a random chance to start the battle with a free turn with no way to protect against it or initiate such a move manually), though overall it's not really a problem. The game feels a lot like an old-school RPG from the 16-bit era of gaming. Whether or not that's a good thing depends on your personal tastes.

I recommend the game since I had fun with it personally (though the ""post-game"" is very heavy on level-grinding with a major difficulty spike) and I've played some of the spin-offs before this. But I'm no RPG-buff, and I know you ultimately could be playing something more unique like Persona, Undertale, Pokémon, and Dragon Quest's ""cousin"" Final Fantasy.

Upsides: [list]
[*] Story - Simplistic and trope-heavy, but in the best way possible. It manages to capture all the magic of reading fairy tales as a child--it's silly, it's whimsical, it's dramatic, it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it also knows how to be bittersweet and downright sad when it needs to be. I would compare it to an animated children's movie, but one crafted for an adult audience. It holds all of the delight of that kind of experience, balancing innocent joy and darkness, but is still very much written for an older age group. 
[*]  Cast - One of the few JRPGs where I didn't dislike any of the party members. Everyone has their moments, and while they fall into typical Dragon Quest character archetypes on the surface, they end up subverting expectations in interesting and meaningful ways. I was constantly checking party talk to hear all the interesting things everyone had to say. This goes triple for Sylvando, who has become one of my favorite characters in anything ever. The game is almost worth buying just for him. 
[*] Gameplay - There are lots of different ways to set up the party and each individual character, but never so many that it felt impossible to manage them all. There are ways to minmax and deal a zillion damage at once if you want to figure them out, and there are ways to not do that if you don't want to do that. A good balance. The battle animations are also charming and full of life, especially with how your party members will wander around the screen on their own.
[*] Enemies - Some of the cutest and silliest creatures you'll ever see in gaming. Love these little guys. 
[*] World - DQ11S features an incredibly vast, expansive, and varied landscape. There are so many things to do, and so few missables. Lots to do and see if you want to do and see it, and if you don't, you don't have to. There are also fun quirks with NPC dialogue in certain areas.
[*] Localization and Voice Acting - Really good localization IMO--there are so many puns in this game that it hurts my head trying to imagine localizing them. Additionally, I loved the English voice acting and everyone's distinct accents (Yes, including Erik's. It will grow on you, I promise. You won't be able to live without it soon enough).
[/list]

Downsides: [list]
[*] The Protagonist - It would be nice if he were more emotive. Also, I'm sorry to say, but he looks ridiculous in half the costumes with his haircut. Otherwise, it didn't bother me too much that he was silent, given the overall silliness of the setting, but I'll note it anyway, since it can be considered a negative. 
[*] Music - There are a few excellent tracks on the soundtrack (such as the symphonic versions of Light through the Leaves of Love, Battle for Glory, Heavenly Flight) and then there are, well, the others. It's not that they're bad songs--it's that you'll be hearing them on repeat for hours on end, and they're not necessarily the kinds of songs you want to be hearing on repeat for hours on end. While the overall musical style is iconic and distinctive, and while I would even say that I like it for the most part despite my hatred of Sugiyama as a person, pieces like the battle theme (or whatever was playing during the final dungeon in act 2, which began to grate on me so much I was actually getting frustrated) could really use more variety. A lot of my favorite selections from the OST are the parts that were used with scarcity (Melody of Love, the few distinct town themes, etc.). That being said, I would still wholeheartedy recommend the game--I would just also recommend that you go into the menu as soon as possible and change the overworld music from the default theme to the DQ8 overworld theme. It will vastly improve your experience. 
[*] Jade's side story - The peak of sexism in a game that otherwise isn't the worst with it considering the genre. [spoiler] This side story just felt completely creepy and unnecessary, especially when the other members of the cast got such interesting character development in theirs. Yes, I hated this part enough for it deserve its own spot on my downsides list. [/spoiler]

Played through the whole demo and was immediately hooked. Having a proper ""pseudo-sequel"" to DQ8 (in terms of gameplay) is a godsend and hits me right in the feels with nostalgia. So far, the game is much more accessible than I remember DQ8 being, in that there's a lot more direction and guidance, whereas DQ8 could be incredibly cryptic, even in the early parts of the game. Core elements of turn-based fighting, exploration, itemization and the ""pep"" system show a marked improvement from 8 and are incredibly fun.

There is no way to change difficulty after you have started the game.

The story became to sexist for me to continue, so this is a very mixed bag for me.
My favourite character had an interesting backstory which was not explored. Instead, the game just continued to sexualise her and explore the other characters' backstories.

With less sexism, I would have completed this game and recommended it.

Let me tell you why this game is terrible.

First off, let's talk about the game's economy. You will ALWAYS be poor. You will NEVER have enough money to properly outfit your party. At the point of the game where I gave up (about lv25-ish) random enemy encounters would pay around 150-200 gold. A piece of armor costs 4,000. The most recent boss fight paid out 4,000 gold, and that boss fight gets you ONE piece of armor. There are SEVEN people in your party.  While it's true you unlock the ability to craft early on, finding recipes and materials is difficult. Recipes are few and far between and well hidden, and materials to craft even low-level recipes are rare. So you won't be getting a ton of use out of your Fun-Size Forge.

You will also spend a large chunk of the game under-leveled, unless you devote literally hours of your life to grinding. Normal enemies will consistently provide a serious challenge, and will drain your HP and MP on your way to the boss. And let's talk about the utter bullshit that is boss fights.  Your debuffs usually don't work. THEIR debuffs ALWAYS work. Bosses will curse, poison, stun, paralyze, confuse, and/or blind you, and in many cases there's nothing you can do about it except wait for the effect to wear off.  (Oh, and did I mention that bosses will often get multiple turns in a row?) And since you're always broke, healing items will constantly be in short supply--or you spend all your money on restorative items and have no money for equipment upgrades. No matter what you do, unless you devote literally dozens of hours to grinding levels and cash you will be on the back foot pretty much all the time.

This is the kind of garbage I'd expect to find in a JRPG from the '80s, not the 2010s. It is old-school in all the worst imaginable ways and unless you are a die-hard Dragon Quest fan, don't buy this game. Save your money. If you ARE a die-hard DQ fan, I would suggest re-evaluating your life choices.",1672852692,1672852692,False,0,2,0.32622721791267395,0,True,False,False

DQ11’s storytelling is absolutely atrocious. 
The main plot comes to a constant standstill, so the writer must resort on contrived nonsense to keep it going.

The cast doesn’t drive the story; instead you constantly feel the presence of the writer nudging them to their next goal. It doesn’t feel natural.

I’ve lost count of how many times characters get convenient visions, jump to conclusions or just stumble across important key items.
Nothing feels earned and there is little agency.

The story failing at such fundamentals makes me question if an actual writer was even involved.

Most of the time you meander around without a clear sense of what’s going on, collecting mcguffins and wondering why you should care about any of it. When finally something exciting happens it’s confusing because there was no buildup.

The side stories are enjoyable and kept me going, sadly the later acts retroactively ruin that as well.

Characters are likeable, but vastly underwritten and will disappear from the plot for an extended period of time. Randomly dropped backstory segments masking as character development is as good as it gets I’m afraid.

Also, if you settle on using a silent protagonist, make sure the story you are telling actually supports it. I know this is a staple for the series, but whenever the game tries to be dramatic it falls flat because the hero keeps staring into space like a radish. 

Calling the writing lazy would be an understatement. This is straight up no-fcks-given territory. The quality is on par with Bethesda; full of interesting ideas, none fleshed out and barely held together by contrived plot points. 

This isn’t a story. It’s a series of stuff just happening.

Like today’s average Hollywood Blockbuster there’s no build-up, no logic, no consistency. Just look at the screen and clap. Nothing makes sense and it’s ok as long as you don’t think about any of it.

Was I expecting too much? How did we get from DQ8 to this? This stinks!

-----

Now that I got that off my chest I can’t say I fully hated the experience. It had its moments, but overall I don’t think it was worth my time. If you’re expecting something like DQ8, then you will be sorely disappointed.

In fact, just boot up an emulator and play that instead. Your time will be better spent.",1672251422,1672251422,False,7,1,0.420520037412643433,2,True,False,False

Personally, this is my first entry in the series, and from what I understand, this game is the culmination of all the past Dragon Quest games, being both modern and old-school in all the right ways.
Contrary to the Final Fantasy series, where each entry can be widely different from one another, all the main Dragon Quest games share the same foundations, making it more cohesive and refined over the years.
There is just so much to like about this game. It has a simple but good story, with a great cast of characters. The graphics are good, although they’re downgraded for the original release. But it barely matters because the Definite Edition is just better everywhere with only this exception. Also, since you’re playing on PC, there are mods available that improve the visuals closer to the original game. But the cell shaded graphics are nice, coupled with the Akira Toriyama character designs, similar to the Dragon Ball series.
The music is also great. The original release suffered from the lack of symphonic tracks, but that’s not the case on the Definitive Edition. I think that alone is better than having better graphics because you’ll notice the music more. There’re are a lot of tracks borrowed from past Dragon Quest games, and the music gets a bit repetitive, but I really enjoyed this soundtrack.
Combat is turn-based, but this game proves that this style isn’t outdated. It’s simple, yes, but functional and very enjoyable, with various options to auto-combat and speed options. It’s flashy and the animations are great. A great case of if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
This game has one of the best crafting systems I’ve seen. It’s not complicated, but the fact that crafting is basically an entire minigame, it just adds more meaning to it. And speaking of minigames, this one probably has the best casino. The minigames aren’t that special, but they are rigged to be in your favor. Not only in the regular prizes, but in the Jackpots as well. They can still take a long time to happen, but they don’t deal with real odds. Overall, the house loses long-term.
But perhaps what I enjoyed the most was the game design. It’s more subtle, but it’s stuff like organized item trackers that really help if you’re aiming for 100% completion. Also, very uncommon for JRPGs, there’s barely any missables. For example, treasure chests that you may miss in unrepeatable dungeons get relocated somewhere else, so those aren’t missable. Or, if you didn’t fight a specific weaker enemy that later gets replaced for a stronger one, defeating that stronger version will unlock the bestiary entry for the weaker one as well. It’s a lot of attention and care like this throughout the game that I really enjoy. Lots of small details that add up.
The Definitive Edition also adds a lot of quality-of-life features, like a shortcut for common commands, a photo mode, having the party following you on the field, and the ability to freely change outfits. Not only that, but it also adds a ton on new stuff. Things like Japanese voices (although I recommend English, because of the different accents), extra chapters focusing on some party members, the symphonic soundtrack I mentioned earlier, and the biggest one, a 2D mode.
The 2D mode allows you to play the entire game in 2D! Granted, it’s not completely new, since it was present in the Nintendo 3DS version of the game, exclusive to Japan, but in practice this adds a radical new way to play the game, with sprites and gameplay more similar to the SNES games. And that’s awesome because it basically adds an entire new version of the game. You can also swap between modes if you want, however you can only go to past predetermined points.
My recommendation is to just play in 3D, because it’s much richer with all the voices and facial expressions, but after finishing the game you can swap to 2D and play again from the beginning, and since you retain everything except for that story progress and key items, it essentially acts as a new game plus. It has some limitations, but it tells the exact same story, it doesn’t miss anything. All treasures refresh on swapping, allowing for some item exploits, like duping unique items.
But there’s no need for that, because the 3DS exclusive content also got added, mainly the Tickington content. It’s basically a series of side quests that take place in short areas from all 10 past Dragon Quest games, plus some super bosses at the end. It’s a lot of extra content, and it’s played only in 2D, so even if you’re playing in the original 3D version, you’ll also get a taste of the 2D mode without the need to swap modes by playing this content.
The Definitive Edition also released with a cheaper price, even with all the added content and features. Unfortunately, owners of the original version couldn’t upgrade. I usually don’t buy games on release, and this one just further proves my point. Not only it’s a much superior version, but it’s also cheaper. Even without a sale, this is an easy recommendation, there’s a lot of value in here.
And the cherry on top, while it runs with Steam by default, the game can also run without it, essentially making it DRM-free! You’ll need to manually move the save files if you want to retain progression though, but this is a great pro-consumer practice, and games on Steam that can run without DRM should deserve that recognition.",1671744760,1671744760,True,20,0,0.709646761417388916,0,True,False,False

While this is not true for the whole game, a good portion of this game's music seems to be recorded with a live orchestra, and it shows. Its music is better for it in both sound and composition.

This being my first Dragon Quest game, i didn't know what to expect except it being a fantasy story about being a hero, and early on as the story progresses, that's what you get.
Progressing through the story i started to meet the characters that would pretty much compose my party, and as expected i started growing attached to them and liking them, they're genuinely fun and varied, be it in design or personality, if there's one thing this game shines, it's on that.
As i go through the game i started getting hooked by the story, with it having some interesting twists, and when i reached the end of Act 2 there were moments that honestly made me tear up. ( [spoiler]That being Veronica dying and her sister Serena growing a lot from it as a character, which to me is one of the most impactful scenes in the game [/spoiler] )
And honestly, if the game ended here, in act 2, this review would've probably been positive, but alas, as Act 3 rolled around, i was personally severely disappointed. (WARNING: Heavy spoilers ahead)
[spoiler] At the start of Act 3, our Hero discovers a way to go back in time before a moment in the story where the first twist in the story happens, where he's betrayed and branded as the villain, for a chance to undo that and with it, pretty much everything from that point onwards, which would be essentially 80% of what you played of the game up until now, and to me that felt like the game was picking up everything it showed me, everything i did, the neat little love story with the mermaid, Veronica's heroic sacrifice to save everyone, the whole journey up to this point, crumbling it up like a sheet of paper and throwing it in the garbage, and then spitting on it for good measure. I genuinely felt like it was the most ass pull way of giving me a ""good ending"" and fixing everything. Nothing needed fixing, it undermined everything the characters went through, because now there's a convenient way of fixing it, the whole story, all the consequences lost all of their weight, since we could just press the world reset button, and in my opinion that's a fat no.

To conclude this review in a non-spoilery way, if you plan to play the game until the end of act 2, then yeah, it's a pretty good game, but act 3 was genuinely a bad choice in my opinion.",1670704314,1670704314,False,19,4,0.501601696014404297,7,True,False,False

I have a windows 10, high end gaming laptop, and I couldn`t figure out why DQXI sometimes crashed when i launched the game. I checked my drivers were up to date, checked my NVIDIA settings etc, verified the game,  and no, they weren`t causing the crash, and was totally confused. 
So I thought , maybe the exe file could be corrupt and created a new one by right clicking on the game in steam and create a new shortcut. And boom, no crashing , I then quit the game.......but then I clicked the game on my TASKBAR, where I had pinned the game , and yep it started to crash again. After pinning and unpinning the the game on my taskbar multiple times I can now confirm that if you PIN the game to the taskbar, it will cause the game to crash, lag and stutter.

HOWEVER, I because of Sylva, or whatever his name is, I couldn't keep playing. I finally just had to quit because it started making me insane. 

Now, a little context, I am a bi-sexual man and greatly enjoy my LGBTQSETR!@#$ (or whatever is politically correct at the moment) and I totally get that some of my friend express themselves by being particularly flamboyant. Myself, I'm very cis and no one knows that I'm bi unless I actually tell them. 

That said, this guy is over the top and it gets to the point where the writers decided they wanted to be so inclusive that the game starts revolving around that character. And there's only so much ""Oh sweeeetie! You're FABBULOUSSS!"" That I can possibly stand. When I get a little too much of that from my friends, I go home. I don't need that from a video game. 

I fully support their choice to be inclusive. That part is awesome! I'm not okay with that character taking over the game to the point that I find my Main Character wearing peacock feathers and being part of a fabulous traveling troupe of flamboyant performers that roam around the world in a mardi gras style parade while I try to complete my quests. Yes, it's required, no you can't get away from it. Thankfully, you can at least change costumes. But this is just too much, and it started making me skip cut scenes because I was just sick of it.

The roles are pretty set for each character you come across, so don't think you can make any weird team compositions here.

Also, if you play with no draconian rules, the game is too easy. You can just set it to autoplay in combat and run through the whole experience. I would suggest anyone trying it out and looking for a challenge, starts with the ""super strong monsters"" setting, then you need to use more of the mechanisms offered to you in combat.

The gameplay and turn based combat in turn is nothing unique either, but it's polished to perfection and expertly balanced to the point where the game's not too grindy, but still damn satisfying to play and progress through. 
My only real point of criticism is that while the music is wonderful, it does get rather repetitive after you've heard the same overworld music and battle theme for hours on end.

That was when immersive, story heavy games were changing everything, and it's not something that I can go back to. I feel like this game would be very well suited for someone just starting out in RPGs or even for children as a first RPG.

Expect standard JRPG hero tropes like smashing pots and robbing other peoples homes, standing by as bad things happen and only then dealing with the problem as well as a dark lord that apparently wants to destroy the world because he is the dark lord.

A huge glaring issue is the English translation. Region dialects are overdone (completely ridiculous in places like the ALL CAPS alien and incomprehensible hot spring village folks) as well as a large number of name changes that doesn't make any sense. 

If the rest of the game wasn't so good I likely would have dropped it over the translation alone, it really stands out among bad translations and I've seen my fair share of bad translations. Worst is that it's not bad because sloppiness but because they try too hard.

Fortunately Dragon Quest XI is rather good. It's nowhere near my favourite jRPG, but I enjoyed most of my time with it. The story is quite straightforward, but there are some plot twists to make it more interesting. The characters are mostly fun and interesting. There's one very bland one though.

The problem is, I didn't like the unnecessary padding between act 1 and act 2. It's apparently the definitive edition addition. I found it a waste of my time, mostly boring, and too long. I wish it could be skipped. Another addition of DQ11SEofaEA:DE is 2D village, where you can visit all 10 old DQ games for a dose of nostalgia. If you played the old games. For me those were very boring. Especially the ones where you had to battle monsters. There were fights every 2 steps, and they were wordy, slow and boring. It only reminded me while I dropped all previous DQs.

The combat system in this game is actually rather fun. You can give your characters orders, and they will fight automatically, but you can go into full manual mode at any time you want. Or go full manual only with selected characters. The strategies you can give to your allies (or even the main hero) are varied enough to cover all bases. This makes regular battles move in a swift manner.

You can also make camps in certain spots, where you can chat with your party, craft items, buy stuff. The crafting is useful and also a fun little diversion. You can save a lot of gold using it. There are also monsters you can ride, and few other fun little features. Overall the game is fun to play.

You also  have talent trees for all characters. Those are fun, but you are forced to specialize your characters in one weapon for the most of the game, as you don't have enough points. You can use a tiny amount of gold to reset your points and move it to another weapon, but it's too bothersome. There are also some times where the game resets the talent trees for some characters. It happened too often for my liking, and I had to re-assign all the skills. A bit irritating.

The game has some archaic things. The party members who died in battle don't get the experience points, and monsters can 1 hit KO your spellcasters easily, so you end up with highly uneven levels, and as you try to get those closer you overlevel your other members. You lose half your cash when you die, but you can keep the cash in the bank. And you can save only at the praying spots and churches, but it takes a lot of text to click through to actually save... But the game autosaves all the time, so I didn't bother making manual saves too often.

The beginning of the game has some challenging fights. At some point there was a difficulty spike, where I had to prepare for a boss knowing what is coming. But afterwards the game got very easy. I think it was partially due to me getting the skills needed to kill metal monsters, which had my party go through the levels ultra fast.

Near the end, I felt a bit tired of this game, they were dragging it out too much. And then there was even more story after beating the game, but it felt anti-climatic and rather bland. I'd suggest ending the game at the end credits.

The game has one very terrible issue. The music, while being really iconic and great, is really limited in the number of pieces that is being used. The same few songs are used all the time. All the zones seem to be using the same upbeat song, you never get another battle theme, there's only about 3 or so songs for different moods during the cutscenes. While what is there is great, there's just too little. Feels cheap, like an indie game.

I also didn't like that they didn't bring back better looking models from the base game in this ""definitive edition"". There are mods to fix it, but I shouldn't need to mod my game to have a definitive experience. That said the models still looked fine enough, it just makes the port feel a bit cheap.

All in all a great game with some minor issues. Good for both new and old dragon quest fans.",1666136879,1666136879,True,5,0,0.574922025203704834,0,True,False,False

It is way overrated. A fairly simplistic JRPG, it has big ideas but small executions.

Two major issues with the game; 

First; The music is probably up there with the worst JRPG soundtrack ever made, in particularly the over world theme, which simply doesn't match the tone or dynamics of the story at all.

Secondly; It should end in Act 2, but it digs up a false happy ending style Act 3 to basically undo everything you've done up until that point. 

About the only thing good with this game is the colourful cast of characters (The jester being fabulous!) but the story pacing and beats are fairly weak overall and they walk/run/jog to the same annoying flipping fanfare tune, it just sucks the joy out of the game.

But there's just a few things that rub me the wrong way and make me not want to continue. 
Long rant in bound while I gather my thoughts.

I love how nostalgic it is to play and how it truly takes you back in time to playing old rpgs as a kid. I actually at first thought it was a remake of an old game because it captures this feeling so completely (nope lol). The gameplay is fun and while the character designs are ugly and the music ear grating, the game is in my opinion, amazing up until... exactly when you recruit Serena and Veronica.
Because suddenly the pacing goes from 'we are running for our lives!' to 'whacky dated anime funtimes' 
I flinched at veronica being the 6 year old you can legally date, but rolled my eyes and kept going.
Like I got the feeling that everyone involved in making this game was probably between 50 and 75 years old and rolled with it bc it was kinda endearing. 

What killed it completely for me though was Sylvando.  Let me preface by saying I'm bi. My sisters gay. We're on the lgbt spectrum, woo. And Sylvando is just... yikes. If you like him, you need to go learn some lgbt history stat bc whooo boi.

Like, I get that theres a handful of youtube videos praising him as good lgbt rep but when you compare him to other 'flirty/flamboyant gay semi bad moraled man with sad backstory types' in other rpgs or anime (Zevran, Yuri LeClerc, Tiger and Bunny's Fire Emblem to name a few) ...he very quickly reveals himself as very much a uncomfortable caricature. Like whenever he attacks and makes *that* noise. The lisping. All of his alt outfits being gag ones or comically ugly. The feminine pronouns in the Japanese version when hes exceedingly masculine looking (war flashbacks to Grell Sutcliffe gender wars)
 The generally uncomfortable nature of how he phrases things. The fact that he is the first non-16-18 year old party member and is decidedly not someone I'd want to leave Hero in the room with, not because I think he'd do anything but because he just seems slimey. I mean, he called 2 guys and 2 girls traveling together romantic when as far as he knew one of those girls is 6. Like. Dude.

 Like, I'm sure he has the most deep sad dark backstory ever- I'm not sticking around to find out what. I'm gonna bet money hes a run away noblemans son who decided to be himself rather than be a rich noble mcnoble man. Like most of the very 1 dimensional characters in this game, he's nothing original. It's just that he's also a member of one of the most problematic tropes ever.  

And it makes some of the other 'hmmms' just become all the more apparent. The prestigitators had me googling for an explanation when I first faced them. I mean, they have full body covering hoods, flesh colored hands and slits for eyes... in the magic!arabia desert. I think that if they weren't in the desert, I wouldn't have thought anything more than 'man in magic robe' but because they are in the definately arabic inspired desert... its yikes.
When googling, I didn't find anything out about the prestigators, but I did find out that the composer was a supreme Japanese nationalist so, there is that. and they kept the dude around even though his compositional ability is supremely lacking. Like, this dude only composed for dragon quest pretty much and there is a reason. And its probably a bad one.

The characters are cardboard. I like Erik. I only like Erik. Where is Serena's personality? I love me the blonde cleric archetype (Ophilia from octopath for instance) but Serena just fails utterly.
And Why are all 3 cute girl characters near identical looking blondes? Like Gemma, Serena and Veronica? I know we get off brand Lynn fire emblem later but like, shes off brand Lynn fire emblem.

Don't get me started on the voice acting or the clear use of bad takes to maybe make the less good voice actors seem better. I mean, when Sylvando first appears you can hear him bump his mic. Which is something that you would not expect in a game of this supposed quality, it's just bad.

I'm thinking a lot of the hype for this game comes from nostalgia, suck-ups and people who think you 'have to know all about the one that started it all but for reasons never came to America'. 

Cause at the end of the day its a solid mediocre game made by some very old boring Japanese men who need to have a blue haired 20 something intern spice up their writing table.

Pros:
- Graphics is ok and can be beautiful at times
- Act 1 is ok, you get to choose who to be at your battle party. Some of the characters are meaningful and you can connect with them.
- Pacing of Act 1 is still OK up to this point.
- Exploring each of the area can be rewarding 

Cons:
- This is probably the biggest issue I had with the game, Act 2 is where the pacing is quite questionable. Unnecessary re-visit, back and forth navigation into the same places back in Act 1 (It really gets nausea and annoying having to re-do all of these again). For my case, I've just wanted back my old party members and try to get better equipments and defeat the evil but I was forced to use characters that I'm not interested with. Besides that, the story plot introduces a lot of comedy and side stuffs that doesn't seems relevant after what happened in Act 1. I reckon the Act 2 will appeal to some audiences and on the other side it may not.

No doubt that this game is really a cookie cutter RPG, but up to the ending of Act 1 I am still enjoying it but it all goes down after the start of Act 2.

The characters have real personality, and it really adds to the experience - there's a village where basically all the NPCs talk in haiku - incredible!

The devs don't care enough to make few simple dialog line changes to reflect the function of buttons from controller to keyboard. 
For example, the tutorial tells you to press controll button ""LT"" to confirm, but doesn't tell you what key that is on keyboard, and of course the game also doesn't tell you what key to press to bring up the menu or what section of the menu to goto to look up the key bindings. 
Unlike all other PC games, you have to press ""z"" instead of ""ESC"" to bring up the menu which I had to look up. Basically, every time tutorial told me to press certain button on the controller I have to go to the key binding menu to check. Sure, maybe I could have memorized all that, but I think that takes you out of the game.

The characters and Dialogues are nicely writtens , there are a lot's of memorable moments and the gameplay is overall fine.

it's a bit grindy but there are specifics spots on the map that allow you to find metal slime pretty easily and there are also pep skills (some sort of ultimate attacks) that allow you to summon metal slimes once in a while.

gameplay wise each characters have skills tree that allow you to specialise each of them the way you want , you can forge equipments and everytime you forge something you get special pearls that allow you to upgrade these gears up to a +3 status.

once you've beaten the game a first time you've offered to continue playing and there is a second campaign [spoiler] where you can go back in time and revert some of the events that happened in order to get a second ending , but seriously if you are a casual player like I am I'd advise you agains't doing so ...

Full review - This game is fantastic. Hits all the bells and whistles that you'd expect from a JRPG while also providing voice acting and a borderline cinematic experience that makes you keep coming back. Not a walk in the park unless you purposely overlevel and enough overworld to fill that DQ itch of exploration. As someone who started with DQ3 on the NES and GBC, there were legitimate goosebumps throughout the game due to storylines, music and dialogue that hearkened back to the older games.

Is it the best DQ of all time? That would be a stretch for those who've played some of the older games. But it's definitely up there and 100% is a great way for newcomers to experience the franchise. The remastered (XI S) is the way to go with the Quality of Life changes, orchestral soundtrack and such.

I can't believe I havent made a review on this game yet and this seems like a good chance to do so

so um--- This game's good and you should play it

Nah but fr, Dragon Quest XI might just be the greatest JRPG of all time, maybe a bit behind some other entries on the series but to me this one's way up on my top games of all time. This game is a love letter to Dragon Quest and maybe even JRPGs in general if you get easily excited at dumb stupid dumb stupid crap like I do.

I first played and beat this game on switch, I simply got the PC version out of curiosity and respect. I must say this game does work well both on console and PC if that might be a decision you are trying to make out right now, the requirements for PC are fairly permissive, so if your mega machine can run any other AAA release from the past few years you're good to go

The cast of characters is very diverse and enjoyable, full of crazy development which actually I have come to expect as a standard of sorts at times! I understand how difficult it can be to have eight main characters and having them all as fleshed out as they were in this game! I won't lie and say even with all the promotional art I never would've thought that [spoiler]Hendrik would have a redemption arc which would have him join your team. Also, Veronica's death really got me in tears[/spoiler]

The world building is superb, it really sells you this fantasy world you have to save from a cursed king! There are many towns to explore, all full of charismatic characters with fun quirks and accents that add to the experience of traveling through a lively and actually lived-in world. I know some games like Breath of the Wild spoiled us on the sense that we're now expecting any adventure game to be an open world, but the half-linear take Dragon Quest has as a franchise has really stood the test of time, by mixing large open areas with linear segments.

The gameplay might be nothing special if you don't like RPGs but the combat in Dragon Quest XI is spectacular and one of, if not the best combat system that's currently in modern RPGs, it sticks to it's roots while innovating by giving you the ability to move around the environment during turns which really has no gameplay impact but it's fun to fidget with. You are also given the option to choose the speed of the battles, which helps that more impatient portion of the playerbase that might still be on the no over turn based RPGs.

The music... oh god the music. I know this might be a controversial opinion but the music in this game is spectacular, even [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciJcrbJy9ro]the bossfight theme which many people despise[/url], it still is a heavenly masterpiece to me. Even then! The base soundtrack has [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q0DFTSFPY4]some splendid tracks[/url], including [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XClpykYN13I&t=11s]many throwbacks to past compositions[/url], which as a long-term fan of the series I really appreciate. But if your reaaally need to hate on this game's OST, you are given an option to use Dragon Quest VIII music which sure, is a great option, don't get me wrong, VIII is my favorite and most nostalgia-coated DQ game to date, but damn babe the tone of the game really doesn't fit with VIII's soundtrack, I'm sorry, it just makes me think I could be playing DQVIII instead of living a lie.

If you pointed a gun to my head, I'd admit this game does have a weak point that just to be nice with this piece of work I don't like to point out and that'd be the post-game, the infamous act 3. It's tedious and a clear way to extend the playtime of a game that really didn't need it, while ruining a perfectly sound ending by forcing in the damned hollywood-esque philosophy of needing everything [spoiler]to have a happy ending[/spoiler], but that's pretty much it, the reason I don't consider it seriously is that it wasn't originally intended to be in the game since it's completely optional and you'll really have a better time just with the intended game length.

There's also this weird side-mode that lets you explore past Dragon Quest game's locations, but like I said, it's completely optional and a new player might not be able to fully appreciate it, to me it was a cool nostalgia trip, but nothing special and completely skippable.

Dragon Quest 11 is a good JRPG at its core, with a fun round-based battle system, beautiful landscapes, and very creative monster design.These features are merely the surface that attempts to conceal the various negative aspects of the game:

-The silent main protagonist is as boring and bland as they come, and I never felt sympathy for him. 
-You never feel threatened or challenged during the fights, and you can practically set it to autofight and win 99% of the time. 
-Everything feels so fairytale-like and magical, which doesn't really appeal to me (might be a positive point for some) 
-The dialogues are simply uninteresting and, at times, forced. 
-The story is as generic and JRPG cliche as it gets, though I can't fully judge it after 20 hours.it might take some unexpected twists or turns but honestly i doubt it
-The companions are charming at times, but ultimately fall flat because the interactions with the silent protagonist feel strange and completely break immersion.i honestly think thar's the biggest weak point,don't rly get why they didn't give him a voice or some sort of personality.

If you're new to JRPGS, it might be a good place to start, but for veterans looking for something new or interesting, I wouldn't recommend it.

Edit: Now that I've completed the game I can still confidently say that the statement above is accurate, that being said, I wish I could have enjoyed it a little more. 

Following my playthrough of Persona 4, I entered Dragon Quest 11 with the impression that I'd fall in love with the characters and the environment in the same way I had in the former, but that wasn't really the case. The characters were pleasant and fun to engage with, no doubt; I loved that they each had emphasised idiosyncrasies, but they always left something to be desired. I didn't feel as connected with them as I would have since they were typically just following your standard JRPG archetype (sleezy old man character, best friend character, character who is gay but never explicitly confirmed). That was kind of my consensus with the game as a whole: it left me wanting more. 

I wanted more out of the relationships with the characters, I wanted more density in the environments, I wanted more cool music to jam to, I wanted more out of the story, and ironically, I wanted the game itself to be a bit shorter. Am I asking for too much? Probably. I do think I came in expecting a lot, given that I had set my JRPG bar pretty high after Persona.

That said, I do think that what the game got right got it properly right. The combat was easy but engaging, the story, although simple, was charming enough to keep me invested throughout, and even though I mentioned that the environments were somewhat lacking in density, I was still surprised at the scale of some of the cities and I would be remiss not to mention the fun voice acting each character was given in the English dub.

All in all, an inoffensive, globe trotting adventure with charming characters that I can confidently say I'm glad I played.

To start It's a super linear JRPG which means you don't actually get to make choices. There are options during dialog but it will literally loop you until you say yes to everything. By default the game only gives you control of the main hero in combat which you have to change in order to issue commands to your entire party. On paper it sounds cool to only have to control your character while your other party members cast/attack on their own, but it only takes one obviously wrong choice before you just end up setting all of your party to manual mode. 

The combat just isn't enjoyable and in an RPG where all you do is run/talk/fight, that's a pretty big problem. Turn based combat should feel tactical and strategic but this games combat is just blowing away world mobs until you get to a boss. Pokemon added combat depth with the type system, forcing players to pay attention to what enemy they were fighting. You can probably already guess that this game doesn't have anything like that. Sure there are moves that are more effective against types of enemies but your normal moves still work fine.  You will unlock so many different spells and abilities across your party that will never be used because you can just giga-slash this random mob and get on with your quest instead of trying to put it to sleep and debuff its resistance. This is one of the only games I remember playing where unlocking abilities/spells didn't excite me. To make it worse you can swap dead party members with live ones mid combat which gives the impression of the game going out of it's way to not make anything even remotely challenging. 

When you're watching cut scenes everything is great. The voice acting in both languages is good. The music is fire. The world looks amazing on PC. It's really just when you get to move around that things start to feel too sluggish. You will do a ton of side quests for rewards that aren't useful. You will buy items and gear from shops only to find them 20 mins later on the ground. You will spend your time running around to every glowing item drop on the gorgeous map only to not end up actually needing 50 pink shells or whatever random crafting material it is. In use battle items will be equipped and forgotten as they don't perform better than spells. All of these problems could be forgiven if combat was fun but, well... it's not...

TL;DR: This would be one of the greatest games of all time if combat wasn't a snooze fest. Over world mobs are a chore and bosses are too infrequent to scratch the itch of good turn-based combat. It feels like the game is balanced around doing the bare minimum so if you explore or farm even a little bit you're just going to be too strong forever.",1659528413,1659529348,False,2,0,0.39093548059463501,0,True,False,False

Story: The story was written for kids. No, I'm not joking and this is not an exaggeration. It was truly written for kids 10 and under. I'm completely serious. This ranges from plot elements to dialogue. It is too basic and childish with an extremely reserved story and dialogue. Don't expect much from the story. Due to this issue among others the pacing is incredibly poor, so much so the game is frequently termed ""play for an hour before bed slow burn"" by its community. I'm not going to call it outright awful, but mediocre and probably not to most people's taste when better options exist, or just period, mark it unappealing. There are also times where the story simply makes major mistakes like the handling and transition of events leading to being jailed leading the player to range from being confused to extremely so making best judgement assumptions about the situation due to poor handling.

Characters: Main character is totally silent leading other characters, notably Erik, to produce supporting dialogue that comes off almost redundant, obviously as intended for a younger audience to clarify events/story. Character's are not awful but are certainly absolute tropes and rather bland if not obnoxious. It should also be pointed out that English dub dialogue and voice acting come with an extremely overwhelming Engrish accent prejudiced on less educated communities and not something you would see typically in modern times in most areas. It comes off as incredibly jarring and obnoxious, but also has a bit of natural warmth so mileage will vary to extremes from player to player. Dialogue is also very kiddy styled.

Combat / Gameplay Mechanics: Combat is very easy, so much so that the famous recommendation is unanimously set the game to harder mode. Unfortuantely, this requires you to progress hours into the game to unlock it then restart then and there and make up hours of progress to get back to that point and continue on hard. Let me put it this way... You can control all characters but the default setting is you only control the main character while the AI is set to automatically pick its moves on its turn plus the AI doesn't know how to use skills correctly at all (such as inflict status effect then transition to skill x6 dmg on status induced foe, but rather just spams x6 dmg skill on no status effect for x1 dmg output instead... or doesn't use it ever if target has status effect applied). Despite this the game is hilariously easy and practically impossible to lose during combat. Its mechanics are also inconsistent like how AoEs are handled and it has a constant spam power up mode (kiddified I kid you not, feels like power rangers vibes) via Pep Up which happens overly frequently while being uncontrollable random except very very later on. The grid skill system is virtually unengaging and further troubles the game's pacing issue with its own design and slow burn growth and low impact vs very extreme impact unlocks. World exploration is visibly nice but clearly designed from a sheer padding intent rather than truly meaningful, immersive, or fun.

Music: Very loud. Unless you want to go deaf you will have to turn it down when you start playing. Personally, I had to turn it from 100% to 30% just to bring it even remotely close to 100% other sound/dialogue because it is so uneven and so absurdly loud. Music is also totally and utterly unimpressive as well as forgetful.

I'll not call it a bad game, but I would certainly not recommend it. Most likely, kids or already established fans are the type of audience it will appeal to most. I've always avoided the franchise until now precisely because I had these very concerns about this and I'm sad to say despite coming in with a fully open mind it proved me far more correct in my initial concerns than I could have ever believed. Perhaps the other games aren't all like this but this one has done enough damage to deter me from the rest of the franchise without considerable reason to change my mind in the future.",1658693043,1658693043,False,8,6,0.452785372734069824,0,True,False,False

The Dragon Quest (DQ) games are classic, turn-based JRPGs where you control a party of endearing characters. Besides for a few exceptions, games in the DQ series are standalone stories, so you do not need to play any of the other DQ games before playing DQXI. DQXI is probably the best DQ game to play for anyone that has never played a DQ. As a JRPG, most of your time will be fighting in monster encounters, traveling the world with your party members, going to towns, finding/crafting better gear, completing quests, and fighting bosses. DQ games are more of a cozy/low-stress gaming experience instead of a highly tactical or difficult one.

The combat is generally simple and easy, making it a pretty low-stress/casual experience when fighting normal enemies. You can set your party members (and even you main character) to auto-battle, and the AI is generally intelligent enough that you can do this without too much worry - in fact I'd recommend setting most to all of your party members to auto-battle just to speed up fights with easy enemies. Bosses usually require more strategy and would be advised to control all your party members at these times. Because there is quite a gap between the relatively ""brain-dead"" easy normal fights compared to the more tactical boss fights, it could feel like a steep learning curve. But if you hit a tough boss, you could always grind a few extra levels or craft/improve better gear to power through it if you're having trouble with the game's strategy.

The plots in DQ are more like charming fairy tales instead of thought-provoking stories. Most of the story is pretty predictable, but it does have its moments. The really enjoyable parts come from character moments from colorful cast of party members you recruit. The party members are all quite enjoyable, and it helps keep the cozy feeling of the game. 

[h1] For Those Familiar with the Series [/h1] 
I have played through Dragon Quests 1-6, 9, and I'm part-way through DQ7. While I would probably say DQV is still my favorite (and definitely the best in terms of story), DQXI comes in at a close 2nd for me. The story is enjoyable, the game is gorgeous, the party members are great, and there is a ton of content. The game is divided into 2 acts + a post game, but the post game continues the story and has a lot of content and should really be considered the games 3rd act. 

[h1] Quality of Life [/h1] 
I was worried about playing in a larger 3D as I felt it would just needless pad out the game, but the ability to sprint and ride on mounts makes traveling very quick. Also, Zoom & Evac in this game cost no MP, and you can Zoom out of most locations (even inside of buildings and most dungeons without having to Evac first). Most of the open world areas are also filled with camps that you can rest, save, and Zoom to - making this a big time saver and quality of life addition. I'm normally not a big fan of crafting games as I feel it often wastes the player's time by doing unfun grinding/farming and being stuck in a menu instead of doing the fun part of the game. However, I will say DQXI made a lot of QoL improvements to the crafting system compared to DQIX:

*All picks-up spots for crafting materials are visible on the area map immediately.
*You can craft anywhere instead of having to go to one specific location to craft.
*If you are crafting an item and are missing a material, you can use gold to instantly buy that item as long as you discovered a shop that sells that material - instead of having to manually go to that specific shop to buy it or go out and farm it (Note: there are still some materials that cannot be bought this way, but that doesn't happen until the post-game).
*The crafting mini-game is surprisingly fun. Normally I would see something like this as another ""time waster,"" but I actually found myself enjoying engaging with the mini game when I would go on crafting sprees.

[h1] Draconion Quest [/h1] 
If you're like me and thought the combat in the DQ games were way too easy, I would recommend using the Draconion Quest options to increase the difficulty. These can be turned when starting a new game, but can be turned off at any church. However, once you remove one of these options, you cannot turn it back on unless you load an earlier save file while it was still active. Because of this, I would recommend turning on all of them you are willing to try, and then turning them off one-by-one depending on your taste. I started my playthrough with the Stronger Monsters, No XP from Weaker Monsters turned on, and one other - I'm glad I did. While part-way through my playthrough I took off the No XP from Weaker Monsters, I did keep the Stronger Monsters on my entire playthrough expect at the very end when fighting the post-game super bosses (I did not feel like grinding for seeds just to beat them). 

The stronger monsters makes the game MUCH more challenging in a good way. Even normal encounters can be deadly if you aren't careful. With this option turned on, DQXI became the most challenging DQ game I have played. Achieving victory against most bosses will require you to consider your party makeup, their abilities, crafting/equipping the proper gear, using consumables, and using buff/debuffs appropriately. In all the other DQ games combined, I can probably count the number of party wipes on one hand, and I don't think I've ever used a consumable in battle before. But in DQXI with stronger monsters on, some boss fights required multiple attempts to beat. Victory was usually gained after I was better prepared by switching up my party composition, changing what abilities I used, what protective gear I equipped - or a combination of all 3. Because of the increased challenge, I found myself having the most fun with DQXI's combat out of any of the DQ games. In all of the other DQ games I feel I could just spam the hardest hitting multi-target attack each round on all my characters and I would win without ever having think or change up my strategy.

[h1] Criticisms [/h1] 
DQXI does have its share of drawbacks, which keep it from being a truly great game. As the game progresses, you will be revisiting places a lot with sometimes almost no change and this can be pretty repetitive. This kills the pacing and sense of discovery compared to other DQ games where you were always finding new places/towns as you progressed further in the story. 

There is no job/vocation system in DQXI, which is a shame because that tends to be the most enjoyable part of the gameplay for DQ games for me. In DQ XI, each character has a predetermined set of skill trees unique to what weapons they use and their general ""class."" When you level up, you get skill points that you can use to unlock skills or passive bonuses in these different trees. It is most similar to DQIX as you have multiple trees to chose from, but you level up by unlocking tiles in a grid. So you can chose what path you want to level up in even in the same skill tree, instead of a singular linear path like DQIX's skill trees. Were it not for these issues and if it had a vocation system like the other DQ games, DQXI would have probably been my favorite in the series (though DQV still is the best story in the series, IMO). 

[h1] Verdict [/h1] 
I think I got it on sale for under $20, but it is well worth the price for the amount of content and sheer quality that this game has. If you loved the other DQ games, you can't go wrong with this one. And for newcomers, this is the best entry-point into the series.

Let me begin by prephasing that I spent over 150 hours on this game and enjoyed almost all of it. It does take a while to get going, as is typical of the genre but once you have met all your companions it truly opens up. There is a vast world to explore, its cities are more full of life than in any other game I've ever played. Not only do the townspeople and books you find offer an insight into the worldbuilding as a whole but they differentiate the many different cultures you come across. I believe writers and localization team both did a fantastic job at making every location stand out.

Your partners of which there are many do seem rather one-sided at first, I must admit. But once you get into Act II and start really learning more about them it might surprise you how well written most of them are. Every character has at least one very impactful moment and it's in Act II that they shine the brightest. Around this time you should also start getting deeper in their Character Building, a system similar to the Sphere Grid in Final Fantasy X, although not as complex. Your party will be more powerful and able to tackle more varid challenges, and each battle becomes more interesting as a result. How you build the characters are mostly up to you, there are some limitations in terms of weaponry but all characters can use at least two weapon types, often three, and an assortment of abilities and/or magic.

Sounds pretty good so far, right? And it gets better. The game is brimming with personality and charm, it is both visually gorgeous (at least if you download the Project Rebuild mods), and audibly stunning with a fantastic orchestral score courtesy of the Tokyo Metropolitan Orchestra as well as exceptionally well-acted voice performances. Neither of which were available in the original release. However it isn't all sunshine and rainbows, but as I cannot express my main issues with the game in detail without massive spoilers simply know that the story isn't without its faults. Some things are not explained well, others are inconsistent and it overall takes a big hit in the third and final act.

Although not the perfect game that review scores might have you believe, DQXI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age is a blast to play, a pleasure to read and offers so much content that the asking price is basically a steal! (You can even play through the game in 2D if you prefer the retro look. It lacks the polish of the old 16bit RPGs but it's worth a try.) If you are a fan of traditional JRPGs then I highly recommend this game!

I went into this game having only played Dragon Quest 1 & 2. and it doesn't seem like too much has changed over the years from it's core design, unlike Final Fantasy. 
It's like they know what the series is and just build upon that and modernise different systems and add quality-of-life.

The combat is pretty-much the same as the older games except the big change is there is no random encounters and there's a more dynamic camera system. You can see the enemies while running around in the field and can choose to engage them or not. This let's you set your own pace and I think it's a nice change that helps keep the game up-to-date in the genre.
The other big change I noticed is how early on in the game you unlock fast-travel. In the older DQ games you wouldn't acquire the fast-travel spell ""Zoom"" until much later in the game once you'd gotten the main character to a certain level. In DQ11 you reach a point quite early in the game where you unlock Zoom as a feature after a certain story event. The rest of the spells are learned by reaching certain levels with certain characters - same as the older games.

Nothing in Dragon Quest 11 is over-complicated but everything is just implemented so well. The ""Character Builder"" is an awesome system that lets you unlock new abilities and increase the attributes of your characters. Much like the license board system in Final Fantasy. There's a fair amount of freedom to be had with each character basically filling 2-3 roles each. For instance, one of the characters can equip staves and be a magic user while always being able to have claws for more of a melee-focus if that's what you want to do.

There's also a great crafting system in the game. It's quite simple but has just enough going on to keep you on your toes and gets more enjoyable as the game progresses.

The world of Dragon Quest 11 is awesome. It's region-based with an overworld that you can explore in a ship. There's a lot of back-tracking but I really enjoyed this because one region connects to the next to give the world the sense of being interconnected and I loved getting to know the different spaces.
Each town has it's own theme which are clearly stereotypes of real life. There's the Spanish town, the Nordic town, the French town, etc. The stereotyping is very strong in this game and it makes fun of itself a lot. I did find it a bit un-immersive seeing places so blatantly based off the real world.

The writing in this game is so good. It honestly reminded me of The Witcher 3 (I know that sounds crazy when you compare the art-styles, but hear me out...) with how you're helping different communities with their problems: Lifting a curse, reuniting long-lost lovers, solving a mystery. It's like a more family-friendly Witcher game. The voice-acting is honestly pretty good. The general tone of the game is quite light-hearted. There's lots of jokes and poking fun at things, but it can also be really sad, and when it does get sad it doesn't feel forced. It's sad because a situation will be generally sad. This is a big issue I've had lately with modern JRPG writing. It seems to not really hit the mark when it comes to trying to be deep and emotional and sad. It can often feel too forced and end up being just cringy and unrelatable. Dragon Quest 11 seems to avoid a lot of this and I found myself really caring about characters and what they had to say.

The difficulty of the game was interesting. I breezed through the majority of this game's main story with only a couple bosses giving me trouble. It's a very easy game for the most part. Then the end-game hits and it gets pretty hectic. The post-story gameplay was really enjoyable though. I loved travelling around the world and finding all the sweet loot and gearing-up my party for the final superbosses. You can max-out your stats if you want but it will take time. The grind is there if you want it.",1656470232,1656470232,True,6,0,0.595375716686248779,0,True,False,False

I had significant fun with my adventure throughout the lands of Erdrea, and felt myself really getting pulled into this world.  I laughed at and with the characters, I felt deep emotions in parts, and felt a sense of triumph when I completed the main story line.  I have not yet played through the post-game content, but I'm sure will be just as jam packed with fresh new story lines and adventure.
        Expecting something akin to the Persona series (my only JRPG before this) I initially felt a little out of my element, but quickly adjusted to this new style of standard turn-based combat without extra turns like I was used to.  The addition of pep-up and pep powers was also a very unique mechanic that I really enjoyed.  I always felt a surge of power when one of my teammates triggered it, and also always felt my stomach drop whenever an enemy went pep-up.  This feeling of ""Good lord, they're about to do something crazy!"" always felt refreshing, and never got old.
         Story wise, I at first didn't feel as drawn to the characters as I thought I would.  It took me a solid 20 hours or so to become fully engrossed in each of them, but when I did, I truly cared for each one.  After the end of the first act of the main story, I could feel the heroes' despair, and I was worried about what would happen next.  In-between the first and second act, there were a couple of bonus stories of your companion's, which I did feel like they dragged on quite a bit.  I just kept thinking ""This is taking so long, let me get back to the main story, PLEASE!""  I really do wish that it was JUST a bonus feature, like something in the main menu, which the game prompted you to do at the appropriate time, and not a forced extra 5 hours of non-hero action.  Overall, I did enjoy the story and plot, there were just a couple of my own nit-picks that I wish could have rectified.
           In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this title to anyone who thinks even slightly that they might enjoy it.  Or better yet, go play the demo through to the end!  It's the full game, that just prohibits you from going farther than a certain point in the story, but will allow you to play after that and continue to explore if you wish without a time limit.  If you then purchase the full game, all of your progress will carry over, and you will get some nice little bonuses to completing the Demo the full way, so why not take the easy money route for a trial?  Final Verdict: 9.5/10 ; Docked points for tedious middle section, but that's it.

After: After fully completing the story, defeating the final boss, and earning every steam achievement possible, I can positively say that this game was worth it.  Every penny.  If I was to make a list of the games that I could go back and play for the first time again, this one hits among the top ranks.  Even while mindlessly grinding/achievement hunting, I was always having a blast.  I wanted to search every nook and cranny, do every side quest, and obtain every customization option just to see what they looked like.  Every battle, another puzzle.  Every location, another exploration waiting to unfold.  Every cinematic, another opportunity to make you laugh, cry, or become more invested in the story and its characters.  I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed my time with this game, and it ranks among my favorites, and will for probably years to come.  This was one of those games that I kept putting off finishing because I just didn't want it to end.  If this game ever goes on sale, buy it.  And if you have enough free cash to blow, please consider it.  It was one of the greatest stories I've ever had the fortune to experience.",1619024687,1655781368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Has added content that the original doesn't have.

Can go back to previous chapters meaning technically the game has a ng+

Clears up some plot holes at the start of act 2

Can skip custscenes

Graphically it's a downgrade thank god for the modding community

To preface, NOTHING about the game whether it is story, combat mechanics, character archetype, style of progression are new. In fact, one might easily predict and anticipate what comes next in the story. All of these, what could be deemed reused elements, are prevalent throughout the game, and that is one of if not the biggest strength of DQ11: familiar, nostalgic gameplay. As the eleventh entry in the mainline Dragon Quest games, DQ11 is prime testament to the RPG genre and the game industry as a whole: you don't need completely new things to have a great game. The foundation on which DQ11 builds its structure is beyond sturdy, staying true to classical ideas of JRPGs. The story is basic in nature: you're the hero, go save the world. The turn-based combat system doesn't change nor does it get any more complicated, save for the introduction of the pepped state a few hours into the game, throughout the game. Character archetypes are also simple, you have your warriors, monks, spell casters, and thief. Gear progression is simple, give the character the piece of gear that raise their numbers. In addition, most pieces of gear can be shared among party members. Crafting is relatively simple to grasp. Specializations in combat, i.e. being a tank, single target damage dealer, AOE sweeper, buffs caster, Magic DPS, healer, etc., are also possible for every party member with the choice of ""respecing"" being very forgiving in cost. Grinding for levels and stats are prevalent in-game, with most post-game content requiring the player to be at max level. 
If a player chooses to do everything in the game, it would easily be a 100+ hour time sink. And that was the case for me. I chose to pick up DQ11 early in April of 2022, and I played for many hours on end. It was around the 50-hour mark that I realize how much I love playing this game. Playing this game helped me remember my roots and the reasons why I love playing RPGs.  DQ11 is one of the few games that, after 100% the game, I still want to keep playing. The gameplay loop was satisfying, the characters are likable, the story, although very basic and linear, is great for leading the player on. The challenges in post-game are great tests of the player's mastery of the combat system. The crafting system is engaging, the wonderful voice-acting is prevalent throughout the game, and the music is always a joy to listen to. There are complaints about the graphics being downgraded from the vanilla version as the Definitive Edition on PC is a port of the Switch edition, but that can be remedied by installing some mods to bring back the original textures and quality. With only some nit-picky flaws, DQ11 is simply a must for any fan of RPGs.",1654120964,1654120964,True,6,0,0.566108822822570801,0,True,False,False

This game has been in my wishlist for a loooong time. When I see a sale I happened to have a free time and immediately bought it. For a few hours I kinda disappointed and thinking ""How come this game have huge positive score, it feels kinda generic."" Hooo boooyyy. That was a  mistake from my end which I accepted a long time ago. 

Game shows it's true face later on (nearly 10-15 hours later) and from that point forward it's kind a snow roll. Really really good story, classic JRPG mechanics and really beautiful world and graphics. 

But at two aspects, game hit me from my heart: English voice overs and depths of our teammates' characters. Friends, this game's English voices are soooooooo good that I really find myself speechles most of the time. I really cannot praise it enough. PERFECT in every sense. Normally I play games with their original voices but I'm really glad that I chose to play this game with English VO.

And our teammates. Again at first I thought ""Ok, here comes a clown. Ok here comes an old man."" etc. etc. Man oh maaaaan. Each and everyone of them are so unique and beside their perfect voices they have brilliant back stories. Really unbelivable! I really didin't expected that and blown of by these aspects of the game.


So in short, this game is solid in all around aspects but there are lots of areas that make this game a very dear for me. Huge thumbs up if you like JRPG's with really good story and amazing characters.",1653242467,1653242616,True,17,0,0.714751541614532471,2,True,False,False

- I had purchased the original DQXI and had to rebuy this version for the extra content. They said that the engines were completely different between this version and the original which I don't really buy. Granted I did buy this on sale, but there was never any option for an upgrade or to buy this at a cheaper price because I owned the original.

- Overworld exploration is a bit clunky at times in 3D mode. There are plenty of ledges and things I feel you should be able to jump down, that are blocked with an invisible wall. There are so many of these that it's actually quite frustrating, especially with the amount of time some of these would save.

I will say, if you do own the original however, it is worth upgrading to this version for the extra content. It's almost like this game does not end. I've done a majority of the sidequests so far and the post game is incredible.",1653185613,1653185613,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

Good: This is the very best JRPG released in a long time. Must buy if you like JRPGs.
Bad: This game is REALLY long. Avoid if you're looking for a more fast paced experience that won't last you the rest of your life.

Detailed version: 
Good: 
- Superb art style (especially on a big great 4K display).
- Incredibly deep lore, if you take time to dig into it. The game doesn't give you all answers right on the main path.
- Great combination of traditional JRPG elements and ""fresher"" features.
- Definitive Edition contains many QOL improvements that help completing a 100%, among other things.
- Customized characters perk path allow for some different playstyle for each characters.
- A lot of side quests and optional stuff to keep you playing more.
- Difficulty is perfect: Sprint too much and you'll eventually get overwhelmed and you don't need to grind for too long when you need too; also: key bosses REALLY aren't wimps. Get ready for some great challenges along the path.
- Additional REALLY challenging options available on game completion for even more challenge.
- This game is a celebration of the entire DQ franchise and it ties all DQ games together in an incredibly well thought manner. 
- Even with all its difficulty, the complexity and subtlety of a JRPG, the game is really kid friendly. My 7 years old daughter likes the game really much and she progressed surprisingly far in the game. Don't hesitate to share the fun with your kids! 
- NO MISSABLE!!! Really, no joke. This game is really ""100% friendly"". The devs took good care of making sure it's not possible to miss anything you might want to get at any given time in the game. There's only 1 dungeon you can't access after completing it and even then, the game does teleport all the treasure chests to a corresponding location once the dungeon is cleared. Same can be said for monsters you may have missed.

Personal note: To me, this game doesn't really have ""bads"" or flaws"", but JRPG being one of my favorite game genre, I'm going to have to remove my ""biased fan boy"" glasses and put some bads for the sake of making my review as neutral as possible and maybe prevent some people from buying the ""wrong"" game for them.

Bad: 
- VERY LONG game. Don't play if you're looking for something quick and fast. Don't trust those walkthroughs online that claims the game can be completed within 50-60 hours: you're mostly only gonna have act 1 completed and maybe a little bit of act 2 at the 60 hours mark. the game has 3 acts and an optional boss upon completion of act 3, end of Act 2 is ""considered"" the regular game ending and Act 3 is the ""True/secret Ending"".   
- The original and base DQ11 game already had a LOT of content. The additional content from the Definitive Edition may feel like bloat to some.
- A section of the game has a big melancholy feel, due to plot points, and the music does follow the game's 
 mood along. Many have complained that, for instance, the over world map music at that point is unbearable, 
 making the section a drag to progress through.

...

But really, no joke, what are you waiting for? GO GET THE GAME NOW!!!

By the time I got to Act 3 I felt like I was finally playing the game I wanted to play, but had lost interest in the plot. It just only took me 120 hours to get there. And after beating Act 3, I felt there had been some moments where the plot piqued my interest again, but not enough to hold it to the finish line. And Act 1 plot was mostly weak other than the start and introduction of new party members, with some exceptions of some neat isolated side stories like the town with the cursed mural and the mermaid story. I feel like if I had kids, this would be a fun game series to play with them, but nothing I would go through again and i have no desire to explore the other games in the franchise after beating this one.

[spoiler] Also the theme of forgiveness and to let go of grudges is a good one, but when you think about how nothing in this story is ever truly anyone's fault for the evil things they do, it ends up feeling ultimately shallow as a theme. [/spoiler]

DQXI is a storied adventure with a strong cast of likable heroes. The story moves at a leisurely pace but never feels too longly drawn. Characters are given ample room to grow and contain interesting, albeit somewhat cliched, story arcs. 

Combat mechanics are basic turn-base affair; if you've played a JRPG in the past 20+ years, the game's combat systems will feel very familiar. If not, the game does a solid job of explaining its systems without ever overwhelming in unnecessary complexities. This is not to say the game is derivative or too easy, but rather well designed for all experiences. 

On PC with added mods from Nexus.com, the game looks quite nice with crisp textures, especially the lead characters/heroes, and bright, varied land/city-scapes that are joyful to explore. You navigate these semi-open spaces in real-time and are able to initiate most enemies, with the exception of a few encounters, on your terms at which point the game turns to its turn-based combat system. 

The sound design is quite good. Character dialogue is nicely acted and the music is sublime, but it would have been nice to have a few more symphonic tracks mixed in, as the game takes dozens of hours to reach completion. You'll be listening to the same few, though excellent, tracks a few too many times by credits time.

2. Name of everything. IDK why this series of game have to change name of everything between JP/ENG it's really hard to remember.",1651927264,1651927264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great game, if you're new to RPGs or 8 years old. the constant immaturity theme and the Main Hero having no personality of any kind make it sometimes difficult to play. I'm not even gonna finish the game, mainly because its just a continuation of running around back and forth from point A to point B while somehow ""earning"" accolades. At no point was the game challenging. The only hard part about the game is the occasional required navigating of cryptic messages and/or vague clues.  The story is predictable and with overly familiar themes. In addition, even though the game attempts to be 'open world' its a very linear timeline. The only real choice you get in the game is how to spent each character's skills from a very basic skill tree. Most of the skills are very similar to one another and there is very little variety when choosing the 'best' abilities. I feel as though the only unique aspect about this game unlike any other is the ability to switch between 2D and 3D graphics. The graphic in 3D are pretty, and runs seamlessly and smooth. The sound track is enjoyable with enough variety as to not become bored of hearing the same thing on repeat. All in all its a decent game, I just wish Act III would have more than just ""the same old song and dance"". Its just a series of running around doing mundane tasks with no challenge at all. Maybe I will be able to force myself to finish, but as of now I'm stopping about 10-15 hours into ACT III because I'm so bored.",1651767730,1651767730,True,0,0,0.449826985597610474,0,True,False,False

This is a pretty long game, which you typically expect from a JRPG. And from what I gather it's a ported version of the Nintendo Switch version of the game, and the devs made a few changes from the original. Like taking out an annoying minigame/sidequest, and some quality of life improvements like being able to use the Forge anywhere instead of just at campsites, being able to buy forging materials in the Forge interface, etc. Things that take away some of the tedium. Which I generally approve of.

It's a fairly boilerplate story, good vs evil, fate of the world, etc. It's also, at least without tweaking it, pretty easy, at least this version is. With barely any grinding I got to a level where monsters on the overworld would run away from me when they saw me.  But being able to set the AI to fight battles for me put the game almost on autopilot. Upgrade your character's skills and equipment regularly, and you can set the Tactics setting to Fight Wisely or No Mercy and just sit back, even with boss fights. I pretty much did that for the whole game. This can take away most of the challenge, but you can always turn on special challenge features to make things harder for you. But I don't have a lot of time, so I don't mind playing on what is basically ""Story Mode."" I've beaten the main game and some of the post-game, but got distracted by a new release I'd been waiting for.

If you never played any Dragon Quest game before, I highly recommend you to play this one first. 

With that out of the way, I'd like to discuss about the Square Enix dumb idea to upgrade the game without respecting the original buyer of Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age PC Edition by not giving them any Discount or Free Update whatsoever,  you have to get both games at full price back then. Thankfully, it's now on sale, so I don't really want to brag about it again, the good thing is the original version become this rare and somewhat removed game catalogue in your library, so it increases some sort of value to your steam account at some point if you already bought the game.

Changes : 
there isn't alot of changes if you have played the original version, but its all depends on your perspective, so let's get to it : 

1. Japanese Voice 
2. 2D Mode
3. Slight changes in third person point of view
4. The Performance is better than the original, but the texture feels a bit downgraded (maybe because it was developed for switch) depends on your PC, I recommend this version if you have an old computer or an M series NVIDIA Laptop. If you have a high end PC, you can use ultra wide settings by changing the unreal engine config, and you can set the game above 60FPS, in my cases I set it 144FPS and it rarely drops under 130. 
5. You can take pictures with your party without having NVIDIA Ansel. The absent of NVIDIA Ansel kinda disappoint me though, since I can't use F12 to take a screenshot, now if I want to take a screenshot I have to manually put that screenshot to my steam image folder, and then upload it to steam manually. (EDIT : Ansel is still supported)
6. You can't access the first person camera, I don't know why they removed this one, they should just put both camera options when taking photos. 
7. The party can now follow you in the overworld. This one is my favorite because it doesn't make sense when you travel alone and suddenly when the monster attack you, you fight with your party XD, it kinda make the game more fun actually. 
8. You can use the fun size forge everywhere.
9. Easier game than the original version, altho the original game wasn't really that hard. 
10. Orchestral Soundtrack without using mod.
11. You can choose your marriage option. 

Overall, there aren't many Big Changes outside of Japanese voice and 2D mode, but this game is really fun to play again and again, I have 300hrs on the original version. And I highly recommend this one to be your first Dragon Quest game or your first version of Dragon Quest XI.",1648616512,1650496036,True,15,1,0.640770256519317627,5,True,False,False

I also unironically enjoyed the English voice acting, though I wish some of the characters (especially most of the monsters with speaking lines) didn't talk so slowly. The orchestrated soundtrack was mostly on par with that of Dragon Quest VIII, but there's an awful lot of songs that were carried over from previous games including VIII, and the new ones are a bit of a mixed bag too. The story is quite by-the-book as you might expect from the series, but there's enough twists and turns to keep it from being too terribly stale, and plenty of interesting and endearing characters even beyond the playable cast.

Unfortunately, the original on steam had a midi soundtrack instead of a full symphonic one, and they added some other content to the game.

This game originally released on Steam in 2018, and it helped to get me out of the turn based slump i'd been in for some time, as this game takes it back to it's roots, with a classic fantasy setting and a fun, simple combat system. The soundtrack is one of the best, and it's definitely got some tearjerking moments. The best moments in this game don't come from the main story, but rather the world, the side quests, and the character origin stories are great too. They're really good at inserting a side character for a few hours, and making you feel like they've been there the whole game, you get invested. 

People have complained about some of the voice acting, but I actually really liked it.

This comes down to personal preference, but I could not get invested in all the world had to offer because it just didn't feel that rewarding.

Even Dragon Quest VIII on PS2 had a more heroic feel than this one. DQXI is very well built, has a somewhat interesting story and even while this is a 3D version, the option of playing it in 2D is available. The music is excellent and the combats are fun and satisfying. Personally, I could have lived without the pink outfit forced on the character for a long period of time before any other outfits are available later in the game. It's something I don't relate to in real life so that it feels more or less personable to play and diminishes the feeling of immersion. The character is also much too young and the themes are a little immature which makes this title more suitable for players aged 12-17. I also don't like having a political agenda shoved in my mouth from a game publisher. And, unfortunately, this is what DQ XI is doing. For that reason, I can't recommend this game.

- It really does a great job at making a old school RPG still feel amazing to this day.
- Love the voices with the accents and how they fit in each area (Spanish, British, etc.) Keep making it unique like this please, it's what gave the series charm for me.
- 2D mode added to the game for that retro feel and can swap anytime in gameplay
- New additions added to the game for challenge and content
- and many more things. My second time playing through the game after playing Original 11 and I have to say, I really enjoy it.

My complaint really is this stuff should've been in Original 11. If not that, a massive discount should've been given to those who owned it before. Not to mention they removed it from purchase which was sketchy. Still for those who haven't played it and love classic RPGs, it's worth every penny. It's basically the same game with enhancements. Also it's based off the Switch version, so the graphics are downgraded sadly.

Overall I'd give it a Rating of 9/10 again

I do recommend downloading mods for the best experience though.

It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.

If you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)

As for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.

p.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",1648146688,1648169835,True,59,0,0.843138277530670166,2,True,False,False

The Dragon Quest saga is the root of every JRPG ever made, and as such, bears tradition as a badge of pride. Where today's trends go towards fast-paced action-oriented flashy games, DQ11 is a slow burn, a sprawling epic of hundreds of hours, tons of stories and a world to leisurely savour.
It's mechanics, while simple - never straying too far from the original formula - are enough to keep the game going. With lots of sidequests, activities and a story that never rushes but never stops, you are always focused on the adventure ahead of you. No fancy tricks or trendy modernities.
The story is the very definition of an [i]epic[/i]. It reveals a world most complex than it seems at first glance, it reunites the whole saga beautifully and its incredible twists - which I wouldn't dare spoil here - are breathtaking.

This is, above all, a love letter to the Dragon Quest saga, and to JRPGS. It is all that defines the genre... only cranked up to [b]eleven[/b].

The over abundance of armor, weapons and accessories feel a little over-bloated especially when leveling moves quickly and stats bonuses are only useful during special types of fights, I felt there could have been a way to minimize that or create a large crate of special type of gear that did not individually focus on only specific harmful effects.

It ties together so many of the things I loved about Dragon Quest 5 and 9. It contains all the tear jerker emotional elements that made 5 such a treat to play and the fun exploration and character building of 9 (without the hassle of having to reset your level every time you want to respec your characters).

You've probably read other reviews so you know it's a traditional style RPG without many bells and whistles. Despite that it's still a fun experience worth having.

What really stood out to me was the character design, particularly the boss and enemy models. They have a lot of style and depth with every boss being voice acted and given some sort of back story.
The story hits all of the elements you've seen a million times in JRPGs but I feel like they throw enough of a twist on each one to keep it interesting. It subverts your expectations at every turn so it doesn't get stale.

There are a few major drawbacks to this game. The first is that the voice acting is great but they insist on giving silly accents to characters and they are sometimes outright bad. If you're going to have an Italian sounding character they should probably hire an Italian speaker so the accent is natural, otherwise just drop the accents and talk normally.

The music is also quite limited for a game of this size. You will hear the same songs so many times that it will start to get on your nerves. I had to switch from the symphonic soundtrack to the normal one because having everything performed by an orchestra made it blend together so much. This is because many zones have the same song just slightly modified and having the same instrumentation for every version takes away from the idea that each is a variation on the same theme. You will have the battle and town music stuck in your head for weeks after playing this game.

The other bad thing is that this game is very close to being a series of monster halls. There is almost no exploration and 90% of zones suffer from the horrible FFXIII/WoFF syndrome of being straight halls with tiny detours to make you feel like you're finding things.
Some areas open up to more exploration but it's almost always just a short path to a treasure and back, you don't actually explore.
Combine this with the mini map and quest markers and you can run through the whole game without stopping to think once about where you're going. It's nice in one sense but totally destroys the feeling of exploration RPGS are known for.",1645558873,1645721382,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The major characters are very well written (except for the silent protagonist, of course. It's about time the series dropped this ""tradition""), the gameplay systems are engaging and rewarding, and the world is fun to explore.

However, parts of the story feel quite redundant, requiring you to do very similar things at the same places at different points in the story. It's a step down from Dragon Quest IX, which did something similar but with much better execution.

The combat system was changed a little; you don't give all the commands at once at the start of a turn and then watch them play out depending on the characters' speed stats. Instead you choose what to do for each character just when it's their turn to act. This sacrifices some of the more engaging strategic elements of the classic combat system and makes the speed stat pretty much meaningless.

Considerably long playtime, game mechanic/optimization choices that are almost entirely opt-in, and a cast of characters just interesting enough to have you emotionally invested in them by the final arc of the game.

Unfortunately, the game really ""starts"" once you're about halfway into the game. Up until that point, the game is mostly a tutorial, giving you a hand and introduction into every character type, every mechanic, most spells. If you're worried you won't understand something because of the fast pace and dense narrative surrounding the Dragon Quest universe:

Don't sweat it. There's a Chosen One, an Evil Guy, Magic Stuff, and friends who help you Fight & gather Stuff.

The forging mechanic is my favorite part of the game. A lot of your equipment quality boils down to how willing you are to gather materials, forge items, and reforge your mistakes, should you not be able to forge another. I spent about a quarter of my time with the Fun-Size Forge, forging and reforging items, clawing desperately for that satisfying +3 bonus.

Party composition matters a lot in certain scenarios, but not at all in others.

If you're not a fan of grinding enemies, just fight each unique monster (including recolors and palette swaps), 3 times each before moving on to the next area. If you're good enough at micromanagement in combat and forging high-quality gear, you'll only find yourself grinding at the very early beginning, dead-middle, and very end of the game, before hitting the post-game.


At the end of the day, after 60+ hours just to reach the post-game, I found myself satisfied. Not overjoyed with the game, but satisfied enough with my purchase. I'll have to see how I feel post-post-game.

UPDATE: It took me another 50 hours to beat the challenges, get the gear, and finish the game in a manner I wanted. After fiddling around with grinding forever, I used Cheat Engine to speed up the process for myself. I highly recommend doing the same once you've done everything you want, and are ready for the final battle. The final fight of the post-game is ultimately underwhelming, but, I like how they presented the boss. The post-game was, at times, more fun than the core game.

Once you finish the core game, if you're feeling burnt-out, take a few months off before starting the post-game. It made all the difference to me.",1612965885,1644555164,True,0,0,0.470531076192855835,2,True,False,False

However, the focus of the game is the story and its legacy to the franchise. However, I will admit that there are some parts that was not great especially how some of the characters gets such an expansive quest about themselves where others do not. None the less, it is gorgeous game with the standard turn-based combat but with a great story and focus on the main cast, it is a fun game to play.

I have never played a Dragon Quest game before, but all reviews online said this one is fantastic. I would say this really was a perfect game to introduce me to the Dragon Quest series. I didn't need to know anything before playing and I didn't feel like I was missing anything.

[u]List of things I noticed about the game[/u]
[b]Game Length and Gameplay and Combat[/b]
This game took me 50 hours to beat the main story and another 20 hours to finish the great bonus content. I almost never had to look up walkthrough information online because the game was never confusing. I feel I played this game very efficiently and without too many detours. It's just a really long game. The combat was simple and turn-based. The skill trees were simple, but offered some minimal character customisation for combat. I did not find grinding levels necessary until very late game, but there are highly efficient methods to do so if one googles. The game has very nice modern graphics and character design by Akira Toriyama (Creator of Dragon Ball) which was interesting.
[b]Story[/b]
I wanted to play a simple and straightforward JRPG that gave me the feel of old RPGs. The story felt casually pleasant for the majority of the time. There were a few parts that I rushed through because they were boring, however, all the most important moments/events in the story were awesome and had great impact. Overall, the story was good where it counts.
[b]Characters[/b]
I really did like most of the characters. The protagonist is a silent protagonist type that doesn't really have much personality on purpose. The other characters are pleasant. The characters I didn't like were merely a bit boring. The group of characters is fairly diverse, so there should be at least a few characters that a person will like.

I'm not good at giving long, storied reviews about the magnificence of a game, even if I absolutely adore it, my mind wanders easily and it's hard for me to keep to my tasks. For a long time I've been looking for a good RPG to play, I was never a fan of JRPG titles solely out of intimidation. I was burnt out for a long time on gaming and practically had to force myself to play something to keep myself from being bored and having nothing to do, then along came this game.

I've never been so mesmerized by a story or world before, the adventure you set out on is so open and free. To me it felt like sticking your head in the freezer and breathing in the ice cold air after a long hard and hot day outside. The mysteries that this world sets upon you to explore, discover, and overcome, has set a bar so high for me in expectation for the rest of the series that I should've saved the game for last. Playing this has now made me wonder how the other games in the franchise might treat me. 

I cannot explain to you how happy this game made me over the two weeks that I enjoyed it. Sure there were times where battles got a bit tedious, but that's common if you don't prepare yourself properly. Overcoming that and seeing the next cutscene in the story was always a treat to the heart.

When I started this game I had low expectations for it, I was a big JRPG fan back in the SNES days with Final Fantasy 3 ( or 6 for the purists ) Chrono Trigger and others.

This game really feels like a love letter to those classic games, I had never played a Dragon Quest game before this so I didn't know it was also a love letter to the long history the series has.

But even more than that I loved that the story would get you comfortable and on autopilot to then suddenly throw some depth in there and really let you know you're in a expertly crafted narriative as well.

In short for me I came for the turn based almost classic game play and stayed for over 100 hours on the PS4 and hopefully on Steam for the story and characters.",1609527679,1641654678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Great music.

Cons:
- Unnecessary name changes for characters and locations between Japanese and English versions.

For non series fans I would say you may be disappointed if you come in with the wrong expectations. You should almost view DQ as a leisure game (e.g. animal crossing) with combat and a focus on story, although there are difficult fights too for the most part the game does not aim to challenge the player or ask for complicated strategies, it's more about the pure joy of adventuring in a fantasy world ( living the hero's journey ,finding items, powering up etc. you know the drill)

 If you loathe turn based combat that will likely sour your experience (as there is a lot of it) although you could still enjoy the world outside combat, on the other hand, no random encounters in this DQ so you're never going to get less combat in a DQ game.

The game seems to lean a bit on the simple side compared to other past titles so it may be a gentle starter for non-Jrpg fans or somewhat disappointing for vets of the genre.

First off, I want to mention that I bought the vanilla version of this game and it lacked key components that made this game feel whole. I couldn't upgrade or get a refund to get the S version and I rate that version lower.

- Story: I don't play DQ games strictly for the story as they are straight forward and traditional, but I'm always pleased when I get a good surprise or plot twists. DQ 11 didn't deliver here. You embark on an quest to get to the world tree. Where previous titles start you on a quest, they usually save the real important quest for a good plot twist. Without stepping into spoiler territory you are on the same quest for over half the game without motivation for doing so. It's not until after this quest is attempted that the story starts to get interesting. 3/4 of this game is so predictable it hurts. I didn't want to progress the story and was angry with the main characters at times because of the plot. 5/10

-Characters: One of the better things about this game. You might start out disliking the characters because they have very black and white personalities and most of them are in your face. Later in the game though, they start to grow on you and evolve a little from certain events that take place. 7/10

-Mechanics:  I wasn't completely satisfied with the item dispersal. You get recipes or shop items at uncomfortable times that don't make sense a lot of the time. DQ8's alchemy pot opened up so many paths for equipment management especially for replay value. The alchemy pot had it's own sub mechanics like saint's ashes, devil's tails, and an extra item upgrade to balance the game. DQ11 replaces it with a gimmick forge. It's not a horrible addition but it's uses are limiting. The casino is pretty good in that regard. Combat is more fluid adopting an active agility stat approach. I absolutely loved this in FFX and it works decently enough here. 6/10

-Soundtrack: I had high hopes for the sound track of this game, but it didn't deliver at all for me. The bad music is so memorable I had nightmares after playing this game. The vanilla overworld music in this game is the most ear grating overworld song I have ever listened to. Luckily the S version allows you to revert to DQ8 overworld music. This game recycles so much music it's unbelievable. 4/10 

-Graphics: Easily the best thing about DQ11. Every location is almost breath taking and the enemies are brought to life with vigor. Kind of felt like seeing a book get made into a good movie in that regard. 9/10",1640462804,1640818129,True,3,0,0.568106293678283691,0,True,False,False

[u]New player experience[/u]:
Let's be honest, the gameplay is not new player friendly. It expects you to know your way around JRPG-s, and Dragon Quest games. There is no explanation about most of the stuff, including what stats, spells - abilities do, and most of these is not obvious. Also, there is no indication about how much damage a spell-ability will do, so you have to guess.
[u]Combat[/u]:
The combat is typical, turn based JRPG combat. In 3D mode looks really nice and thank to the animations it feels really fun, engaging. But sadly it has it's problems. 
You are, in theory, able to control turn order, with a certain stat, and it is important to certain bosses or challange fights. But the game randomly decides, that it does not care.
You can move around the battle area, but it does not matter where you stand, spells, including aoe spells, hit everyone in the target group.
There are a lot of CC and instant kill mechanics in the game, that the enemies can use against you. But, it is impossible, until the endgame, to protect yourself against everything, so for the first 80-100 hours, there will be a lot of time, where you are just watching and doing nothing. And it is especially bad in 2D mode.
Bossfights can be pretty annoying sometime, because they have so much crazy abilities, but this makes them a challange. Especially the last super-super-super-secret boss. For that, you will have to be extremly well prepared, with min-maxed characters.
Maybe one of the most annoying thing in combat is, that there are no health indicators on enemies. You have no idea how much health they have left. On regular mobs, that dies in 1-2 shots, it is whatever. But on bosses. It is really bad. Especially on Wheel of Harma, where move count matters. Basically, you have to read up in guides how much health bosses have, and count constantly, while playing.

Exploring the world is a pretty big part of the gameplay. And it is really well done. The game is not open world, but every area has a lot of hidden thinmgs to find, so it really worth it to explore. The world is colorful, and full of activities to do.
[u]Tinkerton and mandatory 2D[/u]:
This is the part i hate. The idea of this part of the game is pretty good, but the mandatory 2D part makes it terrible. The 2D combat is tedious, long, and boring. You are just watching and reading the combat log. The turn order is more messed up than in 3D. And remember the CC problem, what i mentioned? Well here, it is worse. It can lead you to just do nothing, just read the combat log for minutes. And the missing health indicators, are the finishing touch on making it as bad as it can be.
[b]10/6[/b]

[b]-- GRAPHICS --[/b]
It is a JRPG. It has anime like graphics. Which look really good here. Even the 2D graphics look nice. 
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- SOUNDS --[/b]
The music, well it is the same music as in other Dragon Quest games. Nothing new, but still good. The japanese voice cast, well they brought in the big guns. Top tier, A list voice actors, who gave everything they had into this role. Amazing. And the enviroment sounds, well they perfectly fit the game.
[b]10/10[/b]

[b]-- STORY --[/b]
The story, well not an amazing story, but a really fun, really engaging one, with a lot of twists and turns. Obviously there are some anime cliches, and some parts where you can predict what will happen, but still, it is a really good story. 
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- CHARACTERS --[/b]
The game has a really colorful cast. They are all fun characters, each with well thought personality and backstory. And all the party members have unique talent trees, which makes it much more immersive.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- WORLD & WORLDBUILDING --[/b]
Dragon Quest has a big, colorful world. During the game you learn a lot about it, it's history. It is given to the players in a really good, non overwhelming way. Not perfect, but a lot of other games could learn from this example.
[b]10/8[/b]

[b]-- REPLAYABILITY --[/b]
There are no big choices that makes you want to replay the game, to see the outcomes, but replaying this could be fun, just because of the story. And, if you did not turn them on for the first gameplay, the Draconian challanges can add some more challange to your second playtrough.
[b]10/6[/b]

[b]--TL;DR--[/b]
It is a good, really fun game, with a lot of annyoing stuff in it. But if you can overcome those, you will have an amazing experience. 
Worth every penny.

                                                                                          [h1] Plot [/h1]

The story follows the reincarnation of the Luminary from the Erdrick trilogy, who is trying to fulfill his destiny of saving the world from the forces of impending evil. The Luminary is orphaned from birth due to a tragic event that jumpstarted an apocalyptic force that threatens to plunge Erdea into turmoil. The main villain—who orchestrated the tragedy during the Luminary infancy—serves as the antithesis to the player throughout the whole journey. Many subplots, towns, citizens, and travelers are plagued by the effects of the main villain attempt to dominate Erdea by killing the Luminary. The rest of the plot focuses on preparing the Luminary to fight the villain in a fashion told exactly like Joseph Campbell’s theory of mythological story-telling arc “the hero with a thousand faces.” The story is a complete cliché from the start and rarely deviates from the norm but makes up for it with the novelty of interactions between characters, gameplay, and subplots that litter Erdea. 

The plight of the denizens of Erdea and the many towns you visit invite you in to interact and spend time with them. The game doesn't try to force you to develop compassion for them, rather through exploration of towns and solving side-quests you'll eventually grow to care for the places you visit. Every town had at least something going on, even if you aren’t clued into it immediately on your first visit. Later, the towns you’ve visited in the past are given new importance, which makes revisits compelling and purposeful. The plot can be broken into three acts.

Act 1 is very light-hearted and straightforward. There isn’t anything significant aside from a few subplots here and there, but you’ll mostly be experiencing Erdea and getting used to everything. Although I must add that this act felt like the weakest in the whole game because of the slow pacing. The fact that there was an issue of chasing after a key item throughout several towns with little progress felt like a huge fetch quest with no decent reward at the end. In Act 2, the pace begins to pick up and you’re finally making progress towards uncovering the villain and uncovering the mystery behind their circumstance. In Act 3, you’re treated to the full experience of Dragon Quest 11 S, including the new editions added to differentiate slightly from the original game. Act 3, in my opinion, is the best part of the game.

                                                                                      [h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Dragon Quest 11 features traditional turn-based combat with some gimmicks to spice up the formula. You still take turns hitting each other, but eventually, after enough turns characters and enemies can enter a “pepped up” state. This state confers various benefits, such as some stat benefits and access to new and unique skills for your party members. However, the most benefit you’ll get from a pepped up state is the ability to perform unique attacks that also grant bonuses when other party members are also pepped up. These ""pep skills"" can range from executing stronger attacks, party-wide buffs, to even becoming invulnerable for a few rounds. The only catch to pulling off these group pep skills is that you must learn the individual skills first for each party member that are locked behind their respective skill tree. There are rare items that you can find from monster drops and later in shops that can help you attain instant pepped up states but are locked until post-game to prevent breaking the game too early. It is a little shocking how easy you can break the game if you know what pep skills to use to amass copious amounts of EXP from ordinary encounters. A few of your party members can collaborate to perform pep skills that not only double your EXP but also double item drops. Coupled with that fact, on top of being able to re-enter the pepped up state in the same battle can also allow you to perform another pep skill that summons rare monsters that provide a huge EXP bonus, you’ll be drowning in EXP by the end of that one battle. But I digress.

You’ll eventually come across other party members with new skills and weapons that can expand your strategy. Each character can hold up to 2-3 weapons, but the stat proficiency, stat growth aptitude, and available skill trees heavily imply a preferred weapon type that maximizes one attribute (such as Heavy Wands primarily boosting the Magical Might stat). The good news is that, despite that, you will not be penalized and instead earn more potential to learn better pep skills should you decide to dabble with other weapon skill trees. There are no bosses that favor a particular strategy or character, so you’re free to mix and match to make every party and weapon combination viable. Where the game truly begins to differ further is through the newly added “Draconian Quests” for this Dragon Quest entry. You can select certain difficulty challenges that range from restricting what you can do to doubling all enemies’ stats. Some of them are novel, such as the option to enable town NPCs to lie to you and to include some white lies to clue you in on what you must do next. I recommend the “Stronger Monsters” difficulty for certain bosses to truly get that gameplay challenge that is lacking from some parts of the game. 

Where the gameplay begins to shine is with bosses in the post-game content. They are very challenging even without the Draconian Quests on. They force you out of a comfortable style of fighting and pressure you to adopt actual strategies. You [b] need [/b] to prepare in advance to beat post-game bosses. There are plenty of post-game bosses to tackle on and none of them feel impossible because of their combat script. You’ll know what to do after you’ve fought them once and you have a variety of ways to dispatch them. There are clever strategies that you can adopt to close level gaps very quickly and that level of freedom and creativity in fights is what is sorely missed in many modern RPG video games.

                                                                                    [h1] New Editions [/h1]

The “S” edition is a Switch port and carries all the newly added content from that port to this PC version. This includes Tickington town that was present only in the Japanese 3DS port, including the ability to play the whole game in 2D mode. I’ve never used the 2D mode much, aside from completing Tickington, but it has its charm if you used to play the older Dragon Quest titles. 2D model emulates the early design of Dragon Quest before it went 3D. There’s the added Japanese voice audio that was highly requested and I am truly grateful they included that. They added two new post-game super bosses that are easily the bragging point of this port. If you think the post-game in the base game was hard, try squaring against the added super bosses. Don’t even get me started on how hard they are with that Stronger Monsters difficulty turned on. One major downgrade I want to bring to attention is the graphics. Since DQ “S” is a Switch port, there’s a noticeable graphical fidelity drop. The textures and model quality pale in comparison to the original DQ 11 version that was taken down. The original DQ that was released for Steam is by far superior in terms of looks and runs smoother with very few bugs. Although, this downgrade would not matter if you don’t care about the graphics. 

                                                                                        [h1] Verdict [/h1]

If you’re wondering whether to pick up the game or not, rest assured you’re in for some quality content. I’d recommend waiting for the video game to go on sale because paying for the game at full price is too much considering what it has to offer.",1639037060,1639037109,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

For those who have enjoyed the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy franchises, this game is both delightful from a nostalgia factor, as well as exquisite as a modern RPG.  The story is deep and rich with numerous major and minor surprises, the music and background scenery are beautiful, the combat system is well done and fun, and the player becomes very attached and invested in the characters.  Explore every inch of this vast and beautiful game; you will be delighted over and over again.  You do have to build your characters pretty high to beat it, but it is very balanced and does not at all feel like a grind.  Most importantly, this is an incredibly FUN game, such as getting the first strike on enemies, bowling through enemies on the vast landscape with your horse, going through many sidequests (both in 2D and in 3D), being able to do dozens of combo moves with your multi-character party, and of course the fun-filled forge!

Story:
The story is honestly just what would you expect from a JRPG; There is the hero, there are your teammates (or Comrades) and of course the Demon Lord (Maou). An ancient evil is looming over Erdrea and with it also a Hero comes into the spotlight.

The premise is basic enough but you realize that its actually not until you reach the first city. You will travel through the vast open world, visit huge cities, talk with the people of Erdrea and help them in their hardships. I don't want to spoil the story for you but i can certainly say its beautiful; you will sometimes get goosebumps, sometimes cry or laugh with the characters and it will make you feel all kinds of emotions.

To me, the story felt like a mix of a Disney movie and a fantasy-themed Shonen Anime. I absolutely loved it!

Gameplay:
There are two modes you can play the game: 2D or 3D.
In 2D mode, you can play the entire game in classic JRPG style and in 3D mode, you can well.. experience the game in 3D (as seen in the screenshots in the store page)

First of all; If you dont like turn-based combat, you might not like the gameplay. 
If you do, you will like it. Its nothing special to be honest but its not bad either, its a bit modernized version of what you see in other recent JRPGs; 

There is the basic Fight, Magic, Flee option and a skill tree which can be used to gain new skills, improve stats (HP, STR, LCK etc.). There are also the Pep Powers which are abilities that grant an advantage over an enemy, debuff them but can also be used to grant buffs for the party. They can be used only when the required characters are in a ""Pepped"" state,  There are a bunch of these powers; some of them only require the player to be Pepped and there are also ones that require you and your teammate, only your teammate or the whole party needs to be Pepped.

The modernized (?) additions to the traditional turn-based combat system are; the ability to move while in combat, being able to change teammates in combat and the ability to change the speed of the combat (normal, fast or super-fast) which is useful while grinding.

That's about it about combat. Now, lets talk about transportation, subquests and minigames;

There are four ways of transportation which are: by walking, by horse, by sea with a ship or by air.
The first two are unlocked at the start of the game and the remaining two are unlocked gradually as you move through the story. You can freely control them but dont expect anything too advanced.

Subquests are a mixed bag for me to be honest. There are fun and interesting ones for sure but usually they are errand quests and they can sometimes get repetitive.

About Minigames;

There are three of them throughout the game which are Horse Racing, Gambling in the Casino and Fun-Sized Forge.

Horse Racing is basically what it sounds like. You ride your horse with the goal of being 1st to pass through the finish line and you get great rewards for it. There are 2 cups at first but you can unlock others as you progress through the story.

The Casino Minigame is an addicting one that can make you spend hours in front of a slot machine to win more coins. The coins you win from the machines can be exchanged for rewards such as Greatswords, Armor etc.

Fun-Sized Forge is a forge which you can use anywhere in the world to craft Weapons, Armor and Accessories. I called it a minigame because you have to manually craft them by putting the ingredients in and hitting a metal until its the shape of the thing you want to craft. If you fail to give it a shape that atleast looks like it, the session fails and you basically get shit. The items quality is decided by your craftsmanship to be exact.

Last but not least, there are also mini-medal collecting which are scattered through the game and the secret Minigame ""Pot-smashing"" which once you start smashing them, you can never stop to do so.

Almost forgot: Yes, you can fast-travel to places you once visited.

Graphics:
2D version of the game features beautiful pixel graphics that can make you feel nostalgic.
3D version don't look amazing but the art-direction is really good so it makes up for it and for a JRPG it certainly holds up.

Character designs are each unique with their face expressions, clothes and physical features.
And, for the people that will think they look like Dragon Ball characters, you are actually spot-on because they are drawn by Akira Toriyama, which is the creator of Dragon Ball.

Sound:

First, the soundtrack is really good but there aren't enough tracks for the game so they get repetitive after listening for the 900th time. I've found myself muting the game and opening JRPG Exploration OST playlists after awhile. It would be really tiring for ears if the option to switch the soundtrack to Orchestral version didn't exist.

Also, you have the option to switch between Japanese and English voices but i can only recommend the Japanese voice option for people that dont understand Japanese or for people that will play with JP Text because; Spell names, Character names (Major ones too), Place names, Enemy names and the dialogues really differ. For example one of the major characters, Erik is called Kamyu in the Japanese version which can confuse people as to thinking ""who the hell is Kamyu"" or stuff like the spell name being Zam but character saying DORUMA! when using it instead, the worst one is when a character cracking a joke but the text-box says something like ""Great!"" instead.

Luckily, the English Dub is also great.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, its a fun JRPG with a great story that will entertain for more than 100 hours. Buy it! You will definitely get your money's worth! :)

It’s a good game in the style of the more modern Dragon Quest -games. There is an option to play the game in more traditional fashion too, if you choose to for some reason to annoy yourself with random encounters.

The game is substantially long, with this version adding even more content, which some are my favorite parts of the game while some additions I loathe. The difficulty is one of my main gripes with the game as the game is laughably easy. There are ‘Draconian Quest’ options to up the difficulty, but you have to choose them at the start of the game. And, at least to me, as I chose most of the ‘Draconian Quests’, the end game bosses became a ridiculous RNG-fest while the main game was still quite easy even when avoiding most of the grinding.

And it’s funny, for a definitive edition, this is not the best-looking version of the game. There are a lot of graphical issues and downgrades from previous versions.

All-in-all, even though I did not mention many of the positive parts of the game, I do think it’s a great game. And luckily, you don’t have to trust reviews here: there is a hefty demo available for the game. If you have any interest in the game give it a try.

I have played most of the other Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest games over the years including the originals and the remakes. I love the series as a whole, and I think this game is an excellent addition. I'm always shocked that Dragon Quest as a series isn't more popular in the West and it's great to see this game do so well so we can see more come our way.

This game like all the Dragon Quest games is a semi-traditional JRPG with a sprawling open world and a large map to explore. Plenty of dungeons, towns, cities, and beautiful vistas dot the landscape of the continents and the seas are beautifully done.

Battle is traditional but comforting if you know the JRPG recipe, and Dragon Quest XI does it as well as it always has. Combat is more about planning out your build and equipment and then going with a tried and true method of quickly dispatching an enemy/group without taking much damage to yourself. Bosses end up being about trying a few strategies but mostly end up being: one person heals, one person buffs/debuffs, one person deals damage, and one person helps as needed. Fun but nothing substantially new besides the great visuals and the good music.

Speaking of Music, this series has always been known for it's fantastic soundtracks and the S: Definitive edition brings us back to that with the classic Symphonic Suite style to truly explore the depth and richness of the compositions. Though Koichi Sugiyama recently passed away I think he would have been proud of the great job done here. Everything from cutscenes, towns, cities, dungeons, battles, sailing, etc. all have their own composed music and it's performed brilliantly. If you have the regular version then you're missing out, and I will admit that it's a gripe of mine that the original release of DQXI did not include the higher quality OST.

Sound design and voice-overs are also classic, sometimes being quite serious but mostly poking fun at itself and there is a ton of humor in the way that characters speak to one another and the sound effects that come along with that. Voice-overs   have great quality to the voice, but can sometimes leave something to be desired in terms of delivery or editing.

Leveling is exciting because it brings with it the ability to go down specific paths in the skill trees and find ways to complement the party. As the party grows and more options become available, it's quite fun to experiment with the different ways that characters interact with one another via chosen skills. Skills can be respecced at cost at a church or statue, but the cost is negligible and won't be needed that often once you have a few ideas in mind. As with most Dragon Quest games, not all skills or builds are created equal and it's a good idea to either read a guide or try different things out until you find something that works well or works for you.

Beyond the excellent music and the vast open world to explore, I would have to say my favorite aspect of this game and all DQ games is the endgame. Beaten a DQ game?  Think again. There are usually extra bosses, weapons, places to explore, and perhaps even more story. It's one of the best parts about this game that there are additional challenges that await the player when the adventure is ""finished""

If you have never played a Dragon Quest game, but you like classic JRPGs and are interested in jumping in somewhere, this is a great starting point.",1638087214,1638087214,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

To no surprise, this game continues with the classic JRPG formula, quirky sense of humor, and Akira Toriyama's distinct style that has been Dragon Quest's lifeblood since 1986. Having said that, there are plenty of nice quality of life updates, an interesting take on 3D battles if you choose to allow it, and the visuals in both the 3D and 2D version are nice and crisp. Plus, the additional content is a nice touch -- the super bosses are insane, especially with the Draconian Quest modifiers. 

If you are a fan of the classic JRPG formula, but for some reason have never played a DQ game, I highly recommend it.

First the music: Like always I just adore the music. I can't stop humming along and the soundtrack always manages to get stuck in my head.
Now the story: It's a good story. I played it three times together with the switch version and it was still fun. The plot twist got me good.
Regarding the plattforms: I would recommend buying the game for PC. I can't say anything regarding the PS4 or Xbox version but after playing on PC and the Switch, I truly prefer the PC version. It runs more smoothly for me and the visuals are better. Spoiler: [spoiler] In Gallopolis is a horse race minigame. I wasn't able to win all the tracks on the switch but had absolut no problems on PC. [/spoiler]

Many people view the gameplay of a JRPG as their secondary objective, as if the story is some holier than now narrative that will carry the pacing on it's own merit. Dragon Quest 11s' story is very simple however, with the protagonist hailing from a small village must leave his humble roots in order to save the world. Despite the premise of such story being so contrived and non-innovative, the key story itself builds upon the foundation on it's many memorable characters that act as a direct defiance of the status quo and propel the (albeit silent) protagonist into the role of the player with some of the best world building I've seen accomplish in any game. It never questions the grasp on someone's judgement whether this is reality, but whether this is a fully functioning world all on it's own. 

[b] Mild gameplay spoiler [/b]

What I mean by this is there's a point in the game where you reach a sacred library of mythical tales and a optional book you read in there speaks of a dragon who was sealed away in ice 1000's of years ago. If you decide to go for some mild exploring outside that area, you will be able to find a dragon directly frozen in ice, but the real conclusion is far later in the game where you re-visit the area only to find [spoiler] that the ice has melted and the dragon is nowhere to be seen. If you missed the optional book encounter you would not understand the significance of the dragon escaping the ice as most people would either remember there was a dragon or forget it all entirely [/spoiler]

This is the approach the Dragon Quest 11s tends to deal with it's exposition about the world, yet moments of direct character growth is also wonderful to witness too.

The gameplay is something that should have far higher priority in subject of a ""game review"", but the gameplay is really enjoyable. I really think this is the perfected form of turn-based combat, even though many people view that system of play with inherent contempt. Throughout standard gameplay, battles are won more-so by the preparation done before battles than the actions within so, however, luck is a consistent theme in this game so even go into a battle without correct upgrades, you could quite easily come out the victor. The game employs a crafting system for upgrades, that has every quality of life improvement from the original Dragon Quest 11. You can check the map for locations of materials and can easily access the forge from the menu so it makes crafting feels less tedious and more rewarding exploration. Each character has their own unique skill trees that can be upgraded upon a level up, or easily reset in a church. This is where I spent most of my time theorising and testing out the best possible combinations of skills.

I have played every single Dragon Quest game since it's inception and this game is easily the game I would recommend for new-comers of the franchise. It's both easy to engage yourself for a while and make severe progress based on the great pacing and easy to endure long sessions normally expected of a JRPG and feel this unbridled ecstasy of seeing yourself progress so much of the game.

That said, if you wish to 100% the game like I did - this is not a short game whatsoever. I unlocked every steam achievement after 152.7 hours of gametime and if you just want to experience all that you want to do, than you will have to expect a total playtime of 100 hours.

There are a few things I have issues with (for example imho air transportation was much cooler in VIII, and the game imho could've been like 10 to 30 hours longer, to pad out each chapter of the game a bit more with stories for the areas :D)

The story is great (though, again, i personally prefer VIII, but that probably is because it was my first DQ) and has some truly heartwrenching moments.

DQ XI truly modernized the series core gameplay and made it much more accessible to people new to the series. Little additions like guaranteed heal/save spots right before a final boss in many dungeons, for example, make this entry in the series much less of a hassle to play through. No longer do you have to exit a dungeon before the final boss so you can heal up, and then re-trek your way all the way back. As a grown adult with much less time for games, I really appreciated additions like these!

That's not to say that the game is too easy - it's still challenging. There were bosses that still whooped my party and required re-matches. However, the game gives you many ways to overcome them and power up your party (such as unlocking more skills, crafting better weapons and armor, etc). For those who want an extreme challenge, there's a hard mode that makes the game just as hard as earlier DQs if not harder.

Gameplay aside, the game is [b]beautiful[/b], both visually and musically. The soundtrack will forever remain etched into my brain - it's great. I never had performance issues running the game on max settings, either. It's definitely a competent PC port.

So many JRPGs (ie. Kingdom Hearts) have weird, overcomplicated convoluted storylines, but this is another area where Dragon Quest XI shines. The story is never confusing. It makes sense all the way through. Characters get decent character development. And the way the story is presented is just beautiful - particularly during the most emotional moments in the game. The skillful voice acting helped with that too.

I can't recommend this game enough to any JRPG fans. Heck, even people who aren't normally into JRPGs will like it. It's much friendlier to people new to the series.

It's ""old-school"", so to speak. Visually sure the graphics looks pretty and all but the story and gameplay elements and even the music feels classic. It doesn't bother me too much but probably because I've played several past DQ games since III. ""Modern"" gamers or first-timers to DQ however might dislike this. 
Other reasons why you might dislike this game would be:
-You're sick to death of the ""chosen hero/hero versus dark lord"" plot.
-You absolutely hate turn-based combat.
If you belong to these categories then you can stop reading now, this is not your kind of game.

Now we've got that out of the way. Let's get to the review.

The Good:
-Characters. This is what I love the most about this game. It actually made me absolutely love and care for not only the main characters in your party but many of the side characters too. 
-Story. Now I know its an overused setting. ""Hero"" adventures with friends to defeat ""Dark Lord"" is hardly an original story. But the execution is great and the emotional moments are done wonderfully.
-The turn-based combat is simple and it has ""auto-combat"" presets with decent AI which is useful when you just wanna get over the random monsters/non-boss fights quickly, unless of course you prefer to do ALL your fights manually. The choice is yours.
-The colorful fantasy world is visually pleasing and it performs well in most places. Oh and btw, the rumors of the downgraded visuals from original release is greatly exaggerated. Try pcgamingwiki for tweaks to fix the bad anti-aliasing and low draw distance.

The ""Ehhh... It's alright"":
-EXPs are gained only by combat (quite common in JRPGs), which means you're not gonna level up simply by completing quests like in western RPGs which also means there's gonna be a whole lotta grinding to level up cuz otherwise you may end up underlevelled during a boss fight. 
Helpful Hint: most of the weaker enemies will run away from you after your character reached certain levels. Just ignore those enemies and only fight ones that actually attacks you because that means your level is still not high enough in that area/stage.

The Bad:
-Music. Not the scores themselves mind you but rather the placement of some of the soundtrack. Imagine just walking through the map but the music is going ""BAMBABABAMMMBAAAMMM"" in the background. It drives me mad after a while feeling as if there's a g-damn independence day parade band following me around all day blasting trumpets in my ears. I wish it had a more calm ambient music like Zelda BOTW did.
-The English translation/localization. You know its crap when some of the ""translated"" text actually just makes it harder for you to understand. Some lines just lost their actual meaning, some made the characters sound stupid and some others just outright retarded. The localization team seems to make bad puns and stupid rhymes their priority instead. 
-The English voice acting is mediocre at best. Although it could be the garbage translations that made them sound worse than they are. So either play with voice volume at 0 or use Japanese voice acting if you can understand some basic Japanese.
-The worst thing about this game however is not something in the game but Square Enix themselves for making owners of the original game pay full price for this game again. That's a real b!tch move by Square.

When I played the original version I still kinda thought maybe DQV was the better DQ. But now I've played this Enhanced Ultimate Definitive Hyper Edition, I've changed my mind. This Ultra Super DQXI is the best DQ game ever made imho, and currently my favorite JRPG title. If you can overcome all the bad points I stated above then I might even say this is one of the best JRPGs available.

The End.

The 2D mode was amazing.  Again, as a developer, I really enjoyed how you took what newer generation 3D graphics and world building looked like vs. the 2D representation.  I think this really helps shine a spotlight on 2D in that its not the graphics that make them special, but its the feeling and mood they bring in each map and part of the story.

The only other Dragon Quest game I've played is IX for the DS and when I thought no other game could top it DQ XI came and proved me wrong.
The game can be divided in 3 acts which are defined in the story, acts 1 and 2 would be the main game and act 3 would be the post game or true ending, the main game took me about 90 hours at a slower pace and post game (which is quite hefty) took me around 40 hours. 
Now, the story had me hooked the whole way through, i wouldn't say there was a single moment in which I wasn't interested in continuing and the characters are really memorable too (some of them with pretty good arcs and backstories, especially one of them) 
From the gameplay aspect, it really is your typical RPG with a few changes made to the turn based combat and even so, it doesn't feel grindy at all and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

The way they put together a modern game with some of the retro style things (stair case sound, menus, etc) was really impressive.  The story is good!  The character development was great!  

My only major bone to pick is the music in the last dungeon being the exact same as other dungeons.  It didn't feel as epic as it could/should have.

All the characters are extremely memorable and interact with each other and the story well. They all have good character development throughout the story, and all party members are useful in battle in different ways. (even though late game Erik could solo every boss)

The story is your generic ""light vs dark"" jrpg story but it still manages to be unique. And sometimes a more straightforward ""good is defiantly good and bad is defiantly bad"" kind of story can be good. Act 1 focuses more on separate arcs, while acts 2 and 3 are much more serious and straightforward. Having both keeps the story from ever feeling boring or like it's going on to long.

Being a port of the switch version the game doesn't look as good as the original version, but there's a guide on steam for some graphics mods, and with those the game looks beautiful.

If you don't want to spoil it, I'll summarize my reasoning here; the transition to Act 2 is so fucking annoying that it made me uninstall the game on the spot.

This game is a very well made JRPG that nails the aesthetic and tone of other DQ games. The systems are fun, the areas are fun, the combat is fun. Everything about this game is fun. But I would not recommend it, because of the way Act 2 is handled. Spoilers from here on out.

Act 1 is the archetypal hero's journey. There is a great evil, you are the chosen one, you explore a vibrant world and travel to many locations while collecting a party of lovable characters to help you on your quest. You are being hounded by bad guys across the globe. You are quite literally always being chased by a specific high level bad guy. Act 1 culminates in your party traveling to the ever present World Tree to collect the Master Swo- I mean, the...oh whatever. The McGuffin Sword of Destiny that is the ONLY way to save the world. I like this sort of thing, so no complaints here.

Your party will arrive, and a series of cutscenes will ensue. In these cutscenes, the bad guy who has been chasing you this entire time will catch up to you JUST as your character reaches (slowly) for the McGuffin, and shoots you in the back. Were any of your 7 companions watching the door? Nah. You then fight a pointless and frustrating battle that you have to lose (the text in the battle implies that only the McGuffin could have saved you here. Too bad your character spent a really long time stretching his arm towards it as slowly as possible.) After you lose the fight, more cutscenes happen in which the bad guy wins. Also fine, very dramatic, whatever.

You are then forced to play as the other characters, not the MC. And they have amnesia. And they are doing personal errands. For hours. I'm not kidding; the first thing you do at the beginning of Act 2 is retrieve a bag for someone who was mugged as Sylvando the clown. 

You spend between 20 and 30 hours on a very fun quest, only to be literally forced to do errands for a clown. I looked up how long it takes to get the main character back - multiple hours. Not only that, but you literally spend the rest of Act 2 collecting your party members again. From scratch. Traveling to the same places you just spent 20-30 hours exploring.

Now, look. If you played through Act 1 and thought, ""This saving the world business is really fun, but I sure wish that I would be forced to start over. And this Main Character guy sure is neat, but it would be really fun if I had to play as a character I literally never used. Also, I love how my characters have gotten to know each other, but wouldn't it be cool if they lost all their memories?"" Then this is the game for you. If you prefer, however, for your videogames to force you to do circus chores right after the climax of 30 hours of playtime, I would highly recommend never buying this game.

TLDR; This game waited 30 hours to do something so fucking irritating I uninstalled it. Save yourself the money.",1634703073,1634703073,False,7,2,0.416150897741317749,0,True,False,False

So, if you are into complicated games that provide a challenge, then this might not be for you, but if you just want to relax and enjoy a beautiful story then this is perfect.
The battles get really easy later on, but there are still a few boss fights that can provide a small challenge.  My party is all about level 45 now, and most monsters die in just 1 attack.  There are a lot of interesting side quests also in this game.  You can tell that they really put a lot of time and effort into this.

This game is sooooo cute!!!  I would like to live in this world.  :)",1634046436,1634046436,True,1,0,0.489059984683990479,0,True,False,False

Pros
+ The story is simple but interesting
+ The visual is really good
+ I Love the Characters and World design
+ Memorable music
+ The crafting system is very good. you can get more powerfull weapon by crafting instead of buying from the shop
+ Onlye few side quest available. That means all of your gameplay you spend most is for main story, not for the side quest like final fantasy xv haha... i spent around 70% of my time for doing side quest and the rest is for the main story.
+ you can change 3D mode to 2D mode

cons
- None

The game is so enjoyable that when I finished it [and this is a very long game] I still kinda wanted more and that didn't happened to me in years.
If You are looking for something for relax and break from the regular hardcore gaming, this hits the spot.

To keep it short, this JRPG is traditional to a T, and while in some parts it's a hindrance to its quality (the music for example), it manages to bring so much damn charm it hurts. This game just brings a smile to my face and brings me so much joy. It's fun to explore and fight monsters, fun to watch the game's story unfold, fun to interact with the characters, fun to craft and find new equipment, and fun to be in the game's world. None of it is really all that ground breaking, but the game is still very good at what it does. If you don't like traditional JRPGs with some grind required and a LONG length, this game will not change your mind. If you are, however, this one is one of the best of its kind out there.

EDIT 9-18-2021

Well i gotta say after beating it, it was a great introduction into the series and i really love this game with it's tone and combat.


Combat classic camera - Feels like a really good modern JRPG like Persona 5 Royal and every critical hit is satisfying.


Characters - Feels really plane and feels we needed atleast 2 or 3 more members because it feels lacking mostly because you get the 2 members you like but you have to put your least favorite to fill a slot. overall the designs are ok and wish they had more to them


Story - It's a really good one and has a lot of deep moments in a scene but sometimes it feels to short because it makes you want more but you don't, wouldn't call it a 10/10 story though but very basic but good atleast.


Final boss - Challenging but easy, i was sweating because i didn't know if i was underleveled for this fight but i was wrong, it's an ok fight but not an epic one. The one thing i hate is the music the music fucking sucks for a FINAL BOSS fight, you know the big bad that's been taunting you through out this entire game ends up being a wimpy boss. Needed to be harder for what you faced up until this point.


Music - I'm gonna be 100% honest the music fucking sucks, the overworld theme or the place you explore has the same goddamn theme and it's way to overdramtic with the hero theme, even if you explore a lets say a desert your expecting a desert theme right? wrong it's the same music and get used to it for the hours you grind.


Battle theme and boss - It's alright for a battle theme, not very catchy or memorable but it's not annoying. For the boss theme uhhh it never changes and it's the same, doesn't feel threatening or anything but just basic.


Collecting the orbs - I love this part of the game and the final one was the hardest and the first time i never looked up anything for a game, and it was awesome when i finally found the last one after maybe 9 to 10 hours of searching, i finally found it. I was so goddamn happy.


10/10 - I cried at one point and felt empty inside, but overall a very fun and addicting adventure and i loved every second of it. Thank you Dragon Quest 11 your the first one i ever beaten and the first game where i never looked up what to do or anything just completely blind.


(This section has spoilers you are warned)



So turns out there's a double game to add to this and it's not the 2D mode it's the post game.
making this game even longer


Story - It got better with this little edition to the game and was really sad because you did a lot and now you have to go back in time to save a friend, but during this it felt wrong what i was doing and also Luminary doesn't say a single fucking word on that he's a time traveller to the party and keeps it to himself like it never happened.


Music - The overworld theme finally got updated with the adventure music and it's way better than the generic theme they chose for the other half of the game.


Trials and side stuff - I beat all the super bosses and the trials and if you look at my hours half of that is grinding because holy fuck those bosses were annoying.


True final boss - Finally a final boss fight that's actually hard but doesn't have really good music to go with it overhaul a really good final boss and he will kick your ass if your not a high enough level.


10/10 - Yes i married Veronica, and i thought she would be in her adult form when you get her back.",1631487102,1632723134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall it's a very relaxing game that pays tribute to the Dragon Quest series. I found the difficulty to be extremely casual. If you are a perfectionist / completionist / casual RPG player, this is the game for you!

Pros:
- The user interface is phenomenal. The ways to look up monsters, items, and things you missed is glorious. 
- The lore and towns and world are really well designed. It is very immersive and after finishing the game I can see it is a pretty massive world.
- I really enjoyed the art in the game. There are some breathtaking landscapes and cool character costumes. Some of them are pretty cheeky.
- The music is wonderful in this game! The only downside is in my opinion there are not enough different tracks and the ones in it can be a bit overplayed and repetitive. However, this is true for most RPGs. You can play some DQ8 music in settings to mix it up.
- There are tons of different storylines and quests you go through. I spent 133 hours (it does not add time from the demo game to this).
- I love all the different NPCs sounding like they have different accents in true DQ form. Always enjoyable.
- Speaking of the demo, I've never found a more complete demo! I think I will well over 10 hours on it and hooked. Wish more games would do demos like this

Cons:
As much of things I love about this game, there were some things that could have been much better.
- The main characters were very shallow in design in my opinion. Most of their entire demeanor could be described by one adjective and there was no depth. Very boring when compared to something like characters in a Final Fantasy game.
- I find the save the world stories of Dragon Quest games getting a bit tired. I know this was to pay tribute to past games, but with all the other stuff they nailed it feels like a waste to not come up with a really creative 
and unique storyline. DQ8 was much better for this.
- I found the game WAY too easy if you dont start it out putting on hard mode difficulties. For 90% of the game, I won battles with autofight. If you are a completionist, make sure you set the difficulty harder or it will be too easy. I spent time trying to get rare steals and stuff (you must do this with pep power to do it reliably early on, regular steal cant get rare drops without it) and leveled up too much?
- The fun sized forge got a bit boring after using it so much. Wish once you mastered and item you could just keep making them at +3.
- There was a lot of overuse of worlds, enemies, bosses in the game. Which is really smart in terms of getting the most out of a world, but I dont want to effectively play everything twice. It double dipped a bit too hard IMO.
- The sidequests were mostly bland WOW style go kill this, go find this quests that I found to be really monotonous. Some of them were okay but most were underwhelming. I wish games would stop doing sidequests like this. The post game sidequests were much better because they actually had some story to them. The pep power sidequests were the worst. 

Overall, if you either enjoyed the DQ series, enjoy being a completionist, or just want a casual game to play for a bit in a beautiful world to let off some steam with TONS of content, this is a good one for you. If you are looking for more challenge, you must set it up to be harder difficulty at the start of the game. If you are looking for more depth and plot / storyline, I'd probably pass. Compared to most games being released half-finished these days, this gives you incredible value for the money spent and feels incredibly polished. It's almost worth playing just to remember what a finished game looks like!

I've been playing this series since I was 10 years old and now 25 years later this has to be the ultimate DQ experience. Since it's release I've completed the game 6 times and every time I enjoyed it more and more. I've played the game on the PS4, played the Definitive Edition on the PS5 and played both versions on PC as well.

Echoes of an Elusive Age is on par or even slightly better than Journey of the Cursed King (Part 8 in the series), which is/was my all time favourite game. I find it difficult to summarize what makes this game so good. The graphics are beautiful, gameplay is great (I would highly recommend playing with a controller be it PS4/PS5 or Xbox) and the story is up there with the best is the series. You know what you can expect if you've played DQ games before, old-skool turn-based combat and a single player only experience. It's quite a lengthy game as per usual with Dragon Quest, it took met 60 hours to complete the main story (all 3 acts) with much more left to do afterwards. With the Definitive Edition giving additional side-quests and a more complete storyline of the fellow partymembers of the hero. 

Like I said, DQ XI is everything I hoped the series would become since playing it for the first time. It left a deep impression on me and the quality of this series is unparalleled by any other game. So, in conclusion, I can't recommend this game enough.

As old school school as old school gets, Dragon Quest XI is simultaneously cliched and endearing, lulling you into quick complacency with its tropes and thrilling you with their inversions. Quick, somewhat spoiler-free examples:

*The characters are the traditional archetypes you're familiar with in any RPG (damage mage, heal mage, thief, [i]et al.[/i]) and yet they're written to be so charming with distinct personalities that you cannot help but enjoy spending time with them.
*You are the chosen one (gasp!), but (and this is a light spoiler) [spoiler]even still, you are hunted by your fellow man for a large portion of the game[/spoiler].
*The bad guy is exactly who you expect it to be upon your first meeting them, but (and this is a much bigger spoiler) [spoiler] when you first meet them, you lose the fight to save the world...which has huge, far reaching implications for the people inhabiting it and the state of the game.[/spoiler]

What's more, I cannot think of a game more generous with content than Dragon Quest XI. Each 'chapter' of the game could easily be sold as its own standalone title without anyone batting an eye, as each one would likely constitute several dozen hours of play. Combine this with the newly added 2D mode which fundamentally changes how the game is played and you've got hundreds and hundreds of hours of content, should you be interested in experiencing it all. My playtime is indicative of completing only the 'main' game using the 'Harder Enemies' and 'No XP from weaker enemies' options, meaning I was unable to grind. That's all gameplay, baby!

Pros: The graphics and game play are true to the series, and I love the adorable little puns, and characters in this game.

Having the choice to play in either 2D mode or 3D mode can add more dynamic interest to the game, and is a fun way to think about the older Dragon Quest games. The story and characters are well fleshed out and are deeply entertaining! There are moments in the Story where you wanna cry, but there are plenty of moments that make you laugh, as well. I love that you can ""Party Talk"" and hear the thoughts and feelings of your team mates.

[h1]The Good [/h1]
And boy is it fun. One of the best JRPGs I've played and a adventure game to the very sense of the word as you adventure across the entire world of Erdrea to diverse and unique locations inspired by real life (inspired by France, Vietnam, the Middle East, England, Sweden etc).

I love how you meet all your companions just before the end of Act 1, which is around the 10-15hr mark or longer depending on your playstyle (except a story companion, but they join you literally 2 cutscenes later).

Also all the characters are simply amazing, and the voice acting, especially the english is awesome, best dub along with the Persona series. Which is rare for JRPGs. 

As mentioned before you get ample time to meet and get to know all your companions, and they get to know each other, unlike Persona 5 where Haru infamously gets shoved in at the end and barely interacts with you of your companions.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
The only major complaint I have is that crafting takes so f*cking long, like 2 non skippable long ass animations and you can never craft in bulk. So to craft gear for your entire party can take like 10 minutes... Also overall the tone of the game is very bright, except Act 2 which gets darker, but around the end of Act 2 and beginning of Act 3 the tone gets brighter again.

Other than that I don't have any major issues, just minor ones. Like how the coolest gear you get by the end, and Act 3 (Post Game) is really quite short storywise, but you can revisit and help your friends and call in favours that you gathered through out the course of the game, which is really fun.

There's times when I agree, and there's times when I disagree that discount or (more specifically) being given the game ""for free"" should be an option.

This is one of those times that I disagree.  For starters, this version even at launch went for $39.99, 20 bucks less than the original game went at launch. At first that might seem unreasonable for a game 2 years old at that time to re-launch for that price, but consider this: Life is Strange Remastered Collection is literally just prettier graphics and being sold for $40, with no discount option for current owners of the original LiS or BtS.  Now that is a legit thing to complain about, because it's something modders can do for free and SE is charging money for it instead of giving owners the option of even a discount.

This game however, is $40 of new content mixed in.
*You now have the option to switch from the OG soundtrack to a more Symphonic version, and I do mean the entire soundtrack.
*You now have the option to play the entire game in 2D, or mix and match at your leisure if you choose simply by switching at a church.  And when I say play it in 2D, I mean the world itself, battles, all of it is in a 2D setting and maps can even be just a bit different to accomodate the change in perspective.  In other words, it's now 2 games in one.
*There are new expanded bits for characters throughout the game, and now options to even marry different characters other than Gemma.
*You also now have the option to switch to Japanese voices as well.
*Tickiton, a new 16-bit town that you can visit previous recreations of Dragon Quest games and take on quests.
*Photo Mode: Kinda speaks for itself
*Battle Speed modifer: Again, speaks for itself
*New costumes, ridable monsters, and other smaller content

Which is quite a bit of extra stuff being thrown there.

""But much of that should have been in the base game!"" I hear some of you rudely interrupt to say, and you're right.  But that's also arguable for literally any DLC that is thrown out there and be given a price tag outside of the game.  One could argue Skyrim's DLC should have been in the base game, or that Fallout 4's or Final Fantasy XV's DLC should have been in the base game, or that Season Passes are perpetuating an awful business practice in promoting post-game transactions for things that should have been in the game Day 1.

""But Bethesda let owners of Skyrim on PC have the Special Edition for free!"" I hear you once again rudely interrupt to say.  First off: That's only half right.  Bethesda only gave owners the game for free if they had all the DLC as well.  If you only had the base game, you were paying for the cost of the DLC when you were given the chance to upgrade to the Special Edition.  Second of all, Skyrim is an example of games I DO agree with them giving for discount purely because Skyrim SE's changes were all cosmetic.  Aside from the addition of their own Mod repository for people to upload/use mods (which should have been in the base game already *drops mic*) and the inclusion of Creation Club content (see the last parenthesized statement), Skyrim SE added literally nothing new aside from prettier graphics, so that game made much more sense being given a free upgrade, just as I think that (going back) something like Life is Strange Remastered Edition should be given a heavier discount price for current owners.

And stop interrupting me, it's rude.  The point is: Dragon Quest XI S arguably has $40 of new content thrown into it, regardless of whether or not it's content that suits your own personal tastes.  If anything, you're getting the base game for free and paying purely for the content just as you would when you pay $30 for a mystery-content Season Pass at the game launch on top of your $60 purchase.

Now, off that rant, Dragon Quest XI (S) is a fantastic game.  It's honestly the best DQ game I've played in a long while, and in all honesty one of the better JRPGs overall that I've played in a while.  The characters are fun and interesting, Erdrea is a very pretty and large (by JRPG standards) world, the story is pretty neat and has a couple of twists every so often (some you'll see coming a mile away, the rare on-occasion one that'll surprise you), and overall it's just a fun game that'll keep you busy for hours.

If you're a fan of JRPGs, I highly recommend giving this one a shot.  Even if it's ""slightly"" graphically inferior to the original version (which I've played both versions, and it wasn't noticeable enough for me to want to not want to play through this one), it's still every bit as good than the original version, if not a bit better because of all of the added stuff.",1630925894,1630926092,True,0,0,0.472636818885803223,0,True,False,False

Very good story.
Interesting characters.
Fun combat system.

The English version is phenomenal (it's really worth a detailed note).
- English voice cast surprisingly good.
- In addition NPCs have different accent depending on the in-game region they are from, and these regions kind of have certain similarities with regions from our world making the accents fit very well.
- And they really put a lot of work in wordplays and rhymes that work great.

Some ""minor"" annoying points:
- There's no pause. Combats are turned based, so it doesn't really matter here. In the world however, while in the menu, monsters can't engage, but they still move and can reach you. Also, during cutscenes, there's no pause: you can toggle auto dialogue off but it doesn't apply to all cutscenes and only works at the time of the dialogue (not during ""action"" ...).
- I find it weird that the main character is completely voiceless, but that's the Dragon Quest series.
- Keyboard controls are terrible. The game is clearly designed for controller gameplay. The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but the default key combination makes no sense. Also, the keypresses shown while playing use Playstation icons even if you've switched to keyboard mode. You eventually get used to it, but it's still annoying.",1629105102,1629105102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since knowing me i would pick the costume i like regardless the equip status, that would make the game more harder to play. So its great to have their own slot.
But there are some disappointing thing in this game too, which is the English translation, it was very weird and confusing that they change about 90% of the place name/character name into some other name.
For example :
Ema to Gemma
Kamyu to Eric
Martina to Jade
Silvia to Sylvando
Greg to Hendrik
Delkadar to Heliodor
Grotta to Octagonia

Its just weird to change it into a different one, if its hard to pronounce so they change it, i would understand, but most of it are not hard to pronounce. There is even some change on the skill name which already in English into another one, like a skill [spoiler]Grand Cross into Pearly Gates, or the Grand Nebula into Solar Flair[/spoiler].",1629088474,1629088474,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I just want to reiterate the following: whoever Square Enix hired to do the English language localization nailed it!

Played the whole game on ""Stronger Monster"" setting, the game has a simple yet fun and challenging combat with 4+ playable characters each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The game is so easy without Stronger Monster setting so feel free to play without it if you just want to enjoy the story. I recommend playing with the Stronger Monster setting on if you want a challenge since this is where strategy matters and players are encouraged to be well-equipped and experiment a lot with each characters' builds.

The original vanilla steam version, the Nintendo Switch Definitive edition on release, and then finally the Steam version of the Definitive edition. My first experience with the franchise was Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime on the Nintendo DS and I had no further knowledge of the series.

I've started the game several times and it wasn't until last month that I figured I should just sit down and finally play through the entirety of the game. I have been missing out.

This game is incredibly good and a fantastic representation of the DQ franchise as a whole now that I'm more familiar with it. My initial thoughts starting the game was that this was going to be a traditional good vs evil story, with the hero saving the world. Although this is generally true, I was NOT expecting several twists in the stories. The story gets emotional at times if you choose to follow and read through the text (It's incredibly easy to accidentally press a button and skip through a huge portion of the story). The pre-rendered cut-scenes are absolutely beautiful whenever they're on screen. The characters, while I was worried I wouldn't like them, use them as often as I would, actually grew on me and I appreciated them more at the end of the game than when I first met them. The game manages this incredibly by forcing you to use certain party members during certain sections of the game, causing the player to find ways to use these characters and learn their abilities and how to properly use them. By the end of the game, you'll be switching out characters constantly mid-battle.

I feel like talking about what a game lacks or does wrong is easier for me to pick apart so lets talk about the negatives:
-If you want to 100% or FULLY beat the game, it will take a lot of grinding and in-depth knowledge of the systems/items of the game.
-The story doesn't pick up until you get all your party members.
-The enemies don't start to feel challenging or require a lot of strategy until Act 3.
-Some plot contrivances involving time travel (but this is super minor)

To further elaborate, it took me weeks of non-stop playing to reach max level with all the characters and obtain the most powerful weapons for my party in order to beat the final boss (some people might refer to this as the boss to get the 'true ending'). This goes hand-in-hand with JRPGs but if you don't have the time to grind out items or XP then this game might be the one for you. If you love a total grindfest then by all means pick this game up. As a side note, it is almost necessary to be level 99 and have the best weapons in the game in order to beat the final true boss.

The reason why I ended up buying 3 copies of the game but never finished and played through the full first arc of the game is because I lost interest several times during the intro. The world starts off as bland and kind of lack luster. Maybe bland is the wrong word, I guess 'typical' is a better way to describe it? It doesn't offer anything in the first arc that separates it from the typical JRPG. I spent most of my time wanting to reach a point where I had all my party members, but I was extremely bored trying to reach to that point. Once you do though, the world COMPLETELY opens up. You start visiting these really cool places, The story does take a turn by the end of Act 1 and it's so cool the way they do it. If you pick up this game, at least get through Act 1 (you'll know when it happens).

If you like strategizing and preparing for difficult boss fights then this is also for you. However, it doesn't start to be difficult until the Act 3. The difficulty spikes tremendously and it involves grinding materials in order to forge necessary items, knowing your party members well enough to rotate them in when necessary, and just trial and error if you're not using a guide to know the enemies weaknesses/strengths. I wish there was a difficulty setting that would make the early game require some strategy but sadly it doesn't get challenging until really late into the game. Don't worry though because you get to backtrack again and re-beat powered up versions for the bosses. I think each boss you encounter in Acts 1 and 2 gets a powered up version in Act 3.

At some point in the story, you end up time traveling. Obviously time travel in a story is very tricky and can kind of break your immersion if done wrong. There are some side stories that you witness that kind of don't make sense once you do time travel although you can simply overlook a lot of the stuff since it's not important to the MAIN story. Still, it's a small nitpick. 

Overall, this is a fantastic, charming, SUPER deep game which you can spend hundreds of hour grinding, maxing out levels, trying to get 100% on. I highly recommend it for the average JRPG fan and people who like strategy turn-based games as well. The story is very wholesome and sweet which put me at the edge of my seat sometimes.

The core of Dragon Quest XI is adventure. This is its greatest asset and the most glowing praise I can possibly give it. Every step from when you boot up the game to when you close it out for good is brimming with that unwritten promise of excitement. Stepping out from home into a world filled with danger is daunting, yet that same world and you grow at an exponential rate over the course of the story. There are few genres that provide as satisfying a measure for growth as JRPGs. Waltzing through enemies that used to take you countless turns to beat, and whacking them down with a single strike, is catharsis on an entirely different level.

Along the way, you'll meet a cast of characters that are among the most charming in the entire genre. They're not particularly deep, but they don't need to be. Dragon Quest XI doesn't present many complicated arcs, either in its grand story or in the individual pieces that accentuate it. It's a tale that echoes fables and epics, with simple villains and simple heroes going up against each other on the world stage. What it makes it work is the earnest and straightforward heart that beams through every possible line of dialogue. Dragon Quest XI isn't interested in breaking your heart; it wants you to feel like a hero, and to go out and save the world because you believe it worth saving. While side quests and collectibles never amount to more than fetch quests or killing specific enemies in specific ways, it's always the context that makes you want to do them. Finding a bunny girl bible in an academy for ladies-in-training so that a mythical mass of old men can transfigure themselves into bunny girls, finding the most cowardly man in the world because a young kid is convinced he's the greatest master of hide-and-seek, and tracking down a mermaid's favorite song from a man who sang it fifty years ago are miniature tales that gleam with no less enthusiasm or spirit than the main story, and they all make the journey as a whole feel all the more heartwarming.

On a more objective note, I'll say that combat well and truly clicks around the midway point. This is where the game really started to sing for me, as weaving characters in and out of battle, using more inventive skills and combinations, and really ramping up the equipment department all offered a more compelling experience than what was previously on offer. It's also where I think the writing well and truly shines strongest.

Which leads into my one caveat in this recommendation. When you beat Dragon Quest XI, there's a wide and expansive postgame that pushes the story further. The ending you get when the credits roll is immensely satisfying, and there's a decent possibility that where this postgame takes the story will dissatisfy you. I can't entirely say I love it. But I do love the amount of interactions you get with characters both large and small through it, along with the closure offered to pretty much every arc in the game. If you do pick it up and are entirely satisfied with the ending you originally find, I would encourage you to stop while you're ahead, and be happy with that tale.

I can't describe the magic that flows through this game. All I can say is that I spent almost 180 hours doing every last thing I could in it, and I don't regret a second of it.

The characters are memorable and the art style is unique.  The story can leave you on the edge of your seat at times, and although I have not completed the additional S edition content, I have faith that the extra chapters flesh out the characters that much more.  I have put in around 70 hours into the original Steam release of DQXI, which is why I felt comfortable about being able to write this review.  I first looked at the game and honestly thought I would end up disliking this game, but man was I blown away by how good Dragon Quest is.

From an achievement hunting perspective which is what I tend to specialize and focus on, the game is not overly difficult to obtain all of the achievements in, even though I am still working on it myself.  Draconian quest adds an extra layer of difficulty, but is not required for any achievements.  The list itself is just time consuming to complete, but trust me that every moment is worth it.  The game is estimated to be around 100-120 hours to 100% the achievement according to achievement hunting sites such as Trueachievements.

Pros
+ Gorgeous Art Style
+ Lovable Characters
+ Excellent Orchestral Soundtrack
+ Memorable Locales
+ Plenty of Replay Value
+ Straightforward Achievement List
+ No Shoe In Multiplayer Mode

Cons
- Can Be A Very Long Achievement Completion

The only other DQ-Game i had played before was DQ:9 on the Nintendo DS. So that is what shaped my expectations for this gaming experience. In DQ:9 one big part of my playthrough was to experiment with my own characters in different jobs with different weapons and skills. 
In DQ:11 you gather a fixed party with most of the fighters being able to select between 2 weapon types. So I was a little bit disappointed in that. 
Adding to that, you do NOT see your equipped gear while running around or fighting except your weapons. In this day and age, that is just sad.

These things aside the game hits a lot of nostalgia buttons for me and the story itself is the clear strongpoint of this game. It is a pretty streamlined experience.

The story starts out normal and cliche-y but the twist was definitely unexpected.  However, some side quests are almost impossible to figure out on your own without googling for help. I also feel that the character builder can be more flexible than what it is now.

A+ for character development too. I have rarely seen a RPG pay so much attention to the story and development of each and every characters.

All the draconian quests individually aren't hard, but checking all of it in a playthrough can be ridiculous early on, and later if you don't want to farm seeds, so be prepared to get sent back to the title screen a lot.

I'll say that first so that if you are looking for a game that you don't want to be committed to, then this game is not for you. Also, if you are looking for a game with edgy story, this game is not for you either as this game features a lighthearted story.

This game is a good entry point for people who haven't experienced a single JRPG game in their life. Let me list the reasons why:
• It doesn't have an overly complicated system. Everything about it is easy to learn.
• It begins with a quite easy difficulty but progressively ramps up as the story goes on.
• It doesn't try to be something with its story, it is a standard JRPG story where you get allies and you save the world from a great evil. With that said, please don't take the ""standard JRPG story"" as a minus point as, in my opinion, it does a ""stand JRPG story"" in a magnificent way.
I also recommend this to old fans of JRPG genre as this perfectly encapsulates what the classic JRPG used to be.

This was my second time playing through it, the first on the Switch. This time, I had Steam achievements to chase, which only enhanced the experience. I love nearly everything about this game.
The classic turn-based combat we've come to expect and love from the Dragon Quest series is executed to perfection here. The characters are fun and well developed, and it's a joy to watch them interact with each other. The graphics are lovely and the gameplay is fantastic. The music sets the tone, and really adds to the whole story.
The story is good, nothing extremely life-changing, but fun and engaging. There's only a few story beats I really didn't care for, but the game does a good job of keeping the pace of the story moving while letting you reflect on what happened before the next major point.
One thing DQXI does a lot better than other JRPGs I've played is keep the level grinding to a minimum. You're pretty set just playing through and doing the battles as they come. That said, it sure is fun just grinding for the heck of it, which is good because hitting level 99 is an achievement on Steam for each character.
I greatly appreciate all the callbacks to previous games that XI throws in there. Of course there's Tickington, and all the quests there, but there are plenty of other callbacks in the main story that fans of the series will recognize and appreciate.

I drifted away from the genre in favour of western CRPGs and FPS's, as well as online games such as WoW, Ragnarok Online and Overwatch. I saw this game on sale and took a punt as the art style piqued my interest.

DQ11 is a fantastic adventure with all your typical JRPG clichés. Once you get over the childish art style and predictable premise to a story, this game has so much to offer. The character development is deep and the story has some surprising twists and deep, emotional moments despite its childlike aesthetic.

I spent about 80 hours on the story and was genuinely invested. I was hooked. I would rant and rave all day long to work colleagues and friends about how good this game was. I could not wait to get home and find out what happens next.

Unfortunately, due to a major in game event that I will not spoil on here, I felt cheated. All that investment on side quests, not skipping any dialogue. Caring about these fictional characters. All down the toilet. I felt no desire to go on to see the ""true ending""

Is this game fantastic? Yes. Is it worth buying? Yes. Has it left a bittersweet taste in my mouth? Absolutely.

Buy this game and enjoy it. When you feel that you are done with it, stop there. That is where your journey ends bold Luminary.

Even if the main plot often felt very cliché, it surprised me a few times and I ended up enjoying it more than I first thought I would.
I quite like the characters in the party, my main regret about them being the complete lack of emotions manifested by the hero...

As for the gameplay, I definitely like the 3D mode more, mainly because the fights are faster and less annoying than in 2D mode (most of them can be avoided in 3D mode while they feel overwhelming in 2D mode), but I still find the 2D mode beautiful and enjoyable once you discover the ""fast"" combat speed in the menus :)

The game is also quite well-balanced (except for a boss fight I won't spoil but no worries since it's optional and its only purpose is being a tough challenge) but you can still get beaten a few times without a bit of strategy (or enough levels if you prefer farming XP).
And if you're not satisfied with the base difficulty, you can still pick challenges to make your run harder.

I had no nostalgia going into this one, but I do like JRPGs and had the recommendation of a friend going into it, so I figured I would most likely enjoy it.  I did overall really enjoy it, but my recommendation comes with some caveats.

The amazing: 
- I loved these (3D mode) graphics.  They are total eye candy.  Everything is so cartoony, vibrant, and slightly exaggerated.  I found them very charming.
- The humor.  This game made me grin & chuckle frequently.  Punny creature names, weird gag jokes, it was overall very bizarre but I really appreciated its irreverence.
- The characters are VERY memorable and mostly very enjoyable.  Sometimes also weird or a little offensive (see later sections), but always unique and memorable.
- The sense of world-building and exploration is great.
- You get a [spoiler]flying whale in golden armor[/spoiler] as your [spoiler]late-game airship[/spoiler].  [spoiler]She talks to you.[/spoiler]  I love it.

The so-so:
- Customizations and skills.  There just isn't much there.  Each character has their own unique fixed set of skills and you can acquire them in any order you want and respec at any save spot for a pittance of gold.  By the time you're around Act 2 ([spoiler]of 3[/spoiler]) of the game, you'll only respec to change weapons out & generally all of your points will be going to diversifying weapon skills (so you don't have to respec anymore to switch weapons effectively).  There's tons of overlap between characters on weapon skills (and weapons), making the unique mechanical aspects of certain characters very small, specific skills sets.  This wasn't necessarily [i]bad[/i], it's just a very simple system compared to most modern RPGs.
- The combat.  It's turn-based.  It's extremely grindy.  Its saving grace is that you can essentially automate all of the trash fights on 3x autoplay, which really alleviates a lot of grind and allows you to manually play on more difficult, interesting fights, although that's still a stretch.  It's every JRPG turn based combat you've ever played with no particular innovation or interest to speak of.  It works, but it's just OK.
- The story.  Good vs. Evil.  Quest to save the world.  [spoiler]Then time travel stuff happens.[/spoiler]  The overall plot is a solid mix of amazing, so-so, and irksome on its own, but the characters, world building, and weird side-stories really held my interest more than the main plot did.

The irksome:
- If there was even a single female writer on the team, she got vetoed on [i]everything[/i].  The game hypersexualizes one character in particular, going so far as to give her an [i]entire skill category[/i] centered around her, uhm, 'Charm' as it puts it.  You also get to marry anyone you want with no consent required!  And there's an achievement for visiting all of the bunnygirls that give you 'puff-puff.'  All of these things are true and all of these things make me roll my eyes so, so hard.
- This crafting system.  You have to spend a lot of time during your endgame at the fun-size forge.  It's so tedious, so time consuming, so repetitive (and much of the animation unskippable), I just hated every second of it.  Maybe you'll like it, but I sure didn't.
- The mandatory 2D segment toward the end of the game.  I'm 36, every game I played as a kid was 2D and I'm very much over it now.  I appreciated the advertised idea that you could play the whole game in either 2D or 3D, except that's not really wholly true & significant chunks of endgame content are 2D only.  I strongly disliked these segments of the game, but if you still love squinting and trying to figure out what you're supposed to be looking at after 30 years maybe you'll find these sections more enjoyable than I did.
- Mild Veronica story spoiler: [spoiler]I didn't understand why, after having been turned back into an adult during a cutscene, we had to be stuck with Veronica in child form for the rest of the game anyway.  It didn't really make sense to me and I'd have preferred if we just finally got adult Veronica at this point in the story & kept it that way going forward.[/spoiler]


Overall, the 'amazing' outweighed the 'irksome' for me and I was able to power through the parts I did not enjoy and stuck it out for the parts I loved.  This game has a really enjoyable world, beautiful visual aesthetic, highly memorable characters, and really great sense of humor and those things really kept me engaged in spite of its flaws.

First things first, this is potentially the best RPG I've ever played. Full disclosure, there's the factor of my own personal bias around the idea of an adventurer party. Any RPG out there with a party mechanic with interactive members I will probably end up loving.

Before I picked this game up, I had randomly decided to play Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride. I fell in love with the game. I loved how every time you encountered a new location or talked to NPCs, you could talk with your party members to both get to know them as well as get their own insight. Because of this mechanic specifically, I'm planning to check out more games in this series. It's very interesting and it gives your party members personality rather than being solid brick walls for anything that's not a scripted event. Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age also has this party talk mechanic, but it's not as totally in depth as DQV, but that is totally made up for by the extensive story and character building done by the scripted events of the game.
For example, I went from completely hating two party members at the start, to completely adoring them and enjoying their dialogue and presence in my team. This was over the span of about ten or twelve hours. I felt that these relationships and building on these characters felt actually rather organic. Few, if any, of the characters immediately trust you at the start and, honestly, nor should you trust them immediately. This party writing and mechanics really set the game apart for me, to the point where it kind of knocked Chrono Trigger out of my top RPG. I fell in love with this game after starting to love the characters in it.

Now moving on to the gameplay. If you haven't played a Dragon Quest before, this would be a good start. It's very simple. You defeat enemies and level up to better your stats. That's the core loop, but there's stuff added on to enhance the loop. This game has skills and skill points. Your characters gain skill points every level up to spend on new abilities or powerful passives. And that's about it for the gameplay. Very simple stuff. Anyone can learn it, and anyone can play it.

Let me talk a bit about the pacing. The game is rather slow. It's dependent on story as well as your leveling. There are a few times where I had to go and grind a out a level to properly survive a fight or gain some cash to proper gear. Asides from the leveling, the story takes its time, and in my opinion, it's a good thing for it to do. Although the pacing is a bit slow, the game takes the time to develop characters during the time it takes to get from the start to finish of a story beat. It is the main reason why I was able to have a 31 and 4 minute long play session, with only about 4 of those hours be food and hygiene breaks. Its pacing is rather enrapturing, and it made me want to keep on going even though I knew I should probably take a break and continue after getting some sleep.

Next topic up is the music. It's Dragon Quest music. So that means if you played or plan on playing other games in the series, you'll probably hear similar or the same melodies. That doesn't mean the soundtrack is bad, since I believe the entire thing was performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphonic Orchestra. There is the obvious production value that you can hear in the performances, but that doesn't remove the actual typical problem with any long form RPG. You will hear a lot of the track over and over again. This one is at least decent, though.

Lastly is the story. The story is very simple. Good versus evil. You are the Luminary, and it is your destiny to defeat the evil force that rules over all of that which shadows the land. What isn't simple is getting to that destination. While the general plot is actually super straight forward, the twists and turns that take shape in the story make the game unique. This includes the party members you recruit over the duration of the story. Each character has their own little arc with their own sequence for self-realization. It's rather heart warming and fun to go through.
I will admit, the Third Act is a bit messy, but considering the topics involved and the need to wrap up the game, of course it's going a bit messy.

And to close this review. I love this game. Genuinely, I think it's an amazing experience, and it's gotten me convinced to explore other games in this series. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone halfway interested in the premise, gameplay loop, and/or the study of characters and their development.

tl;dr good experience, good characters, suitable music with typical rpg issue, fun story twists, good game

Original post below:
I'll be honest, I have not finished this game yet, but I do have something that is incredibly important to say about it. With all the games I've played, not one of those has ever captivated me for over 28 hours of straight playtime. I had a play session of 31 hours and 4 minutes, and I only stopped because I felt really tired and needed to actually sleep.

As a game, if you haven't played a Dragon Quest before ( I played DQV before I picked this up and it has a similar gameloop also Bianca best girl ) then you need to expect one thing: they can get grindy when you're underleveled, and feel grindy when you're just progressing the story. 

Speaking of story, Dragon Quest stories are typically the Hero vs. the Villain story, like a standard good vs. evil story. What's special about some of the games is how there are twists and turns while you do your hero schtick. This can get to the point where the hero is bested or just straight up fails to win, only to get back up, continue the adventure and save the world. Depending on the handling, it can be really fulfilling.

These two things can and will make or break the games for people, so that is a disclaimer. Aside from that, the game is absolutely excellent. I love it.

1-ITS a absoulity massive game with a lot of difrent enemeys and places to explore witch is awesome.

2- However I must say as a Dragon Quest fan their was a lot of disapiontment as well sadly.

3-First of all waay too many weird/gay and unnessary things in this game that took the points down for me alot.

4-After playing 7 and 8 witch are much better in every way for me at least im Hesident on playing any further Dragon Quest games. 8 was the bees nees for me with a great cast of Heroes and awesome story all the way around with a very rewording ending-plus the freging awesome OP super cool monster teams you can aquire make it a masterpeace.

5-This game has NONE of that A weird story that jumps around ALOT with often weird and unnessary plot turns way too many heroes to choose from I mean granted i like a little verity sometimes too and some of them are a bit interesting but would of made better NPC canpanions rather then playible heroes 

6-And the most worst dissipointing thing of all is NO MONSTER RECRUITING WHAT SO EVER whitch is half of what made me fall in love with 8 in the first place Now to be fair ive never played 9 or 10 so maby this is the first on sence 8 without that i dont know.

7-With all that being said it is a ok stand alone game on it's own with no need at all to have played any Dragon Quest games before as it story has nothing at all to do with previous games its tottily new witch is ok i guess.

8- As well i really did realy love the deep Hero skill trees witch offer a nice many choices when choosing play style and most of the magic a sp mooves where very nice looking all around I really haft to say a 7/10 but a solid game none the less I would still reconmend this but just dont compare this to other games if you want to enjoy it for what it is on its own.",1624642245,1624642245,True,0,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

Story is somewhat generic but with lots of charm, the cast of characters are very pleasant to be around and with them following you it helps with the suspension of disbelief/immersion.

Post-game content is a must, without it there are loose ends.

Every party member feels good to use and the game makes it easy to swap them and their equipment mid battle. The option for super-fast battle speed is a huge plus.

Getting through the entire game and getting 100% completion are completely doable without a guide save for maybe 1 or 2 achievements. The game gives you all of the tools not to get stuck and frustrated.

General gameplay: Progression feels rewarding, and gear hunting is quite fun. Farming isn't a chore, and unnecessary unless you want to really deck yourself out, which is unneeded as the game isn't too difficult. It's semi-open world, with a bunch of open regions to explore, each tied to a city area that matches the aesthetic of the locale, that are either connected by land or by sea (or by sky). There are three acts to the story, and in the second and third acts, the game stops handholding you through a linear-ish experience through these places and you can do things the order you want. The skill system also seems narrow at first, but it opens out in the second act so to make each party member increasingly unique the more you invest into them. There's a forging mini-game for crafting items in here, and it's actually oddly satisfying. There's a whole art and science to it.

The combat: The turn-based combat is relatively average compared to other JRPG's. There is little in the way of synergies and setups between the 8 party members (of which you can pick 4 to participate in a battle, though you can change your lineup in the middle of it), and when are are, the few instances of them can trivialize the combat somewhat. Their answer to this seems to be the pepped-up powers, which are just skills you need multiple party members to use, but getting into the 'pepped-up' state to use them takes a while, so it's hard to reply upon them for aid in combat. Pep-skills are actually more useful when grinding exp. As a result, most of combat is every character spamming their strongest aoe/single-target abilities and the healer spamming buffs and heals. 

The art direction: There are two completely different art-styles you can choose from: the normal 3D, or a top-down 2D reminiscent of older JRPG's, making it a 2-in-1 package. It's hard to hate it, seeing the effort it must've taken to make what is essentially two games. It's designed to run on the Switch, so it's no Night City on Cyberpunk, but it's nonetheless very sharp and charming. It would be a problem if you didn't like anime-style art, but you wouldn't be here in the first place if that were the case.

Music: There is music to match the grand journey you're undertaking, but the other arrangements saved for smaller moments stand out as well. The casino music probably is going to be stuck forever in my head.

Controls: This one took some time to get used to. Like with a couple other games (Sekiro comes to mind) the controls in the tutorial are given with console buttons. Going through menus in-battle use the arrow keys because you can move using W, A, S, D (which makes no difference, as combat is stand-still, turn based--unless you want to change camera perspectives). The binding is wacky, but you'll find it's even worse to try and remedy it, it's like the terrible mapping was meant to be there.

The Story: It's incredible. At first, it seems like a quintessential JRPG hero's journey, what with the hero versus the 'darkspawn' dynamic they had going at the start. However, there are genuinely unpredictable twists, and these twists continue even 70-80 hours into the game. It even manages to somehow competently shoehorn in a time travel plot device. And the scale, too. The journey you take sees you travel the whole continent, and you see sights to match, from desert cities with a tradition of horse racing, to a city built into a mountain with a fighting area as its centerpiece, to a place modeled after Venice, to islands in the sky, to a kingdom under the sea. This is to match the scope of the story, which is absolutely grand, involving the fates of all these places, the legacy of a group of heroes from centuries ago very much like yours, time itself, and resting it all on your likely underage shoulders (I'm pretty sure the hero's like 16, which brings up ethical issues of its own). DQ11's greatest strength is its story. I'm not one to get attached to characters, and I still mostly wasn't attached to specific characters, but it was a case of always wanting to see just one more step in my party's journey.

I'm not sure which aspects of the game I mentioned above combined to make the whole experience so memorable, so much bigger than the sum of its parts. Maybe it's the grand sense of scale in the story combined with the rewarding in-game progression you make with regards to your characters, and the huge and diverse world that keeps up with your progress in the story. Honestly, I don't give a shit whatever it was, but it was damn good. Personally, I recommend it.

My main issue with the game is that it's extremely 'traditional' -- to a fault. The story is very generic (chosen hero of light must save the world from darkness) as well as the combat. It felt like playing a 90s jrpg but with modern presentation (even most 90s jrpg had more 'spicy' combat to be honest).

If you're looking for a chill jrpg you can play and grind without thinking too much, give it a try, especially if you don't care about the battle system that much.

If you are looking for a jrpg with a deep & complex story and/or a deep & complex combat system, you should avoid this game as it has neither of these two things.",1624131489,1624131489,False,8,0,0.499016255140304565,2,True,False,False

I love everything about it to be honest, i set out looking for a final fantasy-style, turn based combat system & menu based interaction system, and that is what I got. It's great! Currently ~80 hrs in, and still playing it every day. I've had this game for about 6 days btw. Its everything I hoped for and more.

Story is great, better than many others I've seen.

Worth the money? ABSOLUTELY. Im ~80 hrs in right now and im level 30 out of 99, and I grinded levels a bit, so there is an insane amount of content.

Music, I usually watch youtube for background noise while I play this, however the music is great, especially the orchestral versions.

Gameplay is nice, although you have to want a menu based combat system to like it. Also, UTILIZE TACTICS!!! They are so nice to have, especially if you're one to be checked-out while playing games like this. You can also turn up the battle speed.

Controls are 100% controller, like dont play with the keyboard if you dont have to. Trust me.
Enemies are classic to other dragon quest games, but they're still different than anything youd find in other rpgs.

Character design is really nice. Except for the base hero, in my opinion. There's armor that you can get later, the ""Drasilian Armor"" that helps fit the general bill for an rpg. All of the characters have outfits as well, so if you don't like the look of a particular character, you can change it later on.

Finally, some tips. First, keep Erik on dagger if you want damage. I would keep the team focus to either single-target one-by-one elimination, or group focus where you hit and kill everyone at the same time. Also, this one is rather important, if you're trying to 100% it or just do a lot of stuff, any quests before you leave Heliodor and get chased by Hendrik ARE NOT AVAILABLE past that point, so if you have any quests to tidy up there, DO THEM EARLY. Also, any combination of characters are as viable as the next, but I typically tend to run at least 1 melee, and anyone in the left most spot in the line-up is going to be focused the most.
Also, if you need xp, play with Jade, Hero and Sylvando and use theyre pep power, it turns things into metal slimes which give a massive amount of xp (2,010 per regular metal slime and upwards of 10000 for the liquid one that spawns)

the music is incredibly grating
the gameplay is basically what you'd expect from a DQ game with some improvements
woulda loved some costumisation, like say outfit variants, even just recolours by player choice would work for me
and then there's the main character, I would have WAY preferred a custom class and custom looks, but I get why they didn't did that, you're a skinny 16-year old swordfighter in all the cutscenes
I'd say DQ fans would love this, but you'd have to be a DQ fan that never grew up
oh, and the story is just plain bad, and I seriously hate how you're a silent protagonist that constantly gets told what to do and you go along with it
you even get yes/no options where if you pick the wrong choice it just restarts the prompt or negates your choice

It's a Dragon Quest game, sure, and some of my old-school faves were ""Dragon Warrior"" titles... but that's what it is, and that's it. It doesn't really innovate. Other than a faster crafting mechanic and visible encounters, it doesn't feel much different from DQ 8.

The environment is much less interactive than I expected, and even the 3D characters and objects don't interact well; see, for instance, how characters ""hold"" things. It feels like the 3D design was an afterthought.

There's a lot of unnecessary small gameplay delays, like victory tones after every smithed item and found medal, and a LOT of NPCs shouldn't need an interaction prompt to say their unhelpful flavor text... they should just have ""passing"" speech bubbles instead. Overall, it feels like there's a lot of forced make-work.

There's also a certain archaic feel in skill planning and gear itemization; if weapon-type skills are going to overlap, then, by now, there should be a more fluid weapon-swapping system. There should also be skill buildouts... if nothing else, to swap useful accessories.

Lastly, but possibly the worst... menus are a mess. They're scattered across THREE different buttons; on my controller, they'd be X, Y, and Start. Menu, Quick Menu, and Map (which you have to tap A... a fourth button, to access the Map Menu functions). There's also an Equipment menu selection and an Item menu selection which then offers Item Bag or Equipment Bag. Where is the function you're looking to check? Expect to spend time clicking into, and then backing out of (using B... a fifth button!), various menus sometimes because there's so much overlap and near-crossover. It's a junk pile.

If I'd paid $10, I wouldn't be so disappointed, but $25 for a mostly-non-innovative ""just another DQ title"" game irks me. And, during gameplay, there are times where it really just makes me want to play FF12 or Skyrim instead, to ACTUALLY deal with the monsters (a la FF12) or ACTUALLY deal with the environments (a la Skyrim).

PS: If you want your characters to auto fight, but don't want them to waste MP on massive overkill attacks... don't buy the skill in question. The in-game combat menu options for auto-fight do not include a ""Conserve MP"" option... just ""Fight Wisely"" (which will result in overkill fighting) or ""Use No MP"". Of course, many spells come with levels, not skill points, so there's still only so much you can do.

PPS: I've been playing more, simply out of boredom... but I've finally run out of interest somewhere in the postgame. The interface is clunky and it makes everything take forever, even simple gear strategizing. Look: it's a Dragon Quest game. There's nothing remarkable or interesting. Take that for what it is.",1622750836,1623425988,False,3,0,0.381985008716583252,0,True,False,False
1295510,93568818,76561197977063672,0,29,4213,0,3619,1623791684,"It's silly, over-the-top, charming, funny, and heartwarming. Some characters and stories have had me laughing or grinning from ear to ear. While the story draws on RPG tropes, it's inventive and unique and has it's own style and often kept me guessing as to what would happen next.

But, the combat is so easy that I leave my characters on auto-pilot, even for the bosses. Most enemies go down in one hit and even large groups never present a threat. I played DQ8 and the combat there was genuinely challenging, but this has been a cakewalk from start to finish. I've had 2 characters die in total across 60 hours of play and one of those deaths was my choice so I could see what happens when someone dies! I've never had a party wipe. It's disappointing that I never need to change my loadout or playstyle for the zone I'm in, because the monsters can all be killed with the same one or two attacks and the status effects they cause are pretty much inconsequential. Maybe it gets harder later, but I'm 60 hours in and it hasn't yet!

A strange bonus from the easy combat is that it plays like one of those offline clicker games. I just set the AI and watch my team destroy the enemies. It's quite relaxing in a way. The ultra-fast mode also means a battle can take <10 seconds. Earning XP is generous and you level up often, but the skill trees are a little dull. There are also too many weapons, armour and items in my opinion and, as already mentioned, there's no point equipping that sword that does +20% damage to dragons when you can kill it in one hit anyway.

Altogether, DQ11 is a very enjoyable and uplifting game and everything has been polished and refined so well that it's a real joy to play, meaning you can sit back and take in the story and characters.

จุดเด่นที่เกมนี้เป็นเกมตำนาน  คงไปการออกแบบและลายเส้นของ Toriyama Akira หรือผู้วาด Dragonball Z

ในภาค 11 เป็น Full 3D ในแบบรูปแบบการตูน  ถ่ายทอดผ่าน ตัวละคร และสิ่งแวดล้อม  ได้อย่างดี โดยไม่ทิ้งกลิ่นไอ จากเกม 2D หรือฟิลของ
DQ ที่ยังคงอยู่  ต่างจาก ซีรีย์ FF ที่เปลี่ยนคอนเซปทุกภาค ในช่วงหลังๆ   แตกต่างจาก DQ ยังคงรักษาหลักการและทางเดิน  ถึงจะเปลี่ยน
เป็น 3D ก็ยังไม่เปลี่ยนแปลง

มาถึงจุดเด่นหลักของ DQ XI  
1.ภาพสวยในแบบ JRPG   (ฉากโล่งๆ  ไม่เน้นสมจริงหรืออิงสภาพแวดล้อมตามจริงมากนัก   เน้นสวยในแบบภาพมังงะ)
2.เสียงพากษ์ตัวละคร   และ npc ที่ดี  (แต่ตัวเอกของเราไม่มีเสียงพากษ์)
3.Battle - turnbase  ยกระบบต่อสู้มาจาก ซีรีย์ FF  มาผสมกับ เวทมนต์และคลาสของ DQ  คือระบบเซทแทติค ให้ Ai เลือกใช้สกิลเอง
  ผู้เล่นสามารถกดเพียงปุ่มเดียว ai ก็สุ้เสร็จจนจบ   ช่วยให้ง่ายต่อการ ฟาร์ม exp   แต่เวลาสู้บอส ยังคงต้องออกคำสั่งทุกตัวละครเหมือนเดิม
4.ระบบ พัฒนาผู้เล่น  มีให้ผู้เล่นปรับแต่ง skill และเลือกสายอาวุธ  โดยทุกตัวละครจะมีจุดเด่นในแต่ละสายของตัวเอง   สามารถ mixe up มาได้หลายรู้แบบ เช่น โฟกัส โจมตีสกิลเจาะจง  หรือ โจมตีหมู่ด้วยเวทมนต์ เพื่อเคลียร์ศัตรูให้ไวที่สุด
5.ระบบสร้างอาวุธ ที่มีในภาคนี้  ผู้เล่นต้องหาแร่ตามฉาก หรือ ดรอบจากมอนเตอร์  มาสร้างอาวุธเอง
6.เนื้อเรื่อง และการผจญภัย  ไม่ยากหรือเป็นเส้นตรงมากเกินไป แต่เป็นมิตรต่อผู้เล่นทุกวัย  ไม่ต้องทักาษะ eng มากนักก็เล่นได้  และไม่ได้ทำให้ผู้เล่นเดาได้ง่ายเกินไป
7.ตัวละครผู้หญิง npc ผู้หญิง  ทำออกมาได้ดีมาก  เป็นเกมที่ npc ดูดีกว่าหลายๆเกมเยอะ  555
8.ระบบเควสฮาๆ  น่ารักๆ  และมุขตลกที่สอดแทรก    ทำให้เกมนี้ไม่น่าเบื่อ

สรุป ใครเป็น แฟน DQ และ JRPG  เกมนี้ไม่ทำให้ผิดหวังแน่นอน  จากที่ผมเล่น JRPG ช่วงหลังๆ ที่ช่วงหลังๆทำให้ผิดหวัง หรือเล่นแล้วง่วงนอน  เพราะความจำเจในระบบเก็บlevelหรือความต่อเนื่องไม่ดีเพราะเคลสไร้สาระมากเกินไป    แต่ DQ 11 ไม่มีความรู้สึกแบบนั้นเลย  มีแต่ความรู้สึกดี  มีความต่อเนื่อง  และมุขฮาๆของเควส ทำให้เกมไม่น่าเบื่อ

Leans heavily towards manicheism, and happy happy goody goody closures. Many aspects are predictable, but even then the story is satisfying. The characters grow on you, and they grow themselves.

Game mechanics (outside of the obsolete turn base combat are fresh and somehow addictive). 

Music:
Beautiful, albeit repetitive since there are not so many tracks.

Visuals:
Beautiful cell shaded. Plays great at 4K. Supports 120 and 144Hz

There were a few factors that lead to the decision. I fully understand the game is a traditional RPG and that it is part of a series of traditional RPGs and it is loved because of that, but I am judging this on whether I would recommend this game to an average player in 2021, not 1980. And that means that some gameplay elements that players in 2021 are a huge turnoff, including but not limited to:

1.) Extremely Slow Gameplay - It's a traditional RPG which means the gameplay is also traditionally slow. From having to grind out skill points with an exponentially growing experience requirement to pointless Cinematic elements that take forever to get through without missing a good chunk of story (without the option to speed up the text fade-in), this game feels comparatively slow to most other games on the market right now.

2.) Needlessly Frutrating Annoyances - There are so many pointless annoyances littered throughout the game that it nearly made me give the game up completely. Having to quickly find a church or a priest every time you want to save is--in this day and age--so incredibly frustrating. The fact that the chance to flee is not set at 100% was much more troublesome than I personally thought it was going to be. There's nothing like walking into a place whilst exploring to find a higher level mob only to be unable to flee combat. Which brings me to my next point...

3.) Brutal Lost Battle Repercussions - In the early game, I was out in the field grinding for levels for ages and accumulated a somewhat impressive sum of gold while doing so. Out of curiosity, I wandered into a dungeon and was met with a battle that I had no hope of fleeing from. The untimely deaths of my team not only reset my progress exploring by sending me back to the church where I had saved last, but HALF of my gold had gone missing, presumably into the pockets of the mobs guarding my rotting corpse.

4.) The Combat Style - Oh boy, what to say here... Now don't get me wrong, I grew up playing games like Final Fantasy I through VII, Dragon Warrior Monsters, DW IV through VIII, etc. but all I can say about the menu/turn-based combat system is that it is nothing but a disappointing aggravation that always results in the mindless single-button mashing that can be done by a brain-dead gorilla. So if you've got any of those lying around, why not put them to use as you farm up your LP so you can finally use those sword skills? Honestly though, please video game devs, stop beating the dead horse. Let it die in peace.

Once again, take this review with a grain of salt. I personally loved the game overall, but I highly doubt the average player in this day and age would enjoy it half as much. I've looked at this game from dozens of angles and this was the only recommendation I could come up with. But hey, if you're into old-timey RPGs like Chrono Trigger or Grandia, why not give this game a try? The entertaining story and silly artwork were more than enough to satisfy me and my love for RPGs, and they could be for you as well.",1622552383,1622552383,False,11,5,0.405239522457122803,4,True,False,False

So, this game is the DQ game we've been wanting since we all played 8 and forgot what it means to eat, shower and sleep...only without the things that sort of sucked about 8. Hated that slow walk? Guess what, you can run in this game!!! Hated grinding on metal enemies? Guess what!? Killing metal enemies in this game is MUCH easier!! Hated the *ridiculous* amount of exp it took to level up? [Seriously, who the hell ever reached level 99 without cheats? Anyone?] Guess what!?!?! Exp required to level up over the course of the game isn't a straight vertical line. In fact, reaching level 99 [not necessary of course] is pretty easy, and not a ton of time required! Will you spend as much time with this title as you did with 8? Probably, but the real joy is that half of your logged hours won't be time spent grinding! 

That's all I really want to say. I don't wanna get into specifics about how to kill the metal slimes; I'm sure you'll figure it out, my fellow Dragonquesters. And fear not, the post game will rock your world once more. Enjoy this great title.

At the very beginning let me warn you: Dragon Quest is an old franchise. It pretty much defined the whole genre of Jrpg being like a root solution for the games to come. That means you may not like the whole mechanics that comes with the DQXI. Certain solutions inside the game are not exactly new so they may piss off some players that didn't have the opportunity to play older DQ games. 

DQXI is a good chunk of jrpg. Quests, character customisation and battle mechanic....pretty much standard that comes with DQ lore. There's always something to do though the collecting process may not feel as rewarding as in other games. After some time it comes down to „Go to point A and collect item B” pattern with no real challenge besides the fighting.

[h1]Plot[/h1]

Plotwise also standard DQ high-fantasy story about the hero, misunderstandings with a plot twist but pretty generic. Again, not everybody's cup of coffee. 
Characters are very archetype of themselves. We have a hero, a thief like vagabond, flamboyant swordsman and so on. They behave exactly as they looks. That may feel plastic but you quickly grow to like them.
In my opinion that's where DQXI shines mostly. In it's predictability and almost childish, pure fantasy story. As something very solid. 

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
Akira Toriyama’s style may not be taken very seriously by some...Sometimes goofy and childlike characters while being sometimes sexualised at the same time creates a sort of contrast to other styles in JRPGS. But such is a prize of originality. 
Though the game may be recognised as a’la Dragon Ball Z the usage of 3D allowed the style to be more solid than ever. It's like the best iteration that shows how one style can evolve over the years and be almost the same as older generations. If that isn’t beauty then I don’t know what it is. 

[h1]Sound:[/h1]
Intro song is also something to be expected from DQ. Pompous and mighty yet still fitting for the hero story. The overall BGM side is pretty DQ-like but elevated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Orchestra. It’s solid but may become tiring after the while. 

 Yes I’m only 12 hours inside the game. And yes, I’ve played some earlier instalments. With that info I can vouch for the Dragon Quest XI. It you like standard almost raw fantasy stories with just a sprinkle of new technology- go ahead....You won’t be disappointed.",1619720249,1620476623,True,59,0,0.796640992164611816,0,True,False,False

Once you have played for 3 hours you have seen every RPG element and combat mechanic in the game. The formula is very simple. Grind trash mobs. Fight some boss. This progresses the story. Go somewhere else and repeat. Now this is kind of in every RPG game, but the issue is that every trash mob takes 2 AOE hits to beat, and every boss feels very similar. There is virtually nothing off the beaten track to discover, and the side quests and RPG elements are very shallow.

This makes hour 30 feel basically the same as hour 3, so it becomes very grindy and feels more like a chore than anything since you know there is literally nothing cool or exciting to work towards. Just items with a better stat pad and abilities with better stats. And, you can't save when you want to or see any enemies health or see how long until you level up for no better reason than ""that's how it was in 1986 in Dragon Quest 1"".

As a port, it's incredibly lazy. The icons for which button to press still map to the switch. You open up the game and it says ""press A to interact"" but A is move left.

- Beating the game
- Getting all my party members up to Level 99 (actually pretty easy)
- Getting all the alternative outfits
- Defeating all the optional challenges
- Playing the casino games (surprisingly easy)
- Completing the Tockle's quests (2nd worst part)
- Beating the Superboss of the game (The one and only WORST part of the game)

And I enjoyed every minute of it.

The game is fairly straight-forward, the story is fantastic despite being a bit cliche, the characters have great story arcs, the world and creature design is great if a bit goofy, the music is awesome despite there not being much of it... It's just a good game. PERIOD.

The only caveats I have that would hold you back would be these:
- You don't like JRPGs, which I get as I don't tend to like them either. But every Dragon Quest game I've played I would really enjoying, so this might be a good place to test the waters as the series is largely responsible for a lot of the tropes of the genre.

- Square Enix does not put their games on sale that often and not at a steep one at that. In a lot of ways they're similar to Activision in that if you get a deal that's 25% or if you're lucky 50%, you better grab it because you aren't getting a better deal. That being said, there is a free demo you can play that goes fairly far into the game and lets you keep any progress that you've made which offsets this fact. Plus, Dragon Quest is a pretty budget-friendly game in that you will get a lot of playtime for the price you pay.

every town you visit is different and fantastic in its own ways. you never really visit a town and expect the same. quests and stories are diverse. I have played the hell out of this game and although I am marching furiously towards the end i am doing side quests because i do not want it to end.

Music can be repetitive but anyone that played dragon warrior knows that it is kind of what makes it feel like a classic game and where i think final fantasy went wrong on the last one. 

Every character is fantastic and interesting . I have a special sport for 3 but i wont spoil.

If you played the old dragon warriors and old final fintasies and want the same feeling but with awesome crisp new graphics and long hours of addictive play buy this game. you won't regret it.

I kind of want to end the game and then play it on 2D to get some extra nostalgia.

The art style is great and one of the things that drew me to it the most.  It's overall a very easy game on the default settings, I only had to try a few of the bosses more than once.  I get that it has the options to make it more difficult but as a first time player I'm not gonna start tacking on restraints; the game should probably have just been a little more of a challenge as a baseline.  I don't appreciate a game where a cutscene plays and then control of the game is returned to the player just so they can move a few feet to initiate another cutscene, it's very pointless.  Just play the whole scene you want to play.

I did really enjoy playing it.  It's a game that kept me coming back to play a few hours every night or so.  I did a few side quests and just finished the main quest a bit over 40 hours.  I dunno what people are doing in this game to extend the playtime to 100 but I can't see myself doing that; I might dink around with the postgame content a bit but honestly I'm satisfied with the end of the main story and I'm not sure I'm as invested in continuing to come back and put more time into this.

Anyway, fine game.  I bought it on sale after playing the demo for a couple of hours and I would say it was worth it.  Not an all-timer for me but I had fun!

Edit:  I did find myself drawn to keep playing in the postgame.  It was fine, but it starts to get to a point where all you can do to progress is joyless side quests and mindless grinding.  Not gonna lie, I went ahead and cheated to get through that faster.  I would have been so pissed off if I played this game for another 40 hours just to get to the point where I could pass some trials and beat the second Big Bad.  I guess there's a real audience for this kind of boring garbage but if you're like me and don't want to spend hours and hours just to bring your stats up so that you can wang the endgame, I'd say just don't bother.

I still think this was worth it at the sale price, but just know people talking about hundred hour gameplay is totally artificial and straight up expecting you to spend hours and hours and hours of just grinding exp just to get through a super underwhelming, uninteresting, lackluster ending.",1618901906,1619337889,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

longer version: ive played dragon quest 8 and a couple of nintendo ds versions of dragon quest, and i can say that already this is probably the best dragon quest i've ever played, something about the atmosphere and hilarious characters/writing has hooked me right in! the story telling is well paced and it covers a range of emotions too. the combat is your typical jrpg turn based action! your party members (and yourself)  however have the ability to become ''pepped up'' a sort of magical rage that u can combine with other party members pepped up state to unleash duo specific abilities that can damage/debuff enemies greatly, or buff yourself and party greatly, i simply love this system, their is also ALOT of different kinds of enemies as u should expect from a jrpg, lots of boss battles too. The world is packed full of things to find, sidequests every so often, collectables, loot, and materials for crafting. the crafting component is awesome! you essentially get a pocket forge that u can use anytime and pick from a wide array of recipes (which you also need to look for) and then u craft it by hammering away carefully on your new forged gear, the more perfect you hammer it out the more powerful your gear will be when you finish it! i wont get into the story, but expect something in the area of 80-100 hours of just main story! to wrap this up this game so far has been phenomenal, its story is keeping me engaged and wanting more, the turn based action is addictive yet stays true to the classic formula, and the atmosphere, from the music to the different lands you explore is simply alluring and FUN!

For 50 bucks only this experience is a steal! if you like jrpgs and haven't played a dragon quest game ever or if you, like me, came back to the series years later to see how dragon quest has been, then you will ABSOLUTELY love this experience! 9/10!",1618912395,1618912602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everything was very well done in this title, from overall story to every minor detail. Each character has soul and you could relate or connect with each of them, even the NPCs across Erdrea felt more alive and like actual people.

I loved how the writers balanced out the more serious, sad and dark tones with humorous, fun and light filled moments. 

Game play wise, you do need to grind a little to get to appropriate levels throughout the game, but honestly, its well balanced as you progress through the story, so it doesn't feel too tedious.

Dragon Quest XI is one of the best video games I have ever played.

In 1986, a bunch of Japanese game designers came together, took the RPG elements that were floating around in PC games at the time, combined them, ironed them out, and (mostly) streamlined them, and created a Famicom game not quite like anything before it. To ensure its success, they got Akira Toriyama for the art and character design when his manga, Dragon Ball, was flying off shelves. Pioneering the RPG sub-genre that would be known as the JRPG, Dragon Quest was born. Admittedly, the original hasn't aged fantastically but was perhaps revolutionary for its time. The series was continued and, by Dragon Quest III in 1988, it was perfected. Every entry has taken the formula and added new layers, sometimes removing previous layers, but it still has the same rock hard core.

You don't need to have played any previous Dragon Quest games. They will all contain references and throwbacks to previous entries but the story is not directly connected (except I, II, and III - IV, V, and VI are connected but it doesn't affect the story - actually, they may all be in one or two timelines but this isn't the place for theories). However, I do highly suggest checking out the first 3 games, known as the Erdrick trilogy, in order to understand the major references.

By playing Dragon Quest XI, you are committing yourself to a story of love and tragedy told over countless hours both directly and indirectly. This is not a game for the impatient. Please, take your time to talk to every NPC, read every book, observe every scene. This story is not simply told through the cutscenes, every character you meet is a piece of the world, see what they have to say, you never know what you might learn. 

Try the demo and when you arrive in Heliodor, have a good look around. You can learn how the city was founded, about the steadfast knights who defend it, the daily lives of the citizens, perhaps even a little about the other great kingdoms of Erdrea. As the story goes on, you will amass friends. Talk to your friends. you will love them, chat with them, hang out with them. You may lose your family, your home, everything you love, but home is anywhere people care about you and these people do.

Now go
save
the world.

P.S. Please play the 3D mode, the 2D mode was added for the definitive edition and it's a cool throwback I guess. But it suffers issues many ""retro-style"" games suffer, that is primarily to not actually look as good as the games they're trying to throw back to. You will be forced into 2D mode when visiting Tickington, a bonus location added to the definitive edition (technically the Japanese-only 3DS version first) where you visit the worlds of past DQ games which would've been awesome in the graphical style of DQXI's 3D mode but sadly we were robbed and you will understand why we don't like it.",1618818552,1618819761,True,22,1,0.664551436901092529,0,True,False,False

The last time I was so utterly disappointed in a game was Dark Souls 2 and Civilization: Beyond Earth. I like JRPGs and I like turnbased combat, but this game is as bland as can be.

Story is something an Elementary School pupil might come up with. There's the damsel in distress that doesn't do anything besides enabling the protagonist through her utter incompetence, and within the first hour you are randomly told that you are the chosen by your obese mom standing in the kitchen cooking food for you. Splendid.

Combat is very vanilla, turn-based with nothing special to it, which is what I signed up for, but If it stays that simple even in lategame, then that's a problem.

Graphics are ""OK"", art style is offputting to me, because it looks like an 80s DBZ anime. I obviously knew that beforehand, but I was willing to look past it because of the good reviews. Had I known that the bland art style is a direct representation of the bland gameplay and story, I would've stayed away from this ""classic"".

The game has good voiceovers, which I really appreciate... except for the protagonist, who is completely mute, which constantly broke my immersion and makes for weird one-sided interactions.

In the end I feel rather delusional belonging to a very small minority of people who do not like this game at all, especially since I grew up with and love oldschool JRPGs. I'm also mindful of the fact that I quit after slightly more than 3h, but I'm just not willing to invest more and supposedly the way the game plays does not change significantly later on.",1618069755,1618069755,False,13,5,0.432049959897994995,0,True,False,False

There is also the new side quests where you go back to the worlds from past Dragon Quest games. I skipped over these since I haven't played any of the other games

My only complaint is that the music is kind of generic and terrible, even with the orchestral versions in this version of the game. You'll be hearing the same 4-5 tracks throughout the entire game. Second complaint is that Act 3 is very weak compared to Act 1 and 2. It mainly consists of grinding metal slimes in between story segments, and a lot of Act 3 is just recycled content.

The story is fun and interesting

The best part of this game is how it makes you feel you've achieved something as you pass each hurdle. Speaking of hurdles this game will make you think its over multiple times before its true ending which gives you a nice reset when things begin to feel stale. 

Saying this the combat system is old yet still satisfying and the plot is predictable yet still equally as satisfying.

If I had only one real gripe it would be with the lack of good side quests in this game as most including the passtime mini games/quests seem pointless.

I was so sick of all my games. I just wanted something kinda mindless and easy but with room to grow if I decided to dive deeper. I most wanted some cool JRPG that I had never heard of... but that's impossible, right? I know Dragon Quest is a storied institution lol. But I hadnt played one since like the 90s.  I tried this out and was so pleasantly surprised.
The graphics are awesome. They dont try to make it realistic and just keep an anime type style. The black outlines on characters make it look even more like animation.
Lots of people complain the game is too easy. I thought that as well at first. At the end, I still wouldnt call it difficult, but late in the game and (post-game ;)) it gets more difficult.
You can add settings to make the game more difficult also. Such as no healing items, etc. You can make it quite hard if you want..
You can also make the game become a 2D game at any time at a save point. As in, it looks like an old pixel RPG. There are levels that allow you to play other timelines in the 2D universe. (some you might recognize :))
It's a long game. And there are tons of achievements. collectibles, secrets. Casino mini games. All that ish.

Only con for me would be that it is kind of a lame story (HOWEVER: if you arent someone who desires long Final Fantasy uncanny valley quasi-anime stories that you actually hate and you just want to get to the next part of the game where you can level up and explore and do side quests, etc... then the story is fine.)

And it's almost like the game reminds you of this ----^ you can turn it into Dragon Warrior 1 at anytime you want at which point worrying about the nuance in a story line seems kind of silly. The game is meta and aware of itself. 

I was very impressed and I still have tons to do. I am very glad I bought this game. It took care of an itch i had for a while.  Check it out :)",1617073640,1617073640,True,1,0,0.512987017631530762,0,True,False,False

Pros: The fact that you can play in 2d mode and 3d mode is awesome. It's story is decent, game play is on par with other games but the length of the story and the after game content is superb. It doesn't feel so ""talkative"" as other rpgs can feel and it doesn't feel grindy. The visuals are par excellence and the world design is great. This game will feel very familiar for fans of the series.

Cons: If you're looking for an action RPG look elsewhere. This is a turn based game. Even though they allow you to control your characters movement during combat you attack by selecting from a menu. This game will feel very familiar to fans of the series. The monsters, the game system, even the crafting are pretty much on par with other games of the series. Nothing really new or innovative here.

This has got to be the most engrossing storyline I've ever played. Sometimes I feel there's a bit too much story and not enough time for playing, but there's so much to tell. I never played the original version of this so this S version has been my first experience with it. I'm about 40 hours in as I write this and I'm still not done with the main quest yet. This is the longest game I've played in a while. 

Sometimes it feels a bit too kid-like with all the anime, but the characters are well drawn and the voice acting is decent enough. I'm sure this game will get me close to or over 100 hours assuming the whole world opens up once the main quest is beaten. It seemed a bit too easy at the beginning, but lately it has been getting harder or maybe I'm just not keeping up with equipment. I welcome the challenge though.

If you're into story rich scenarios with great writing and rpg lines...well...this one might not be a homerun. There's cheesy deus ex machina features, nonsensical scenes and pretty lame dialogues sometimes. But hey, if you're here like me to feel that old jrpg classic twist, I gotta say: this one delivers it. Fun battles in hard mode Draconian Quest, colourful themes and the strong journey of the hero saga with a base of emotions here and there. The world doesn't feel as vast as DQVIII felt and, I'm sorry, you won't have a rodent pet. Huge letdown. But I'm only 15h in the game and have just collected my third and fourth companions.

You start the game and you get this really nice intro. The little save menu music is charming and and the whole opening to the story is great. The world looks really nice and the monsters are so well-animated and charming. The story also progresses nicely as you meet new party members in different areas and solve their respective problems. Overall, the devs were clearly skipping out on some of their square enix crack rations but it's a fun and more simplistic game. 

The second half of the game is just great because someone could probably mod it out of the PC version and the only extra flaw you'd get is one underdeveloped character. It's an extra 30 hours that doesn't need to be there at all (probably - I did about 15 hours of bullshit and gave up playing the game, so I never reached the end). I can't say much without minor spoilers, but the game is not fun. Combat gets significantly worse for several hours, time you would've spent finding new monsters before is replaced with fighting versions of old monsters that have new eyes colours and the music keeps repeating so much. There's like 1 theme for every type of area/type of cutscene in the game. The plot ends up moving so slowly that when the next bit of predictable anime garbage I've seen 100 billion times showed up I snapped and quit the game because however many hours of bullshit wasn't going to be worth it for this game's ending which is probably really easy to predict anyway. I bet no party members die and there's a big dragon that either saves them or more likely bestows some sort of weapon unto them that allows them to beat the bad guy.

Maybe I'll come back to this in a while when I've quelled my seething gamer rage but for now I'll just quit games for 2 weeks again or something who fucking cares why are you still reading this why do you even ca Edit: changed wording a bit to improve readability.

The story is interesting enough to make up for the constant tropes.  There's an attractive female party member so if you don't like fan service you'll have to leave her out of your party and not do her sidequests.  For some reason this version completely replaced the original PC release version, so none of the mods for the original work on this, but people are working on porting them over.  I've spent 95 hours in the game so far without getting bored, doing sidequests whenever it feels like I'm about to do something point-of-no-return like.

UPDATE: At 131 hours I've finished getting all of the Steam achievements, but I didn't bother completing the in-game accolades.  There's a whole lot more shit to do but I just don't have any interest in doing it.  If you're looking for a fun JRPG with lots to do then you will not regret picking this up.  I believe the only things that are potentially missable are the enemy logs, but I think if you use 2D mode with chapter select you can go back to earlier chapters of the game to find the ones you've missed, but it's a one-way trip so you'll have to replay back to where you were.a",1613659973,1614922191,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story later got actually very engaging with quite a few unexpected turns. I never would have guessed how the story ended. 

This is a LONG game, you should be prepared for that. This is a long adventures journey that will take lots of your time to finish. Around 60h in I was hoping the game would finally end because I was burned out from it. When I was 80h in I was actually surprised of how interesting the story got, that when I finished it with around 102h I was actually kind of sad it ended.

The Gameplay is your classical turn based Dragon Quest Fighting System, but refined to modern standarts. It might be to this day the best turn based game I have played.

The graphics I shoudn´t even have to mention if you saw a screenshot, they are absolutely fantastic. The Lighting really brings everything home. 10/10

The music while beautifully orchestrated was very exhausting. There are VERY few tracks in this game and they keep playing over and over. Luckily in this version they addded the option to instead use the DQVIII Soundtrack and one can even change both Soundtracks to a bit version if wanted. (Awesome Feature, I do have to say)

Then in this version there is the option to play the entire game in a 2D pixelated version. You heard right. You can switch between these modes whenever you want. Kind of insane how much work the devs did for this game, I really have to praise them for it.

If you like Dragon Quest this game is a no brainer. If you didn´t like them in the past, this one might actually still be interesting for you. So it comes down to whether you like turn based JRPG´s and are ready to spend at least 70-80h into a game. Overall I can absolutely recommend this game. it is, dispite its flaws, quite honestly probably one of the best JRPG´s ever made.",1614885947,1614885947,True,127,0,0.890199720859527588,0,True,False,False

The graphics are just beautiful. some of the cutscenes and areas of the game look so nice you can't help but screenshot it. Each character is unique in their own way having their own personality, weapons they can use, abilities and outfits exclusive to each party member making each of them feel more human. 

The story is hours long and gripping enough to keep you invested for hundreds of hours with 3 seperate parts to the game, act 1 being the main plot, act 2 being the aftermath of act 1 and act 3 (the postgame) being optional and taking place kind of inbetween 1 and 2 but still doing things very different. 

Each boss is very fun to fight and in its own way they're all a good challenge that requires a good deal of strategy to beat. I find that the harder the bosses get the more fun they are as it makes you need to prepare and strategize better in order to come out on top. That alongside the fact this is the new version of dq11 which has 12 new bosses which are all optional but take you back to locations from past games is just amazing to see. I personally loved to see the obervatory from 9 come back in this game even if it was just for an optional side quest.

Overall this game is amazing with some mild flaws, most of which end up getting fixed in this version of the game. It is easily a game worth sinking hundreds of hours into to complete all the content you can.

Good:
- Beautiful graphics and music
- Lots of nooks and crannies to explore
- Story is decent, although not very original
- Traditional turn-based gameplay
- Good port, no bugs, full controller and remote play support

Bad:
- Very, very, almost insultingly easy. Unless you completely aren't paying attention, you can breeze through almost the entire game. I found myself putting off allocating skill points because I didn't need them. DQ games were never that hard, but here there is just no challenge whatsoever or sense that you could fail.
- Areas are not very open and are essentially series of connected corridors. The SNES DQ games were more ""open world"" in the sense that you could travel freely around an overworld map. Here, there is an overworld map, but you can only sail freely in the boat.
- No pause button, not a big deal but also something it seems could have easily been added.
- No 21:9 support.

However, I truly enjoyed this game. All the characters in your party are interesting people who have believable motives for why they do what they do. The world feels alive since there are many NPCs who give you quests that make you actually feel for them. Or they give out quests that reveal something about other characters you know. I fully recommend you try to read all the lore books you find! The ones about the traveler looking for the rainbough is particularly enjoyable. The story is a bit long (around 60 hrs with some grinding), but very worth it. I actually disliked Sylvando (you'll know who he is) at the start, but i gradually grew to really like him! He brings a light to the group that none of the others have. And there is OK character growth throughout, not really much for your party, but definitely for some of the side characters.   

The combat is pretty standard fare for a JRPG, simple turn based combat that doesn't require crazy inputs or combos. I played on normal difficulty, so the vast majority of the game was quite easy, but I still had trouble with a few bosses, including the final one! 
The art style is classic, I don't think it can ever look 'old' or 'bad', but it definitely is not Breath of the Wild. The environment can look bland at times, but there are definitely parts where you feel like actually using the camera function (yeah that's a thing). Overall, it does a decent job setting the tone and feeling fresh despite being quite old. 

Overall I give this game a 8/10. It kept me engrossed in a story that was fairly standard for a JRPG, but it did so with a charm that I haven't experienced in a long time from western RPGs. I genuinely cared about my party members and the world. There is plenty of lore to get invested in, though the depth is not akin to The Elder Scrolls games. It is enough to service the larger story of the game, but nothing more, so the game feels like a nice package wrapped up with a bow. If you've never played a JRPG, I would say this is the perfect game to start with.

Dragon Quest XI remains a fine game, in many ways Square-Enix's counterbalance to Final Fantasy: while Final Fantasy keeps changing and trying out new things, Dragon Quest, for better or worse, keeps to an old-school JRPG format.

Dragon Quest XI S is a great callback to old school RPGs, filled with that patented Dragon Quest charm found in the dialogue and the cliched but nostalgic tropes. Having played 5,8, and 9 before along with a couple of the spin-offs, I'm fairly accustomed to the series so I was looking forward to playing this game back when it came out in 2018 but ended up pushing it further and further towards the end of the backlog. I ended up buying it for Steam and PS4 lol.  

Finally, the Definitive Edition released for Steam and PS4 which I got although I already bought the base game before. Now, Square Enix could've cut their loyal consumers some slack by either reducing the cost of the game or making it so that those who own the original can buy the updated version with a discount. But they didn't and it caused a bit of a stir in the community. I have myself have no problem buying games on multiple systems or multiple versions (trust me, I've done that numerous times) but when finally giving the Switch content to other consoles after a year, you could've knocked off $10 off, even temporarily. But whatever, onto the game itself. 

Oh but before that, in regards to the graphics, I did played a bit of DQ11 OG before and graphically, you can tell that the Definitive Edition has some noticeable downgrades. All of you who say it doesn't matter, well that's case by case and for me, it definitely matters. It's the Switch textures with scalable resolution with worse anti-aliasing. Pop-ins are more apparent and sometimes the lighting flickers abnormally. Hopefully down the line, someone will fix the graphics via mods but as of now, it is graphically an inferior game compared to prior release (which you can't even get on Steam anymore...) Also, the cutscenes just look worse. Like lower bitrate and artifacts everywhere. Btw playing 1080p on the highest settings with an RTX 2070 so it's not like my system is straining to run this (then again, I would assume this version would be less intensive to run compared to OG). Honestly you can say you're not playing for the graphics, but why limit yourself if the game can look better. To be brutally honest, this is a half-arsed PC port of DQ on the Switch with some basic PC settings. Square Enix PC ports aren't known for being good (I have most of them), but hey at least this game works out of the box without any needed external changes or any official patches.

Characters and story wise, it was decent as is, nothing new but that's always been the style of DQ games. While I liked the cast, there could've been more character interactions and dialogue between members. Party Talk is there but it's not the same. Wished more games would implement something akin to the Skits from the Tales games or better yet add conversations during traversing/battles. Characters like Erik and Sylvando were good characters to begin with and seeing the backstory and developments your party go through helps make them even more likeable. Your MC being a silent protag is always a polarizing thing but I didn't mind it save for some moments that he could have been proactive. Especially in Act 3, but that's for later. 

The story is serviceable and gets predictable but is decent for a majority of the game. The twists you'll encounter can be surprising and the ending of Act 2 is satisfying and adds some needed closure to the game. I like that tragedy is present throughout the story and it makes the world more believable. Also the variety of towns/ciy and its inhabitants is something I always welcome in these type of games. Traveling all around the world, there should be different cultures and customs and that is present in this game, just wished to could've gone that extra mile to knock it out of the park.  



Spoilers Below:



Then Act 3 happens. Honestly beating the game at Act 2 after everything that has transpired was refreshing, relieving and just makes you feel good. I got my happy ending, although it was bittersweet with Veronica's death and the world being plunged into darkness before. Nautica was destroyed and its Queen gave up her life to save yours but all of these sacrifices were heart-wrenching but strengthened your resolve to defeat Mordegon once and for all. After credits roll and you open your save game again, you'll get the option to travel back to time to ensure Veronica live and prevent the world from ending. 

This is where the game falls apart. Essentially the world is reset and you'll have to retread all of the old regions and areas again. This would've been fine had we not have to relive the similar storylines watered down. Sylvando's reunion with his father, Erik and Mia, Mordegon, and worst of all, Michelle the Mermaid.
Her story ended with her ending her own life in my playthrough and seeing her alive again was a plothole, pure and simple. Actually it's the same as Jade having Revamp since time traveling means the Octagonia Casino event never happened. Essentially, in your journey to stop Mordegon and save Veronica, you let another ancient evil live and now he is the true boss. And boy, what a disappointing boss. Dragon Quest was never known for their deep antagonists but not only did Calasmo lacked depth, his design just f***ing sucks. He's either an overgrown flea or Cell 2nd form's steroid induced cousin. 

It was honestly a slog trying to get through Act 3 and it made me dislike what would've been a pretty good JRPG. I had to take multiple breaks because I really was going through the same dungeons and regions again with the same enemies and even recycled bosses. Had they added new patterns or restrictions to each boss battle, the battle aspect would've been more fun to me. Drustan's Trial was the most egregious of said recycled content. Also, I believe in experiencing the game without modifiers (Draconian mode) to enjoy the game the way it was intended. The game overall was on the easier side because of it and I managed to beat most bosses without getting wiped. Calasmo was defeated with my party at lvl 70 average and honestly I was checked out by then and was playing poorly but it still took one try. Overall, Act 3 soured my opnion towards this game.

But the lead up to the climax of Act 2, with the single character episodes, Hendrick's redemption arc, and Serena growing to become independent was great. It made the fight against the forces of evil and eradicating Mordegon more worthwhile, as stated before. There were stakes to be had, Mordegon was more personal of a villain than Calasmo was to the party and the world. The Tickington side content is cool and a nice throwback as well as being able to play the entirety of the game in 2D mode, which I'm saving for a future playthrough. The gameplay is fun, the QoL changes are welcome and it IS a good game. Up to Act 2 where you get the base ending, it's for sure an 8/10. After playing through Act 3, I would drop it down to 7/10. I'm just not of the opinion that it is one of the best JRPG of this generation or of all time. Had they dropped the time travel and instead had the party battle a new evil after Mordegon and discover a way to revive Veronica maybe at a cost (maybe going through a lost dungeon in search of a way that ends in having Serena's remaining life/lvls cut in half to bring her sister back), maybe I'll sing a different tune, But honestly, 2/3 of the game is good as is while the remaining portion drags the overall experience for me. I'd say get it if you want a modern day traditonal JRPG but for me, the game was good at best and decent a worst.

 - If you don't own DQXI, disregard review and purchase. Very worthy game.
 - However, repurchasing I couldn't recommend because it's minor improvements over the prior version, and the main brand new feature, 2D mode, was buggy and poorly implemented.
 - I felt that the majority of players were likely in the repurchase frame of mind, and therefore went with a non-recommend rating.

Since then, I've come to adapt a bit more. Some settings alterations made the 2D mode much more playable, and it plays generally quicker than in 3D mode, with some nitpicks. Here's a list of features (good and bad) of 2D mode you likely will not be finding on other lists, as some are probably a bit nitpicky and tough to notice, or just seem obvious:

 - Battle speed is generally quite fast and minimally animated. 
 - However, the game lists every bit of damage dealt separately. This means if you attack 4-8 enemies with Boomerangs, Whips (fewer), or all-enemy spells/skills, you will be seeing every enemy struck separately from left to right, one at a time, even the enemies that take 0 damage. Boomerangs (dual wielded) and some Whip skills get 2 strikes apiece. This adds up to a fairly hefty chunk in battle time compared to the 3D version.
 - And yet, battles seem to have fewer groups with larger size, improving said group skills tremendously. Yes, there are 8-enemy battles occasionally, whereas I think the 3D had a max of 5. This is comparing the 2D S-version to the 3D original, so I'm not sure if that has changed in the 3D S-Version.
 - In 2D, battles are completed by initially giving everyone's commands together, and then finding out how they order it and fulfill the commands. Harder to plan around. However, it feels like when you place a tactic on somebody to override giving them commands, they will choose an action based on when they come up in your lineup, not what'd be expected from before the fastest characters' actions. Very important for that healer in your group to benefit from, unless you want to stack all of your Agility on them.
 - Also, at least with Tactics on (I always do in 2D), only 1 Pep Power per turn, announced prior to any character. I'm not even sure if it takes up that character's turn, to be honest.
 - There are no enemy-approach battles. You cannot hunt those cacti to find the rarified version as easily, for the most part. That said, I think I ran into one on accident in my first encounter with them, before I then grabbed the quest and spent a half an hour trying to find a second one. As such, Crackshot Bow and sword strike have no effect pre-encounter in the 2D version.
 - Fun-Size forge was annoyingly difficult to read if you were close to the goal in the 3D version. In 2D, it's just more pixellated and even harder to tell. I've also been getting annoyingly few crits, but maybe that's just because I'm used to late-game crit rate.
 - I think the ""Neighboring Zone Enemy List"" has been removed.
 - I know I haven't been able to find the Sparkly Spot identifier, I assume this didn't make the transfer, either. However, Sparkly Spots aren't a total loss because everything is insanely easier to find. Maps in general are smaller and easier to cover. Sparklies are still moderately difficult because they don't sparkle until within like 5 range, but they can't be as well hidden. Additionally, overworld maps have new ""Trove Zones"", where they often take several of a map's treasures and tuck them in an easy-to-plunder zone, all easily identified by running around. If you see a full box-sized clearing in the trees, you have a Trove Zone which can hold everything from Chests, to Sparkly Spots, to Magic/Locked areas with a chest in it, and I found me a Tockle in one of them so far. Tons of goodies, generally easy to find.
 - I have found that the 3-resource ""Sparkly Spots"" (ore/tree/chopped plant) often regenerate extremely quickly, though often incompletely, only holding 1-2 items a lot.
 - Tickington is less boring to me than I imagined. Not by a lot, since I'm not familiar with much DQ Lore, but the quests are easy to quickly do and move on, have a snippet of what's going on, and get going with the next thing. Nice break when you want it. DQIX is also represented, which I had doubts of, and apparently the quests are divided by game of origin, but sometimes intertwine with quests from other games. I've found one crossover so far, and I suspect a second.

Note that this is based on playing up to about 3/4 the way through Act I of the game, getting to the Cold North, and all on 2D mode. I previously beat the game, all 3 acts, with little else to accomplish in the original, which is my main comparison.

There's some good and bad in there, but overall, it's got its niche. It's not much to look at, and cutscenes are generally too dull to prefer over 3D, but it can be beneficial if you plan around things correctly. I'm also more hopeful of the late-game environment, when I get there. As such, I will be upgrading the review to Recommended, even if just barely for those of us who have played the original.",1610956652,1612435942,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Original Review:
[h1] Playing on Linux and the game won't boot? Read past the review part and to the help section! [/h1]

[h1]Main Review[/h1]

I played the original almost all the way to the end (couldn't be bother with the final bit of grind) and I can assure this is an excellent and exciting game (though maybe I'm just simple, it's a rather simple story!)

The graphics are nice, however they are not any better than the original. New features include 2D mode, seeing your party in the overworld, Japanese voice lines, fully orchestrated OST and a lot of other quality of life improvements (such as Photo Mode as opposed to the first person mode in the original). 

[b]THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF GRIND, THE ORIGINAL TOOK ME OVER 60 HOURS TO FINISH[/b] Please keep that in mind when going into this.

[b]Is it worth base price or should I wait for sale?[/b] That's a tricky one. I honestly think that this should have been a £7 DLC update for the original so I'm a bit miffed that I had to buy again (still bought tho) so it's up to you. [b]Really comes down to one question: did you play the original?[/b]. If yes: WAIT UNTIL A SALE. From what I understand it's the same story as the original and this only provides quality of life improvements. If no: IT'S UP TO YOU. I usually wait for sales anyway, but if you're looking for something other than an FPS game to play this Christmas, and Cyberpunk 2077 is out of your budget, this is certain worth the price - at a 60 hour 3 part campaign I think you more than enough get your money's worth for £30.

[h1]LINUX TROUBLESHOOTING[/h1]

I've written a more in-depth guide to getting it to work that also includes a compatibility report, check it out here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2308952690

Use Proton-5.21-GE-1 - with this the game booted, initialised a save, played the introductory cut scene and booted into the 3D game engine with no issues on max settings.

THINGS I HAVEN'T TESTED:
[list]
Gamepad
[*]Completing the game (I want to enjoy it so it's gonna take 60 hours)
[*]Changing the language
[*]Changing the music
[*]Getting past the tutorial (I just wanted to make sure I could play this later)
[*]Getting new party members
[*]2D mode
[/list]

Basically I'm at the point of the first battle with the initial 3 slimes. Given my experience with other games and the original version of this game, once you actually get into in-game engine you should be fine (this game is fairly un-intensive so there isn't much to worry about in terms of graphical artefacts)

All in all, this game seems to run just fine under Linux (with Proton) and I look forward to playing this again over Christmas. If you are having issues, please:
[list]
[*]Update your system (including drivers if you are using propitiatory)
[*]Update to Proton-5.21-GE-1
[*]Ensure Steam is up to date
[*]Ensure that the Steam Runtime Library is up to date
[*]Check the integrity of the game's files

It's the most accessible game in the series to date, and it gets a glowing recommendation from me, albeit with some caveats that I'll list below. 

 - - -

[i]Don't[/i] buy DQXI: DE if you:

 - want a hard game, by default
 - want the graphically superior experience

Sadly, in terms of difficulty the game is laughably easy by default if you don't enable any of the draconian ""quests"". Akin to the pact of punishment system from Hades, these can offer you a few ways to increase your enjoyment-- or frustration-- of the game. A quick google search can give you all of the info you'll need on the varying options, plus give you some insights into what a full playthrough might be like with any of them enabled. To echo the general consensus you'll find online: if nothing else, enable stronger monsters.

For a Switch port-- which was ironically a PC / PS4 / Xbox port-- the game runs and looks pretty good. In this scenario, I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I was! There's a pretty sizeable list of .ini tweaks floating around online that you can enable easily, making the game fairly comparable to the original. However, comparable [i]is[/i] the key word here as it definitely falls short of it in the graphics department. Personally, I still prefer the original, but [i]everyone[/i] is going to have a differing opinion here, as the definitive edition trades graphical fidelity for new content, and a treasure trove of qol fixes. As the original did get de-listed from Steam once the definitive edition launched, google is your friend if you think that's the version for you.

 - - -

Again, I want to further reiterate I can't recommend the game highly enough, [i]but[/i]:

 - it did take me a few re-starts to find the draconians that made my playthrough more enjoyable instead of frustrating
 - after playing both versions-- original on PS4, definitive on PC-- I really do prefer the fidelity in the original over the new content and qol fixes

If neither of those things raises some red flags, enjoy! We usually only get one DQ game per generation!",1612288431,1612289468,True,13,0,0.602933704853057861,0,True,False,False

Nasza seksualność - powstrzymywana, niema, obłudna - naznaczona byłaby piętnem imperialnej cnotki. Mówi się że jeszcze początek XVII wieku nie całkiem pozbawiony był szczerości. Praktyk seksualnych nie uprawiono potajemnie, nie liczono się nazbyt ze słowami, rzeczy zaś jawiły się bez zbytnich osłonek; nieprzyzwoitość traktowano z poufałą pobłażliwością. W porównaniu z wiekiem XIX normy określające rubaszność, rozwiązłość, sprośność były całkiem swobodne. Jednoznaczne gesty, śmiałe słowa, jawne akty transgresji, pokazywane i skore do zbliżeń części anatomiczne, dzieciarnia dokazująca wśród śmiechu dorosłych bez skrępowania i zgorszenia “parada cielesności”. 
Światło jakoby miało nagle zmierzchnąć, aż wreszcie nastała monotonna noc wiktoriańskiej burżuazji. Seksualność dostaje się pod klucz. Przeprowadza się do mieszkania. Konfiskuje ją mieszczańska rodzina. I zagarnia dla poważnej czynności reprodukowania. Wokół seksu zapada milczenie. Legalna i wydająca potomstwo para małżonków stanowi prawo. Mianuje się wzorem, wprowadza normę, bierze w posiadanie prawdę, strzeże prawa do zabierania głosu i zastrzega sobie zasadę sekretu. Zarówno w wymiarze społecznym, jak i w każdym domu seksualność uznana, lecz pożyteczna i płodna zajmuje jedno jedyne miejsce: sypialnię rodziców. Resztę trzeba, naturalnie, zatuszować; konwenans obyczajowy unika ciała, powściągliwość słów odbarwia wypowiedzi.""
 - Michel Foucault 

Tak się mają sprawy z PUFF PUFF na przestrzeni serii, między DQVIII a DQXI.
Toriyamowska rubaszność odeszła w zapomnienie.
Zamiast włóczęgi, jest luminarz, milczek-kurwiarz.
Kościół katolicki został bez zmian - radzi sobie przednio.
Odwoływanie się do tradycji czy tzw. konserwatyzm serii to stylistyczne uniki dziennikarstwa growego.
DQ jest wtórne (cechy gry wszyscy znają - frustracją rodem z redita neguję rzekome zalety)
Dla przypomnienia:
LEVEL-5 w 2005, rok po odwaleniu DQ, wydało Rogue Galaxy które przy kolejnej j-wariacji na D&D było projektem eksperymentalnym.
LEVEL-5 na dwa lata przed DQVIII wyprodukowało Dark Chronicle, z mechanikami unikalnymi do dzisiaj - niezależnie o jakiej platformie growej piszemy.
Posuwając się dalej, rok po DQXI wydają Ni no kuni 2 - kompletne przeobrażenie serii, rozgrywka z wariacji na Pokemon stała się action rpgiem z elementami rtsa i budowania miasta, tymczasem Square-Enix nie potrafi zaprojektować systemu ekwipunku.
Od wielu lat status Dragon Quest leży w fanbojstwie - we wchodzeniu w dorosłość z tasiemcem.

Dragon Quest XI S is a game that works with the player. At no point in this game do you feel like you are fighting against the game. You can craft wherever you are, most common materials can be bought from the crafting screen if you do not have them, you are able to add new quirks and challenges to your playthrough to improve your experience or make additional playthroughs different, and you have a good cast of characters to really adhere to your preferred method of combat.

Save points are plentiful in the game, gambling tends to be tilted in favor of the player to make for a less headache-inducing experience, loading your save gives you a recap of where you are in the story, and opening the map not only allows you to quick travel to any place that you've visited, but also tells you what it is you should be doing in case you've been gone for a little bit and have forgotten.

That does not mean that Dragon Quest XI S doesn't have its difficult moments. Even for me as someone who was wildly over-leveled (finished Act 1 at level 45, Act 2 at level 67), there were still some difficult moments in the game, especially later on as I got to some end-game bosses like in the 2D world and against the Secret Boss. The Wheel of Harma, while it is probably the only thing in the game I would quantify as ""anti-fun,"" ends up being a good way to figure out how to be efficient during combat and is really good for those with the min-max mentality.

It feels like a cop-out to say that there's ""something in this game for everyone,"" but there really is. If you want a really good JRPG story, you've got it. You want to spend hours doing nothing but playing poker, slots, or roulette tables? You've got it. Want to play a more modern and well-crafted 2D game for the old nostalgic feel? Easy enough to do. Game not hard enough for you? Just turn on the Draconic Quest that makes enemies more difficult.

Rarely is there a game that allows you to sculpt and tailor it the way that makes it most enjoyable to you, and rarely do I get that sense of post-RPG depression anymore, but both of these things proved to be true with Dragon Quest XI S. At no point did I feel like any of my 143+ hours were spent not enjoying my experience, and there was always something new to look forward to on the horizon.",1611953683,1611953683,True,53,0,0.838414847850799561,0,True,False,False

On one hand I can understand all the care that went into the enemy designs and animations, but there is literally nothing new or interesting here from story or character design.

The first half of the game was ok, and a little lighthearted, but i kept hoping there was some meat to the story. The second half drags waaaay too long. It was a struggle to finish, and I have no desire to go do the post game content. The orchestral music might be some ones cup of tea, but I thought it was grating and bombastic to the point of annoyance.

THE GAME IS NEEDLESSLY LONG: 
Subplots best suited as side-quests are forced into the main narrative. This detracts from the primary objective. The result is a game which drags considerably starting at its midway point. 

THE SIDEQUESTS ARE USELESS:
Sidequests are euphemisms for fetch quests. They don't expand any aspect of the game; narrative included. The aforementioned subplots would have been a perfect substitute. 

THE MUSIC IS . . . MUNDANE:
It is not bad music per say as it features many classical composition techniques and a half decent motif. But there are no stand out pieces and no memorable moments to recall after the game ends. 
 
Having said this, there are positive aspects to the game, which lead me to feel indifferent in the long run. 

GAMBLING
this is more personal than anything but I spent an obscene amount of time in the game's casinos. 

COLLECTION
the game does a good job in scratching the completionist itch. In-game achievements are plenty, and this includes mini-games related to enhancing gears.

[spoiler] THERE'S A FLYING WHALE [/spoiler]

THE FINAL BOSS
the game features a legitimate final boss by the very definition of the term. You have to be ready and put up a fight. Appearance wise it is a very nostalgic final boss. 

If this is your first foray into JRPG then I do recommend the game as it is literally a cookie-cutter JRPG. Granted the team behind this game spent years working on it, and I appreciate how polished the game looks. The scenery is beautiful, the monster designs are wonderful and the animation is quite possibly the best of any JRPG ever. Having said this, to the seasoned JRPG players it is ultimately a story which is so vanilla and mundane that it bogs the experience down.",1611529295,1611529295,False,6,2,0.40640297532081604,0,True,False,False

From the massive, beautifully detailed world of Erdrea to the warm-hearted, courageous and stout companions you meet along your adventure, this game is a unique experience that is bound to stay in your memory long after you complete it, sometimes leaving you longing for those friends you spent so much time with in your fight against the forces of evil or while telling stories by the warmth of a campfire.

The Definitive Edition adds tons of extra content on top of all the content of the original game, such as [spoiler] new chapters in the main story, new outfits, Tickington, worlds of previous DQ games [/spoiler] plus many quality-of-life improvements, not to mention the full orchestra version of the OST that this game deserves.

The combat is turn-based, as with most other Dragon Quest games, and if you're looking for a challenge I highly recommend playing with some Draconian Quest settings. I played with ""Super Strong Monsters"" enabled which was enough to make the game much harder, requiring you to make proper full use of all your available skills and items.

It's also worth mentioning this version adds an [spoiler] emotional chapter late in the game that helps tie some loose ends related to the 8th party member after the Luminary's ""big decision"" [/spoiler]

The story is typically JRPG style good guys against some bad dude. However it is so well rounded and written that you can't complain. There aren't the big plot twists that shook everyone, though some surprises are in store. Even the tiniest side stories when you talk to some NPCs get attention so that the world feels alive and the conclusions are even more satisfying. 
The gameplay is also traditional JRPG meaning it's round based. If you don't like that that's fine however you  can adjust the camera so that  you can walk around while fighting which makes the gameplay more fluent. Even though the game itself is one of the easier games in the franchise, the post game bosses can still kick ass even though you are almost maxed out. And if that is still too easy you can add challenges to your playthrough which the game gives you in the beginning. 
The soundtrack is just amazing. For the Definitive Edition they added the orchestral soundtrack which is far surperior from the other version that came out in 2018. Some people complain that there is no variety since the game uses one theme for most of the cities but in my opinion you do not need this in JRPGs like Dragon Quest that relies on worldbuilding through the story and its characters. 
In conclusion, the game makes everything right: By staying true to the classsic JRPG formula and perfecting it while bringing in some minor new features that make the grinding not as painful as it is in other JRPGs,  you can easily play multiple playthroughs and 100% the game.

for anyone wondering if this is a game worth their time, it most definitely is, invest your time and your money into it, but if you're not a fan of games with a really long story and the same kind of combat through it's entirety, then perhaps it may not be for you, and even if i had a similar feeling, it was still worthy of playing, money well spent.

The Story was for the most part great with a three act structure, but it was slow at times and got slower during the third act. Instead of writing down everything I loved about the game, I think it would be easier to tell the few things that I didn't. 

1. Even with auto play cut scene's turned on, there are some dialogues that are incredibly slow that I couldn't help but skip through after reading ahead
2. Being as though the story has to do with going back in time I think that the idea wasn't used properly. Aside from a few distinct changes a lot of the cut scenes are nearly identical to something you've seen before. This really makes the third act seem like more of a slog considering it's end game content that you've already watched once before.
3. Minor gripe, but I'm not a fan of the alchemy system in this game compared to others. It seems limited overall and wasn't as fun to me.
4.If there was one thing that I could have removed from the game, IT'S THE GOD DAMNED MERMAIDS. They have a surprisingly big role in the story, and the part they play is important. But nearly all their dialogue is long, slow, and EVERYTHING THEY SAY RHYMES. That might not sound so bad, but it starts to get increasingly annoying the more you have to listen to the slow dialogue spoken in the same rhythmical pattern. I know I could have just skipped it, and I kind of did. I made sure to read what was going on, but they just kept TALKING AND TALKING!

Other than those few things I'd give the game a 9/10",1610235574,1610235574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They have a demo you can try out on Steam with roughly 13 hours worth of gameplay and will connect saves with the full version as well. Great demo! Great story. Beautiful world. Wonderful gear and tons of monsters to fight. Maybe based on my pace of the game, every boss had me on the edge of my seat as i'd be pretty close to defeat, but usually won in the end. Some deaths/mistakes were made on my end, but loved mostly all of this game has to offer. With over 200 hours worth of content is more than gracious for the price offered. As i type this i've beaten the game with my current 296 hrs, I have 3 achievements left to unlock plus at least 2 more challenges in game.

A Charming, fun and relaxing experience, with polished combat that does not feel like chore, and pretty graphics, even if i would prefer a slightly more saturated look colourwise. My first game in the DQ franchise, and I always liked JRPG's, even if its not the genre that i play the most. I have no complaints for now except for the music being a bit too repetitive, its well arranged and orchestrated but it would be better with a bit more ambient approach at certain parts of the game/cut-scenes etc with triple the content. I might give this review an edit, near the end game phase. I anyways recommend it, 8.5/10. Good vibe and i am sure i will likely delve into more DQ games after this one.

[edit] 50+ hours in, I adore the Characters, World, humor and story. My conclusion is that this game is a masterpiece, one of the greatest RPG's ever made, it might not be revolutionary game as it builds on a well tested formula, but its hard to find any game in its genre that does more things right. 9/10. And to think i just bought and played this game while waiting for Cyberpunk 2077, now I am glad i still have to complete the game, as i am really enjoying it in its own right.

62 hours in [And now the DLC begins] this game is loooong!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me start by saying i own the original version here on steam and the S version on switch.
I have 100% completed the game here on steam with 232 hours on record.
Also let me start by saying, i LOVE dragon quest.

Now with that in mind.
Dragon Quest XI S - Definitive edition is a masterpiece. It adds tons of small and big changes to the original.
Its a fantastic world to explore and it has phenominal characters.
the combat is fun and is your typical TBS combat system.
The implemented 2D system is just a blast from the past.
And as always the soundtrack is a nostalgia trip.

Dragon Quest is one of the most hearth warming Jrpgs out there.
And XI was already one of the best in my opinion.
Now with the S Difinitive edition it even gets better.

this is a MUST play for Jrpg fans and a MUST have for DQ fans.
Sure, square enix could have done a discount for the original owners, but sadly thats a other matter.

The game itself is a masterpiece. And i can not recommend this franchise enough.
Get it and enjoy Dragon Quest XI S.

New or returning players, a beautifull game, with tons and tons of content.

I played the original game for upwards of 90 some hours and enjoyed every minute of it. When I saw this was finally on the steam store I was ecstatic and so happy. I bought it right when I could and honestly I couldn't be more happy with the final product. The definitive edition should be the way everyone enjoys this game. While the graphics were lessened to an extent the game, in my opinion, looks gorgeous still. As a fan of JRPG's this is definitely in my top 5 for sure. The implementation of the symphonic score was amazing as well as that was a downfall of the original being entirely digitally based tracks. The story isn't anything fans of JRPG's haven't heard before but yet adds slight variations on the basic tropes that it offers. One moment in particular is very gut wrenching but really great addition to the story as a whole and brings in interesting dynamics. Now one thing I would say is that there gets to a certain point where you might feel like you hit a road block and can't progress tbh there is only two points in the game like this and the second is part of the end game which is completely optional but I recommend trying it. If you can get through those two parts the game gets even more fun than it was before. The side plots are super fun and enjoyable and a nice break from the main story while not being too long and drawn out. Overall I say pick this game up you will not regret it.

The first 70 hours or so were a chore, every battle was a breeze even without any grinding of levels or focusing on gear beyond crafting whatever recipes I picked up. The game does pick up a bit in the final section (you will know when this happens). However, there were still only a couple of fights that needed preparation. I played DQ8 and at least that one had some humor and challenges. The story itself is OK at best, about what you can expect from a DQ game I suppose. 

Some major cons:
-You are forced to explore the same areas 3-4 times
-Your choices don't matter, even when the game gives you a choice. There are many scenes with a ""yes/no"" option, and if you choose ""no"" the last dialogue just repeats and you have to select ""yes"".
-Battles are a chore for the first 70 hours of gameplay, easy but annoying (even with the fastest combat speed)
-Characters are incredibly bland and annoying.  There are only 3 characters that are bearable: the mute hero, Rab, and Eight (you'll know when you get that one).
-Quests are typically extremely boring and easy
-You have to retrace your steps a thousand times because quest items don't appear until you accept the quest (meaning that even if you explored thoroughly the first time, it simply wasn't possible to get certain items)
-Pep powers (overdrive, ultimate powers, whatever you want to call them) are mostly useless and extremely niche. Other attacks will almost always deal more damage. You also get a ridiculous number of them.
-Incredibly tedious companion story quests that CAN'T be skipped. Sylvando's is particularly unbearable. 
-A lot of unnecessary walking back and forth, when the game could have asked you if you wanted to return to the appropriate NPC or similar. 
-Hero abilities that can only be used if you follow a particular skill path (single-handed swords)

Pros:
-There are many quality of life improvements to speed up this grind of a game (transportation, easy access to different resources)
-Crafting ingredients are relatively easy to find, even for the rarest recipes
-The graphics are quite nice
-Seeing enemy encounters while out in the field is great, reduces the RNG.

The world is beautiful, expansive, and lots of hidden little secrets sprinkled about.

The characters are well designed, fully voice acted, and easy to relate too and develop affinity for.

The story and lore, albeit standard, is well fleshed out, convoluted, yet easy to grasp and understand. The game even provides a summary of what you've done beforehand each time you load it up to play.

The monster design is kinda cutesy, which may turn off some experienced players, but they're so well designed and animated that they become easy to accept and enjoy battling. A lot of them have rare drops, like higher level gear or permanent ability improving items, that actually make battling them worthwhile in more ways than simply experience gaining.

I highly recommend playing with a controller. Keyboard and mouse, while playable, is not well thought out and very clunky, which could detract from the smoothness of play that comes with using a controller.

The crafting element of the game is well implemented. You can actually get better gear from crafting than from drops or bought off the vendors. You can also upgrade said drops and vendor bought gear into much more useable and powerful versions.

Lots of hidden items scattered throughout the towns, buildings, and overworld to actually reward exploration.

It's a massive game expanding from 80 to over 100 hours, in which the end game is pretty much a whole game in itself, so you will get excellent bang for the buck in its purchase price.

It's a high quality game with excellent design and gameplay in a beautiful, living world, with fun, enjoyable characters. I highly, highly recommend it wholeheartedly for fantasy RPG/JRPG/Exploration/Crafting gamers.",1608801906,1608801906,True,11,2,0.651865720748901367,0,True,False,False

The world is incredibly detailed, rich, and full of great characters. It has turn-based combat, but the animations and style are very vibrant. This is the golden standard for RPGs and is a modern classic.

One minor downside is that this is considered the easiest Dragon Quest game so far. Having played through it on Switch, I would agree. Fortunately, you can turn on a setting for stronger enemies and if you get this, I would highly recommend doing so. It can come with some very light grinding of a level or two occasionally for boss fights but overall makes the combat much more satisfying, as you are required to plan party buffs/debuffs/heals/composition more than you must do without the stronger enemies enabled.

But this game captivated me after the demo. I can't really explain why, just the general sense of adventure. For those who have played the demo, if you have a tiny speck of curiosity and found the few hours of gameplay from it entertaining enough, get this game. It does play some elements very safe, though all dragon quest games do this. Turn-based combat, a story that starts very cliché (You're the hero, go save the world and stuff) and characters that don't have too much depth compared to other story-driven games or other RPGs. It does eventually pick up and I can safely say that I'm addicted.

It's a game that doesn't diverge from the norm but practically has no flaws because of it, and the few that it has are mostly nitpicks I have with JRPGs as a whole, so you might even find this game perfect.

You can summon your horse on the fly after a certain point early in the game. Pretty helpful for when you just want to run everything over(you get exp for btw) and get to your destination quickly.

Plenty of people are very vocal about this in the discussions section, being insistent that ""different"" means ""worse."" I don't agree. I also don't think it looks any better, it's just a different final effect.

The character models are currently lower-poly than the originals, since this is a Switch port rather than an engine update. Whether you even notice this without a deliberate side-by-side comparison is a bit up in the air, personally it took me setting up two identical screenshots and comparing one atop the other to spot the slightly more angular elbow on the hero.

There are improvements as well. The audio track includes orchestral music now, something I quite enjoy. There's various small QOL updates they gave to the Switch version that have been brought over. I quite enjoy the chapter after the big midgame event that shows what got your scattered party to the points they're at when you find them again.

The graphics are, in some small ways, different and arguably worse than the original. If that's what will make or break this experience for you, then obviously avoid the game.

Now, all this was from the demo, ten hours and twelve minutes worth of playing, can you continue playing from your save in the full version? YES! And you even get a really handy reward for finishing the demo itself. And it all carries over when you start the full version. 

When it comes to the graphics and loading there's a couple of things to say. First of all it looks gorgeous, everything is very tight, no screen tearing and the stability is just perfect. Now, I'm playing on a 55"" TV with an older PC (gtx970) upgraded with a couple of ssd's, and the loading times are just stupid fast, I haven't had a loading screen lasting more than 3 seconds, and you don't get loading screens very often either. Still the game runs on max settings on older hardware which is nice! My PC is like 8 years old and still no problems running this, and it looks and feels like playing on PS5.

Playing with controller works like a charm, but would be nice with an option to choose what controller you're playing with to get the right button layout. Right now the game seems to be locked in with the Xbox layout. Not that it matters too much, but since I'm playing with a PS4 controller it has happened that I push ""X"" instead of ""square"" when the game tells you to push ""X""! 

I haven't really followed the Dragon Quest franchise over the years, it has been very sporadically, but I did play a couple of them, but I kinda fell off the wagon because it got a bit childish(?) I guess. But this game has a bit more grownup feel to the graphics and story, don't worry though, you will get your dose of the typical cheesiness of course, but not too much, it's all very well balanced. 

And the music is really good too, I'm not into symphonies and orchestra, but this is actually not bad. You can almost feel the skill level of the people that played the instruments.

I'm not gonna put a grade, or number on this game because it's just a really really good game. It's perfect for the upcoming holidays, and also considering the situation on this planet right now. Here you have a game with an exciting story, beautiful graphics and it will just suck you in. I haven't played RPG's like this in a while, I've been more into other genres, but this game really brought me back, and I'm enjoying it to the fullest.

Firstly, let me start by saying that I have only ever played one other Dragon Quest game in my life, that being III on the Game Boy Color so long ago. Back then, as a child, I didn't really appreciate the nuances of JRPGs, and so just saw it as a dumb time-waster, leading to many, many trips to the church with coffins following close behind me. 

However, after playing the demo for DQ XI, I can safely say that I have a newfound appreciation for this series in general. The characters are great, the music is great, the voice acting is top-notch, and even grinding on the multitude of enemies on the outskirts of towns and in the wild feels more fun than it does in most games, ESPECIALLY given that my party AI is intelligent enough for me to let them fight on their own.
