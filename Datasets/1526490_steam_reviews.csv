I've been playing nearly 2 hours and I could count the amount of games I've played with my fingers. Global server has a dead population and people are not going to be able to experience the gameplay because of this, and this is what drives most casual players like me out from the game.

Gameplay-wise, it is just Among Us with a different theme and I guess some additional gimmicks to add to the gameplay, though debatable if you would enjoy it. 

One of the main differences between this and Among Us is the turn-based action that revolves around speaking / providing justifications. Unlike Among Us, you take turns to convince others why you aren't the killer or provide statements that may affect the killer. Though the differences are simplistic in nature, there are reasons why this is bad:
- Early speaker can't defend any claims made to them by later speakers.
- Later speakers tend to have the last laugh since they have the most capability to provide claims and defend themselves from claims by other speakers.

In a game with deception as its main selling point, you're gonna need a nice way of exchanging information so both sides could enjoy the deceptive exchange. The deception among the players are what makes Among Us enjoyable in the first place. 

The game makes the players become an active errand boy to continue surviving and I have no quarrel with this.

As far as theme goes, I'm kinda neutral at this point since technically there's no Horror-style Among Us available at the moment. As far as the ""Horror"" goes, it's not that impressive as well. Jumpscares/Kill animations are kinda mediocre at best and I'm an avid horror fan.

TL;DR
- Horror-themed Among Us.
- Game has 2 servers, CN is populated but global is dead.
- Take turns to speak / provide claims during a meeting.
- Don't do tasks = You die
- You can't say ""That's kinda sus"" if you're an early speaker when a later speaker provides their claim.
- Mediocre jumpscares / kill animation.",1635019281,1635019281,False,1,0,0.473150968551635742,0,True,False,False
