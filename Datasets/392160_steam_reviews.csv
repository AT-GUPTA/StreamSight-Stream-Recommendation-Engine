Couple things I love:
The freedom of the game to do whatever
Combat is simple and accesible
Building your own ships and being capable (after a while) of building your own shipyard
The pilots occasionally forgetting there is a mortal on board and ramming themselves through entire stations

Couple things I dislike:
Ingame tutorial is a bit shite so you need external resources to understand some of the mechanics
The ships feel like they weight nothing (just a personal gripe)
Having to restart every once in a while due to deteriorating performance

The game is really initimidating but it also goes a long way into taking the work of managing an empire out for you. I'd have been a lot less stressed about throwing my head at a wall if I'd known that what takes several hours of work in Star Citizen can easily be accomplised in minutes in X4.

I finally broke through into the game proper the other day - and damn. It's amazing what they have accomplished. It's criminal that Star Citizen churns through so much publicity and money, stealing oxygen from titles such as this. Whilst it's certainly not as pretty, it's completely functional! Star Citizen can't even get doors to work. The abuse of that game does a lot to set your expectations of needless BS in games.

Well it doesn't focus on the space part that much like Elite Dangerous, but the exploration is good and rewarding, lots to find and do. And best of all, everything you do matters and affect the economy in real time, unlike most games.. (looking at you Elite dangerous). But like most people that actually played this game said, it's not for everyone. It's a very complex game, some people like that, some people don't. It requires you to think your next move since it's a strategy game. Most things in this game take time, but they're worth it, i started as the Terran cadet storyline, and my goal now is to get the Asgard,, the most powerful ship in the game, but that will take a huge amount of time, so i wont rush it, rushing a game is never good. The flight model is nice, fighting feels good. There are large fleet battles that can happen anywhere without you knowing, unless you deploy satelites and see what's happening in the map in real time, it's a fascinating and unique game, a true sandbox. Beware of the xenon, they can become really aggressive and invade sectors, so you must keep an eye out. 


I didn't even scratch the surface of this game's content, but i know for sure this is a game i will spend large amounts of time, just like Elite Dangerous, a deeply flawed but good game. But ofc X4 is not perfect it has its flaws, the difference here is that the developers are actually passionate and care about their game, and it's a small studio.

The good:
But really, X4 remains a bit of a hidden gem. There's a lot of people out there looking for *exactly this*, but they still don't know it even exists. & I recall the same situation with X3. X4 doesn't have the AAA budget but it's not a half-assed scam like some of the other AAA games we know either. 

The could-be-better:
I would like to see more Xenon and challenges in the game, and the UI and space battle mechanics could benefit tremendously from a AAA budget. Look to something like World of Warships or Everspace 2 for the kinds of mechanics this game needs, particularly with capital ships and stations. X3 had a lot of things that I wish they would bring back for X4. X4 has suffered a bit from the same sort of ""dumbing down"" and cut content that Skyrim did after Oblivion, or Oblivion did after Morrowind before that. But perhaps my biggest critique out of everything is the F-P-S. Sometimes also known as SPF. People just play this game like 10-15 fps during major battles with all the latest technology is normal and shrug at it. Yes, it does require good hardware (or can, at least). But it also needs some major optimizations because FPS drops like that when said hardware isn't even being close to 100% utilized means there's something off. And sure, the AI could always use improvement, but at this point I've just learned to accept that X4 AI, is X4 AI...

But all in all, it's a solid game and the best part is the devs aren't done with it. It's received way more love post-release than 90% of games out there, and there's really nothing else that even comes close to doing what X4 does, which is why I keep coming back to it.",1675305221,1708347454,True,1,0,0.44842258095741272,0,True,False,False

The scope of the sandbox, the faction encounters, the background wars that will wage whether you want to take part in them or not, and the constant struggle against the perma-hostile factions that can topple sectors if left unchecked.

There's one thing about this game that would make me quit if it wasn't for the rest being so enjoyable. That's the ship AI. It is atrocious on so many levels.

[list]
[*]A ship will suicide itself for no reason.
[*]If you order ships to move somewhere they'll move anywhere but the location you specify.
[*]Ships will collide into enemy stations, get stuck, then die if you order them just to approach within safe distance.
[*]Ships constantly wiggle around and spin... which isn't so much a problem with small fighters, but capital ships are sloooooow and every second counts with their movements so as they spend time spinning in literal circles, they are effectively doing nothing especially if facing the wrong direction for their primary weapons.
[*]Ships love to collide into each other and get stuck. So often does a hostile ship dart into combat and faceplant into a capital ship to literally get stuck inside it. When capitals get stuck on each other (very common occurrence) the game can teleport them around to separate them as a fallback measure. Fighters don't seem to get that treatment. Better hope the one that gets stuck in your capital doesn't start attacking it from inside freely while you're unable to take it out or dislodge it.
[*]Fleeing ships will often run into enemies (example: reinforcements or the remainder of the enemy fleet) (such as a freighter that is attacked by fast fighters. if it starts fleeing or you tell it to flee it thinks a good course is straight into enemy capital ships)
[*]Second note on the ship collision, other faction capital ships (especially freighters) love to dive full speed into warp gates and if you're in the way (even if you're in L or XL ships) they will barrel straight into you.
[*]Third note on ship collision, non-player ships have the mass of neutron stars when they run into you. A small 10t fighter can cause a 1000t XL capital to be flung around, spin around, or dragged. I had an S xenon ship face plant into one of my L destroyers and i could not escape from it as it dragged me about 20km away from my position before it finally freed itself. And when you're in that state of the game trying to adjust course because of collisions, you lose all control of whatever you're in. Whether it be your space suit, a small fighter, or an XL capital ship. Everything and anything not only has seemingly more mass than you, but overrides any of your movements.

It has a lot of ""potential"" but unless the ai is fixed (which it wont be because apparently that shits hard coded and would take an entire rewrite to fix) you shouldn't waste your time unless you really like idle games and Factorio. I may have 1312 hours at time of writing but only about 600 of them have had me at the keyboard and only like 100 of those hours have had me doing anything with it (I'm typing this while ""playing""). The game also lied to me about the Yaki and after the hundreds of hours (and billions of credits) I put in saving their bitch asses I feel insulted that they just sit on their hands once their free, when the game itself tells me Ill unlock a new trading partner and implies that you can help them rebuild. This type of over promise under deliver is typical of the mission rewards. Another example is with the condensate, if you betray the twins in order to give the condensate to the masses, you don't actually give anyone anything and have to do all the work yourself, no ai will ever seek the condensate on their own and all you get is the ability to store it on a station. With clever usage this can give you nearly unlimited money but.... its not worth it and isnt what the mission implies the reward is. Its implied that you will unshackle the stations in Avarice from the twins tyranny, but instead all it does is shackle the stations to your own brand of tyranny...

My gripes with the ai are.... numerous, but I'll try my best to be succinct (No I wont).

Boarding: The ai will kill your boarding target.
YOUR ai will also kill your boarding target unless you hold their hand and manually tell them to stop.
The boarding operations are broken, if you use elite soldiers it slows the boarding operation to take over 10* longer than it should because of a bug.
If you make a mistake and remove a ship from the boarding operation that you didn't mean to, when you add it back to the op you wont be able to tell its marines to board or control what the ship does, so it will default to ""destroy engines"" which destroys the entire ship, not just the engines, so a three for one issue.
Because the ai is trash, your gonna be doing all the heavy lifting, you alone with a scout ship and 1 pulse gun are more effective than 10 heavy fighters with 4 pulse guns each, simply because when you want an engine destroyed, you shoot it, and when the ai wants an engine destroyed, it shoots everything but the engines. Heres a pro boarding tip for lazy captains like me, get yerself 16 or so heavy fighters and outfit them with the paranid burst rays so that when they miss, they don't completely destroy the target and when they hit, it does extra dmg to subsystems.

Mining: Large miners don't work when your watching. They technically do, but it would take literal days for an L ship to fill its hold with you watching. So if you had any plans to watch an L miner at work, sorry but no, they have performance anxiety.
Miners assigned to stations that require more than one type of mineral will slowly fill the cargo holds of their ships with whatever mineral the station uses the least of, typically ice, meaning eventually your supply line will be choked. Admittedly this is only really a problem in the long run, but considering that I'm still an X4 ""noob"" with as many hours as I have, your gonna run into this problem too if you decide to play. This can be avoided by using mining stations that mine one specific mineral and one gas (for efficiency sake) but its a pain in the ass to build 3 whole mining stations, crew and fleet them when it'd be so much simpler if the station managers were able to do anything at all about this on their own, such as dumping or selling excess cargo or restricting each miner to one type at a time.

Combat: So there is out of system combat (oos), where the game simulates combat, and in system combat. When out of system the game pretends every shot is a hit. This means that some load outs are worse and better than others depending on if your watching or not. Rail guns (very high dmg, long cool down, long range) tend to be trash in system because when they fire, they often miss, but oos their... fine. Frankly this isn't really that big of a deal, but its important to know how this works for my biggest problem with combat.
Carriers. Carriers are my favorite thing, ships that carry other smaller ships, swarm combat, a mobile base of operations, I like carriers. HOWEVER I cant even use them, I cant even WATCH them, because when I do, they spin out of control because the fighters get stuck in the launch tubes, or stuck in the walls and with them stuck together they drift out of control, often sweeping up more fighters which proceed to get stuck themselves. This isnt a problem oos. This happens EVERY SINGLE TIME you launch fighters and happens about 50% of the time when they come in to land. Even the ""fixed"" new carriers (Guppy and Shark) have to deal with this. The devs hyped up carrier fixes for the last major patch but it still happens EVERY launch. You don't have to use carriers, and in fact they are significantly slower than fighters so its technically better to not even use carriers because they slow your response time, so whats even the point? Free repairs? k... 
Boosting. You can boost for a large boost in speed, however this drains the shields to compensate, a decent design on its face forcing you to choose between defense and offence. The problem is with the fuckin ai because of course it is. The ai will boost all of its shields down when running, trying to move from point a to point b and just because it feels like it I guess. I don't understand what makes the ai choose when to boost. Sometimes L ships will get within 20km of a gate and decide to boost the rest of the way despite not having enough shields to boost the full distance, so will just sit there making the annoying boost out of energy noise over and over again for upwards of 10 minutes, when it could have just left travel drive active or just start the travel drive again. I've watched and lost countless ships try to boost away from xenon, which does more harm than good since the xenon will just catch them anyway given how fast they accelerate and their top speeds being significantly faster than any pilot-able ship in the game.

The devs focus on adding new content instead of fixing issues that have been around since launch concerns me. I know they have to because its a small company and if they didn't release dlc they wouldn't be able to afford to stay open but then why promise carrier fixes and then release two more broken carriers? Why say the last update would improve the ai when there were no changes? Their telling us that the next update will add end game stuff, but who else but turbo nerds like me are even going to get to the new stuff? and when we do is it going to be another Yaki or condensate situation? Whats with the focus on ventures, hiding the good rewards behind them, but then locking out those of us who use mods to fix the game and make it playable in the first place? Its a single player game, why do you care if I use mods? Guess ill use a mod to get those items and skins... I don't even know what a venture actually is because I found out really early on that id actually enjoy the game if I used basic mods like ""Stop attacking my boarding target"" and ""Sector explorer"" the latter of which solves a series of problems I didn't even get into because its not strictly an ai problem but a design one. Things I left out that suck include but are not limited to: Pilot levels I like the idea, but taking over 48 real world hours to get 1 level that doesn't actually improve the pilots ""skill"" is ridiculous, performance issues, models and animations of the people (not the ships, the ships are all dope), writing, vo inconsistency and a myriad of bugs.",1707965992,1707968394,False,114,12,0.866943061351776123,6,True,False,False

If you're ready to lose yourself in a universe of infinite possibilities, then look no further than X4 Foundations – where the stars are yours to command.

Lots of quests and themes to follow, but often little lost if you chose not to pursue them (with a couple of key 'early game' exceptions). The devs seem committed to the project and there's just so much to love about this game. There are many positive reviews, I don't have much to add except up vote the game. 

Two key points on the negative side:

1 -- You will, not might, [i]WILL[/i] have to search and ask the Internet many many questions to learn the finer intricacies of the game. I just cannot see how you can get into this game without many visits to YouTube tutorials, Steam guides etc. I found myself pausing and searching the Internet for answers every other minute early on.  There are in game tutorials and an Encyclopedia, they're not too bad to get you going. Recommend them. But the depth of the game just leaves the tutorials inadequate.  This is so not always because of depth and complexity, there are quite a few points where  the game is just quirky or more ambiguous than it has to be. 

Overall, as others have said, this game has a STEEEP learning curve, but so rewarding if you can hang in there.

2 -- The game is a resource hog. As an old programmer, I am dismayed at the inefficiency that many contemporary games have with resources available. It is a beautiful game that runs a big universe in 'real time', but it under-utilises multi-thread/CPU technology and clearly occupies the GFX card in ways not needed. Can't be bothered going into technical details, but to play this game in all it's glory needs a pretty chunky PC. Not GFX card so much as CPU resources. More so than is needed if the devs knew what they were doing.

Those negatives aside, love it and can't get enough of it. Has taken over my free time entirely.

Overall yes, i'd recommend this game. However there are many quality of life improvements the devs could make, as well as fixing some things about the game. 
First of all, pilot level takes waaaaay too long and is a having skilled pilots matters ALOT. Just getting my pilots of level 3, without using combat, takes ages. I have about 20 medium trade ships, which have been running trades for a long time and they're at most 2 star. This takes way too long. It's really frustrating when they're killed by some dickhead pirate for no reason, even when they're all setup to comply with pirate demands. 
Another thing that pisses me off, is when i call in my anti-pirate fleets in to save my traders. My ships start boosting in quickly to intercepts, but then slow to a crawl like 2-5 KM from target, taking forever to intercept. About 50% of the time this results in my trader dying anyway... very frustrating to lose that trader pilot i've invested 80+ hours to skill up to level 2.
Ships that use drones, heavily rely on pilot skill too. I bought a large miner, and it only uses 1 drone at a time to recover minerals. I could just move a pilot into the ship, but it's time consuming to do; the process should be streamlined for improved quality of life.
When you level a trader to pilot skill 3, they gain the ability to autotrade on their own. This is really nice, but it takes a lifetime to skill up to that. I've been relying on ""repeat orders"" command, which is ok. The problem with repeat orders, is that you have to configure each trader individually to do this. If i could configure multiple ships at once with this order, it would be so bad, but i can't. I have to configure 1 at a time. It's a taxing effort to do, when you're running an empire. It would be so much more enjoyable if i could configure a few ships for 1 resource, then move on to another.
Another problem i have is that when my traders are set to a repeat order, getting them to move to safety is difficult and time consuming. For example, if a trader is running into a bad location, I have to give a move order, then go into ""information"", then ""behaviors"", then move my ""move"" over up the command chain by clicking the arrow ""up"" until it becomes the first command line, which it will then execute. This could be improved by allowing me to force a command with a hotkey... for example ""Shift+click"", which would prioritize the command to number 1.
Another frustrating thing about this game is that there's no way to re-equip multiple ships at once. You have to modify each individually. For example, if i want to change the guns on 20 of my fighters, i have to land them at a warf and modify each one by one. Very time consuming.
With all these gripes, the game is really good! It's very difficult to learn, but very fun. It's a very deep game too, so be prepared to reference youtube videos to learn the game. It's alot like Eve Online, but i think it's better.
I haven't played the game with mods, but there might be some out there that fix alot of these issues, i'm not sure.",1705637348,1707357318,True,0,0,0.507586419582366943,1,True,False,False

This isn't going to be a long winded description of the game, all I'm going to say is that if this is your first intro to the X-Series than I promise you will not be disappointed at all. This game has so much depth and story behind it that it is beyond what most games put out today have, and Egosoft has never once let us down with one of their games. If its not working right they are going to fix it, if they aren't done with it you better believe they are going to develop it into the game it should be, and they really listen to their community more than most developers that I have seen.

What you are getting with X4 is a game that in my opinion has been in development since they first started with X: Beyond the Frontier and has had its story, play style, and fine tuning in constant evolution through every X-Series title until Egosoft finally landed on this masterpiece that they are still to this day tweaking, fixing and expanding with every update and DLC. You are getting the pinnacle of what a passion project is, every aspect of this game was crafted with love and care for both the continued legacy of the game, the studio and the community.

All I will say is that if you think this bad boy has a learning curve WHOOO go try out the earlier titles this is the easiest one to grasp to this date and Egosoft did not compromise on the features in any way which is one of the most impressive things I have ever seen.

The tutorial walks the player through learning the default mouse-keyboard space flight control scheme.  I found this scheme laborious and counter intuitive.  Thinking possibly I just needed to shift modes, I switched to joystick-keyboard.

X4's default joystick control scheme is... not what someone who is generally used to joystick flight controls would normally expect.  To put it mildly.  Which is fine, it is customizable.  The control customization menu presents two choices for every option available across a plethora of client modes and little documentation or guide for a new player.  Nor an easy way to test changes while one is making them.

I could see this game being a lot of fun once I'm past the knowledge wall, though it does look pretty crunchy for a single player game.

Hopefully the tutorial can be reworked to help a new player get past that knowledge wall more easily.  Also, either a better control scheme or a better introduction to the current control scheme and customization would go a long way to getting new players into the game.

1. It does have a learning curve, but that is mostly due to the vastness of the game.  Picking up the game and learning the basics is actually pretty quick.  (eg flying, shooting, docking, etc)  The learning curve comes into play with the mid-late game and the fact that there really isn't a tutorial.  There are a few optional tutorials, but the one about piloting didn't really give me an indication that I was done and ready to move onto the next tutorial.
2. The modding of the game is pretty extensive.  I found a Firefly class ship online using google.  There are various mods that help with empire building, etc.
3.  The game is not Star Citizen, Starfield, or Elite Dangerous.  Although I'd say it has elements of all 3 games.  Its visually appealing, although it is not as beautiful as say Starfield nor as detailed when it comes to the ship interior, but you *can* walk around inside your cockpit and other star bases, even if they are somewhat limited from what I've seen thus far.  I have yet to be able to just run around inside my cargo hold on any ship I've come across (just seems to be the cockpit).  Maybe in a future iteration of the game?  Or a new DLC?

A collection of questionable decisions regarding non-standard control scheme, UI design, and a poor AI piloting implementation sours an otherwise fun experience.

Pain points include:
* A nearly non-existent tutorial
* Fleets that can't maintain formation
* Ship AI which leaves the ship they're supposed to be escorting behind
* Auto-piloting which flies you into mines
* Destroyers which run directly into stations to die instead of attacking it at a distance
* AI which burns shields to boost unnecessarily, leading to a quick death
* Ships which I've ordered to flee from an attack sit there
* ...and so on

This game is also not for the meek. Be prepared to have a browser open at all times to figure out how to do basic things like automated mining or commanding a ship follow you. The learning curve is steep.

To be clear, I love the concept of this game. It has some really fun ideas and offers many of the things I love about space sims. It just lacks a gallon of polish. More often than not, I felt like I was fighting the game more than I was playing it. And for me, that's an absolute shame. Every time I would lose myself in this world, I'm yanked out by some frustration with the game design.

As an ardent fan of both strategic and space games, I was intrigued by the promise of merging these two elements in one game - and I must admit, ""X4: Foundations"" fulfills these expectations and more.

The game offers deep, strategic planning, which is crucial for success in space. Decisions involving resource management, spaceship construction, and mission planning require thought and foresight, adding an incredible depth to the game. It's this combination that makes every decision matter, and every move important.

Moreover, the aspect of space flight simulation is executed with astonishing attention to detail. Controlling a spaceship is intuitive, yet simultaneously provides enough challenge to satisfy even the most demanding players. The graphics and sound only add to the feeling of being a real space pilot, fully immersing the player in this extraordinary journey. The graphics in ""X4: Foundations"" are quite impressive, with stunning visualizations of space and intricately designed spaceships, further enriching the experience.

What is most impressive about ""X4: Foundations"" is how brilliantly it combines these two aspects - strategy and simulation. Every strategic choice impacts the course of flight, and successes and failures in space have their consequences in the long-term game strategy.

In terms of value, ""X4: Foundations"" is worth every penny spent. The complexity and depth of the game provide hours of engaging fun, and the potential for repeated play is enormous. This is a game I can recommend to anyone looking for more than just a typical simulator - it's a complete experience that will satisfy both fans of strategy and lovers of space.

In conclusion, ""X4: Foundations"" is an exceptional work that deserves recognition. Its ability to combine strategic thinking with realistic space flight simulation makes it not just one of the best games in its genre, but also one of the most memorable games I've had the opportunity to play. I heartily recommend ""X4: Foundations"" to anyone looking for a deep, engaging, and satisfying virtual experience.",1706025831,1706025831,True,10,0,0.60949254035949707,0,True,False,False

I cannot recommend this game more to anyone that love space. It's a learning curve, not as bad as EvE online (close), but you will need to invest quite a few hours just to understand basic mechanics. After you do (took me maybe 50hrs, and even then I quit and came back), man it's great on the other side. It's extremely deep and satisfying. All I can do is recommend all the DLC, and suggest new players to do all the tutorials, and do your best to learn the basics, THEN a guided start with Terran or Boron, but if you want to just into the criminal life, start the guided with tides of avarice. If you don't want DLC, every major update provided massive free content across the whole game, so that's ok, but the universe is amazing, and the DLC is very worth it, much more then other games, yet not having it does exclude any core mechanics or game-play as other titles do as well. X4 is just the best, and my favourite space game (and I've played thousands of hours into multiple titles). Love it, and gotta love the small dedicated dev team, what a bunch of awesome people, and community to help others that are struggling.

Old reviews 

I have changed my review to positive, after update 2.5. Also to note: 2.6, and 3.0 rolling out soon will make things even better. The game has got A LOT of improvements. Many bugs ive faced no longer exist. X4 is still not perfect but there is steady improvements, and when 2.6, and 3.0 comes out I would reccomend to buy then due to further economy fixes. If you want a larger trade challenge buy now in 2.5, the AI cannot keep up the economy and its your job to help it out, ive been relatively successful after 100hrs, and now Xenon are nuking the Sh**t out of everything, here comes a real war. All in all there's lots to do, its great after you get a few mining ships going, and traders. I would reccomend completing all the tutorials, learning how the economy works, asking questions, using reddit, and how in depth stations can become with all the different things they need to work. Also don't rush to L/XL ships, the S/M ships are currently better especially in large wings to defend the 3 major choke points. I will keep my previous review below; however it is extremely better now, and will continue becoming better.

I can't even finish the tutorials after much time going through the forums. There's a  known bug list the length of something that should not be on the steam marketplace.

Likes:  I can pilot all of the ships again, from small scouts to large destroyers.  This was a reversal from X Rebirth that limited you to only flying in a single ship.  Players complained and Egosoft listened.  

The economy is now starts from mined ores and collected gasses, crafted into hull, turret and electronics parts, and assembling everything into ships.  Very few ships are spawned except some mission specific ships.

Station building is greatly improved over X3.  Everything is modular and clean.  

Ships have modular weapons, shields, and engines.  You have to destroy them before sending in marines to board the ship and take it over.

You can get up and walk around your ship, walk on the dock and in certain buildings.  Walking is limited but does add to immersion and helps to show the scale of the ships as you can stand or walk on the dock and see just how big the ships are in comparison to your character.

Each DLC adds races, ships, missions, and mechanics.  Get them all as a bundle.

The modding community is as strong as it was for X3.  There are mods to improve script functions like fleet control and combat, add QOL stuff like making asteroids stop spinning, remove small asteroids (both to improve FPS), and add new ships from X Rebirt, X2/X3 and even a Star Wars full conversion.

Dislikes:  The new Mortar Blaster and Blast Ray guns make capping capital ships way too easy.  Before you have to put a lot of firepower into taking out the cap ships main XL shields.  Now?  You can shoot though the shield with these guns and destroy the shield generators!  Everything goes poof.  So easy to make millions capping and selling capital ships.

I'll try to keep this review concise and condense my thoughts down as much as possible.

[h1]Story & Worldbuilding[/h1]
I'd like to preface this section by claiming that I'm by no means an X-series historian, but the game does have quite a bit of lore explaining the current climate between the factions, and what previous events led to the current environment you find yourself in. Funnily enough, the game takes a niche approach by telling you bits and pieces of the story via unique missions tied to specific starting scenarios. For example, you learn quite a bit about Earth and the Terrans by starting out as a rookie pilot in the navy. Where this becomes impressive is that it also changes interactions with other story missions that all scenarios can lead to (i.e. obtaining the PHQ, or player headquarters).

The worldbuilding is a bit on the lacking side when compared to games like Mass Effect or Halo, but damn does it handle the aesthetics tied to it in a pleasing way. Despite the lack of depth, there still is a substantial amount of care that went into the design and histories of each of the factions, as well as the technology each on possess.

[h1]Game Mechanics[/h1]
This section could be a whole novel with how in depth the game mechanics are, but I'm going to keep it rather simple since what you actually do can be explained in simple terms. Below is the following progression for the 3-types of main mechanics you'll come across:

[list]
[*][b]FPS:[/b] You start off the game as a lone pilot inside a single ship (in most scenarios) and are told you ""make a name for yourself"" (or to follow unique storylines). This phase of the game typically lasts for 10-20 hours, has credit ranges between 0 - 10,000,000, and is the most enjoyable of the three.
[*][b]Squad/Fleet:[/b] This stage of the game starts once you've built up a stockpile of credits (10m - 5b), have purchased a cruiser and/or several other ships, and typically lasts for 20-40 hours depending on your starting location and setup. You're still flying the ship you're on, but you're now also in command of several other ships who may or may not be in a fleet with you. One of the hardest stages to get through since the playfield has most likely developed to a point where you're hostile with a few factions.
[*][b]RTS:[/b] Ahh... the RTS stage... This is considered endgame content and is easily denoted by you securing your PHQ and becoming self-sufficient from the other factions' shipyards. You'll most likely be in command of several fleets, have constructed dreadnoughts/carriers, and have 5b+ credits at any given time. This phase is where you really start to grapple with some of the other mechanics in the game related to trade, combat, politics, and industry as your faction is now considered a credible threat.
[/list]

All 3 phases of the game have entirely unique gameplay mechanics specific to each, and also have overlapping mechanics as you seamlessly progress from one phase to the next. Keep in mind that each stage has radically different playstyles that you [b][i]NEED[/i][/b] to adapt to, otherwise you'll quickly find just how unforgiving the reaches of space can be...


Side note: The actual flight mechanics for mouse/keyboard are so complex that it's highly advisable that you keep a copy of the keybinds on a second screen, or printed out for reference. You have been warned.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]
I want to be upfront and say that this game is meant for a very specific niche of gamers, and involves a substantial amount of time to learn/master. Even with 118 hours of playtime as of this review, I'm by no means anywhere close to being an expert on everything there is in the game. Additionally, each phase of the game involves a complex range of actions and knowledge just to engage with it (i.e. base building...).

For those who only care about what the final verdict is...:

Game play i like its a little slow but i like it. If you want action dog fighting is the way to go. Other wise just move around slow and let you turrets deal with everything. Nothing like being on the bridge of your ship and getting attacked, running down the elevators to get in your fighter ship flying off and fighting and win the fight come back and land and get back on the bridge again.

If you want to trade illegal wares and try not getting caught by the police is always fun and risky.
Becoming allies with factions can help you. Then if you want, you can turn on them or exploit them.
You can build your empire but block everyone else from doing any kind of trade with you so only on empire gets everything you do.
Taking over a sector is fun even my allies would send ships to patrol the area for me. 

Starting out with $10k and one ship trying your hardest to become who ever you want to be, like your own supper power, that everyone fears or likes you. And all the hard times you will have trying to get there. I remember long ago when i first started to play i didn't get far and i was already getting attacked by some raiders. After i died a few times, it was then i started to focus on building my fleets and empire and show these people i'm not to be messed with.

I'm hoping for X5 to have:
-Ground combat for boarding ships and stations.
-A heavy emphasis on interiors but not so much it takes away from what the X games are known for. Mainly for exploring and ground combat.
-Take part in boarding ships and stations or defending them.
-Not to focus on planets and planet landing. Stay in space, on ships, and stations.



i don't care so much about planet landing and exploring on them for this game. i rather have it be space stations and ships. Space stations should have large interiors to explore and fight on and same with ships. interiors should match how big the ship is. Not every inch and part should have interiors. Like some big capital ship shouldn't have 50 interiors or whatever but enough to cover main parts of the ship like the bridge, engine area, quarters, cafeteria and so on. Mainly it would be nice to be like star citizen but not that much in depth. So lets say you want to board a ship and want to take part in it well you go gear up get in the boarding pod or whatever it may be and then you board the ship. Say you got different areas to choose from where to try and start boarding the ship. Usually if you start from the back of the ship it would be less guarded wile the bridge would be the most heavily defended. so you can choose to start next to the bridge but once you exit the pod its a hard battle you may not win since its more heavily defended. Same with stations. You don't have to just take over the ship or stations you could just take their cargo or people or rescue someone or whatever it may be, doesn't have to just take over the ship. you could also sabotage the ship form the inside take the shields down or plant bombs or even steal their ships that are docked. Same thing with stations. Maybe you want to explore the dark depths of a station and talk to someone down there who might buy your black market items or give missions like stealing something or whatever it may be. Maybe you want to go the top of the station speak to who's in charge or something and get missions from them or try to buy the station from them i mean who knows you can come up with a lot of things. This would expand quest or missions and give you more things to do than taking over a ship. Same with stations. Imagine fighting on a big station big battle going on ships trying to defend in space and you on the station fighting on the ground in a big battle, look out the window and see the space fight, you could stop fighting on the station try to go to the hanger and get in a ship on go fight in space if you want too or escape if you have too. to me that would really open and expand the X games and be a strong competitor in space games.",1645813952,1705665707,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

X4 Foundations 6.2 and all DLC.

Still runs nice and smoothe even on my aging system. The DLC adds so much more to the game that I find myself playing with themes in mind such as a Xenophobe for example.

The scale of the game is immense, I'm not talking about the map size or the depth of the game even though it's quite generous. I'm talking about flying a small ship next to a station module, going into camera view and zooming right out and looking at that tiny dot next to the module then landing on a dock, getting out of my ship and looking at the size of that module in the distance.
And then coming to the realisation that I play with those modules like Lego.

It's actually amazing when you do that. I'm still mesmerised by it even today.

From Empire building, to space legs. From piracy to trading, mining to manufacturing. Wars and threats, stories and lore, it's all here.
There's even RNGesus right from the get go. And that's not a bad thing at all.

I've dominated whole sectors and made everyone angry with me only to start again as a lowly plebeian and each time I learn something new.
And the latest update is no exception to that. In fact even after 2000 hours, I'm still learning new things whether it be from a new ship Loadout all the way to a new station design.
This game keeps pulling me back.

I wish the developers all the very best in their future and I hope they will continue to roll out updates and even new gems like this one.

After spending 4 hours in tutorials, I had an experienced friend walk me through getting started, which would have been so much worse if I was left on my own, since this game tells you very little information and requires you to know a lot of its quirks to simply progress in the smallest manner. After 90 minutes of that, I was determined to uninstall and I requested a refund which was promptly rejected. With no refund and after a night of sleep I downloaded it again to give it a second chance with a fresh start and another 3 hour session to confirm that it was not the procedurally generated seed ruining my experience; I was simply not having fun. Based on some of the positive reviews I'm sure this becomes an amazing game after sinking a full work week into it, but until then, I find it to be an empty and unengaging experience. 

This game is full of empty space and the pacing in the early game involves a lot sitting around in a space road trip simulator. 80% of my time is spent with zero to no interaction while I autopilot to various mission areas. The game is procedurally generated and missions can be generated that are impossible to complete, but the game doesn't tell you so you can spend 20 minutes in a location before realizing there is nothing to do there but to abort the mission. It had my considering logging in to read some work emails because I was getting tired of monotonous fetch quests and minesweeping (ie carefully spend several minutes shooting dots from a distance or get too close, blow up and start over from a save).

The UI is extremely unhelpful, which is unfortunate since a large part of the game takes place in a menu hell. For example, modding your ship supplies very little information. There is no tooltip or description for each component when you decide what to slot in; you are expected to go to a separate glossary to read about them and come back with that knowledge ready in your head as you look through each one. All you can see is that your total ship stats increase or decrease; you gain or lose a little dps when you slot a weapon in or out but leave out key info like one weapon never missing but only damaging shields while another having low accuracy and fast fire rate but only damaging hull.

A large part of this game is learning the various quirks and menus and the game makes no effort to help you. Sure there are tutorials, but for the hours of tutorial content, it only scrapes the surface of what you need to know. I think I gave it a fair try but learning cryptic menus and game mechanics felt like work, and after more than a full work day in this game waiting to get hooked on the fun part that never came I'm ready to permanently uninstall. I think in order to truly enjoy this game you need to be willing to sink 20-40 hours before you get to the fun part.

I come from a Factorio background. I've got an absurd amount of hours in it, like 6500 or something. Possibly more, I'm afraid to check. Anyway, this game scratches the itch in much the same way Factorio does. This game is the child of Factorio and Elite: Dangerous. Honestly, I think the comparison to Elite is less accurate than to Factorio.

Cons: UI issues. Coming from a background in Factorio, you would especially want quality UI. You just have to forgive the devs here. There's a lot of crunch to the game and I think they are acting like most programmers and just not looking at the forest for the trees. That said, with a modicum of patience, you can figure things out. I haven't run into any game breaking bugs, but I'm only 30+ hours in at the time of review. This is game is not for casual players but is rewarding if you are willing to work for it.
Second con, the game stutters when there is a lot of action on screen and my computer is decent. I noticed some scumbag Xen destroyers attacking some friendlies and I dispatched my gunboat to help them. Went terribly. The action was dramatic and fun, but the frame rate went to hell.

Pros: This game is nice because it is as deep as you want it. It's quite crunchy but if you want to be a Han Solo smartass who dicks about the galaxy instead of being a Lando Calrissian trade mogul, you totally can. You can put in as much as you want. Say you don't even want to fly your ship, the recommended start gives you enough money to pay someone to pilot. That brings me to my next point and why I compared it to Factorio so much: automation.

This game automates. You can automate all the things and simply manage them from above. You can mine yourself or you can purchase a fleet of miners. You can trade yourself or you can hire traders. The autotrade functionality is a little ass but once you figure out station trading (not terribly long), it's quality.

Outside of all that, fucking fun. I bought the base game and then a day later, I bought all the DLC (on sale). I knew it was going to be a big ole time sink and I like a time sink.

One other thing: this game economies too. If you want to dick with economy stuff, go for it. I would say that it leans heavily into war economy so if you go into factory mode, expect to supply warships.

Anyway, worth the money, even at full price. You might want to wait for sale on the DLC unless you have a few hours in it or are a huge-ass fan of Factorio/Elite: Dangerous/Mount and Blade. This game feels like those three combined.",1705272830,1705272830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All the story lines have that black guy (nothing against his skin color, he just written to be unlikable) who like. ""Help me help me"". Here repair the space station. Then you teleport and control the space station. You got a shit ship and needs to build a dock right away with it. The tutorial in the game is fucking ass. It tells you to hire a builder.

It took me long time to build some resemblance of economy for my corporation. I had some stations and traders working hard to fund my military ambitions. I managed to buy my first carrier and fleet of 40 small size fighters accompanied by 4 mid size gun boats and 3 destroyers. I also managed to build a defense platform next to a gate that leads to enemy territory - keeping Xenon at bay. There was constant flow of them from that system so my idea was to go over there and clear it completely from their stations. But I was scared to loose my first fleet knowing that enemy does have some I class ship in there with some serious escort for it. What I've noticed however was Terran patrol going there from time to time as my fleet was staging not far from the gate. And Terrans do have a huge battleship with them. They always come back - crippled but alive. I had my satellites in enemy territory so I could watch what is going on out there, see them fighting. Decision was made - I set up sector alarm so next time Terran fleet with battleship shows up I get a message and I go with them. I thought that I will go, support them from behind and join full scale battle when enemy is weakened enough to limit my loses. I waited doing some management on my stations. And it took some time but the warning came. Quick look at the map and the Terran battleship was there with supporting fleet of fighters and mid size war ships. I teleported myself to my carrier and I took control of it. Few minutes later Terrans did go through the gate. I was next to it but waited - wanted them to take all the attention on the other side. The battle there was raging when I gave the signal and we jumped with my fleet. The moment we came out on the other side I gave the orders to my fighters and every other ship... and I made a mistake. Terrans where between us and the Xenon. Fighters were quick to engage from close flying straight to the enemy ships but my destroyers with range just above 10 kilometers started shooting the enemy from where we landed. Some of the shots reached Terran battleship - and I didn't react quick enough, I panicked. In seconds Terrans turned red and it was a bloodbath. Xenon destroyers where gone, their battleship was destroyed. Terrans were weakened so my forces dealt with them and their battleship was destroyed. I lost more than half of my fighters, was left with 2 medium ships and 1 destroyer in a really bad shape. Carrier wasn't even scratched but with not enough support it was to risky to keep it in that sector. We retreated leaving pile of scrap behind. I wasn't happy - I was not friendly with Terrans before this battle but now my reputation with them suffered. And I know that they will rebuild that battleship and come back at some point. I managed to hire a construction ship and quickly I did build a station in that enemy space with administration office so when the system is cleared of enemy stations it will be mine. For no real reason - not only it's an empty space but also there is some electrical discharge out there that slowly drains shields on all small ships. Maybe it was to remember that battle which was epic! I did send my destroyer there with the construction ship. Destroyer had 250 laser towers that were deployed around the construction area - because the moment I started that construction Xenons were furious and wanted to stop it. It took me next couple of days to rebuild my fleet and destroy all enemy stations in that sector. When it became mine I received a news from media - the world noticed what happened. And there were some interviews with other faction leaders or representatives about the situation. Not everyone was happy. Guess who threatened me...

So X4 is great. I waited very long time before buying it knowing that it will take my life away. It's what happened before with previous X games. I have a special sentiment for the series and some amazing memories from 1999 when I played XBTF (first game of this scale I played and was shocked was is possible in a sandbox plus amazing music). I love the setup and everything that comes with it. I waited and it worked well for me - game is in a polished state, with all expansions bringing back all the factions and things that I would expect from it. Yes there are some bugs and some things are broken - but I can live with that at least for now. Nothing took away they joy as for now, no game breaking bugs. The scale of the game is great, space legs are awesome. Another expansion is coming and free update as well. There is only one thing that I would like to change in the future... Since the first game we are in more or less same world, with same factions, doing more or less same thing. It needs to change! Gates must collapse, new ways of travel needs to be discovered, new space needs to be discovered, new alien races, new technologies, weapons, stations, completely new world for us to discover and to finding our way in it. Because... I love this game, but it's same old just with better graphics and more things to do in exactly same setup. Things did change since XBTF but I want to experience more and new things. If X5 is the same with just better graphics and physics - I don't think I will buy it as those things are great now in my opinion. I need something completely new in the future. 

Back to X4 - it's my first playthrough and I can see many more months before I finish what I started. And then I want to go through Split and Boron playthrough. And Terran! So - It's a game that will entertain me for another year or so. And I wish you the same. Try it, give it a chance and you might find yourself wondering in asteroid fields one day thinking I wish this was my real life, not just a simulation.",1705062986,1705062986,True,29,1,0.755013704299926758,0,True,False,False

Day 3 review:

TLDNR: 6/10 Not worth full price, for most, wait for sale or more patches. 
Hate bugs? Dont buy it. 
Love the X series? Buy it.
Dont mind bugs and want an over all good game? Get it.
Dont mind bugs and got some X-mas cash? X-mas cash = X4.

The bugs are very noticeable, and pretty severe in nature. You can tell this was rushed -hard- for the winter sale.

But, I leave the thumbs up because under the bugs its a great game that im totally enthralled with. The bugs arent stopping my progress in any major way, they are just a blemish on an otherwise well made game.

The worst bug is some rendering issues that arise the longer you play a session. After about 2 hours of general play the map bugs out, ships, people, and stations stop loading properly, and you just need to save and restart it to fix it.

Other than that, there are some clunkyness issues with the controlls, and interface but its easily overlooked if you are either use to it from other X games, or get into the game itsellf. The controlls,... i suggest you spend your first hour rebinding them. Just set the time asside and do it, its so needed.

All in all, the game gets a thumbs up for now because they have released atleast 2 patches to fix major issues within the first 2 days. While i dont expect the game to be 'fixed' over night, i do suspect that in time it'll be a decently polished experiance.

Day 1 review:

Quick thoughts: Possibilities are there. The stage is set. They just need to polish it up and it'd easily be a 10/10 but im having issues with bugs. Not just little ones.

However im use to these sorts of things so for now it gets a thumbs up. But if they dont release fixes ASAP that will change quickly. I can stand behind an ambitious game like this being buggy as long as i see the devs working on said bugs.",1543666067,1705019340,True,2,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Game is still in early access at best (Jan. 2024)
Lack of patch support

+The Astrid is one of the most beautiful ships ever designed
+Music is very good
+Beautiful game
+Stories 
+Flying through highways in a spacesuit is fun and pretty cool and relaxing. Just save before doing so, so you can be back at the ship after you exit the highway.
+Voice cast has improved mostly
+Most ship designs now look better
+Trade lanes are fun now, instead of a crashing burden. All that speed.
+A lot of sectors to explore
+Really like the idea of movable sidewalks to get around. Except it's a bit too slow.
+Game is fun
+Autopilot has epically failed. Hahahah godd.amn drones get out the way bit.ch.
+Game engine without AA runs pretty well
+Mod support
+Steam Workshop
+Game lighting is fine with me now
+Sound effects
+Brought back ship logos like X: Beyond had, though newer ones
+Painting ships now
+Station designs.. painting stations would be nice also
+Font can be increased with UI size slider.. doh! 
+Docking is nice
 +Auto docking is better
+View from spaceports
/<>\
+/- No more alien race stations. Just copy/paste uniformed stations. What was cool about the X series are the alien designed ships and stations. Looks like the new dlc will change that. (dlc's changed this somewhat - still copy/paste station designs)
+/- Walking around stations.. even though it's copy/paste
+/- Tutorial is still not very helpful much.. at least the game has something like an in game guide now.
+/- So the AA performance and game lag issues seem to be related to a 1070 with a faulty hdmi port. An old 1070 that can't keep up with modern MSAA/SSAA modes.
+/- Building stations in side missions. 
+/- Patch support is around. Mostly.
+/- Betty got re-added, except so much voice information is missing
+/- Default key binding for ships is not smart. Re-binded the keys for the way X3TC had them. Kept hitting spacebar for non mouse driving and actually fired weapons instead. Good way to get into trouble with stations and ships.

-Kingsdom End dlc is trash. Worth 0.99 cents at most.
-Kingdoms End dlc has mono audio issues in conversations with characters on ships( jan 2024 still a thing)
-Getting stuck in stations when using boost too close too stations. Bouncing off and some how end up getting stuck in the textures.
-Not enough boost time. Super annoying. No mod for infinite boost.
-Not a fan of scanning stations for radio signals to uncover missions
-Shift-1, F1 randomly stops working. Only way to fix this is to reload (public-beta)
-No way to manually dock in third person camera mode
-Pretty long load times even on SSD
-Still very buggy and glitchy
-Patch support is pretty lacking
-Some stations that can't be targeted have radio signals that cant find the glowing signals either. You can hear it. You can get close to the signal. Yet you can't unlock the message.
-Ships still can't dock worth a crap. Still has docking behavior from X3TC. (big ships)
-Lack of information on objects, even after scanning them
-A.I. is still very dumb
-Rep up for licenses
-Boron are camels in a fish tank
-Xenon ship designs are still bad
-Xenon faction really needs to be replaced with something else... Xenon faction is very boring",1566510284,1705014303,True,7,1,0.492158263921737671,0,True,False,False

Example: My very expensive destroyer (at least for early-mid game), which I bought especially to defend one of the zones vital for my trade was sent to intercept an enemy XEN destroyer that's on half hitpoints, no shields and has no escorts nearby. The result of this fight is 0 dmg dealt to the enemy ship and my destroyer went up in flames. It didn't use it's combat drones despite telling it manually to do so. 

There is many more issues that I could somehow deal with, but what's the point of playing for 5-10 hours if this is the result? It feels like you should buy 20x more ships than the enemy just so you have a chance.

tl;dr: The AI sucks so bad the rest of the game doesn't matter in the long run. Based on how long ago this game was released, I wouldn't count on the combat AI being ever fixed.

That being said the new update just released, and I'm buying the DLC, lmao. I will update my review if anything changed.

 I'm still a junky for these X space games. Rereading an old X game review I said X games are always meh at launch and take 5 years to become truly good. Doh

[b] If your into deep space games with lots of options you'll love playing the X series of games including this one. But be prepared to have your game die for various reasons even if you don't use community mods. Some players experience game breaking bugs and numerous QoL bugs that drive some to insanity. [/b]

 But I'm still just a salty old gamer screaming at kids to get off his lawn in regards to online co-op added after launch and QoL community mods that break achievements.

------- old review 2019
If your looking for a space game where the dev's keep nerfing things that players liked because they do not feel the game should be played that way then this is the game for you.

Experience:
If you are looking for the unique experience of being a space CEO, waiting in a ship looking out the window at how beautiful space is and meanwhile your employee is transporting you to the next quest.

In the meantime, you teleport to the mining ship to see how they are doing and watch them work live. And by now you can have entire fleets, space stations, factories....

Then you decide that you need adrenaline, so you teleport to your defense fleet against the Xenons. While waiting for the attack, you order another ship or design another space station. Until finally, the loud sound of the Xenon attack wakes you up and the action begins.

There are a lot of things to do in this game, it can absorb you completely, and on the other hand, you can relax and fly on autopilot to some new, unknown places.
--------------------------------
The graphics look very good, although it is clear that Star Citizen has raised the bar significantly. Especially when it comes to the interiors of ships and space stations.
The characters in the game look very old, but there is an atmosphere, so they do their job. It's definitely better than looking at some 2D drawings of the races we work with in the game, here we can go to a representative and buy licenses directly from him, etc.

Ship animations and physics are great, ship controls too, especially having a joystick. You can see the difference when controlling each ship.

The number of ships, races, types of weapons, and elements of space stations is simply huge. A huge plus that increases immersion in this simulation.

VFXs
Most of them look good, especially the ones during combat... but when I see myself going through a gate teleporting to the next part of space and seeing a white ball around the ship that cuts through its model, it looks super bad. Someone could have tried harder, sorry. Fix it in Timelines please....

--------------------------------
Things I don't like. (more info for devs)
- One sound of the Kha'ak lasers sounds like a toy, I would delete it immediately.
- Sometimes quests could get buggy, for example you come to collect some crates and there were supposed to be two, but there is only one. The quest is completely blocked. Or I started the young gun campaign and the main quest didn't start at all, I didn't notice it because the game gives you a lot of things to do, but I guess it shouldn't be like that...
- The game does not introduce well the economy and its huge management potential. I had to learn everything from YouTubers. Watch Startopia tutorial videos made by the devs, something like this would be very useful.
- The UI looks very old, and the multitude of options in such a case wastes the player's time looking for why units are not doing something as they should, or it is not clear where something is being edited. You start YouTube again to learn how to play it, because you don't know where to select something required... etc.

Only when you master all the game's systems does it become less frustrating and more enjoyable and relaxing. Exactly the same as in Elite Dangerous",1704621516,1704621516,True,1,0,0.516806721687316895,0,True,False,False

Another 30 minutes resolving a bug that involved half the commands simply not working (would not bring up map, could not throttle, could not unlock mouse steering, nor many other functions) requiring a save / reload every time to resolve.  I spent a bit just ensuring that it was indeed a bug and not some esoteric feature that, you know, literally disables half the controls - but no, I'm very certain it was a bug.

If I'm getting actual bugs on a 5 year old game straight out of the box within hours of loading it up for the first time, there's a problem.

There is next to ZERO guidance on what to do or how to do it.  You will spend hours looking stuff up on wikis or youtube videos.  For those crying that ""it's a sandbox and there's no goal,"" I'd tell them that the original Mount & Blade Warband had more guidance on gameplay and a superior tutorial over 13 years ago than this thing has in 2024.

The thing feels less like a space sim and more like a weird, even more clunky and text-ridden offline version of EVE.  If you thought EVE had a lot of text and spredsheets, then sweet lord this game somehow adds even more.  I'd argue even the point-and-click flying of EVE is somehow more engaging and interesting than the flight mechanics of this game which both allows (and expects) you to toggle inertia with ""flight assist.""

Going into map mode to so much as glance at your route grinds your ship to an instant full halt.  Not having ANY map information whatsoever besides a 3d compass (which offers so little relevant information that it's a joke) means you'll be checking it often.  I'm sure there's a toggle (or a mod) to fix something like that, but it's still infuriating to have to toggle ""travel mode"" constantly, nonstop.  I was bored of it even in the few hours I got to ""play.""

I say ""play"" because if your ""game"" requires the 100-something hours of tedium people are suggesting you need to ""get used to it,"" then I'd tell you there are a lot of painful experiences you can ""get used to"" after 100 hours of torture.

This is my first X series game. I have not played any previous versions and this is from what I gather the 4th in the series. There are some things I don't understand in the story line because of it, but I don't feel like I have missed anything to inhibit me from playing THIS version, it'll give me a reason to go back and play the others if I want but I'm not likely to buy any of the previous games at this time. I got all of the available expansions up to Kingdom's End which seems to be the only expansion that is played as far as the story line goes. I got all of the DLCs during winter sale and I highly recommend getting all of them as it will open the galaxy up wide for you to explore. I feel like I'm coming in at the end of it all though. There is a new expansion coming about time travel or something. This doesn't seem to interest me much though. I enjoy playing the game itself and the story line stuff and missions for it tend to take away from me running my empire. Since I'm struggling to get the AI to do stuff I want it to do properly I find that doing the story line stuff is challenging to say the least. I think story quests help you open up the galaxy some and give you some free ships so they def help your play through but I find it hard to tear myself away to go do them.

This game is a very unique concept of a game where you command your little part of the galaxy in an open world sandbox universe where you are a mere speck of a person in the grand scheme of the entire galaxy. Build you empire from the ground up while simply trying to survive the dangers of the world which there are many. Mine, Trade, Explore, Customize and Build every aspect of your ships. You can fly all ships in the game (except for enemy ships) from the smallest of fighters all the way to the largest of capital ships. You can decide to go and do everything, or control everything from the safety of your home base that you build (if you can). 

What you do effects the galaxy as a whole, help NPCs or let them die from their enemies? Choose sides in a war, or be a neutral party and be everyone's friend? Be a pirate faction and be no one's friend and enemy with everyone and fight your way through the game? Destroy everyone and control the entire universe or be an epic power house that dominates the economy? Anything is possible. From what I've seen there is no ""End"" for the game until you decide to stop playing. You either declare you've beaten the game, or kill everyone else until there's nobody left but you. Its entirely possible to build all the other faction's ships if you want. Just buy all their blueprints, then destroy their empire, and then you become them owning their ships and being able to build them yourself. Is this possible? Maybe I don't know for sure. I haven't gotten there myself but it feels possible. 

I struggle a lot with getting the AI automated to do stuff. The menus and conditions for which NPCs do what you want them to do is very complex. Resources online are entirely community based and are very incomplete IMO. I'd really like detailed documentation as to what every button and every window does but I haven't found anything online that tells me this. I'll leave comments section open below if anyone has this. 

The game looks amazing. Its very enjoyable to just sit and watch your ships land and take off at your station. Watch your station be built, and I also enjoy riding along occasionally with my miners and traders to see the galaxy ""in person"" and watch how things are done by the NPCs. Sometimes I have to do it myself because they get bugged out which is very annoying at times.

If you can handle the above and it looks appealing to you it's absolutely worth giving a shot.

Yeah, you can make profitable stations, but you're either taking advantage of stupid shit (almost feels like cheating, and there are a LOT of easy ways to cheat this game), or you have to deal with your AI not knowing how to manage its own stock properly.

One of the things that still bugs me is the different design decision which come up in the expansions and kinda break the feeling and flow of the game.

E.g. Initially there was a defensive (Sentinel) and offensive (Vanguard) version of each ship, which changed the aspects of a ship according to the aspect (speed, cargo space, responsiveness, turning rates etc.). Those version where then exclusive to specific fractions, like Argon only having vanguard versions. Then in the later expansion they complete turn away from that and instead there was only a single version of each ship, which certain ships being only available to specific fractions.

Same thing for ship customization. Initially each ship could have race specific shields, engines and weapons. But with the latest extension they also went away from that, with the boron race having ships which can only have boron specific shields, engines and weapons.

It feels like that the games could use a clean up which establishes some basic design decision that is followed through the entire aspect of the game.

Over the years of playing these games I have noticed several things.

[h1]The game design has become too complex[/h1]
They add more depth but also make it harder to learn and understand even basic game features. This already makes it frustrating right of the start when you don't even have access to half that the game has yet to offer. If you have no time and no patience, you stand no chance of getting into this game.

[h1]They try to do and have everything[/h1]
The game has too much stuff in it while at the same time having a lot of interesting things people liked from old games cut out. Like the access to the full universe map, they removed a lot of sectors over time. All ship designs are completely different from what they used to be and it is hard to make out a difference between them often times. In exchange they added tons of new items, new ship models that seem unnecessary to me in terms of their purpose, and a lot of management and trading fluff that is a bit much at times. I don't think ambition is bad if you can control it, but since X:Rebirth I think they lost that control. Creating more things leads to more maintenance required. Nothing runs really well and the user experience feels overall average because of it. Don't even get me started on trading with NPCs on stations, I wish they never added this whole tryhard on-side planet trading system.

[h1]The Sandbox became ""smaller""[/h1]
They tried making every sector bigger by moving them into clusters and filling them up with more assets in X:Rebirth already, but they all look the same, or rather each group of sectors does since they follow their own respective themes. In the old X games, each sector was unique with it's own visuals, description and lore on the map. Nowadays sectors are less about being individual zones and more about being clusters of areas which makes you lose interest in them very quickly, as you just fly and fly through them without any visual changes. Yes the initial wow effect is there, but that is lost after flying through the system for 30 minutes. In X4 there was only 1 absolutely unique standalone sector in the entire game and that was before they removed the cool background effect of it (LoF in Tides of Avarice).

[h1]The UI is an absolute mess[/h1]
Especially looking at the UI you can see dramatic changes from old to new X games. The UI used to be very simple, straightforward and better structured. Nowadays you have menus under menus under menus leading to more menus. If you are looking for a specific command or function you are searching a long time.

[h1]The story lost importance[/h1]
And it became more of a side activity. In the old games you were presented with the main story right of the start and could then choose to do it whenever you wanted to. You had your pointers for that at the very beginning. Here you have to first find a NPC or location somewhere in the universe that triggers one of the story missions for you. In an universe this complex that is really hard to do, which is a shame because some dialogues and characters are actually pretty good (Boso Ta).


For these reasons I can only recommend this to die hard fans of the series.
Any new player will likely not be able to get into the series at this point.
For new players I recommend to try X3 Terran Conflict or X2 instead and then work your way up to newer titles.

I will still continue to play this from time to time, because I think X4 is overall way better than X:Rebirth and sort of dips into the old X games, but is still not quite the game that we want and need.

The AI is awful... and I mean, cant trust them to pilot a single ship in combat even at level-4 skill AWFUL
The gate system is probably the most horrible thing in this game... beyond the AI. 

I spent multiple days building a trading empire, spent about the same taking over a few systems for resource claim.  I decided to go after the Xenon home systems, and given that the AI is AWFUL (as previously mentioned) and that the Xenon camp the gates on their side, I watched an armada of the largest and most powerful terran ships get destroyed one by one because the pilots are so stupid that they can only go through one at a time at an average of 1 per minute.... and the fighters get spat out hundreds of Km from the gate with no shields for some reason- so they all die.

Eh, well, where do I start...

I suppose this marks the first time I'm looking for a 'mixed' review option but the AI is just so bad and all the havoc it ends up causing tips the scales more towards the No.

First and foremost, newcomers be warned; the X series has never and will never be one of those fast paced hand holding type space sims. You can spend like, a hundred hours or more just laying the groundwork for your empire. I CANNOT STRESS HOW LITTLE HAND HOLDING X gives. Yes there are ingame resources like Guided/Assisted Start(s) and Tutorial Missions (not to be confused with the Tutorial Start) that generate missions to teach you the mechanic of something but this is not Press W Hold LMB. Even the assorted plots will tend to just go and leave you to your own devices from time to time. Read a guide. Ask Reddit. Newbies will get lost and the atrocious UI (an Egosoft hallmark) is not doing the game any favours.

The game is fully simulated now, no magically poofing resources. You can spend time pew pewing the dumb AI ships for cash or plug some obvious holes in an economy or three and get rich stupid quick. Set up an empire, claim sectors, wipe the floor with other empires. Probably the best(?) sandbox out of Egosoft...since X:Rebirth anyway. X3TC/AP still remains the peak overall.


Pros:
+ Mostly moddable
+ Quite in depth, should you choose to spend the time to learn everything you need to know
+ Arguably easier to get into compared to prior games*
+ You don't blow up because one random antenna on your ship grazed an asteroid at 10m/s anymore
+ Fully simulated - you can starve an AI faction's economy and watch them stop constructing ships because nothing's being delivered to the wharves and shipyards. No more magically poofing in ships.
+ Not limited to a random clunky story ship while watching your shiny ships do (poorly) what you wish you could. Seriously Egosoft, what was up with Rebirth? I mean I get the return to the roots thing but...
+ No more ""CARGO HOLD NOW CONTAINS: ORE""
+ Complexes no longer require spaghetti and the game has more than 4gb ram awareness so you're not likely to crash or drop to 1FPS from entering your home sector where you have a massive 300 module factory or something
+ Station building is much more customizable
+ Capital combat is entertaining now. It's not just some dramatically upscaled fighter, there's hardpoints to target. Knock out their engines and shields and send in the marines!
+ Capitals have mass locking to make this^ easier or to exploit for travel purposes. Simply fly a S/M ship close enough and the capital drags you along with it. Don't want to spend 10mins travelling at 2km/s? Maybe you're escorting a L/XL ship? Just get close and grab some popcorn or something. (Disclaimer: system is not perfect, have occasionally randomly been knocked out of their orbit, sometimes their gate use is screwy and you'll need to get back onto them in the next sector anyway)
+ Boarding is improved. No more waiting for a hundred spacewalkers moving at 10m/s. There's now a readout so you don't have to roughly guess what the progress is based on ""DECK FIVE! CLEAR!"". You can watch them cut down the crew by the numbers instead. Only guesswork is when they finish cutting into the hull and begin clearing.


Cons:
- Learning curve's probably steep for new people. Definitely a cliff for ""I don't do tutorials lol"" 'tough guys' who then spend time bitching that you can't expect them to remain under the belly of this Xenon S the entire time they're shooting it. I can understand if you're one handed but the controls aren't bad. Tutorials exist. Ya git.
- The UI is a royal mess. Several royal messes actually, I find myself missing X3TC's UI despite the few improvements here and there. Prior games were messy though manageable.
- Station building controls such as rotation are a frustrating mess to figure out (but work well enough once you figure out I guess)
- Several of the more community favourite races are DLC and the general consensus is that they're overpriced
- The AI is dumb as rocks and it shows²
- The logbook is helpfully useless³
- Gonna call out the graphics a little. Compare the system specs for X3TC and it's graphics vs this
- Space legs pisses me off like you wouldn't believe (adds nothing besides tedium). I'd go as far as to say Elite: Dangerous has better space legs. Yeah.
- Apparently a space game is all about standing around listening to people talk for an hour before giving you the next quest direction to talk to another guy for an hour. Mostly unskippable too. Heard it once, heard it a million times. Don't want to have to sit through Delilah's long speeches on subsequent playthroughs thanks. Bonus points if I have to talk to the NPC in person and I have to switch my ship (eg M -> S) because they happen to be on a ship which lacks M pads or something.
- Spacewalks are realistic now. Unfortunately there's no pilot assist option for folks who already hate getting out of the ship without having to spend extra time controlling their movements
- While refreshing, there are segments of the game's plots that heavily involve space walks. Paranid Civil War was more or less okay but that Pioneer storyline at Earth? *long suffering sigh*
- I'd wager the modding code isn't as exposed as X3's was given the offerings on Nexus/Workshop but haven't independently dived in to verify yet
- Teladi doesssssn't wear clothesssss. Teladi only needsssss helmet. (Not that they speak in third person anymore I suppose. Anyway, there's a mod for that. Weird design choice.)


*It's more streamlined economically and you don't need to learn the M/T ship classification lexicon to gauge the power of something anymore. Streamlining is also a bit of a minus since we don't have *quite* as many ships as the X3 era but it's not like new people know what they're missing out on right? *Looks at ""ATF MILITARY VALHALLA""*

²At least in earlier games they kept moving around in combat, not literally come to a dead stop, turn, then fly again in quite a few cases. The AI is also responsible for the next gripe.
³Now when I say helpfully useless, I mean that it generates a lot of helpful logs like who traded and made/spent how much. But we have no sector focus button on these logs. See, here's the kicker...due to the AI being exceptionally dumb as rocks now, at some point you will start seeing your factional reputation tank harder than an Eastern European superpower's fleet. The reason? Most likely the AI bumped into one of your defense platforms and decided it was a pirate and so it shoots it and the platform responds in kind. Or perhaps a S ship decided they wanted to fly across the path of one of your XL ships and got splattered on the bridge's solar windshield. Sector security promptly goes nuts and your ship defends itself against the perceived pirate attacks from sector security. You go from 30 rep (max) to -30 in a 5 minute space. So you go to check the logbook in the high hopes you might find that HMS Smusher is logged swatting TEL Dumbnuts in [sector] so that when you inevitably reload you might be able to prevent that. All you get is a REPUTATION LOSS -1 REASON: UNAUTHORIZED KILL. That's it. Not even who did the kill or what exploded.



Overall...if you like space and you like sandboxes, this is good for the most part. The learning curve is like one of those vertical drop slides - super steep but once you've been in it you find it fun and go back for more. That said, the AI is very likely to make you flip a table. I wouldn't be writing this review if the AI hadn't just made me go from 30 to -30 in the blink of an eye for the same reasons I listed above. Thanks for being so helpfully useless, Logbook. Egosoft. It's been years since the game dropped.

Latest update (6.0) made it somewhat better (+borons jeej!), but overal still buggy. There is hope after all.
I can only recommend to buy it with discount tbh.

=== Original:
Great game, but absolutely plagued with bugs, bad performance (mostly towards endgame) and horrific AI.

The AI is absolutely horrific. It is propably the worst part of the game. A fully kitted and modded Terran Syn with a full 5 star captain can't 1 vs 1 with a Xenon but it is completely retardly turning endlessly. Of the 8 Large plasma turrents at best 4 are shooting...and then not even consistenly. Or they are hugging enemies and get shredded that way. 5 star captains should be the best, but are barely better then a 1 star.

UI is bad, like really bad. I can find my way through it, but it is just menu after menu after menu. Want to repair a few fighters? Have fun! Fighters that are docked on carriers wont repair/resupply unless you manually order them to, for each and everyone invidually...

Setting up patrols in your own sectors is basically useless. They fly around and ignore enemies unless reaaaaally close or if they are attacked themselves.

I had fun while playing, but only in the early stages, after ~24 in a game it becomes boring. Factions are at war with eachother, but don't do much more then building 1 or 2 stations in enemy territory. Endgame is boring/non-existant. 

I feel like the developers are just winging it and don't care at all anymore. Could be so much more fun, but it is really held back with all it flaws.

The sheer vastness of the game's universe is staggering, providing an unparalleled canvas for players to paint their spacefaring dreams. Whether constructing a sprawling economic empire, participating in epic interstellar skirmishes, or navigating the intricacies of intergalactic trade, X4 delivers an immersive experience that keeps you hooked.

Despite the allure, it's crucial to acknowledge the steep learning curve that newcomers might find daunting. However, the commitment of the developers to patching and improving the game shines through, gradually smoothing out the wrinkles. While occasional bugs may disrupt the seamless experience, the continuous updates reflect a dedicated effort to polish the game. X4: Foundations caters to a niche audience – those who relish the challenge of a strategic space simulation. If you're willing to invest the time and effort, the game's expansive possibilities and the depth of its universe make it a rewarding journey for true space enthusiasts.

Just the mere loading of Xbox 360 Controller for Windows drivers (or maybe XInput?) causes this game to grind to a halt.  Still spaghetti code, but since I can now play the game, I have not refunded and will keep playing.  Will update my review as I experience more of the game; I'm not quite ready to recommend it yet.  

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Game stutters at a constant rate of about 4 stutters per second, regardless of graphics settings.  Frametime graph looks like a fucking atomic emission spectrum.  I tried everything I can think of in my graphics driver settings (including changing drivers entirely) and the game video settings, and was unable to find any advice online, because this game has so many stuttering issues that I couldn't narrow them down with a search query.  CPU utilisation is under 20% on every core (yes, I'm aware that the game's universe simulation is single threaded, and yes, I checked for a single core running higher, and no, there wasn't one), and GPU utilisation jumps between 0 and 100%.  

I have a 7800X3D, a 6900XT, and 32GB of Corsair Dom Plat.  The framerate in between stutters is sky high.  I was really looking forward to experiencing this game as it appears in screenshots and videos, and I was sure my machine would be capable.  I would hesitate to leave a negative review because it might not be the game's fault, but a) the game is such a technical turd that it has prevented me from narrowing down possible causes & fixes despite me being willing & technically able, and b) I have very few issues with the other 400 games in my library, while thousands upon thousands of people have issues in this game.  If the cross section between my machine and the game causes technical issues, one is clearly statistically more likely to be at fault.  

Maybe I'm being unfair.  I dunno.  I was just really in the mood to play something like this.",1703208612,1703635569,False,4,0,0.452287405729293823,0,True,False,False

I don't understand the complaints about the game mechanics. Maybe there were problems during the early days of X4, but now I see little to no problems with this game. In my 500+ hours of game-play, I may have seen a glitch maybe two or three times. But after fully understanding the gameplay and mechanics, I'd say this is by far one of my favorite games of all time. Looking forward to X5 or whatever else EgoSoft has on the way. Excellent job devs! 


===

I've been sleeping on the X series for far too long! I actually picked up a couple of the previous X games back in the day, and never played them. I always loved the idea of the X series, and have always supported EgoSoft, I just never took the plunge. This copy of X4 was purchased the week it came out, and it slept in my library for years until now. 

After clocking 300+ hours into Starfield, I felt empty, alone, and unchallenged. Yet again, the realization that we live in a world of AAA hand holding pew-pew games sold to the highest bidder slapped me across the face and left me with a empty hotdog bun. Enough of this madness! It was time to give the X series a try... wtf...

WTF!!! Why did I wait so long! This is the single player, RTS, deep grand strategy, rpg, open world, space opera, space shooter, small squirrel with a small nut in a huge world kind of game I've been looking for! And it's been right under my nose the entire time!

Wait, this is NOT a game, its a Simulation! X4 simulates an entire universe, and this universe doesn't care about you! You must learn the ropes and make your own way! Hours, this game can run for HOURS to, months, to YEARS even! There are players who have the same game running for YEARS! Replay-ability is NUTS with multiple starting points, multiple factions, multiple income levels, amazing.

I started off playing on Geforce Now, and quickly decided to purchase a new computer to play this game offline. Yea, I did! AMD GPU and AMD Processor (this game is extremely processor heavy). But it was worth every credit! It literally runs all day on my computer. I wake up, start X4, and let the world and my empire do its thing as I respond to alerts and notifications in the background. 

Don't be scared or pushed away by the ""this game is hard"" propaganda circulating the internet. Fact is, this game is like no other. There are no quality how to play guides built into the game, you'll have to head to places like the EgoSoft forums, YouTube, and X4 Reddit to get the ins and outs of how to really get started. But once you unlock the tools necessary to embrace this epic space masterpiece, you may leave your girlfriend AND wife to start a new life as the king of your space empire!

Graphics are beautiful. Music is grand. Stories are deep. And your options are endless. X4 is the Table Top, Epic Space Opera you've been looking for!",1700034980,1703633910,True,34,5,0.775109767913818359,0,True,False,False

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I loved X3:TC and X3:AP but X4 is just too bad.
It COULD be a good game. But the massive amount of broken mechanics and half-baked features ruin it all for me.

Some issues are just plain retarded; I really don't understand how they came to be implemented in the first place. 
The best (worst?) example is targeting mechanic : you press T to target what's in front of you. Except that if the target is too distant or you were slightly off, the game will target LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE, including stuff that can be BEHIND YOU.
There are keys for ""target nearest enemy"" and ""target nearest object"" so I really don't understand why this is in any way helpful. It is counter-productive, confusing and generally quite dumb.
The hitbox also aren't that great: you can have a MASSIVE station literally blocking up your whole screen and the buggy targeting will still target ship behind it. Because reasons.

UI is poor and unlike X3, cannot realistically be used without a mouse.
Forget playing with a controller/joystick : you NEED a mouse to use the in-game menu.
I understand they want it to be more ""user-friendly"" to point and click but they made it so much less efficient and very tedious to use.
I moved 10 marines from one ship to another one by one and nope, never again. Those 10 were better trained but I'll simply use more crappy ones instead of wasting 15 minutes of my life again.

The X series always been veeeeery sloooow gaaaaame.  But it seems they pushed it to another level with this one. In-game pilot ""training"" is broken; it can takes 40+ hours to train one pilot from basic to ""3 stars"" level. 
Why is it important? Because most automation functions are gated by this fabled ""3 stars level""; you won't be able to use advanced trading / mining until you have a couple pilots at that level. This is a major issue and there are numerous forum post about it but it is still unfixed. Fortunately, there are some mods around that fix this but the core game is broken on that aspect.

Another example of bad mechanics are the Khaak, some annoying little enemy critters that attack ships at random.
The Khaak come from ""hives"", as long as a hive is active, Khaak will attack you mining ships in the next 3 sectors over. So okay, need to destroy the hive... But you *cannot locate them* : they spawn on the edge of the map where your scouts won't go. 
They only way to find the hives are to run around in circle in every 3 sectors around any sector where you notice a Khaak. It literally takes HOURS of just driving around. How is that fun to force the player to do such incredibly tedious and boring chore??

The other enemy faction, the Xenon, received a massive buf since X3. You need 5-6 destroyers if you want to stand a chance against 1 xenon destroyer. It's unfair but ok, new balance, why not.
Problem is : they didn't buf the computer factions. Quickly enough they are overwhelmed by Xenon forces and it ruins the whole in-game economy.
X3 had the ""rapid response"" mechanic to prevent that : allied ships would jump in sector where Xenon force would breach in. There isn't such thing in X4: in both my gameplay, the Xenons were eventually everywhere, wrecking havoc to core sectors without the computer factions trying to do anything about it.

About computer factions : they didn't improve the AI of those, not at all. 
It seems DUMBER compared to X3, if such a thing is possible. Traders ""fleeing"" attacking ships will routinely run TOWARD THEM, fleet will forget to engage there drive and instead go to their destination at walking pace, escort ships will carry on their travel while their escorting target is being ripped apart by pirates, trade ship deciding to travel through forbidden ""hazardous regions"", ...
All in all, you need to micromanage everything because the computer is ridiculously dumb. It's not new of the X series, but the added complexity of X4 makes this even more unbearable.

It's a shame really because there are so many interesting ideas in this game but in its current form it's just no good. 
There are several mods around that make the experience better, do look around if you decide to give X4 a try.",1703126989,1703128276,False,268,8,0.746114492416381836,0,True,False,False

so ill try and sum it up as best as i possibly can!
THIS GAME IS NOT NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY AND NOT FOR CASUAL SPACE SIMMERS!
IT WILL TAKE YOU BETWEEN 10-20 HOURS TO GET MODERATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE GAME!
this is a good game! it has an absolutely unfathomable amount of immersion and freedom! this game easily trounces all over ED as far as immersion and ""bgs"" and even the content available!
there are some EXTREMELY serious downfalls that will completely RUIN this game for new players!

i usually go over the pro's first but in this case im going to list the cons first because there arent that many of them but they are absolute deal breakers for a LOT of people who are looking for a new game to get into!
1-the learning curve is EXTREMELY STEEP and theres not much intuition put into the built in tutorials which guide you along learning the many many systems in the game! they are overwhelming in quantity and they are NOT prepared in a way that teaches them to you in a manner in which they are more likely to be adapted to via muscle and visual memory!
2-there are an absolute shit ton of systems to learn and they are overly complicated in many aspects! now this wouldnt be something that would put people off in the case for an mmo or pvp game! the problem here is that your playing a single player game that will take you 10-20 hours to learn to a point of being comfortable enough to enjoy the game as a whole!
BE WARNED IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CASUAL GAME TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A BLAST WITH THIS AINT IT!
3- there are many situations where you need to prompt the player! not hold their hand but simply give them a descriptive set of instructions via the hud or in a menu somewhere that they can be lead to easily to either learn a new system or just simply to progress their current mission! this game falls completely short on that! The first mission for the queens herald is to deliver 50 units of bofu to the HQ... simple enough ... but what they dont tell you is that as you come to the last scouted system you are given a hidden objective to find the jump gate that leads to heretics whatever its called..
it tells you to fly to it.. but doesnt tell you that the gate isnt marked and that you have to find it! as a new player you have no idea that that is even a thing... which is no big deal but it will lead you to a 2 hour journey on youtube finding a walk through to learn just about anything you wanna know!
4-there are as many sub systems and mechanics as there are in the game that are awesome and work properly as there are that are awesome but dont work consistently! ive been really trying to get into scrapping as its kind of a weapons amber situation where you can still pilot around and explore and get your feet wet but not have to worry quite so much about getting wrecked when it means a restart.. which is great as long as your only hauling for other stations! if you try to build your own scrap station you realize that the auto salvage function doesnt work 80-90% of the time! the manticores have brain dead ai as far as dropping off the scrap... and the logical overview subsystem is massively flawed and doesnt give you propper control in a well organized way over the storage and production function over the scrap process! which is made all the worse by the games lack of optimization in general!
now for the pros...
1- amazing amount of well designed content from ships to base building
2- absolute and complete freedom to delve into whatever aspects of the game ends up being your favorite!
3- for the most part the AI do a very good job of micromanaging tasks you deem menial allowing you control of your play through!
4-ABSOLUTELY KILLER VISUAL AND AUDIO WORK! i mean they knocked that out the park!
5- regardless of where you start the story is actually on par with final fantasy with a stellaris genre approach in that its up to you how things go... for the most part xD",1556249928,1703035168,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Space graphics are nice, stations are expansive, but it runs like utter dogshit. Station NPCs look and behave horribly. You look at this game and think ""I'm gonna be a trader"", but then you find out how few trading resources there are and that very few stations actually trade them. You say ""I'm gonna be a star magnate"", and manage a fleet of economy ships, but then discover that it takes ages and ages to train captains to enable basic AI scripts.

You see 4 story DLC expansions and think ""This game sure has lots of great content"", well think again, audio dialogue in this game is possibly the worst in any game ever. That's not an exaggeration, this game would be 100x better with just text. Take, for example, the very first main mission in one of the expansions, something that must have gone 100 times through QA. In this mission, there is some bland dialogue about piracy, except it is delivered in sentences 5 words long. There are several second pauses between the sentences and each is followed by the same annoying static sound. The voice actor has a low-quality microphone and delivers in a bland monotone. There is no cohesion between the sentences either, it's like they were read out of order from a piece of paper. It's like they hired someone on Fiver and sent them the script randomly sorted. You can't skip the dialogue and it is read excruciatingly slow. It's like this in every mission. Sometimes you even get a completely different voice actor in the middle of the mission. Many times the script makes no sense, like parts were cut out.

Also worth mentioning is that you start the game without a map and you need to go through sectors to discover even the basic things like trade hubs. This makes restarting the game extremely painful because you need to do this same boring activity every single time. But at least that's partially fixable by mods, unlike the audio.

The only thing that is better than alpha quality is the shooting and spaceship control. If you wanna shoot some shit, sure play this. If you think you will have fun with any other system that this game promises, think again.",1702969285,1702970313,False,4,0,0.50178074836730957,0,True,False,False

Stay away from this game! It will suck you in and devour your life!!! 

Whilst the below still holds true, this game is phenomenal and, if you give it the chance it deserves to come to terms with its quirks and oddities (which I finally did), you will find possibly the greatest space-sim available. It is mainly a sandbox where you can choose to follow your quest-line or build up an economic empire that funds a war-machine able to lay waste to the galaxy. Or just fly around shooting people with bad colour-schemes or who fly badly. It's your choice, and it's done beautifully. 

Personal recommendation - you CAN make friends with almost everyone, but its a lot more fun to have an enemy. Pick a faction. Annihilate them. Work to destroy them and their allies. Cackle gleefully as you invade their home system and obliterate their shipyards with an armada. It's kinda a rush...

A terribly clunky management UI, even for X games, but still a great entry to the series. If you liked the other X games or Elite then this wouldn't be a bad purchase. With crystal mining, crafting, missions, and general battlefield scavenging you can get some start-up cash a lot quicker than in the previous series entries without having to trade in piddly little amounts of something; you can get a reasonable ship to do what you want to do (trading, mining, or combat) within an hour or two of gaming.

The modding community and support is great as there has always been a dedicated community creating custom ship models and tools for the game adding good replay value.

There was no federal bank to bail them out, so it was a sweep from the Xenon into The Void. Then I build a dumb Hull Parts factory in the region next to Argon Prime, and I literally cannot invest enough money into it to keep up production because the materials needed to build the station and then increase its production is at max infinitely. I literally just abandoned the Argon to their fate and joined the Terrans. Ironically, their closed economy is what saved them. I actually started capturing and buying mediocre Terran and Segaris ships, and would sell them to Argon. They managed to hold Hatikva using said ships for a little while but they eventually got obliterated by the HOP and Xenon. This was maybe 20 hours into the game, which is hilarious.
I used a cheat to see all of the factories on the map and I shit you not, there were maybe 3 or 4 Energy Cell producers in the entire Argon, Antigone, and Teladi alliance, and two of them were in a region with less than 50% sunlight.
I'm just embracing the chaos at this point. There's no point. The Universe is doomed to fall to sentient farming tools.

Edit: My feelings still stand. The game has fun in it, but so much of it is exploiting broken game mechanics in order to become unstoppable. Which makes sense, but it also feels cheap. It feels less like a sandbox at times, and more of a race to defeat the Xenon. Once that's over, sure you can conquer the other factions, but there's really no benefit to it since most of the time they're already fighting eachother instead of the 2 destroyer invasion fleet that somehow wiped out half of Argon or HOP's systems. The game genuinely feels like unless YOU take full control of the situation, then the entire universe collapses.
That's not a sandbox, that's just another power fantasy. You can play a Bethesda game for a similar feeling, aka Starfield or even Morrowind.
The interactions that factions have are so basic that I feel that the game might as well not have bothered having them. It's all the same objectives, with different coats of paint. Do missions, trade the same 3 resources which almost nobody ends up investing in (Energy Cell's, Hull Parts, and even Silicon Wafers somehow), then watch as the world around you gets destroyed due to the AI just not knowing how to prioritize fighting against their neighbors for a dumb sector that has nothing in it, vs a literal hive mind of murder robots.
Actually, that last part is pretty damn accurate to real life.

So I say this with a pinch of salt.
There's fun to be had in this game. It's expansive, the gameplay loop is fun once you get the hang of it, and it's a very rewarding experience overall.
I do enjoy my time playing this game so far, but there are a lot of issues still present in the game that takes me out of it. It just doesn't feel as polished as X3, which is saying a lot to be frank.
The biggest issues so far, is the clunky AI, the braindead autopilot feature, the really tedious and ugly on the station sections, the lack of compensation for actually helping sectors push back Xenon, and the weird clipping problems. On more than one occasion, I'd just clip right through an asteroid or station. Granted, you shouldn't hit object, but I figured that autopilot wouldn't fly me at 4k meters per second into an asteroid or trading station. I marked a guiding point to go from Black Hole Sun to Second Contact. It's literally a super highway jump, then a gate jump. The autopilot took me to Grand Exchange, then wherever the nearest point of contact is to reach the highway that travels around the universe. It dropped me off at Pious Mists then Autopilot turned off.
I've never even been to that sector before.
Another time it took me from Grand Exchange to Silent Witness to get to Argon Prime... I started at Second Contact.
The AI is really bad overall too. You'd be fighting a Xenon destroyer that is threatening a sector, and you can just... camp a blindside to one by one destroy the destroyers shields, engines, and turrets. Which thank god you can because otherwise the Xenon would just obliterate everyone.
So let's say you spend about 10 minutes or so chiseling away at a destroyer. Well even if you did most of the work/damage, unless you get the last hit on it before it blows up, the owner of the sector doesn't give you any compensation for saving their asses. Even if it's just 50k, which is pennies in this games economy. Hell, I'd accept a subscription to the Nostrop Oil of the month club. If I had actually brought my fleet in and destroyed the dumb ship legitimately, I don't even think I'd even get anything for it.
Yes in lore the Xenon are a menace that needs purged, but in the same vain, I'm also risking the lives of my crew to destroy a threat that Argon or the Teladi should be able to deal with 20 hours into the game. If I can get a fleet together that quick THIS early in the game with barely any guidance, so should one of the factions that already has a head start lol. I also shouldn't ""accidentally"" clip into said destroyers whenever they decide to make a 180 degree turn in 2 seconds.
Lastly the on-station sections are pretty damn bad. They're just so clunky and unneeded. The world feels so small and pointless. The only people that exists on these trade hubs and bustling communities are 3 or 4 weird looking people with afros. I'd have just skipped the on-foot section development and focus on actually making good looking models for the profile shots when communicating to other ships.

Overall it's just a very rough game coming from 2018. While it's a fun game when all of the systems work, it's a very frustrating one when you spend 20-30 hours on a game and you realize that no factions actually invested in freakin solar power plants, so you need to somehow acquire one of THE MOST hot commodities in the universe to start producing them yourself because the Economy AI is more focused on building ice refineries in The Void.

and a 10 is: my wife left me - i think.. and i don't remember if we had any kids.

The good:
It is a sandbox game, you can do what ever you want. Pirating in a small ship, or/and raise to a space mega corp with shipyards pumping out your own battleships every minute to delete all life in space. If you can imagine it, you can do it. 

Every expansion gives you campaigns you can follow, almost all of them have two ""endings"". Usaly a good and a not so good ending for the faction you ""help"". You can be friends with everyone, selling them your goods, while your decisions made the universe burn, or turn the universe in an utopia, where almost everyone is happy and turns their focus against the Xenon. The Xenon are the evil AI gone out of control.

The game works. The graphics are ok and sometimes it even feels epic, when a fleet of yours, with all sort of ship sizes opens fire on the enemy. I allways loved in X games how the different weapon types look. Big plasma guns fire slow moving balls of destruction, that almost gently ""float"" toward the enemy unleashing havock on impact, while smaller guns look like machine gun fire while trying to hit those pesky smaller ships. All ships are modular, so you can tinker the ships to your liking.

You can automate almost everything in the game or go with a more hands on approach. Me personaly like the megacorp play style. Constructing one single ridiculously big factory that is self sufficient and supplys the hole universe with replacement ships. Sitting in my chair at home feeling like i own this universe. But you maby like to be a free roaming pirate ""gang"" fighting for everything you own - it's your sandbox, who am i to judge.

Base building is fun, when you learn how to do it and you can go nuts with your creativity.

The Bad:
While this itration of the game looks modern, a long time follower and player of x games will see, that not much has changed in the background of the game. It feels like an Excell chart is controlling what is happening. So do the menues look. Excell chart on top of another excell chart. No drag n drop, almost nothing that makes your life easier to control your empire. It is better then previous X games but its often a chore to navigate all the menues find things or change things that should be quick and easy.

Sound: im sitting here and scratching my head thiking, where there any soundtracks in the game? Sure i remember gunfire and explosions, but not if there where any songs (there are). There is not ony piece of sound that stayed in my head. That might be a good thing, when you think that the sound didnt distract me, but in contrast at least once a year i open Youtube to listen to Homeworld OST.

And the thing i like the least is, there is never a feel of urgency. No crysis you have to fight, no invasion you have to defend against, sure there are the Xenon but ata  point in the game you just steamroll your overpowered fleets over anything the univerese has to offer. At some point in the game the biggest danger is that the autopilot rams your taxi ship into an object and ends your life, while you where doing something else.

Still - this is a good game with allot of value and replayability, if you are ready to invest the time to learn the controls, watch some youtube videos on stuff you don't figgure out yourself and if you have time to waste.

If you like sci-fi and spaceships i bet you will like X4. 
I can recommend this one, X3 on the other hand cost me some grey hairs and felt like a love/hate relation.
X4 was nice from the start and got better with every expansion.

That's amazing to see the scale of battles, modularity of the ships and of course economy, building, management.
You creates your own empire from scratch!
Devs built a really great game and really like it more than ever. The community provided great mods like VRO and fixes.

My only wish for team to work on game quality of their AI. Ships don't know about fear and threat, or all interceptors will go docking randomly in the middle of the battle stacking nearby your carrier making them perfect targets, while docking takes forever. Or your ships accidentally fires friendly NPC and last will try to punish you hard by killing everything you bought playing for hours. I think most of the things could be simplified by giving the control to the players or some functionality could be configured globally.

P.S> I'm playing through GFN and some mods are not working for me, whenever some more important mods are not available on Steam.

X4 is a space trading game. The game gives you a spaceship to slowly build up your economy and create a vast space empire. The economy is closed so everything you buy and sell goes in to making ships and stations, every resource that has an in eventually has an out. The economy has small parts that are in flux where you can start to carve you your fortune and build up your fleet. Once you start building up your own empire you can start to create a closed loop where you build out your full supply chain and construct ships yourself. Eventually you don't need credits and you'll start to fully run your empire entirely on your own logistics. Most of this stage is great, when you get to the point where you know you need to stamp a trade station within 3 jumps of your network to facilitate goods moving about it feels like you've solved a puzzle that unfortunately the game fails to reward. 

The friendly AI is really bad, when you start building up your trading posts to deliver goods between stations, you'll start to notice your ships will fill up with very little goods. I tend to find after ten minutes I'll need to simply have all my traders dump cargo when they are only filled with 3 energy cells and are piddling about failing to take goods that are sitting in storage to where they are sorely needed. You have to do so much manually that you tend to stop in the middle of huge battles to do your taxes and toil away fixing your empire's failed logistics. 

337 hours but I just can't recommend this right now, the friendly ai is awful, the load times are bad, you have so much ""Commute time"" that you don't really get to enjoy the game. Large enemy ships explode and if you send your fleet to attack it, that's it for your fleet. Most ships work infinitely better when you are loaded in a completely different area. The mechanics are finicky, break often, and when they do work the game is more ""Chore"" than game. 

The saving grace is this game is pretty, I don't know if that really makes a difference, but every so often I get lured in by it and play for a while, just to remember how bad it is after a few hours. If you are looking for a fun space sim, there isn't much elsewhere to look, but this one just doesn't accomplish enough to make playing it not feel frustratingly slow and pointless.

Edit: I played another 30 hours since the review, I still want this game to be good, but the shipmate AI is still incredibly frustrating and losing hours of work because you looked away and the AI decides to just give up makes this game still not worth a purchase at full price.

Sandbox space industry trade and combat sim.  You're definitely not here for the plot.

You can't watch the space battle cutscenes, because you can be instantly targeted and annihilated while they're happening.  This happens a LOT because you spend ages looking at trade menus and maps while you're on autopilot.  Is this your fault?  Nope, it's called game design.

You'll want about 2 to 3 dozen mods, most likely.

Pros
- Fun dogfights and/or fleet battles you can watch and/or fight in
- How you play is entirely up to you
- New games are customizable so you can test out mechanics, ships and stations before you commit to a playthrough
- Trading isn't as complex as Eve Online since supply and demand is visible to the player if you invest in information gathering
- Ship designs based on species are distinct

Cons
- AI will be frustrating and is one of the topics you will be googling for with this damn game. Honestly, Egosoft has Bethesda Games Studio beat.
- This game loves to waste your time with obscure mechanics, poor AI performance and pathfinding.
- For some reason, Egosoft made it difficult to supply materials for building a station even if the station is the one providing them. The station DOES supply its (for some reason) separate build storage but it is random and you are not told how it actually works, only that it does. Good luck waiting for that to happen because like all things in this game, you will spend most of your time waiting for things to happen. It may take 10 mins, maybe 20. The best part is, you don't know how many materials are being transferred each time so good luck planning anything out. As they say, if you want it done right, do it yourself and that rings true in this game. Manually picking up resources from a station and manually dropping it off is the fastest and most efficient way.
- Combat AI against enemy ships are okay for the most part. The problems with combat in my playthroughs come from attacking a station. I found that the best way to destroy one is with overwhelming force with a full battleship fleet. Anything smaller will get badly damaged or destroyed, S-M class ships will just die for obvious reasons but L-XL class ships will stumble around and let the station get free shots in while you will never get them to fire their main guns most of the time unless you micromanage them. Imagine inching slowly towards a station to get into firing range and pray that they don't misalign themselves and like a child with ADHD, chase a space butterfly somewhere everyone else doesn't see. I've lost most of my ships this way. If your game needs mods to fix a core function of the game, you did a horrible job.

- The UI provides alot of information while also telling you nothing important. When I want to look for a specific trade good, I want to see all available offers and their locations. All this game gives you is the cheapest one available(out of several spread across the whole map) as the one that is visible and you have to zoom in and check individual sectors to find out more. Then when you go to buy some, you get a bloody scroll bar instead of a type box which burns more time. Yes you can click on a tiny spot on the damn bar but IT. IS. TINY. Also, it doesn't work like a normal textbox so you will make mistakes entering the amount you want. We have had so many trade simulation games that came out, there is no excuse. X4 has 3 prior games.

- Turret targeting is lacking in options but at least they are simple enough that they work better than the AI's piloting and shooting skills even at 5 stars. I found that moving a battleship bristling with turrets works better than a ship with their main guns.

To summarize, in the current year of 2023, do not buy this game. Back when I bought it, it was a unique game with very few competitors. Now there are other games to choose from like No Man's Sky to scratch your itch for space exploration, Eve Online or other similar games for a trading simulator or Star Citizen for a simply better space sim. The lack of QoL features are frustrating mechanics in this game made up the bulk of my time spent in this game.

Just in case you were wondering why someone would both give a negative rating and then run up 1000+ hours in it, that's why.  I played the vanilla game for maybe one day before nearly uninstalling it, then discovered SWI and ran up every other hour of gameplay under that mod.  Heck, I've even bought the DLC just keep compatible with the mod and I've literally never played [i]any[/i] of the DLC as vanilla.  I don't even know what's in them, only that it needed them for SWI and frankly that was acceptable to me.  It really is that good of a mod.

Vanilla game is as follows:

I remember walking into a Babbage's as a young teenager and picking up a box for a game that I had never heard of: ""X - Beyond the Frontier.""  I installed it, played it, enjoyed it.  It was unique.  It was original.  It was fun.  The special effects were lacking (it was the 90s, what do you expect?) but the gameplay was solid and the story entertaining.

That was about 35 years ago or so.  You had your ship and could upgrade it.  You could trade and make a profit.  You had to fight the Xenon mothership to win.  That was it, and it was fun.

Then they expanded on it - now you could have [i]different[/i] ships.  Then they extended it more - you could own stations!  Then they had this crazy idea to make it so that you could plug stations into each other with tubes that was great in theory and a complete mess in practice.  This was the first omen that the peak had been already reached and it was all going to be downhill from there.  The next game, ""X - Let's Pretend This Game Didn't Happen"" was so terrible that it nearly ruined the company.  Luckily, X3 Terran Conflict came out and there was now a glimmer of hope, again.  That spark would last a long time, all the way until the release of X4, but a spark is sadly all it remained and now it, too, is gone.

Today I found myself looking at the bloated pile of spaghetti programming called ""X4: Foundations"" and wondering what the hell happened.  It was like going from Gene Roddenberry to Jar Jar Abrams.  All special effects and zero substance.

They've had literally [i]decades[/i] to work out their UI.  They've had decades to flesh out and expand the story, yet in all that time all we've seen is ""... and then the Terrans showed up and there was a brief war and then it was over and everything went back to normal.""  They've had decades to come up with a consistent weapons/damage system, only to have it change with every new iteration entirely.  They've had decades to fix the horrifying discrepancies between the way things perform in the bubble around your ship and the way it works in the background of other sectors.  They've had decades to decide what ships are supposed to look like and yet that, too, changes with each new game.  They've had decades to give their factions three-dimensional personalities and yet they're just as flat today as they were in the 90s.  They've had decades to find voice actors who don't sound more artificial than the mannequins that they're representing.

What motivates the Khaak?  What do they look like?  What are the long term plans of the Xenon?  What is the name of the Boron monarch?  Why did the Split become horribly racist caricatures of the Japanese?  How did we go from capital ships having jump drives to personal teleporters being something that has yet to be invented?

Egosoft has created a universe and given it a sprinkling of a background, but they forgot to give it a story.  And what's worst of all is that every new iteration of the game has just made it bigger, clunkier, emptier and less complete feeling... while every patch within this iteration just makes the whole thing less stable and run worse.

Obviously in these past 35 years or so I imagine that all the original developers have long since moved on or retired, and what were seeing now is the new ""vision"" of a whoever inherited their positions.  I suspect that is the core these issues - because that means retraining & relearning of a younger team that probably weren't as interested in what was already there as they were in doing their own thing (see Roddenberry vs Abrams, above).  I could almost forgive that if their own thing was actually interesting or, at the very least, properly executed and ran at more than half the framerate of games with thrice the graphical glamour.

And when you look closely at the flaws you can see the fingerprints of those people who made ""The Game that Shall Not Be Named"" on them.  It's as if they're still so bitter over the failure of their own grand dream of what they wanted to turn the X franchise into failing so miserably that they've decided to stay on board the team just so that they can sabotage this latest project out of sheer spite.  The grandiose, yet completely empty and pointless walking around in stations.  The data leak scanning.  The inane plots that pass for a story.  These all smell like the ideas of that one person they want to fire but can't for some reason, shoved into the design meetings and implemented just to pacify them and their need to make everything suck just a little bit more.  Like the owner's idiot nephew or something.  You know the type.

At any rate, watching this franchise over the years had been interesting yet sad.  It's been like watching someone take a balloon, painting some kind of grand art piece on it, and then slowly inflating it over many years.  As it grows, the art stretches, thins, cracks, and turns into a ugly, distorted farce of what it originally was.  Then thin layer of matter holding in the air inside get thinner and thinner.  Leaks form, then tears, and now the only question is whether this franchise will all just explode under it's own bloat or just deflate away with a depressing farting noise.

And therein lays the core of it all: It's been expanding like a balloon rather than a machine.  Instead of planned, measured parts being carefully grafted on after being weighed against the whole mechanism we are just seeing more and more untested (and oft unwanted) [i]stuff[/i] randomly shoved inside, swirling and crashing around inside without rhyme or reason, and causing the whole thing to expand just a little more closer to that breaking point.

And couldnt even fly around. X3 was far better than X2, but still... I couldnt get warm with it. Now we have X4, and damn, it feels like what I promised myself by take glance on glance on glance on X2`s package (yeah, I watched longer onto these purple pink package than what I have played the game...). X4 could make these little 12y old boy feel like the promise, never made by anyone than my phantasia, by myself, was heared by the devs and so they wrapped a game around my wishes. Without to know that I exist and what I wish.

I wonder why its listed as Sandbox, cuz there is a Main Story and for nearly every faction in this game there is a ""Main.Factionstory, long with ""Sanbox Missions"", no, not sandbox... Its more like auto generated missions.
Its very entertaining, many different mission, many main plots for the factions and a main story for you, the human player.

(I cant tell to much, im just at the Start. In these games you wont make it anywhere in 60h. I buyed just one h ago my first medium ship. Now ive got a `fleet` with this corvette and 2 eklipse hunters. And you can become as big as any of the other factions. You can build giant spacestations, rule sectors. Or just scale it down and be a pilot (you can buy pilots, infact, every ship needs one, if you dont steer it) and do dogfights all day. Its... big...
Thank you.

(For now, hour 115, im still satisfied to the max I havent encountered any bugs so far. Everything ""strange"" like ships dedock and leave me alone on a station, was not a bug but a feature of the game. You can place a pilot in every ship and give him orders, still you can take over control and fly where you want. But as soon as you get up from the pilots seat, your hired pilot will take back control of the ship. If his order is to fly to system x to fleet z he will do this. And leave you alone on the station. Anyway, you can order him back. No need to reload, as some others told in the comments.
Another ""strange"" thing are jumpanomalies. They can led you one time to system x, But when you try to get back to system a, where you jumped from, you are at system b. ok, a bug. just jump back and forth again. Ok, now we are in system y and get to system c. Why its not strnge, when you think about: Its an anomaly, not stable. I think they are pretty much the same power what let jumpgates work. But the gates are constructed around anomalies to fix their countersystem. Without gates its just a unsteered anomaly, capable of bring you to any point on the galaxy, as long as there is another anomaly. I like it. Its not an annoyance, it a migthy tool for discovery. Most of the time you get to a system where you can enter a highway and get home. Not that much of a hassle.

What I also want to place here: I wonder if Star Citizen ever will get finished, but until that, X4 is what comes closest to it. In fact: For now X4 is the leading title, along with ED: Horizons. Super gfx, super feeling, visually realy good presented. And... ill bet: b4 SC is finished, Egosoft makes X5 and maybe even X6 and hell, they will be superior over SC, if C Rob wont hurry.)

So... Thank you again, Egosoft.",1700845294,1701967222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Back then, I had always wished for a modern remake of the old C64 classic ""Elite"", and I stumbled across this one purely by accident.  I happened to see a brief mention of a game called X-Tension.  Looking for it, I discovered it was no longer available in America, but I COULD order a CD of ""X-Gold"" from Germany... so I did!  Absolutely amazing in 2002.  Played it on the VGA projector at work, and was hooked.

In 2023, X4 is a lot more complex than it was back then, and of course the graphics are much better, but it retains that feeling of being a real spiritual successor to Elite, more so than Elite Dangerous, in my opinion.  Being able to build up a massive empire, to focus on trade, or mining, or combat as you like.  Having the choice to join different factions and fight for some and against others, or just be a pirate and take what you can from everyone.

It's not normal to search the internet to see if the situation you're in is a bug or just the game is so ridiculous. But in this game it is standard.

Do you like sandboxes? Do you like grind? In this game you can waste tens of hours for nothing. 
And the other tens of hours just reading online what, where and how to do in this game.

Continuation...
So after all this you try to play. And you have to look on the Internet how to complete various missions and tasks, because the game does not explain it in any way. Then you waste an hour or two on single mission that simply turn out to be unsolvable. Is this a bug? Who knows? Probably yes, but it's normal in this game to waste an hour doing something that can't be done.
Then you do more missions. Missions from the main plot. Can such missions be incomprehensible? After all, they were prepared by developers, they are not generated automatically, everything should be correct. You have dialogue in the game and they should tell you what to do. Well, no... they won't tell you. You have to search the Internet again for how to complete a mission and where to go. Because the game won't even tell you how to do it or shoud you do it, it won't tell you what to pay attention to. Absolutely nothing. 

Like ""help the ship that is in the hazardous zone."" Where is this zone? Where is this ship? How exactly to do this? When to do it? You won't learn any of this in the game. I spent half an hour(Because how much can you look on the Internet? This is the main mission, it must be obvious, the creators probably don't mock the players that much) looking around to see what and where this hazardous zone was. Is that the cloud? Is this another cloud? Are these asteroids? Is it different? It is unknown. Search and ""have fun"" in the annoyance. Fly around everything around until suddenly your HP starts to drop so you found ""hazardous zone."" Because what you flew towards is more dangerous. Why? I don't know. That cloud seemed more dangerous, but it is some green stones things on some asteroid around other asteroids. Who knows?

This game is one big frustration, waste of time, irritation and constant checking on forums what doesn't work and why. What to do and how to do it, what to do it and why, why to do something and what. Srsly.

Five years after release I try the game again. The glaring bugs have been patched, and some useful tutorials have been added. But however much I want to like this game it is still very poorly designed. The pathing AI is absolutely atrocious, I've never seen such poorly implemented pathing. The AI will literally just fly straight at things, then stop, and spend 15 minutes trying to go around whatever it is only to find another thing they can't get around. The automated AI... *sometimes* works, but usually not, meaning you spend all your time micromanaging your fleet instead of flying your ship. Even when you tell them to do nothing, they will often decide to go dock at some remote station on the other side of the galaxy in enemy territory. The ship physics just don't make any sense (Speed limit? but only sometimes?) none of the factions produce the correct goods to support themselves as if they are all failed start-ups, not multi star-system governments, and you get almost no information on buy/sell rates of goods (you literally have to go through things one line at a time, while also having the map zoomed in to just the right area of space.) despite the game being literally about trading.

This game is absurd, but the sad thing is that it could be so much better but it isn't.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLD REVIEW:
Words that come to mind:
Early Access, directionless, broken, buggy

After buying and loading up the game I get to the main menu.
My cursor is in a constant state of moving the the bottom of the screen.
Turns out there is a virtual cursor control bound to one of my analog wheels on my HOTAS by default. I unbind it after 4 attempts at finding a key that unbinds the control instead of exiting the configuration menu.
I start a new game. I find myself on a barren series of of pads, I rebind all my FP controls because they are all broken.
I get to the tutorial menu and skip the first one because it's about rebinding controls. I go to the landing pad one. It tells me to ""Find a Trader"" I walk around this gigantic place for a good 15 minutes looking at every person a come across, none of which are traders. I finally find a building with a shopping cart icon above it... on the other side of a wide chasm. I find an elevator and walk my ass all the way over to it. Success! Now ""Find a work bench."" Oh... its on the other side of the station... walk walk walk walk... OK, tutorial done.
Flight basics! Get into my ship, it flys straight down and clips through the station immediately. I spend another 45 minutes rebinding flight controls and the tutorial doesn't actually say anything. Ok, I'll try the next one. ""Enter scan mode."" I do it. ""Exit this menu"" I do it... then nothing. Ok... now what?
At this point I figure I'll just play around without the tutorials for a bit. I know flight sims, so I figure I'll fly around and get used to the controls. The targeting is over simplified, having to use my mouse to actually pick something specific (By the way, that cursor never leaves your screen.) rather than cycling through dozens of targets, and it dawns on me. I have no information on how this game works, no missions, no way of knowing how to get a mission, and I realize I just don't care. I don't want to fight with this broken-ass game to witness an increadibly complex but ultimately masterbatory space sim.
RETURN REQUEST.

_______________________________________________________________________
*old review*
This is a game launched in 2018, i bought it in 2023 and i shudder at how bad this game must have been at launch. 

Im used to fixing ... questionable design choices with mods since i also play fallout/skyrim etc. 

But in this game i surrender. Pilot / Trade / Explore / Fight / Mine / Steal / Build / Command / Think are the keywords in the trailer and let me tell you. 

Pilot - many ships all can be bought or captured and they look good. 
Trade - trading yourself works fine, if you plan to trade with AI traders get a mod that enables autotrade. 
Explore - a lot of systems that all blend together after a while save for a few noteworthy and beautiful systems. 
Fight - fighting is fine, customise your own ship and wreck enemys however you please. 
Mine - if you want more money try this instead of trading. Get a mod that enables automine. 
Steal - do you enjoy staring at enemy ships after you disabled all their turrets and engines? i hope you do because you have to blow the engines up again when they repair. Even with hundreds of marines it can take quite some time to capture a single ship.
Build - building stations and ships is nice, now you can actually control in which direction your station parts rotate. (after 5 years). 
Command / Think - my biggest problem with this game. You can command anyone and anything but everyone in the galaxy beside you is braindead. The AI likes to suicide, even with plasma turrets and bombard setting you cannot let your cruisers unattended for even a minute. Most of the time it feels like you are responsible for a group of toddlers and they will find ways to kill themselves if you are not careful which is a shame. Fleetcombat looks beautiful and there is so much potential there but not even mods can fix the horrible AI in this game.

EDIT: Also, the game takes forever to do much of anything. Now, I'm actually okay with that on its face, so long as it's purely for immersion sake, BUT, and this is a big butt, things that are most frustratingly long are often things that are UNimmersive. Example? The navigation and AI in general. Even the most basic of tasks the AI will go about in the most inefficient, slow, and generally grating way possible. Let's say you tell your fleet to attack an enemy station in another sector. They will cross many light years without activating their FTL, go past the jump gate for no reason, circle back into the jump gate, and then slowly approach the enemy station, often ignoring any new enemies or attacking in an incredibly staggered or inconsistent manner, even if you micro to a painful degree

EDIT2: More examples of the poor AI is the Asgard. It has a giant death ray that can destroy enemy capital ships in LITERAL SINGLE DIGIT SECONDS, but does the AI use it? No. Well, it greatly prefers not to and instead uses its turrets which in some cases can never kill enemy capital ships

EDIT3: Also the mission/questing system is extremely inflexible for a sandbox game. If you do things out of sequence or alter the game state in any way, you're very liable to break things. Let's say a quest you have to talk to someone in a particular faction. Now let's say you become enemies with that faction which is easy and expected to happen. This ship is now invincible and out for your blood. Or let's say you're supposed to make contact with a long lost alien faction, but uh oh, you explored outside the rigid mission system and made contact with them already, too bad that you have to now pretend you never met them and go to random points in empty space for an hour first instead of just skipping that part

EDIT4: And the last thing that made me stop playing for good was how my ships would, some how, randomly and often, spur the ire of stations and factions that I'm capped out with (30 relations all licenses and titles, etc etc) and they will send death fleets against my trade ships and my main station over it. This is despite setting all my ships to DEFENSIVE ONLY for said factions.

I truly believe the X series has finally arrived in X4: Foundations, and it's very stable - which means it'll suck you in.  This is very worth your time and effort.  It has all the economic mechanics found in the previous games in the series but now with more immersion in the gameplay.  You can still control your fleet and stations from the universe map but now you can actually walk into each ship you own and pilot them.  As a flight sim game, X4 is a strong contender.  X4: Foundations really delivers a stellar game where your economic empire is exactly what you want it to be - supported with gorgeous visuals, immersive battles and exhilarating spaceflight.[/end-Update-2023]

X4:Foundations is the X game that has the ultimate potential to deliver the depth of immersion Egosoft has been aiming at for all these decades.  X4 is further in maturity by this time in it's lifetime than all other X games created thus far.  While there are a number of important and enriching elements missing that the X3 series delivered, X4 is quite notably a handsome offering.  Built from the successful engine of X:Rebirth (a game which panned in the community) and stripped and re-tooled with the goals of a renewed focus to employ the captivating aspects of X3, X4 is poised to deliver on what the community and ultimately the Egosoft dream of an enterprising spaceman ought to be.",1575325937,1701120090,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As with the previous titles (X3 in this case, which is more comparable to X4 than Rebirth is), it is a mixed bag, with it's upsides and downsides. And just like the previous titles, the game has gotten better over time since launch, although there are still problems you need to either work around or just deal with. Still, Egosoft is known to support their titles for a long while after launch, so hopefully things will keep improving.

After over 300 hours of play, with still plenty of things to do, I can safely say I recommend this title to anyone looking for a nice economy simulator with the occasional space battle mixed in. The skill curve in the X-series of games is more of a sheer cliff than a steady slope and that is true for X4 as well, but with perseverance this hurdle can be overcome.

For anyone new to the series, I would also recommend starting with X4 as I find this one to be more approachable when compared to previous titles (like X3). It'll still cause some pain to learn (probably) and involve plenty of frustration (isn't this the reason why people play games like Dark Souls?), but you can easily get hundreds of hours of entertainment out of this.

I had played Egosoft's games in the past, so I was forewarned what to expect. Thus, I invested ten hours into researching X4 Foundations. That was probably my first mistake. You do not just research an X game for ten hours before playing. Take two weeks minimum. Full time.

My game experience:

Step 1: Start random tutorial. ""Flying"". Sounds good. Guess in a space game knowing how to fly is king.
- After three minutes I cannot proceed, as the game does not provide what the tutorial's dev expected.
- I remember the fond times with X3 TC's tutorial, where where the tutorial told me to fire a gun you did not have, if you followed the tutorial. Hah, good times.
- Come on, I know how to beat Egosoft tutorials. So, I research more. Ah, there, I found a workaround to the tutorial's not-working part. Foundations proves to be stronger. As the workaround is not what the tutorial's dev expected, the tutorial does not progress either.
- I am strong. What is one malfunctioning tutorial to me?

Step 2: Start next tutorial.
- Get stuck again after a few minutes. This time the ship did not do what it should, although everything looks like it should be working.
- Research more: Check the keyboard configuration, you moron! Thank you, Shujin.
- Keyboard setup is as it should be. Thank you, Shujin.
- Still does not work.
- I abandon the second tutorial.

Step 3: Start third tutorial.
- I fell like being stuck in a running gag. Get stuck again after a two minutes.

Step 4: Refund.

Step 5, knowing myself: Return in 2021, hoping that three years after publication date at least the tutorials work. Bang my head against the wall, as they still do not. Forget to shutdown the game, while getting a bloody forehead. Steam refuses refund, as I played more than two hours. Well played, Egosoft.

Step 6: Thinking about trying to convey the idea of basic Quality Assurance principles to Egosoft. Die laughing. Not the worst way to go.

EDIT:

Step 7: Get comment from a dev, who confirms what I suspected all the time: We do not fix our game - where would be the fun in that? Instead, we create entirely new parts that replace the non-working parts of the game in our minds. The non-working parts stay in our game, obviously.
My comment: Yup, new parts which then turn out to work as well as the old parts: Not at all.


In 2023 I commented:

Step 8, three years later - I mean, they MUST have fixed at least the tutorials, right? No, they have not. They have created a new version of the flight tutorial that makes a very fine first impression and called it ""Flight School"". It works for around the first ten minutes, then another bug stops me from continuing. Still, ten minutes is longer than any other X4 tutorial took to go under. Judging by this development speed, the tutorials could work in a mere ten years.

Step 9: I give up, for good this time.

FFS, Egosoft, get a QA professional. Who understands how to do extensive automated tests. AND LET THEM DO THEIR JOB.

I wonder what those reviewer were drinking who claim that they had not found one bug in the game. And I wonder if I could ask them for liquor advice without sounding condescending.",1577534850,1701068772,False,1,3,0.472620069980621338,0,True,False,False

I never found a game that felt quite right as a next step for me. But X4 looked promising. I quickly realized it is much more complex than Freelancer. Imagine Freelancer combined with an RTS. A hybrid between Freelancer and Stellaris (a simplified Stellaris), perhaps.

X4 definitely has some flaws. Autopilot can crash you into structures so that you're stuck inside. I've been able to ""wiggle out"" each time, though. Autopilot seems to wiggle itself out of such situations itself if you give it time. AI is often frustrating. It's very frustrating to see multiple ships in your fleet move into enemy turret range while attacking a structure, only to be destroyed while you try to intervene. This seems to happen less frequently with more experienced captains, but it still happens with 3-star captains. The interface is complex and can be frustrating. But once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.

I would easily call this one of my favorite games ever. It's got cool ships and space stations. It's got space sim FPS combat. It's got RTS. It's got customization of ships and modular customized stations to build. It's got a bunch of factions to align with, fight with, trade with, or simply tolerate. I waited until the game was on sale to try it. Now that I know how good it is, I'd easily buy it at full price.

If you like the feeling of accomplishment when you have your first space station and see how it makes profits.

I'm a good 100+ hours into a playthrough and have built this giant factory consuming a decent amount of resources provided by automated miners and freighters who have to travel through several sectors in space.  It turned out that there was a single gate that most of my supply traffic went through, and an enemy battleship parked itself there and started destroying everything.  I couldn't take it on directly so I had to reroute and pause traffic before they got destroyed.  I baited the ship into attacking another NPC station while I ordered a torpedo bomber for $10M and moved my relatively small destroyers into place.  Using my travel drive to get up speed I did dive-bomb runs on the ships engines until it was disabled, and then moved my destroyers to snipe it from a safe distance.

So I had this cool little Destroy The Bismarck story just out of emergent gameplay in a sandbox, and it was really fun.  The reality of course is that it was punctuated by a fair amount of savescum trial and error, genuine frustration at my trader AI flying right up to the deathstar ship and taking my supply chain with them, and waiting around at 6x timescale for ships to get into place.

It takes the vast feeling of the X3 games and pairs it with some of the new mechanics that were somewhat introduced in X Rebirth. Even the music is in part a hommage to earlier works, so expect some unexpected goosebumps.

If you are new to the whole X-universe: 
Take your time to learn the basic mechanics, and take it slow. There is so much to explore - not only on the map. Especially the UI may seem confusing at first, but with time (and the helpful tutorials) you will learn and memorize the neccassary shortcuts, that you no longer feel inhibited by that.

For X-veterans: 
- Improved station building eliminates the frame dropping spaghetti complexes
- This iteration offers a wide variety of weapons and ships with the ability to further customize your loadout via mods/enhancements
- Watch out: IS- and OOS-combat is handled differently, so better readup this mechanic before somethin goes wrong
- Very unique starting scenarios can give you the needed spice if your deep run has lost some of its taste (or do a completely customized start)
- The lore of the earlier games is incorporated and in some way retold (bonus if you like the stories set in this universe)",1700846828,1700846828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Performance. This game does a lot behind the scenes. It is a fully simulated universe. It is a multi-core game, but I feel the simulation engine may need a rework as it tends to focus heavily on 1 or 2 cores, seemingly unable to share the main load to more than a single core (I'm sure there is a way, it probably just isn't easy and when you're a small studio, you need to budget time and resources appropriately).
- Character movement in stations/ships is basic, but lets face it, this is a space game, so you'll be spending most of your time flying your ships or looking at the map.
- AI Pathing could do with improvement. With version 6.00, the flight system was reworked, which led to ships colliding/bouncing off of each other more, even seeing ships spinning through space, attached to each other. This is constant work in progress and each patch improves on things.

Pro's:
- Beautiful graphics and scenery
- Stunning music
- Diverse ships and weapons
- Multiple play styles (Explore, Trade, Fight, Build, Think!)
- Can fly fighters, mining ships, trading ships, resupply ships, builders, carriers, and yes even battleships! If you can buy it or build it, you can fly it.
- Command entire fleets of ships, large and small and everything in between.
- You can build your own stations wherever you want. From defence stations, to factories, to resupply & repair, wharves, and even shipyards, you can build it all.
- Stations are modular, meaning that you can build and assemble in any way you want. You can make each and every station unique to your unique artistic style
- Fully simulated universe spread over a dozens and dozens of large sectors and systems. Each ship is built somewhere, and has its own tasks and orders (patrols, traders, miners, salvagers, pirates, etc). Every resource produced is used for something, with the ultimate end of the production line being a massive shipyard pumping out ships for you, your allies, and your enemies to fly.
- There are hidden ships, and treasures to explore and find as well as a mission system which has missions to suit everyone and all playstyles.
- Form your own faction, control your own territory, work with allies, destroy your foes!

One of my most played games EVER. I have played X series since it first came out. They have gone from pillar to pillar. People may complain of bugs, but you need to keep in mind, this game is made by an Indie developer and this game is vast. You'll see no Star Citizen budget here, folks. This developer won't bleed your bank accounts dry but they'll truly work hard for your money and release something good within decent time frames.

They don't have a large team, and the same person who created the series, still runs it to this day (praise to Berndt). It'd be a sincere tragedy if they were to ever sell out to a larger organisation.

The graphics are great, with the Boron expansion and the graphical improvements beautifully executed. Each expansion just makes the game better and better but with each expansion comes a patch that also improves the original game, including reworked ships from the original release.

Mod support definitely exists, but I'll confess I have barely touched Mods as the base game with the expansions provides plenty of hours of play. Each game you start, something different happens. A faction that may have performed poorly before, suddenly excels. A system that stood strong before, suddenly falls. And all because one capital ship or station that survived a skirmish last time, doesn't this time around. Could even be because that same station's supply ship was destroyed on route to deliver much needed supplies for repair.

With well over 4000 hours of playtime (and who knows how many with all the previous X games), I can definitely recommend this game and this series.

They wouldn't have stayed true to the original for this long if the team didn't love what they create. This game, nay, this entire series is a true labour of love.",1700798598,1700798598,True,2,0,0.514705896377563477,0,True,False,False

AI's not the best, but it's gotten better, and there are mods that can help.  Dev support in general has been great, they do take honest feedback and act on it, and the games just have gotten better as it's gone on.  The X series has been on of my favorites, and X4 is their best iteration.  Egosoft's games have generally hit the market pretty buggy, but their support to deal with bugs longer term has been one of the best in the industry.  

Note that the learning curve can be very steep given you do get involved in helping to restart a real economy.  There are quite a few guides out there that can help though.  My advice is to start small and don't worry about it, and then be surprised when you realize you've become a major powerhouse in the universe's economy. 

Thanks for the literal decades of fun, Egosoft.

When reflecting on the tiny size of the team behind it (a company of circa 20 people) it's incredibly impressive'

Don't get me wrong I think it still has a few flaws (some big ones) but overall I do love it. But they listen to community feedback much better than many large studios, and I'm excited to see where the X franchise goes in the future.

Pros: 
The environments are beautiful, to the extent that there are times when I will stop whatever mission it's on and just admire the view.
With the DLC now available the game feels like it has the scale needed to give you plenty to do explore and find.
Difficulty can be scaled by adding DLC one at a time, if you add them all in one go there’s no chance you’ll have time to hold back the Xenon horde, but if you want to live out your nihilistic annihilation fantasy just to see what if any of the galaxy you can save by all means whack them all on in one go to see just how OP their simplified economy makes them.
The devs have started adding beautiful new station interior elements so these now feel a lot less repetitive
The game breaking bugs all seem to have been addressed and stability is massively improved to the point I can’t remember the last time the game crashed so credit where it’s due to the devs.
User interface is improved and a number of new options have been added that make life much easier to automate behaviour of your fleets and stations. Again the devs having listened to players and put in ways of doing things that were previously arcane or absent.
I think it now strikes the right balance between doing stuff for you, and not making you obsolete through over automation.
More recent DLC ship designs are significantly improved.
Some really nice improvements to the visuals on the map and the AI seems to be less obsessed with everything being built on 2 spatial dimensions in an environment with 3.
There are now capabilities for ships to have a bombardment stance making station engagements less suicidal.

Con:
Character models can still do some funky stuff (necks really shouldn't move like that)
User interface still has some clunky elements that were clearly done via the engineering design school of “button exists, job done”.
Some combat ship designs have (IMHO) some really odd design choices for the M and S class ships, where I believe the designer was thinking about combat between fighter jets and not how space and 0 gravity fundamentally change the way combat and design for it works (please devs, watch The Expanse again and take design queues from that)",1640045078,1700734044,True,0,0,0.702625155448913574,0,True,False,False

With over 340 hours of gameplay investedat the time of this review, it's safe to say that this game offers an immense amount of content for players to sink their teeth into.

One of the most impressive aspects of X4 Foundations is its sheer scale. The universe is massive, with hundreds of unique sectors to explore, each with its own factions, economies, and secrets to discover. Whether you're a trader looking to make a profit, a pirate preying on unsuspecting ships, or a builder constructing your own empire, there's no shortage of opportunities to pursue.

The gameplay mechanics are complex, but rewarding. The economy is dynamic and ever-changing, with supply and demand driving prices up and down. Building and managing a fleet of ships requires careful planning and resource management. And the combat system is deep and satisfying, with a variety of ship classes and weapons to choose from.

In addition to the main gameplay loop, X4 Foundations offers a variety of side activities to engage in. You can join factions, take on missions, and even become a space station manager. There's always something new to discover, and the game does a great job of rewarding exploration and experimentation.

The graphics and sound design are top-notch, with stunning space vistas and immersive sound effects that make you feel like you're really there. And the game's modding community is active and creative, offering a wealth of user-generated content to enhance and expand the game even further.

Overall, X4 Foundations is an expansive and immersive space simulation that offers an almost overwhelming amount of content to explore and enjoy. With its deep gameplay mechanics, dynamic economy, and stunning visuals and sound, it's a must-play for fans of the genre. If you're looking for a game that will keep you engaged for hundreds of hours, X4 Foundations is definitely worth checking out, you can get lost in this game for hundreds of hours of enjoyment currently 737hrs in on my first playthrew still going strong",1683816250,1700649712,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

Because I think it's important to not lower your ""bar"" when market offers you second-class stuff.
I'm saying as an old space games fan, who play this kind of games since 1999. Wing Commander, Master of Orion, X:Beyond the Frontier.
Looking at the last decade, there were some space games, not bad, but sadly, not impressve eigher. One exception is Stellaris, I'm talking all space games. Other than that, the last space game I could call a good present for a space games community was Space Rangers HD (2013). [spoiler]Yes, I've played Elite Dangerous and monitored Star Citiezen. These are MMOs and aren't even count unless you're looking for a virtual job.[/spoiler]

I was skeptical about X4 at first, due to the lack of content and story. Because I never liked pure sandbox games without anything meaningful to do.
But now I'm convinced and bought the full package.

Running around on stations to get/deliver some fetch-missions is the right amount to comprehend the scales, to get the feeling one is not only a cockpit teleporting into other cockpits. It adds to the immersion. 

The 'RTS' style menus for controlling the fleets is a good step forward, but still quite clunky. Definitly needs some more work, but better than the mess of hotkeys I remember from X3.

So a youtuber I liked played the game and gave a guide on how to make money and get started. Liked his videos and went back to try it since I already bought it. Fell in love with it.
only real complaint is the very big guns are not stronger then normal turrets (annoyed about my destroyer) but the combat is based on skill more then equipment. The evil AI bad guys destroyer can easily blow up mine head to head but if I fly above it to avoid most of its guns on the bottom it can't even break my shield while I blow it up. 
Technically you can destroy big ships with a single fighter in a blind spot but you either need more guns and a lot of patience or you are not doing more damage then the shield regen an wasting your time.

Old review:

Tried it. Love games like Kenshi but it did not do it for me. Controls for flying are bad. No idea what to do or can do when start. Missions are very poorly explained (spent 5 minutes passing the point to launch a satellite as it was at the entrance of a highway).

It is more streamlined experience. X3 purists may not like it but I don't feel the game being casualized. More focus on trading and economic empire rather then warfare.
Pros:
- No game breaking bugs. At least for me. There are glitching animations and flying through solid objects but nothing that would make campaign unfinished
- Ship scale. It is amazing. Now ships actually feel like ships. Carriers are huge and if you walk on stations, even smallest ships feel big.
- Unification of ships and weapons. I liked it. Any ship can mount any faction turret if the size is compatible. 
- Faction reputation is less grindy now. War and trade missions are generous.
- Ship boarding is more streamlined
- Mod support. Egosoft has always been mod-friendly devs. X4 is no exception.
- Devs are friendly and lurk Steam discussions and Egosoft forums. They help when you are stuck or suspect a bug
- Great soundtrack
Cons:
- AI. Still not optimal. Still tries flying through solid objects.
- Every ship must have a captain hired. No more computer flying. Good news is that crew can now be transferred seamlessly.
- Game is not optimized. Flying can be 60FPS because your'e looking into the black space. Going to more busy space can drop to 30s. In stations it can drop to 20s.
- Dynamically generated space means that stations can't be completely destroyed in the entire sector. This also means that you never know when a new needed station pops up. I wish the game removes a fog-of-war with all faction's sectors after a certain reputation is reached.

I'm honestly so fucking pissed at the amount of time I will never get back from playing this game that I just can't be bothered to explain every little reason that this game is disappointing but the BIGGEST reason this game sucks is the AI.

This game has the absolute worst AI I have ever seen in a video game. Nothing else even comes close. It would not be such a problem is the game didn't rely on the AI 99.97% of the time. 
They won't follow orders, ever. They will not follow you on follow command, they will sometimes lineup with you when in a fleet formation but as soon as you start moving towards anything your friendly ships will reverse or fly in circles or not come with you at all.
All of the above means that combat is useless, and thus you have no real point to playing the game unless you want to just roleplay as a trader for some reason.
I finally got to the point where I had 9 destroyers, 3 carriers, 2 auxiliaries, 200 or so M and S ships and basically just alt-F4'd the game when I realized no matter what I did i could not get any of them to stop being completely fucking retarded and dying 6 seconds into any fight.

Couple all of this with having an extremely steep learning curve makes for a miserable experience. I spent more hours watching youtube tutorials than I did playing the game.

The devs will never fix the AI because they don't know how to, they won't make any sort of decent tutorial because why would they waste their time? All of these issues are brought up tens of thousands of times on their forum and have been for as long as they have been making games and they just dont give enough of a fuck about you to fix their broken game.

So in a nutshell this is a great idea with great graphics, its just a shame there are so many game breaking bugs as otherwise this would be easily the best game of its kind out there. There seems to be more focus on raking in money than fixing the fundamental flaws with the game. Ill list a few of the bigger ones:

1. As soon as you have a station, you really can't be in sector with it as it causes mayhem and ships stop docking or collide with each other that doesn't sort it self out until you leave the system. Pathing needs sorted.
2. The AI is pretty bad to say the least.
3. Fleet combat is not really a thing, you can only really do it from the map and not in sector or it just ends up a big mess with lots of ships dying unnecessarily. 
4. Although pirates have bases and systems they spawn in meaning you can't really defend against them. This makes using medium ships pointless.
5. The Ka'ak are a pretty pointless enemy that you cannot remove completely despite wiping them out, they will always respawn, the game needs a Ka'ak inhibitor or something as they are just such an annoyance that again make medium ships pointless.
6. Sending a ship after an enemy if they have to chase them is pointless, the AI takes them out of warp 10's of km early meaning by the time you get to them they have already moved on.

There are so many good points to this game its just sad that the bad aspects overshadow them. In summary I cannot recommend this game in its current state, it really needs some fresh experienced blood in the dev team in order to address these massive issues and make this game into what it so clearly has the potential to become.",1699952291,1699952291,False,143,6,0.768742501735687256,14,True,False,False

I was looking for a trading sim to scratch a particular itch I tend to get (business games) and I saw a video for this on YouTube. Being a veteran of other space sims such as Elite: Dangerous, Star CItizen and EVE Online, I decided it was most likely a safe bet that I'd get a few hours of fun from this.

Those instincts paid off, and in a huge way. X4: Foundations is a fantastic marriage of many of the best parts from Elite, EVE, SC, Stellaris, and other trading/production games such as ANNO, built cleverly into a sandbox RPG environment in which you can play in so many different ways. My first playthrough saw me start as ""The Young Gun"", and become a territory-owning CEO of a small star-empire. Rags to riches, through means of building ships, hauling cargo, fighting Xenon and selling spaceweed!

It's not without it's issues, of course; there are bugs, there's certain areas in which the game is lacking (voice acting is atrocious, and the UI is daunting to say the least), and there are so, so many things that the AI does that leaves me scratching my head, but this is an immersive, detailed, and satisfying game to play. And my GOD, it's such a time-vampire.

I've been stuck on the Star Wars mod playing as a Mandalorian warlord.

Be warned though, the game can be very clunky at times. The QoL mods help with that though. This is also a game that requires a very large time investment to really understand. It's got a decent learning curve. A single playthrough could take hundreds of hours.

At first glance you are just a small mote of dust amongst an ocean of activity. You have many roads ahead of you. Do you want to run a small pirate fleet from an abandoned sector? Run a trade empire? Become a tyrannical overlord? Or keep it low key and roam around with a small squadron. All of these are possible.

Yes, I'm still playing it because of sunk cost fallacy. But if you are not a victim to it yet, I do not recommend this game.

Don't get me wrong, the game is not entirely bad. But that is the point. It is a great concept and has great stuff in it. But then you will run into a bug or strange ai or something which will waste HOURS of your progress. Like your XL Ship exploding because it was stupid. Or your station gets completely borked because a random ship blocks its build storage. Or autopilot randomly headbutting the station several times, destroying your ship. Or AI ships destroying themselves on one Xenos Capital Ship because they don't comprehend going around it or something.

There is so much bullshit that can happen that it is just inacceptable. I would love for this game to be better so I could play and expand my empire.

Flying a ship in this game feels janky at first, but is incredibly fun once you get into it. I haven't commanded a full scale battle yet, but I can say that the dogfighting combat is leagues better than the combat in Starfield, NMS, and I'd even say Elite. Ship maneuverability/systems/hardpoints and pilot skill vary wildly, and it's not just diverting power from shields to weapons or engines, which gets boring and formulaic to me (Starfield, Elite). You actually get everything you put into your ship, and don't have to waste time choosing what system matters the most. If you don't like it, you can rebuild your ship or get a new one.

The exploration aspect of this game also hits the marks way differently than other space-faring games, in a great way. The atmosphere and art is great, the different regions of space vary wildly and there are genuinely beautiful vistas to discover. Space stations are huge and there is a lot of traffic going in and out, something I feel a lot of games miss. NPCs on stations look and sound dated and awkward, but it's easily forgiven considering the scope of the game. Sound design is great, I prefer to keep the music off as the environmental/ship sounds are awesome and sometimes creepy out in the middle of nowhere. UI is straight up bad in some ways but you'll get used to it or you won't.

let me get right to the one part that you should know before purchase. This game has THE DUMBEST/WORST/MORONIC AI in the history of games......EVER ! L and XL ship fly around in circles shooting them self's down, they back into enemy defence platforms and get shot down or get kitted around amongst a enemy fleet and help the enemy ship shoot them down, who ever designed it, they and there descendants should be banded from the game industry for ALL ETERNITY ! everything from fleet formations to instructions is a total cluster F@^*#% and completely broken/unusable. It needs throwing in the bin an redesigning from top to bottom. things like hold position an open fire, clearly isn't a concept at EGOSOFT or any experience when it comes to fleet AI's its SO BAD it makes the game totally NOT FUN !

If your not into the whole owning a fleet thing, which is sort of pointless in this game since it seems to be encased around the need for a few, then this game gets better, the graphics, the game play, the ship designs, the dog fighting, has become seriously fun but it does get boring after a while since there are limited tactics you can use due to mechanics.

now if you could just find someone who knows what they are actually doing with a Fleet AI you would dam near have not just a average game but an AMAZING game.
a few ideas, war table for better control on the bridges of L/XL ships, a lot more commands like hold position an fire, easier access to fleet and wing commands, etc etc, the list goes on. also a range limit on subordinate ships is needed so they don't get kitted away from the carrier ship an go suicide on a vastly superior target is REALLY REALLY need. there's just SO much missing from the Fleet AI and its parameter's and commands it begs the question "" if you forgot to add all this and though you where doing a good job at the time, what steps do you the programmer take when you forget how to breath ? controlling a fleet is like watching a monkey rub poo all over its face, amusing the 1st time for a few minutes but then you fell sorry for it and walk away.

My favorite part of the game is where you can ACTUALLY GET UP from the pilots chair and WALK AROUND YOUR SHIP WHILE IT'S FLYING. Even during combat if you promote a captain! 

Xpanded economy means you'll be busy learning to build an economy probably your first couple hours of the game. From mining, pirating, missions, stories, building stations, building fleets and hiring staff for your ships.

WISH LIST: That you can land on planets(build stations just like in space) after terraforming. Doesn't need to be the entire planet.. just maybe one area or something to claim, build, fight over. 

More RPG elements with comm and contact with NPC's.. apart from the story missions and controlling an empire it can feel lonely sometimes in the expanse of space without any real roleplaying outside of missions or not having anyone besides Bosa randomly trying to get a hold of you. 

Maybe first person shooter when boarding and taking ships but I know that would be a LONG WAYS OFF.

I see alot of time and effort put into X4, It really tries to emulate an EVE environment but has failed IMO.
EVE is a PC game and it works incredibly well in it's design. I loved playing it until the casual play area got to be just as toxic as the lawless fringes.

X4 tries to offer that experience without the toxic environment, but fails in it's design because the UI is a nightmare to navigate and extract information. It is an EVE and PC wannabee game, but fails because it is also trying to be a console game. It is just too complicated to be limited by the controls of a console. I desperately want to move and relocate windows, but they are locked because that would be very difficult with a console controller.

My enjoyment has been severely marred just trying to access information. Too many icons have no mouse over info. information categories make no sense to me. Why is all of my production info under the research icon? Assigning fleets is a PITA. I can't do it via a spreadsheet layout. I have to sit in map mode most of the time and physically move the map around and select the items I want to assign and then the item I want to assign it too?

X4 is exactly the type of single player game I crave to play, but it is marred too much by it's one size fits all design.

I'll give it a 6 / 10 and the 4 points missing are 95% UI hassles.

This highly ambitious title is the fourth in the X series and seeks to give the player the freedom to experience the universe at their own pace, with advanced character progression, ship trading and upgrading systems, and an impressive array of gameplay options.

Starting from the gameplay mechanics, X4 offers a seamless universe with an open-world environment where the in-game economy, politics, and trade are simulated in real-time. The player can assume the roles of traders, explorers, builders, and warriors, displaying a high level of gameplay flexibility. At the core of X4 are its deep and absorbing systems, which afford the player a sense of complexity and realism that is rarely seen in modern space sims. While being both detailed and sophisticated, it encompasses intricate trade, battle, and building mechanics which are interconnected and function transparently.

Ship combat in X4 is a meticulous experience, combining strategy and execution as players must consider not only their ship's armament but also its technological enhancements and crew. The strategic aspect is augmented by the AI's realistic response to different combat situations. While the combat system has a steep learning curve, the reward for mastering this complex mechanism is incredibly satisfying.

The game's exploration systems are equally impressive, providing players with a vast, dynamic universe to explore, filled with star systems, planets, and interesting factions. X4 encourages curiosity and exploration, ensuring that venturing into the unknown is always a rewarding endeavor. The progression system effectively supports the exploration facet: players gradually acquire new technologies, ships, and modules which further deepen the gameplay experience and offer fresh perspectives on exploration and combat.

In terms of narrative, X4: Foundations offers a non-linear story that centers around the player's choices, effectively contextualizing the open-world gameplay. The narrative is not as explicitly delivered as in some other games; it seeps subtly throughout your experiences and decisions while playing, which can be seen as a strength or weakness depending on player preference.

Visually, X4 is stunning, presenting a breathtakingly vast universe, rich with celestial bodies and technological wonders alike. Spaceships are intricately designed, cities thrive with life - culminating in a deeply immersive and visually appealing environment. The UI, while overwhelming at first glance, becomes an essential tool once accustomed - offering deep insights and control over your assets. However, it's worth noting some players have criticized it for being overly complex.

As for the cultural context, X4: Foundations continues a venerable tradition of detailed space simulation games following in the footsteps of titles like Elite Dangerous and No Man's Sky. However, it distinguishes itself with its emphasis on deep, interconnected systems, providing a comprehensive space simulation experience that few other titles can match. It sets a new standard for what players can expect in terms of free-roaming space exploration and empire management.

In conclusion, X4: Foundations is an exemplary entry in the genre of space simulators, defined by an unfaltering commitment to creating a sophisticated, immersive universe. It provides a gratifying and highly engrossing experience for those willing to delve into its complexity. It's not a game for everyone: its steep initial learning curve and sometimes overwhelming complexity can be daunting. But for those with the patience and passion for this type of simulation and immersion, X4: Foundations is a unique and rewarding journey into the far reaches of space.",1578280297,1699094625,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Patch it all you like Egosoft, it will still be garbage.

You cannot just pick this up and play. You need to learn it. Watch the tutorials - even they struggle. 
It is, however, incredible to dock on a moving ship and walk around as it transports you through space. Its stunning to watch and all the models are just amazing. 
Fairly limited to trading and mining but some settings are unintuitive and limited. Warfare is a bit of an afterthought.
If you love to micro-manage, you'll love this, but for me after 30 hours its not fun yet.

You hire a 2 star pilot ? Even a wild baboon can perform better. How much intelligence is needed to activate the damn travel drive 50 km from the destination ?

Need 20k hull parts somewhere ? lets tell that tiny hauler to do 30 runs - all manually each run click by click there is no way to tell that moron to move 20k from a to b.

Ship too damaged in battle ? They flee.  Could be good thing except they flee into enemy  instead of running away.
You can not set pirate faction to red You can not tell your combat ships to attack them on sight.

From the humble beginnings of flying around in small ships to sitting comfortably in your station while managing whole fleets of capital vessels, this one has it all. 
Goals are what you set (yes, you can follow storylines and quests, up to a point), and then maybe watch as your military-industrial complex takes over trade routes, helps strengthen failing empires and conquers system after system. 
Or just fly around testing each ship, steal other faction's blueprints and traders, and enjoy the sight in first person as 100 fighters are docking in the bay of your carrier.

Performance note: earlier game stages (owning a few small stations, small fleets) are smooth and FPS is stable, IS (in-system) fights are a blast to see and to participate. As your and the NPC faction fleets swell, the game starts to be CPU limited, so late-stage game often means sitting in a backwater station OOS (out-of-system) of the action, and managing your empire remotely to maintain a playable experience.

This game however, has numerous issues. The biggest one:

This game does not value your time. Everything you do happens in real time and takes time. For example, you want to build a station, you need resources. Someone will haul those resources for you, if you put enough money into budget, but. 

* Station is composed out of modules.
* They take time to build.
* To build those modules you need to buy blueprints.
* Which cost more money.
* Some of those are locked behind reputation. 
* Reputation takes a lot of time to raise unless you abuse certain in-game mechanic.

You see where it is going, I think. You build a station, you can end up waiting 30 real-time minutes for the NPCs to haul this stuff, then you'll wait more minutes for the build process to finish. To build BETTER modules, you'll have to grind, and to build best ships, you'll have to grind a lot. 

Basically, one of common way to amass sufficient amount of money is to set up the trade and leave the game running overnight, or do house chores while waiting. Which effectively turns it into an idle game. You could accelerate process a bit, by, for example, hauling stuff for your base yourself, but this has limited impact, and does not fully fix the problem. Because you can't manually accelerate build process, for example. 

Oh, sure, you can boost your bank account in the beginning, through various means, quickly reaching ten million credits or so. The issue is you'd want billions. And then it turns into a chore. Why would you want billions? To build the best ships. The cost of station, blueprints, resources, ships, everything. 

It does snowball eventually, but it is very slow, and your character can't just go to sleep and let the game fast-forward. Although it is not Eve online, so that's something.

The other issues are:

* The game is sector-based. While you certainly feel like you're in space, because you dock to stations, and can marvel at the scale of that meat factory you built, you don't quite feel like you're travelling between planets. It feels like some sort of abstract grid in strange 3d space. The map is organized as a grid, so the space feels like  that grid. And not like the sectors are based around star systems in different part of space.

* Visuals can be dated, especially characters and their faces. Space looks good.

* Devs appear to be progressively simplifying the game. See, in X3 one of the toughest things you could do was building energy cell factory and make it profitable and self-sufficient. Energy cells are used everywhere, but production of energy cells require materials, and to mine those materials you'd need energy cells. The factory had to loop, but it still had to produce enough cells to be profitable. Here, in x4... Energy Cells require no resources other than sunlight. They magically appear out of thin air, apparently. Something similar happened to the resources. At release time the economy was complex and everything required a ton of different components. To become fully self-sufficient you'd need to craft a ton of different things. THis slowly changed in addons. Addon introduced a faction that builds everything out of very small number of basic materials, then another addon introduced a way to build previously existing tech in the same way. Simplification continues.

* This game has bad AI pilots. They improved since X3, sure, but still very rigidly fly around obstacles, at least when they're in the same sector as you.

---

Now, if you can live with all that, you can sink plenty of hours into this. The game is quite unique, although it takes time to learn. And as I said, it is a way better spacesim than starfield.",1698371207,1698371207,True,1,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

- some ship interiors ... some because feels like only exist a bridge/cockpit in the ""gigantic"" ships... you can stand on the bridge since your feet won't get tired.

- good graphics and env

- good concept, yet still very far of what Egosoft created back in 2005 X3 which set the standard and since they trying different formulas but still failing to deliver the proper sequel for X3.

- the game playable if you don't bother the missing logics such escorts (aka protect ship) neither Fleets (don't get me wrong that exists however doesn't work properly)

- Foe engagement is basically micromanaged even if you trust the NPC (aka captains) to do that task, well they do try and many do fail... so micromanaging is X4 must

- Better plots and player immersion 

Cons

- AI is bonkers, and I really mean bonkers... your NPC captain will fly through stations/ships bang on walls and somehow keep the ship intact... immersion break couple times but well is what it is..,. the AI sucks. 

- Fleets are non-existent... well there is an option to form a fleet and set formations but its about it... dull fleets don't work unless... all ships have the same max speed otherwise the fastest mice reaches the destination to be killed while the rest of the group ""so called fleet"" is scattered upon different speeds all over the sector or sectors.

- Protect ship - to be fair it is utter useless! You have the option of set one or more ships to protect a ship but guess what, like the so called ""Fleet"" the protected ship must be slower than the escorts otherwise there will be no protection, again protectors scattered all over the sector(s).

- UI clumsy and not that intuitive neither player friendly, to give simple commands you have to go through several layers (windows) to give the basic instruction.

- AI again, X4 pushes you to have NPCs at the helm, all good for the eye to see, but as Egosoft premium experience developing AI, well they suck. AI does not take care of the ship neither the player have options to get those NPC (aka captains) to a point that are useful... 

- NO CAPITAL SHIPS! Really the so called destroyer (XL) well just few large guns and out gunned. But since a small ship is oversize well you may enjoy X4 in thinking you are flying that fighter/hauler is a capital ship just for the shear size of all ships. If you want to see capital ships then skip X4 foundations and that abortion called X Rebirth and go straight into the better game that is X3 from 2005

- Just FEW SHIPS, well ship design in X4 isn't the best that Egosoft ever delivered on all previous X game versions even X Rebirth had better designs, however you may start to like the odd design. But X4 slim down the number of ships per ship class to one max two per class... S/M/L/XL and thats about it.

- Assign ships to a station such as miners and they will end-up idle in the middle of no where doing nothing neither jumping/moving... again AI is broken (or non-existent)

Well playable on the basis that couldn't much be done without mods which fix some of the lacking game logic and add more ships... anyway for better X game experience, get the latest X3 released

Must have MODS...

After more than 80 hours I can confidently say; this game does a splendid job luring you in with the 'you can be a space pirate and do space stuff' heavily, but then overwhelms you with mechanical problems you need many tutorials for, only to turn into an 'I'm building an empire, but to what purpose?' 
Essentially, this is a board game with mechanics somewhat more complicated than civ games, but it's also lacking in other mechanics to go more in-depth to the role you're trying to play. There's no diplomacy, except the 'I declare war on u, go die now' and the entire game is about trading. Yet, I recommend this game. Why?
Easy, it's happening in space, and does a tremendous job of making sure you understand all of this is happening in a futuristic society where mankind has gone beyond Earth and has met alien civilization, and is now trying to captivate its human instincts to capitalize our known universe. The game serves a niche for players who enjoy games like Eve Online, Mount and Blade and Elite Dangerous and attempts to blend all into one. The result; it's ok. Pretty dope even, considering this game was made by a small staff of 20 people. The developers have managed to let me play through their game with maybe 1 hour of 'wow that's so cool' out of of 83 I've played, and still make me feel like it was worth it. In the end, I had fun, no matter how many more hours I'd plunge into this, but that's because I've also enjoyed aforementioned titles. Don't play this game if you're looking for a story-driven, space-pirate shoot-em-up where you control the universe. Play this game if you're bored and you like to have a second job in space, and then let the game carry you away with its many possibilities of achieving that. Just make sure you go into this game like Kenshi. If you haven't played that; expect to put in an 80 hour grind just to lose everything within a minute. Just like the real economy, it can explode any minute :)

For the record; I never played the DLC. Apparently there's content there if you're looking for more story, space piracy and shoot-em-ups and according to reviews it's good, but I believe base-games should be holding their own without DLC.

The ability to go from just one person and a ship to a galactic superpower is just amazing. Also, the fact that I have beaten back the Xenon and made it so that they are no longer a threat is such a wonderful feeling after enduring their devestation in this and all the other prior games. 

The recent updates have really helped with performance, which is great for those, like me, that have over 1000 ships. 

There is a lot to do and I am really loving the empire building and rebuilding after the devestating Xenon war.

However, those of you looking to try the game may wonder if there are any problems that crop up long term, and as much as I love the game there are a few. Do note that these are issues that happen very late in the game, you probably will not see any of these unless you play hundreds of hours. Also, all of these are annoying, but not deal breakers. However, you may disagree so it is still good to know what you may have to deal with long term.

1) The Random nature of scale plate ships is frustrating. They do not seem to be adhering to mechanics of other factions. It seems their ships appear at random instead of having to be built at a shipyard. The fact that there seems to be no option to have AI counter their pretending to be ships of other factions is also annoying. To get arround this I reccomend new players not try to take over systems that frequently have scale plate ships as their random spawns will bypass any defense and go straight for your traders and stations, which they can disable btw.
2) Riptide rakers considering food being illegal is annoying. I wanted to help rebuild their economy and the like but they do not produce their own food and keep having their police take any food I have.
3) Riptide and Teladi ships trying to rebuild Vigor stations is also annoying. Vigor killed and oppressed them for a long time, but now that I beat them the Teladi and Rakers keep trying to rebuild Vigor stations. I could see them helping their allies, but it is like they want to build the mouth that bites them. It would be nice to have an option to not allow AI to build stations in your territory without permission. 
4) The claims by characters in the game and fellow players that uniting the Paranid is a bad idea gets old pretty fast. I united them, it is my decision, and I do not care what the characters or other players think about it being ""bad for the economy"" I mean seriously, I go through all that work and the character in game gives me this big speech about how bad it is for the economy and then smirks, ""Enjoy your united Paranid empire"" At least with players I can block them, but there is no option to throw this jerk out of an airlock.
5) The fact that planetary infrastructure can only be built on certain planets makes no sense. I control several planets, and I would love to have banks, medical facilities and training centers on those planets, but the game only lets you do that on pre-determined planets. 

Again, still a great game that I can highly reccomend, just some annoying issues that pop up after hundreds or a 1000 hours of play.

I'll let the effective removal of autotrade and the decision that I'm not allowed to sell black market goods to black market people and hold onto 200 security slicers go.

The fact I can give an attack order and watch 4 destroyers approach, 2 fly off in the opposite direction, 1 goes directly into the station and another does... nothing.

First, what's with the fog of war? Even today, we are able to locate any business on sat nav and find details of what it sells online. Flying to the ARG warf is like taking a drive to the local shopping mall. So why do I have to spend hours physically flying around space and pinging to reveal every station my ship should already know about? Why not just reveal everything to the player from the start? It seems to me an advanced space-faring civilization would would already know what and where its own properties are and be able to share that information will all its inhabitants. I shouldn't even have to buy sector maps, if that's possible. They should just be there.

Second, even today's fighter jets have beyond-visual-range systems that can identify objects the pilot can't see. Yet, my X4 rig can't identify objects I can see with the naked eye until it's about 50km from them. Again, the X universe should be pretty well known by now and every known object in a sector should be immediately visible on the map and identifiable by the ships' AI.

in many ways, X4 is one of the best space sims around and I expect to be playing it for a long time, But some of its ideas feel dated, like they come from 80s TV show.

... BS ... i played this in early access (2019ish) ... it was a slow paced half-implemented cross between an RTS and space-sim with 90% of the features missing.

It's been years since then ... and now ... the all-mighty version 6.0 ... and it's somehow an even slower. 89.5% of features are still missing, and what's there is either broken, or designed to suck as much time from you as possible.

Trying to set up a mining fleet is impossible due to various AI bugs, lack of options ... the game locking out ""repeat orders"" for some reason ... can't automate cross-ship trading ... and the auto-mining AI seems to work every time ... about 10% of the time.

... AFK'd it while waiting for this slow arse piece of dung to figure out how to juggle 30 mining ships and build some income while i got on with my life ... then came back 12 hours later to find 90k extra credits. ... this was after 2 days of working up the capital requried to biuld the fleet ... and spending waaaay to much time issuing orders. ... the reason this happened was due to an AI issue ... which apparently is caused by me being in the same system as them ... thereby giving them performance anxiety that made them go to an asteroid and do absolutely nothing to it ... repeatedly ... for 12 hours. ... spoiler alert ... going outside of the system, restarting the game and staring at a wall for 3 hours didn't improve much since during that time they managed to fill out their order loop about 3 times and crap out yet again for absolutely no reason. (yes i checked the prices, and everything ... and even issued an order to mine next to an asteroid that i knew for a fact had resources in it ... nothing. ... so fk it.)

... sold the ships ... built a fighter squadron ... 20ish ships or so ... waited for 2 hours YET AGAIN because the station that was supposed to build that crap didn't have resources in it ... ... and this fleet of 20 high-spec heavy fighter ships got ANIHILATED by 2 random NPC entry-level fighters (the kind i can take out in droves). ... apparently this happened because of a formation i insisted on using.

loaded a save ... figured i'd go back to mining and work out the kinks in the AI ... bought a capital ship ... the game doesn't let you issue an order loop that is pretty much "" mine shit here ... drop off at ship "" ... for whatever reason. .. so having a small fleet consisting of 1 magnetar and a few couriers which'd do all the digging work for it ... and use the magnetar to loop cross-system trades ... thereby saving some time ... nope. ... can't ... reason : no one in their dev team figured out how to make a button that says "" drop shit off at this ship "" ... and also turn the "" can be used in a loop "" boolean to true. 

... so after all that ... after 4 years and 6 versions ... this is it? ... seriously?

fk this game ... also fk egosoft.

If I had to describe X4, it would be the m'fng Mariana Trench. X4 is one of the most advanced agent-based Space 4X sims out there. I would daresay it is the best 4X out there, with Starsector (not on steam) coming in 2nd. 

There's a catch though. It is extremely difficult to learn to play. I think Dwarf Fortress is easier to learn than this beast. I'm a veteran of X3. I have thousands of hours in X3:R and X3:TC combined and I even played the hell out of the Litcube mod. I even tried X:Rebirth. Despite all of this, I had extreme trouble learning to get my bearings in X4. 

For this reason, this game will not click for 99% of you out there. It just won't. The UI is extremely janky, archaic, and cryptic because there's just so much you can do. How do you even begin to design a UI for this?  How do you even begin to teach this? For this reason, X4 is for the 1% out of you out there with the patience, self-independence, and experience to learn how to play. The rest of you will enjoy a game like Starsector much more, as a game like that is 1000% more intuitive despite its complexity. 

And if you can actually learn to play this.. you have a real treat waiting for you. You will take part in some of the most epic space battles available in gaming. Zipping around destroyers in your M class, with laser or particle tracers spraying across space. You can wage economic warfare by blockading supplies, blow up the right kind of ships to create artificial demand and then fill it with your space stations and factories.

Space station building is much improved from X3. It's simply a snap-on affair with space station modules. Back in the X3 days, an those were what. 2 decades ago? Holy s**t I'm getting old. But back in the X3 days I would spend around 6 hours building one complex making spaceweed. Finding the right asteroids. Plugging numbers into online calculators. Dragging and towing around the asteroids in my Hyperion Vanguard. And then painstakingly ordering a friendly Mammoth to bring in factory modules 2 or 3 at a time, and then having to place them down and connect them with kits. X4's system is such a welcome change.

It's so nice to see the ships and even the aliens rendered with somewhat modern graphics. Boron ships got quite the visual upgrade. They look dark, omnious and very alien. A total mismatch with the BoFu-eating, nerdy Boron people. 

The music in X4 is just as good as X3. I remember when I would just idle in Seizewell, Kindgom's End, or Getsu Fune back in the day. They took the themes from some of the best tracks and updated it for X4. 

Anyways, after the disaster that was X:Rebirth, and the rocky launch of X4 (I played it for 90 minutes when it first released and it was a buggy mess so I refunded it), X4 has finally matured after three or four expansions in the way No Man's Sky did. It is a return to what made X3 great.

The game is very very slow. On my current save I have about 30 hours in and havent completed the boron storyline yet, not counting all of the other plots in the game. From a sandbox perspective, I have one tiny trading station. It takes a very long time to get to any sort of ""good"" automation, you will spend a lot of time on the map running repeat orders trades in the beginning if you're optimizing for income. That or farming drops from xenon in Hatikvahs Choice. 

I get what the developer is trying to do, but the execution isn't there especially in the early game. There are a bugs, a lot of bugs. There are two learning curves in this regard, one for the game as designed, and one for the bugs and issues such as OOS vs not OOS (out of system) etc. The vision is there, and it's magnificent, but I can't recommend this game to others despite enjoying it a bit myself. If you enjoyed the eve online AFK mining type of content, you'll probably like this game.

This game should really pivot to supporting or facilitating multiple ""RP"" sandbox experiences where the velocity of the game is increased. Currently this game is designed to and caters to folks who have 500-1000 hour long savegames. With the gaming landscape as it is, despite a major feeling of accomplishment, it's just not worth playing this game over others.

Starsector is an example of an extremely well paced game, in this game you can't really speed through it without cheese, but even then it can take 30-40 IRL minutes for a basic station to be constructed, 5 minutes for a ship, way way more of the station has a deficit of resources. Yes there's a SETA drive (in game time acceleration) but it breaks the AI, and you can only make it via RNG drops from Xenon, in 30 hours of combat focused gameplay, I've only received one component of the SETA, a programmable field array. 

In starsector, if you know what you're doing you can steamroll and playthrough relatively quickly, its skill based and depends on what you want to do, it respects your time. The economy in this game is amazing, I just don't want to work a second job to participate in it.

It's an economic simulator and every ship is real with almost no ships just ""spawning"" in (only for story missions).  Every ship is built using materials from the galactic economy.  You start from humble beginnings as a lone pilot, and can ultimately own whole fleets with capital ships, stations, and shipyards.  The game performance is much better these days as well, and the graphics have gotten better too and it's quite pretty (in space at least, the characters look dated), with great music, and great sound effects.    

There is combat and the combat is pretty good.  But it's made far more interesting in that each ship that's destroyed actually hurts the side losing it - they have to replace that ship.  And you can even scavenge the wreck for spare parts.  The combat matters in the game world.  

I still prefer playing with a few key mods, namely ""VRO"" for better balance and ""Fire and smoke"" for better explosions. 

While things are really quite good, there's still a few frustrations - such as the notable lack of an ""attack at long range"" command for attacking stations.  The interface, while powerful, is somewhat labyrinthine and will take a while to get used to.  While you can always jump into one of your ships and pilot it, later on in the game you might end up looking at the map a lot instead of actually flying around.  I wish there was a bit more combat early on when you're just a guy in a fighter as well - or that the life a mercenary company would pay as well as the life of a mining outfit.  

Also, it really needs an ""end game objective"" - such as a major galactic threat to repel.  At the moment you can get quite strong and can make it your goal to reclaim sectors from the Xenon or decide to fight one of the major races to keep yourself entertained. 

These gripes aside, no other game lets you go from pilot --> fleet commander --> CEO --> essentially faction leader with thousands of ships at your command in a dynamic, fully simulated galaxy.

Where you start out as a nobody and slowly make your faction and make relationships with other factions. So if you normally struggle with being bored in sandbox games or looking for a faster paced game, this may not be for you.

Edit: Changed this to a not recommend after putting more hours in.
1) Auto pilot is so stupid trying to go through an asteroid field. It will try to go in a straight line through the field, drop out of fast travel, maneuver around a rock, and then repeats.
2) When you want an NPC to fly your ship and set a destination sometimes they will just fly their slowly instead of fast traveling.
These two points seem trivial but flying around is a main part of the game and it gets frustrating pretty quick.
3) I was retreating from enemies and decided to save. However, i forgot that pressing escape takes you out of fast travel which got me killed and had to load a previous save.
4) Missions get boring pretty fast. But you need to grind to advance. Like I remember I kept doing the same type of mission where it will say they need satellite coverage whereas in reality the area has many overlapping satellites from my previous missions.
5) Often times when I'm bored but have a station trading, I would like to simply advance time. So I would afk and just leave the game running to build up funds to further expand.
6) There was a trader organization that wanted me to talk to them and when they ask me to join the only dialog option was to say yes and be charged a fee, lol.
7) Your character is basically invisible or a vampire. I can't see myself in reflections. I would get video called by my pilot about something and I don't see myself in their video even though I'm standing behind them. The reason I chill in the ship too is because the pilot can auto dock in the station.
8) Auto pilot for a destroy mine mission will literally warp you into the field getting you killed. Pretty funny until I realized it was a while until my last auto save. 
9) when you are fighting ships near a friendly station or ship, they will get mad at you if you accidentally shoot them. They should know the difference between this and actually being targeted.

After 500 hours into this game I can say that this is a fantastic game.

One ""downside"" to the game is that it will take a long time to get some things done. For example if you have the materials, some station modules can take 15 minutes to build each.

The game also loses a lot of FPS in the late game as more and more things need to be calculated. You can mitigate this a little bit by reducing the graphics slightly. I turned off volumetric fog and saved 10 fps. The game is very CPU heavy.

It feels like a combination of Space Sim and RTS genres, with added immersion of being able to walk around the stations and your ships in first person view. But...
Every time I try to play this game thinking ""maybe if I concentrate on a different aspect of it I might enjoy it more"" I end up disappointed. The number of bugs is mind-boggling and they stay unfixed for more than a year. The UI is confusing, there is no adequate help, no explanation to half of the game mechanics. If something goes wrong (and something will go wrong very fast) you are dead in the water. Only googling helps, and even that is not guaranteed to work every time.
Some people say this game has a steep learning curve. Text editor Vim has a steep learning curve, but at least it's a learning, because everything you need to know about it can be discovered in the manual. This game basically comes with no manual. It's a terrible playing experience, not a steep learning curve. Even the knowledge acquired from previous games in the series doesn't help as there are now new mechanics with their own set of incomprehensible rules.
For example, let's say you have a station with a factory that produces Energy Cells. You produce them, you use them in other factories on the same station and you might even place sell orders for the surplus. Everything is fine there. But now you want to build something else on that station, and the construction requires Energy Cells. You'd think it would be very straightforward - you already have this product in your storage, so you can use it for the station. But noooo. You have to set up a buying order for your build storage, allocate the budget and either tell one of your freighters or wait for NPC to TRADE BETWEEN THE STATION AND ITSELF. There is absolutely no logic in this. And the worst thing of all is that unless you specifically google you will not understand what the hell is happening and why isn't anything working as expected.
I really wish I could enjoy this game, but without a complete overhaul either to UI or to the help section I just feel frustrated every single time I play it. It might take multiple years of active development before I can actually recommend this game, and even that is not guaranteed.

As I weave into my fleet’s formation I almost slam my fighter into my flagship's hull, barely making the landing pad. The fighters that were chasing me disappear into debris as the turrets let loose. I get out of the cockpit in a hurry and make straight for the airlock. The coms open with DD-356, a Behemoth class destroyer, the garbled voice telling me they're sustaining heavy damage over the sound of explosions.  I don’t want to hear it but I know what’s about to happen. As I make my way to the bridge and come into full view of the battle unfolding in front of me, I can see the flashes and debris flying to my left, just like that, It's gone. The captain and her crew were with me from the very beginning, some of my best and most experienced…

I’ve seen this too many times, casualties are well into the tens of thousands at this point in our efforts to push back the invaders. Getting back to the task at hand I direct my ship forward to pull some fire from the massive I-class Xenon battleship in front of us. If I timed everything right, we should take minimal damage before we can finish it off… As the sound of its weapons pounding my ship resonates I can’t help but think; I know we'll take it down, it probably knows too, yet it stands there in defiance, pounding my fleet with no regard for its preservation. Terrifying is an understatement with the Xenon, you never know if they are coming for you or if they are willfully passing through your defenses on their way to some obscure plan in a faraway sector. This one though, and its attending destroyers took no quarter, they dropped out of the gate and onto us just as we were defending the docks from a large group of fighters and gunships.

We've been trying to defend this station for a week now, with my auxiliary ships tied up on other, deeper front lines, losing it would make major repairs on large ships impossible here. This would most likely force us to retreat, leaving the Split to fend for themselves. The lack of support and ensuing attrition from the Xenon would quickly make this system fall and cut the Split territory from us. There would be no saving them and the invader would push that much harder with the gain in resources… Even the Teladi, who are fighting back home on multiple fronts, are helping here lately. Combined, our fleets make the Xenon pay dearly every time they push, yet, it isn't enough. We are losing ground. Every. Single. Day.

As the enemy battleship’s shield fails, our fleet’s heavy guns start tearing through the armor. With the amount of firepower the first fleet is bringing down, the engines fail almost instantly and the guns get scraped off like weeds… Less than a minute later the superstructure breaks and the reactor releases its energy, rendering the massive ship a lifeless, floating husk. Standing on the bridge, this could be called art if it didn't mean so much death and destruction. The MK3 refit for the shielding on my ship worked beautifully, we haven’t even taken a scratch and the bridge personnel look a bit cooler than usual while facing a Xenon I-class. Terran shielding tech is expensive but this will have to be refitted on my heavier ships, we’ll make a production line if need be. Looking around me , there's so many shipwrecks it's hard to believe, as the last of the enemies fall and the battlefield goes quiet I can't help but think the salvage crews will have fun today...

It'll take some time to rebuild the losses, especially the experienced personnel lost; it's a rare commodity nowadays, training is long and the Xenon take them from us with a savage hunger. Fortunately there’s solace in the new stations coming online back in Argon space and the Paranid civil war ending. All this will make laying down the keel on our replacements faster and our unified trading and economies will allow for even more production across all the factions. We must make the most of this opportunity. Yet, part of me can't help but think that it is never enough; for every destroyer we replace, the Xenon makes five more. With the shifting front lines back in Argon and Terran space, we’re spread thin. 

Nevertheless, as soon as the second fleet arrives for relief, I need to get back and oversee the strike force being assembled and some new station designs. The refit, upgrades and fresh ships of the second fleet should give us an edge here for the time being, also something the first fleet has been waiting for a little too long.This new strike force is being assembled from parts of most of my existing fleets and much of the last few months of production… If it goes to plan, we’ll be able to eradicate the Xenon presence in the Split systems, completely secure a flank and gain the split’s military support and resources. If it can’t take down the Xenon shipyards behind the gate, we'll be forced to abandon the Split systems and our hopes of winning this war will be that much closer to zero.

We all know that operation is a suicide run, thousands of men and women, frigates, destroyers, carriers, fighters and bombers, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice so we can remove a piece on the board in the war room, whoever will be left will be lucky to come back limping. I definitely need more time in my fighter and less in front of that board, I am still dreading the moment I have to remove DD-356 from it.

This is X4, it's not for everyone, it's hard to learn and even harder to master but damn does it give the best stories. There’s very little exaggeration here, the war room is basically the late game map that I only use in capital ship and stations and the objects in it are automatically updated, other than that, this is the gameplay.

My game is from an Argon/hatikvah pilot start, in which I focused on commerce and production stations to build up an army, there’s a lot of other types of games to be played such as piracy, political back stabbings and warmongering, science and research with a huge player HQ…etc  but keep in mind large scale operations with large space stations/complex supply chains & 100s of ships is always the end game. So it is a very complex game and the learning curve is steep but not impossible, google is your friend.

Disclaimer; the Story here is made on my second play with a modded save which makes the Xenon extremely aggressive, as a new player you should have time to learn the ropes before they become a problem, if they don’t get completely pushed back by the normal factions (not likely). I also use ship variation expansion, faster crew levelling (still slow), Xenon hell, better kill credit, heavy behemoth, argon cyclops, weapon pack, XR ship pack.",1694117189,1694175358,True,1,0,0.51086956262588501,0,True,False,False

I put it off for many years, though after getting a HOTAS joystick setup for DCS I figured I'd branch out into other games and this one is incredibly fun, even if nearly 30hrs into it I'm only just getting started still.. a few game over screens are expected learning something new and you don't have to restart from scratch but I like the whole 1 life thing so that's what I do. I feel that's the intended way to play, otherwise there would be respawns.

Amazing on it's own and with mods even more fun. Definitely not what I was expecting when I bought it. I saw a comment on someone's YouTube video that explained it best, this game is like Eve Online with it's business-like management systems and Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen (though this is better because it's released haha). I find it difficult to learn the ins and outs as I'm not a numbers guy so it can be a bit overwhelming at times trying to build up your empire, also as a sandbox style game you're basically on your own when it comes down to what to do. I like the freedom of choice, not sure what the end-game is like or if there even is one. As far as I can tell the goal, like the ultimate goal is galactic domination lol..

There are a bunch of factions already established but as you're in charge of your own little Empire that grows I imagine you're only limited by your own ambition and I say why be 'one' of the top dogs when you could preside over them instead :)",1694044843,1694044843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- No Xenon capping is I guess more realistic but damn it was good to build a Xenon fleet to fight them with
- No ship jump drives
- No Kha'ak capitals
- Races as DLC's??? (OK on sale)
- No corporations
- Can't man your turrets!

Due to poor AI, an extremely hazardous environment, and poor mission parameters this can take hours to accomplish.

Since the last time i seriously played an X-Game dates way back to X2, I went straight to the tutorials. For the sake of simplicity I will write my experience down as a dialogue:

Me: *fires up flight tutorial*
X4: *asks to do basic stuff like walking/turning around, entering ship, flying simple maneuvers and travel modes*
Me: *does as asked*
X4: ""Now lets do some shooting. Here are a handful cargo drones. Shoot one""
Me: *shoots one down after several tries* ""My gun has some hefty reload - like 4-6 seconds...""
X4: ""Don't worry, its only a tutorial gun. Now fire a missle at the next drone...""
Me: *fires a missile* Missile misses
Me: *fires another missile* Again miss
Me: *fires a third one from behind the drone* Drone explodes
X4: ""Now fly over the container to collect it or press 'O'""
Me: *presses O* ...nothing happens
Me: *flies over the wreckage* ...nothing happens
Me: *bumps into the wreckage* ...again nothing
X4: ""Now fly over the container to collect it or press 'O'""
Me: *shoots down another drone* ...still nothing
X4: ""Now fly over the container to collect it or press 'O'""
Me: *shoots down around 75 drones* ...three containers drop out of it 
Me: *frantically hits 'O' to collect them*
X4: ""Now fly over the container to collect it or press 'O'""
Me: *Checks mission requirement*: collect Ammunition Container
Me: *Checks cargo manufest*: Injector, and two other random cargo
X4: ""Now fly over the container to collect it or press 'O'""
Me: *shoots down another 150 drones* 
X4: ""Now fly over the container to collect it or press 'O'""
Me: ""**** you. I try the battle tutorial""
X4: ""Welcome to the battle tutorial. Now go to the dock, enter and undock your ship""
Me: ""Wait ...in the previous tutorial I had 'Freelancer'-like controls..?!"" (ship flies to the mouse pointer)
X4: ""Yeah, but here you have 'Elite'-like controls."" (ship does not bank but rolls when used left/right steering)
X4: ""Now shoot that badass Xenon warship. Target its turrets""
Me: *flies like a drunken idiot with vertigo issues and finally destroys all targets*
X4: ""Here a handfull of Xenon fighters. Shoot them""
Me: *flies like a drunken idiot with lesser vertigo issues and finally destroys all targets*
X4: ""Now finish off that Xenon warship*
Me: *Somehow manages to align the ship behind the warship and destroys it*
X4: ""Congrats, you have completed your fighting tutorial. Feel free to check the nearby shipyards for additional assignments""
Me: ""Yeah, just let me assess the damage of my ship"" *starts scrolling through 20 information pages...*
X4: ""Btw. somebody is shooting at you""
Me: *frantically killing of all info windows and staring at the quickly melting away hull-meter* ""But...?""
X4: ""You have been destroyed""
Me: ""Hey ...what about successful completition of the tutorial?""
X4: ""Game Over""
Me: ""...."" *quitting to main menu and hitting the 'Terran Cadet' Game start*
<after some easy stuff like ""scan satellite, drop satellite"">
X4: ""Activate long range scan mode and scan for the distressed ship""
Me: *scans and gets a signal* ""I think i found it""
Me: (after flying to the signal) ""Whats this? A red glowing sphere? And whats its name? ""Lockbox?""
X4: ""Activate long range scan mode and scan for the distressed ship""
Me: *scans again* - the only thing popping up is a ship i passed 10 minutes ago while flying to deploy a satellite
Me: *flies to that ship*
X4: ""Yeah you found it, but since its contect is top secret terran defence force stuff, you are dismissed now. Go away...""
Me: ""Okaaaay.... What about the Lockbox? Any use?""
X4: ""....""
Me: *looks up in steam forum what to do with a lockbox*: ""[i]...shoot its locks carefully[/i]""
Me: *flies to the lockbox, aligns carefully the guns, shoots once*
Lockbox: ""Cabooom!""
Me: *Quits the game*

The whole X-series had always a mediocre-to-bad gameplay. While in 'X-Beyond the Frontier' most people who played it were students with lots of time and the game had the ""i am new"" bonus. 

imagine, when it came out in 1999, the only two big franchises with decent (and true 3D fights) ins space where: Wing Commander, which was limited to a number of missions one could play; and Frontier: Elite, with an Elite 2 which was working fine, but was already outdated (since it was from 1993) and an Elite 3, which was a buggy mess....

So in 1999 everybody was excited with the game which filled an empty gap. So the clunky UI and some very dubious gameplay design decisions (to name one: how long it takes until the player has a meaningful amound of money to do the story missions) were of no consequence and thus encouraged the developer to stick to them in the subsequent titles.

The result of these ~20 years of failed gameplay development is culminated in this game. If you want to get the feeling how games were at the end of the last century, this one is a prime example for it:

- It has a halfton of screens/overviews/functions. Each and everyone is important, and you need to learn around 100+ button-shortcuts to get there quickly (if you think that this is already a lot, try 'Falcon 4.0')
- It does not care about the time you invest into it. It has its own pace which is - in todays eyes - tectonic and it will enforce it mercilessly (check the ""collect container"" mess above)
- It certainly has a lot of nice features, but they are hidden deep behind a time-wall. 
- It is -still- a single player game. So the only thing you can do to show-off your creations is to create youtube videos. No coop/pvp/muliplayer or whatsoever.

Just two words about me, as you will see, that i clocked only 4 hours in this mess.

X-BTF: played through
X-Tension: played through, had the rare opportunity to meet Helge, the author of the X-Universe books, got one of his first manuscripts from his first book in the X-Universe
X2: played halfway through, had a HUGE discussion with the egosoft developers on their forum where i proved them by the numbers that the whole (original) economy systems of the game could not work
X3: messed around with the editor and free play a bit, but my whole impression of the game was rather underwhelming

Yep, released for 4 years and the twits at egosoft never got the AI into a working state in the slightest. your ships will almost never follow orders; tell a ship to flee and what does it do? It flies in the EXACT opposite direction you told it to, hugs the ship currently ripping it apart, and fucking SITS THERE UNTIL IT DIES! Owned npc flown ships constantly refusing to use travel mode or relinquish command to you. ""Sorry, I'm busy.""I'm sorry what? I fucking own you, you don't get to tell me you're too busy to let me, the player, take over. And even if you do get to take over there's a good chance the ships engines and thrusters will just fuck off and go on vacation leaving you with a ship that has no damage to any part of it that can't move nor reorientate because egosoft is less competent than bethesda!

And then there is the fact that the most basic of commands you would ever want to issue are gated behind a leveling system for the npc pilots that doesn't even function... Why does this idiot need 3 out of 5 star levels to do basic bitch trading?... 

The game has much promise. But in order for any of it to be realized the game needs to be handed over to a team that passed their codding classes with more than an F-. Even handing it over to bethesda would be an improvement and my GOD I never thought I would ever say something like that.

And that's just the AI. there are plenty of other problems plaguing this non-proof of concept such as large turrets having no increase in range from medium in many cases and station guns being completely out ranged by almost everything. Graphical issues like explosions not rendering, no concept of priorities for repair (repair order is always random with no control over it), you can take over systems for absolutely no reason because all that does is remove the pitance cost of setting up a new station. You can't tax in the systems, you can't invite or disallow other factions from building in those systems; and other factions will only ever build in a system you control if they already had stations in said system before you took ownership... Boosting your engines for a quick speed bump drains your shields!? WTF? Why are my defensive systems acting like a battery for engines!? The economy doesn't work either. Most factions start out with a set amount of resources for ships and then that's it; they never get any shipments of what they need to build more. I had a medium sized courier queued up at several different places. Just the one. And then canceled the orders after they still had not been built after 2 RL days worth of time had passed.

Yes, you can design and build your own stations, but good luck with that headache. The snap function is finicky, modules will randomly change orientation when they snap to the grid for no discernible reason, modules will also refuse to connect to others even though they have the arrows lining up...

If I worked for egosoft I would be ashamed just like everyone there should be. egosoft is the perfect example of why we are all getting so fed up with the industy's complete lack of effort. Shiny on the surface but just a shell over a random ball of crap. 

Oh, and they try to say this is a sim but it has no attributes of an actual sim...

Edit:

Tried it again after 6.2 and all the problems are still there, and worse is that some of them got worse despite patch notes saying the ""fixed""it. Some new issues popped up as well.

Customise ships, build space stations, setup mining and fabrication operations, explore the vast unknown, and choose your friends and foes (aside from the Xenon, they will kill you regardless). Delegate remedial tasks to crew members you hire, so your Galactic Empire can be more than a one man army.

Speaking of armies, build and command entire fleets and defend your vast space riches.

After 7 min I was delighted to be finally able to explore the station. Looked through every available room. Saw interesting docked ship and hopped in for a 'quick' look.

Important things that was not told at the begining : you have two inventories, your own and your ship's. Cops don't look at yours.

The things I don't like : 
1. it's too short :D
2. the factory 3D manager is a mess. Let us just select the number of each production we want to make (eg 5 refined minerals + 9 hull parts). Place the factory+storage part as a bg… factry, and the rest as it already is.
3. a lot of unkillable NPC (also unkillable lootbox) so don't shoot at npc when there is a station behind them ! and let your own pilots handle the lootbox OOS.
4. I can't fly an I  ? ¿ ? 
5. the IA is pretty stupid and management can be cumbersome. If I want to recall my bombers wing, I need to select the wing, right click, select group, right click, remove all orders, right click my carrier, recall.

Edit: I found the game far more enjoyable with mods. Much though I am loath to recommend a game based on a dedicated and passionate fan-base filling in the gaps for the developer- I'm still not going to do that actually.

Patch 6.2 has the delightful effect of randomly making my fleets shoot allied ships. Why? I have no idea, in part because it's impossible to tell where any reputation demerit comes from. It's just listed in the log as 'reputation lost: Reason, time.'

In a big galaxy with a large corporate empire, that maps out roughly to 'Go f%$@ yourself.' Great. Wonderful.

Putting this back down now, because even with a dedicated group of modders making the game work, the devs are doing a wonderful job of breaking it again.

It is helpful with the base tutorial but once you get the basics done prepare to google how to do things and set things up.  (Small concepts like how manager skill affects trade jumps seems non trivial at first but begins to break you economy if handled wrong). 

The game is very free form; if you want to role play a pure pilot there are paths for that.  If you want to build giant trade empire there is a route for that.  Final step being a realization of your own fleetyard / shipyard for assembling your own armies. 

The world events are random so if you world seems to be crumbling it may be that role or that you simply failed to impact world events fast enough, and that is the beauty of this game.  In most recent play through a empire kept destroying my trade routes.  After promptly depositing 400 + ships in their systems surrounding their home worlds, star bases and trade routes I have oddly not had any issues with raiding of my trade ships.  Many people would move their fleet out to do something worth their cost after that, but I decided they would take up permanent residence in case they decided to ever raid again. 
It is the total randomness of events, wars, trade prices, and other aspects of the game and economy that keep this game fresh for every play through you may complete.  

Some elements can feel a bit awkward but there are so many mechanics and interactions at play it is a minor complaint. 

Warning: If you expect all instructions to be in the game and you do not like looking up mechanics via google or forums this may not be the game for you.

wont let me as much as start X4, and Rebirth crash my computer too often, so for now Im mostly still playing Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude. But that said, I dont regret buying it,(Im not a very good Telladi I suppose) and I still look forward to playing it when it hopefully one of these days will start up. The graphics and the music are awesome, I know that without having played it, because thats a fact regarding all the latest X games. They are doing a great job in my view, and regarding this latest X game...rome certainly wasnt built in a day. 
And this says a lot about these games, coming from someone that doubts the universe itself. Constructive help and advice wanted, so if someone out there reading this have a clue about what I could do beyond setting the game folders to ""play as Admin"" is very welcome indeed. Other than that I hope you guys are enjoying these games as much as I am. Alea iacta est. 

EDITED: I should have written this long ago, but here it is. I can finally play this game without issues and its everything I hoped it would it be. That said, I honestly preferred the Albion Prelude and loved the X-Rebirth type graphics and all the possibillities that it has. I love to be able to capture ships etc, something that doesnt bring the same joy when playing the X4. I will however never stop playing this game series, in my humble opinion the best sci-fi game available and it has ruled since X-Tension and X2 The Threat which Im still playing. Not much, but every now and then I still love to fire up those olden goldies. And dont get me started about the music this series have used, all awesome. All of these games are worth checking out, but especially the X3-series and X-Tension are well beyond awesome.",1544890361,1692950760,True,1,1,0.500502526760101318,0,True,False,False

As more of the bugs are ironed out though, I'm sure this will be the epic masterpiece space empire sim that we all want it to be.

X4 has all the mechanics in place to be a masterclass space empire sim, but lacks the polish that allows the player to enjoy the late game. X4 is great in the beginning with guided and rewarding missions that nicely introduce many of the various mechanics. Then as the player amasses a fleet of ships, they will notice that commands feel clumsy and unpredictable. Large ships ordered to attack a station will sometimes simply not. Fighters intercepting an enemy flying towards them will watch them fly past without landing a single shot. Large carriers will take minutes after exiting a gate to turn 90 degrees, fly 2 feet to clear it, then slowly turn back as if they were agile fighters. Then there are trade stations and a rich economy that is tedious to interact with. There is no way to change common settings across many objects so each station needs to be configured individually. Not only that, but the buy and sell behaviour of each ware of each station needs to be set individually for sensible behaviours like buy from player factories and sell to everyone. Traders assigned to trade stations idle while factories nearby have inventories full of the wares that the station is configured to trade. Factories with all inputs supplied by miners insist on $10 million+ operating budgets.

X4 would be a great space sim that lets the player build fleets of ships from satisfying supply chains that interface with a rich economy, but the ships are stupid and supply chains are tedious to set up and don't work. That is the general theme of the end game: things seem to work a certain way, then they don't.",1692781311,1692931496,False,195,3,0.889418363571166992,0,True,False,False

I've started the game 3 times  now, from scratch. Latest time I bough  the Terran expansion (i¨ve heard their engines are the s**t) . Within a couple of hours i've encountered game breaking bugs. Every time.

Last one was on ""Escape plane"", step 5. I get speak to Boso Ta. He does not respond. Step before is to select a nav beacon i space in a good place. Tried placing it in 5 diffrent places. Everytime I get a half copy of my base spawning there, and Boso Ta won't respond. Reloaded game at that checkpoint 10 times, tried stuff. Tried dismantling the duplicate base. Nada helps. Same thing every time. Duplicate base, Boso Ta wont speak to me.

Game before?
Scan for spaceweed. Spent probably 4 hours scannin every ship in every sector i had explored. Nothing . Bought one expansion (The terran one) to get access to good engines in the future.

Before that?
Same as above. Couldn't progress past spaceweed (and had no other good missions to pick). Decided to restart , since I started to understand the game more anyway.

That's just the gist of it. Other things are autopilot bugs (keeping you in an infinate loop/circle. Stopping and ""re-aligning"" for 30 sek due to invisble objects.

What you get:
-space legs w/o forcing you to play a crappy shooter when you get out of the ship
-plenty of systems
-factions and economy that you can actually put your finger on, you can help them or destroy them
-lots of ships, ships that dock to ships, capital ships that actually feel like capital ships, carriers, freighters, scouts etc.
-very immersive combat.. 
-great music and sounds
-good AI, if not great
-each station layout looks unique and you can build stations yourself
-your stations can trade or produce and sell anything, from basic refined ore to ships, adding more layers to the economy
-very good campaign like story lines
-many community mods you can try out
All in all this game feels very complete, the dlc are totally worth the money with a lot of content.

What could be better:
-graphics look great most of the time, especially ships... but some animations feel a little off (like moving the character is very linear and unnatural) I hope they will improve on that
-3rd person view of the ships could be nicer and better controlled (this is something they are already working on from what I've read)
-you can use a HOTAS for flying but I feel the game is easier with mouse and keyboard and it feels great this way. If you want a HOTAS immersive experience, it doesn't feel that great (at least for me it doesn't)

What you don't get:
- Multiplayer. It's a single player game, but to be honest It feels more alive than any other space sim.

X4 was a godsend for me during the 2021 Aussie covid lockdown, alongside the Split Vendetta DLC. My first gamestart was the Spear of the Patriarch, and i had no idea what i was dong, it was so different to X3, i had to work alot of things out and made many mistakes, it was amazing, I taught myself how to board ships through trial and error and eventually i started pushing into argon territory using their own destroyers against them, until i owned their northern sectors The Eleventh Hour and Guiding Star. Since that first game they’ve added more DLC and the base game has been improved adding new plot missions, combat changes etc. If you like having your hand held Tides of Avarice adds a tutorial of sorts, a story plot that shows different aspects of the game, but if you are like me and prefer to jump into the fire, don’t do the Stranded gamestart for your first game.

I watched streams on youtube, even the developers stream with Bernd Lehahn that keeps repeating here on the store page. It all looked amazing. I absolutely love the graphics, the complexity, enormous autonomy of the ships, the amazing ability to keep busy, keep growing. It seems to go on forever! Its fun! I have a great time playing the game! That's the good...

The bad is the game seems to have serious and deadly issues in my humble opinion.

First of all, make sure you save super-super-often, because the game crashes and locks up often. I keep drivers up to date, windows up to date, everything current, so I have serious reservations that it has to do with anything being out of date. You'll have a lot of trouble finding a youtube video that doesn't have a crash or reboot. If you do, I venture to say it was edited out.

I keep coming back to it, but always have that little annoyance of saving every time I accomplish something difficult, because if the game locks up or crashes again, all that work will be gone. Game saves are quite lengthy also, which is another annoyance. $80 for the Foundations Collector's Edition, I figured the game would be polished. But it has more bugs than a fishing bait store. Much of the problems would be excusable if the game was still in early release, but its not according to the steam store page.

I have lost count of the times I have somehow found myself locked inside the graphic boarders of a station, or behind a false door in my ship and can't get out. There are times where I have to use the task manager to end the game, for the exit game function freezes. Graphic glitches like jerky motion of NCP's, gun mounts, reminds me of watching a bad horror movie that uses flickering movements of creatures to scare the viewers. Lock ups during NCP interaction seems to happen enough times I hesitate talking to anyone, because I end up restarting the game when the NCP doesn't react as it should. Shouldn't be that way with such a beautiful game that obviously has a lot of developer time in it. Even with the 3.0 update, its still pretty ugly. They need to buckle down and do some serious bug squashing still.

Egosoft has an absolutely beautiful, visually stunning game. Its very obvious there is a lot of love in the making of this game. I hope they work things out, because it is in fact amazing and fun. Unfortunately the bugs are a serious fun-sucker.

Edit 9-26-2020: I've played an additional 120 hours or so. I've learned to get out of places and issues now. While I'm still getting stuck from time to time inside graphic areas that shouldn't happen, I have learned to get out. For example, if my small fighter gets stuck inside a larger ship that I tried to dock with (Happened a few times trying to dock with a carrier remotely), I can call the ship to dock at my location at a station or something that I transport to, and it magically recovers itself. So, while these annoying bugs are still throughout the game, I've learned to live with it and move on. I've learned to love the game and work with the quirks. I'm changing to thumbs up, I enjoy the heck out of the game.

Edit 8-20-2023: I've been playing for a while now, and I have to say it continues to improve. Its an intoxicating game, and as far as I can tell MOST of the bug issues I once had, now seem super rare. My pc has changed, and as I continue to update my hardware, graphics card, motherboard, processor, etc, things continue to improve.

Stations built, ships built, big fleet going to defend a portal etc etc... I prefered X3 AP and X3 FL at first. But since the Terran update, X4 is really good and can be called as 'complete'. AI behavior issue are the main problem here. And for content, the lack of a real diplomacy system is a problem. But for the rest, it's a really good X. It's hard to compare, because the X series are alone. But you gonna manage, fight, trade.... Think.... Explore and do what ever you want. Be prepared, it's a SANDBOX, plots are secondary. Fix your own goals, make money and do what ever you want. Fighters and miners are now really important in X4. Ships can't just jump out, so we need to protect them. And we don't have mining stations anymore, so the galaxy is full of miners everywhere.

Compared to X3 :

         For X4

-Better station/complex build... I mean.... A LOT better and easier. 
-Better station design... They are more fluid, I mean, more logic and 'normal'
-Command and control a lot better too. It's hard at first for us (old X players), but once you understand that 90% is controlled with the map, it's intuitive and better with less window and click click click
-Better Graphics... Of course lol, it's a real 64 bits game, finally...
-Better performance... Again... Of course. But you need a good computer with a good CPU and Rams, I have over 200-300 FPS and over 60 FPS on the map with thousands of ships and stuff going on, but less with filters on
-A real and dynamic economy... They was some random aspect in X3, but now it's a other thing. We can't emergency jump out, so we gonna lost a lot of miners and stuff, that's gonna help to run the economy too.
-We can use shipward as a income now (really really good income lol)

       For X3

-More orders and options, I mean.... missile defense, the option to auto transfer money from stations and everything like that. But the community pack help X3 a lot on that
-Better auto trader (Mk3), once you get some leveled pilots, they are not so bad in X4, but nothing compare to a real Mk3 of X3.
-Better ships design... Yeah, Terran, split and Boron are very good looking in X4 and we now want to buy new ships lol, but X3 have a overall better ships design and a lot of interesting unique ships


A lot of people don't like the long time to train a pilot and I can understand it. I was thinking the same at first, but I think this long time just add a lot of value to our staff. Now when I have a ship under attack, I look to the staff on board to save higher skill (I transfer them on a 'mule ship'). When you have hundreds of miners and hundreds of fighters everywhere, you always have some 3* pilots somewhere to put into a new trader you just bought (or build). But now, the life of our staff worth more than a 20 millions ship...

This game take time to really enjoy it. I like to compare it to Mount and Blade for the sandbox aspect, but here, it's a lot more complex and deep game. If you are a new player, maybe take a look to some tutorial video, like the channel of 'Captain Collins'. It's hard to know some mechanics that you.... Don't know lol. If you already played X3, it gonna be fine, but give you some time, it's a more modern game.

Good space combat
The autopilot is a miracle you can even use it in combat

Terrible UI
Terrible Menus
Ugly Npc models

Look Ego soft you guys need to make this game more intuitive and user friendly! I shouldn't have to be a 15year vet player just to figure out how to play a game!

my suggestions;
Add KeyBinding Layers (multiple!)
Add a mouse widget
add the function to lock the mouse to the game window
Add modifiers for keybinding ctrl, shift, alt, Ctrl+Shift, Ctrl+Alt, Alt+Shift, Ctrl+Shift+Alt + (keys!)

Specifically, ships can use a propulsion boost which drains shields and under AI control this leads to ship destruction in combat because the AI does not manage it effectively. Consequently the player can best preserve their assets by preventing them using boost in combat but the only means available is a radio button modifier on each individual attack order as there is no default per ship.

Since attack orders are auto-generated by ships following patrol orders, if they want their assets to survive this requires the player to intervene in thousands upon thousands of interactions which they should be able to leave to the game, which makes the game a micro chore once you get past about 20 hours in any playthrough. 

This single omission makes the game unplayable in its current form but despite discussions, it has not been addressed in over 5 years of development and several media focused DLCs.  

Consequently, despite buying this game and giving 900 hrs to play testing and bug reporting for this game in the hope that it will be improved and made more playable, I cannot recommend it to prospective players in its current form.

Graphics: Nice but everything is based on a very few models with slightly different dressing so it has a sense of copy/paste development.
You'll love this... My WIFE MADE ME BUY THIS so I'd have something to keep me occupied. I was holding off for Starfield.

Overall sense: You're job is to discover all of the bugs the developers have left for you to find and figure out a way around them. Micro management is essential.

Simple scenario: Send a freighter from point ""A"" to point ""B"". It takes under 10 minutes to do it in the specific ship when you take control. After clearing the ship of all other orders and verifying its path from A to B, 45 minutes later the ship still hasn't arrived. So follow one to see what they're doing.
Remember, this is a ship that only moves at 50 Km/h. Ship Accelerates and decelerates for no apparent reason. Performs loops and flies a circles around gates it flies through and then if that wasn't enough, flies 30 kms 180 degrees in the opposite direction from where its supposed to go, directly into a pack of 12 enemy fighters (I was following in a battleship so protected it). EVENTUALLY it got on course, upon arrival at the dock, had angry sex with another ship that was making a delivery at the same dock (ramming it trying to use a busy dock). Now one of those ships is stuck at the dock, blocking all other deliveries to the build and blocking the entire build. I tried ramming the Size Large freighter with my XL Asgard battle ship many times and I was bounced off like I hit a mountain. The freighter never budged.

This game is an exercise in learning bugs, nothing more. Its stressful and aggravating watching the game screw up the most infantile tasks so blatantly and the quality-of-life features failing and requiring so much hand holding. I don't think I've used the term ""WTF is it doing?!"" so often playing a game or watched so many ships having angry sex so often.  Everything is painfully slow unless you do everything yourself: I got frustrated with a slow ship and took over to see what it was doing. Capable of 250 km/h, the automation was doing 3 km/h!!!

- Elevators that break on arrival forcing you to exit the game or teleport out. Literally stuck in an elevator in a game! Thats some kind of record.
- Captains that won't let you take over when they're stuck and literally tell you, ""I'm busy"" when you try.
- Shop keepers that take 10 minutes or more to spawn into their shops.
- Enemy ships that spawn over your head, 35 kms away from the portal!!
- Laggy, Laggy, Laggy on my Ryzen 9/ 64 Gb Ram/ RTX 2080TI/ 2Tb SSD machine

I've done very well in the game. I own the fully fitted out Erlking, an Asgard a few other HOP destroyers, own 4 full sectors and have a massive base with shipyard. I roll into enemy territory and kill everything. I'm not sewing sour grapes, I just reached a point were I got tired of looking on in shock yelling, ""WTF it is doing NOW!!!"" The developers are milking a dead cow and we keep paying.

I played the 2014 X-Rebirth and deleted the game. My memory of how bad it was had faded. I remember now. The Wiki on X-Rebirth (The predecessor) sums the entire series up as a disappointment. To be fair, there is a group of people out there who enjoy it and have mastered all of the bugs. The game would be good if it operated as advertised and didn't go to such lengths to waste players time or frustrate people.

After 23 years of making the same game 6 times i thought they finally figured out how to make them good.

I expect games this pricey to have some love put into them. The in game encyclopedia doesn't even have flavor text for most of the entries. This has the side effect of not teaching you things you might want to know, like what administrative centers are for.

Plenty of bugs, missions become impossible to complete.

""Stop your attack! Sector security has updated your criminal record!"" This happens SOMEWHERE on a map half the size they used to be and without a way of stopping it, paying fines or making changes.

If the game decides to punish you there's nothing that can be done. All turrets to Defend, All people set to flee.
Doesn't help.

The station builder mechanics are so ineptly build it's shocking. Blender was more intuitive to use without a tutorial. Snapping doesn't work right half of the time and the restrictions for module placements don't make sense.

Trading, restocking ships and the whole ship storage system has become bloated and unintuitive. Trades used to be instantaneous so was equipping and even buying ships.
Now there's a mandatory waiting period which makes micro managing fleets a clunky, unresponsive pain in the ass. This seems to be the average intended theme for the game.

I wish developers would put bug fixes in games instead of making DLC that gets plastered over a small and restrictive mess that preys on brand recognition.

Tried to fix the game myself but all Cheatengine or Nexus mod pages i tried have not been updated in over a year.
If those people don't care i doubt the devs do.

The game crashes the second you try to make on the fly adjustments. Probably a ""feature"" caused by the online part of the game.

If only the AI was working properly.
If you're OOS(Out Of Sector), things tend to work fine. But when you want to watch yourself the empire you created, or want to see how your beautiful ships do their job and go in the same system (IS for In Sector), you fall from high.

So, I'd say it's a good game if your thing is to watch 2D objects on a map doing there thing while you're sitting anywhere else.

-Fight ? See above. AI that you have to manually babysit for basic actions. Even doing that will not prevent weird things to happen. And it's the same for trading, mining, landing, everything.

-Explore ? Nothing to discover, no mysteries. Beautiful backgrounds, but it's all.

-Build ? Could be cool. You can create kind of huge stations as shipyards(or anything),  you can make big towns too if it's your thing. But if you want something looking good, your hair will have a bad time while you pull out them and say goodbye to your FPS.

-Think ? Yes, think twice before wasting your money.

They are used to do it since a long time now. In X3 it was fine as the game was playable(thank you modders community on which you piss** on)
In X:Rebirth, it was litteraly misleading advertising
In X4, it's in between. But don't expect something working as intented.

Starting with a single ship, you begin your journey doing smaller freelance work and eventually start to build your own fleets.  Stay at it long enough and you can even build your own stations.  Mining, Fighting, Trading, Building and Exploring  ... this game has it all.  The scope of this game is truly mind blowing.  The way I have attempted to describe this game to my friends is it can be played from a map perspective (think Stellaris 4X style) with the ability to drop into the action and pilot any ship.  I've have several saves with hundreds of hours each and I can guarantee I'll have even more in the future.

--Decent graphics that work well (but don't expect Star Citizen). They are solid and immersive, but the focus is clearly on the game play.
--Fly pretty much any ship in the game.  You can do this personally or assign a crew to pilot them for you.
--Flying actually takes some skill (not arcade style).
--Once you have a large number of ships, you can manage everything from a map view (think Stellaris galaxy map).
--Build stations and supplier lines.
--Take a break from management, hop in a ship and go at the galaxy ""Han Solo"" style (take freelance missions or just pick some fights).
--A real simulation where the entire economy is reliant upon utilization of resources within the galaxy.  If you see an NPC ship being built, then it is using resources that had had to be mined, refined and transported to a ship yard.
--Control massive fleets.
--Start with almost nothing and end up ruling a huge empire.
--Space legs:  Walk around stations and Ships, Exit your ship and take a space walk.
--Numerous starts and the ability to create custom starts.
--Pause the action to assess situations, plan ahead and issue orders.
--AFK gameplay:  I will let my fleets mine and trade during the workday and then I have a ton of loot to play with when I jump on.
--Numerous story threads to experience (and even more if you have the various DLC).
--For the amount of game play you can get, the price of the game and DLC are reasonable.

If all of the above sounds awesome this one might be for you.  A couple of things to keep in mind is that the learning curve is pretty steep and the game can be CPU intensive.  There are no planetary landings in this game.  The game is single player.

It takes a while to start and to save which is annoying. 
Started with the terran story what many say it's the best one to start from. Wanted a lone pilot type of gameplay, like a Freelancer and Rebel Galaxy Outlaw type, Elite Dangerous or even Starpoint Gemini Warlords. Like would not mind bigger ships or even some empire management as long i can focus on playing solo for the most part, at least until i get bored and want to explore the rest. But wasn't that much in to the story, pretty sure just the tutorial part as i barely learned some basic controls on how to fly around that i get teleported near some alien base and now i have to build parts of it and pretty much manage it. And is not something you can do alone i have to hire some constructor that i had to find out about from youtube and can't even afford it because it wasn't my plan at all. 
So looking even more about it i get a much clearer picture that it is way too focused on large management for my liking and the reasons i was interested in are a part but not that important and repetitive and shallow. 
So maybe it's a game that would seem more fitting for someone who would enjoy the management type of gameplay that i would probably compare with EVE online. I haven't play that but i suppose if you would like to be a clan or alliance head but can't stomach the real politics and time consumption that would come with that, this game could provide a similar feeling but all under your total control within a singleplayer environment.",1691818065,1691818065,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

FURTHER EDIT: I removed angry stuff where I was insulting to developers who I have never met. That is not my intention. I have nominated this game for a labor of love, despite the below.

EDIT: When EgoSoft releases another DLC and/or a collectors pack standalone expansion with all previous DLC included but a new game, their model will continue to be proven.
1. Aim way higher than budget and attainability in your game development goals. 
2. Implement unplanned and un-researched systems to get there
3. Ship a 'finished product' so you can make money off of what is essentially an 'early access' for several years in order to fund the continued release and development of the game because you did not get it right the first time AND YOU KNEW THAT BUT RELEASED IT ANYWAYS. 
4 Re-release the game under a new title with all the issues fixed because your playerbase released the mods and found the bugs to make it into the game it actually should be. 
5 .....
6. Profit?

Egosoft is doing the SAME THING that many other gaming companies are doing with ongoing release cycles and re-releases, except Egosoft aimed higher in the beginning, shot lower in the moment, and recovered worse than the competion, which hints at defects in leadership, strategy and growth of what may be a stagnant and out of touch company.

This game is very disappointing. It is close to being the best game to ever come out of Egosoft, but they can't figure out how to create any UI element that does not feature a nested menu inside a nested menu with a nested menu to access the nested menu. Seriously, the UI problems are just the start of a long line of deep interactivity problems that make this gem and beautiful game feel like you are often wasting your time, because hiding all of the gameplay mechanics are insane levels of stupid player interactivity with counter-intuitive menus and UX that take away from the enjoy-ability of the game.

I am physically in pain from how great this game could be, but how insanely bad it is in terms of accessibility and playability due to its hamstrung player interactivity. At the time of this writing, I have 140 hours of gameplay. You will see that number go up, I promise. There is a great game in here somewhere and I intend to keep playing.

I highly recommended that you read the review posted by Wraith_Magus on saveorquit, that review goes very in depth into some of the items I am referring to as well as other issues in the game and will give you a great idea of whether or not you want to spend this money. I would never deign to suggest this games core components are changed, it needs to stay complicated and challenging. The surface level player accessibility, usability and interactivity absolutely needs to catch up to the 21st century.

Learning to play X4 should be like learning to play Dark Souls - a whole new style of gameplay that blows your mind once you realize how stupid, small and insignificant you are (and how great you / your faction could be eventually if you keep playing.) It should be frustrating at times but also very rewarding. Instead, learning X4 currently feels like learning a new task at work that your bosses friend assigned you without telling you and did not give you any instructions. Oh and the task is in a different department and has nothing to do with your line of work and you are not getting paid for this.

Think long and hard before you buy this game - it is absolutely worth if if you have the patience, and it may get WAY better in the future with a new DLC on the horizon and a new standalone game starting development at Egosoft based on this title. Egosoft has a storied history of making their games WAY better after 10 years, and we are cresting that rise right now with the lifespan and changes of the X4 series and, more importantly, the engine it is built upon. However, this game is absolutely not worth it if you do not have the time or patience to deal with headache inducing UI features - they are not bugs - the only reason I was able to spend 140 hours figuring this game out is because I am unemployed and have nothing better to do right now.",1635948882,1691804784,False,2,0,0.512481749057769775,0,True,False,False

the problem is that in order for this to work, you need to be able to delegate those tasks, and the AI pilots could not be trusted to wipe their own asses even if you duct taped toilet paper to their hands and placed a scorpion down their cracks. they will take your expensive L and XL vessels and commit suicide while accomplishing nothing, three times out of four. 

the menus are also especially frustrating to navigate. tasks that ought to be simple and need to be done frequently, like swapping pilots between ships, is a mess of navigation from tab to tab and submodal to submodal, and you have to memorize ship callsigns before you do it because there is no way to get pilots and ships to be shown together. 

and then there are the countless bugs. repair lasers just straight up not working despite being in the proper weapon group, two meters away from the satellite with the beam physically *clipping through*. alt tab silently unpausing the game. your ship being slingshotted 8000km away from the sector core immediately after you reload a save. it goes on and on.

To call this game good would be... unfair to any prospective players out there. In my 200 hours, I have spent over a dozen hours Googling why this or that doesn't work. Why is 'this' mechanic doing this? Can I fix it? What am I doing wrong with this or that. It has a steep learning curve and extremely bad resources, so if that's a turn off, it's easy to recommend walking away now.

The concept of this game is amazing, the scope of the universe is impressive. The idea of becoming a business tycoon within the galaxy, raising up your own fleet over time and steadily growing from millionaire to one of the most powerful factions in the galaxy is fantastic, and horribly addicting. There's pretty good ship variety and a good amount of customization you can do to your ships. You can control your ship from the cockpit, which feels pretty natural once you get the hang of the unorthodox controls. You can be a pilot in your own main fleet, assaulting a station or an opposing armada. Pretty cool, right? It should be.

The issues that this game still has is amazing, considering its release was 2018. Despicable, honestly. If it runs like this in its current state, I would have been utterly baffled to play this game at launch.

Issues:

AI:
The AI is absolutely terrible. You will find yourself constantly scratching your head while watching your AI perform something mind bogglingly moronic. You may cry out, as your entire fleet kamikazes into a heavily fortified station, but they didn't need to, because you equipped that fleet with long range weapons so as to pummel that station from a safe distance.
So then you may turn to Reddit, which will be your only salvation in solving this game's hilarious mechanics. Reddit will tell you that you need to manually set your (L)arge turrets to attack capital ships/stations and manually set your (M)edium to only attack fighters or defend. You see, your peanut brained AI wanted to get in range so they could use their smaller, shorter-range medium turrets on the base, too! That's why they bum rushed the base. Your fleet is wiped now, but at least you will know for next time. There's an autopilot feature, which is very nice to have, but will do the dumbest things you can imagine. It has flown my ship into a building multiple times to where the ship is stuck inside of the graphics, unable to be recovered except by loading a previous save and just doing the flight myself. Disgusting. I have watched autopilot circle my station for 10 minutes before I just took over to do the landing manually in 30 seconds. Autopilot in an asteroid field is also amazing. Instead of maneuvering around asteroids with any ounce of logic while traveling, it will just stop, reorient, go around it, stop, reorient, continue. Basically, autopilot will make a 30 second trip take 15 minutes, if not longer, depending on your ship.

You really have to spoon feed everything to the AI in this game for it to even do any amount of meaningful tasks. Imagine the NPC's in Skyrim going brain-dead momentarily, as the memes show... that is this game's AI from start to finish.

Base building:
Who even designed this? In game you can buy plots within the galaxy (wow, that is actually very cool) ...and build a base. It's kind of like Legos, which should be pretty easy, but don't worry, it's actually a massive headache. Indescribably clunky and finicky.

UI:
Good grief. It just gets worse. To be fair, it's a complex game, so a complex UI is warranted. Does it have to be so convoluted though? Either way, it is. Difficult to navigate, difficult to use in a timely manner. For example, you have a capital ship with 20 fighters. You can select the group of fighters, let's say, Alpha Group, and tell them to attack target X. Okay, great. But for some reason, they are flying over to that spot? No worries, since you issued that group order to all of them, surely you can remove existing orders by selecting the whole group? LOL, NOPE. You have to click on each individual ship and remove or reorganize each order for each ship before that ""attack"" command will be acted upon. Archaic and down right dumb.

Missions:
Somehow Skyrim quests usually so engrossing. You could get lost in side quests that just pull you in. Not in this game, the quests are so dry, they're just a chore. Even the main quest line is God awful. I want to play the game, but I have to do all of these completely meaningless quests with the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life.

Bugs:
Bugs piled high as the sky. Cross your fingers that someone on Reddit has encountered this bug and a fix has been discussed, otherwise you are truly SOL. So many aspects of this game JUST*DONT*WORK like they should.

Polish:
Last and honestly least, lack of polish. The ships in the game are really gorgeous. The behemoth stations you can build are so insanely cool to look at both in flight and on the ground walking around. Aside from that, polish in this game in non-existent. NPC's look decent but move like a Star Wars game from 2002. Dialogue is very disappointing. This game runs well enough for me but it will have episodes of getting stuck at 11 FPS and NEVER recovering. You'll need to restart the game and boom, back to 60, 80, 100 FPS.

I could both rant and rave about this game for much longer, but I will leave this here. Time to go back to Reddit to see if anyone has any possible solutions to why the boarding UI is locked and preventing my 200 marines from boarding this enemy vessel. Do better, Egosoft.

Stupid or laziness Egosoft? I say a little both.
2)	Broken Economy start, you can find yourself hours into a game only to find that the *weakly* random rolled world gave you a shit run that requires a restart.  OMG every economy is broken and nobody has a silicon refinery???
3)	Game breaking quest bugs that require reloading… HQ (main quest line) that never quite spawns where it is intended to, buggy anomalies that take you to incorrect sectors yet keep you on the quest line when you are NOT in the intended area, and
4)	Data Leaks on stations hovering over the station or worse embedded inside the station that they are unreachable.
5)	Ship fires from invisible misplaced gun mounts, can be fixed with a reload but that brings us to another major issue…
6)	Save times are horrendous… even with a SSD this game takes forever to compress and save, and will autosave at the most inconvenient of times.
7)	Animations and Cinematics reminiscent of 1995's 3D Movie Maker... seriously this can only speak for Egosoft's stupidity... And where the hell did they find these shitty low quality voice actors that sound like they are recording over a tin can? When there are free modders that offer better talent??

The tutorials, such as they are, are an afterthought. They teach you the bare bones basics, but not at all how to play the game. There will be huge gaps of knowledge between what the game expects you to know how to do and what it actually cares to explain. You may think that following some storyline will help, but really it doesn't because every story assumes you already know about the finer aspects of the game. Some tutorials ll explain the larger, grander things available, but nothing teaches you how to get there. How does trade work? How does building work? 

There is a depth to this game I still want to explore. No doubt I will spend more hours here. But I cannot recommend this game. So far, 37 hours in, this game has been more frustrating than fun. The problem is not the steep learning curve, the problem is just finding out what it is you need to learn. This game was not made for people who haven't played it before. If that sounds ridiculous, that's because it is.

----

After having spent more time on this I don't think I will ever get into it. I really keep feeling I shoud like this game, but every time i play it I am either bored, frustrated, or both. And I am always, always out of my depth. I don't want to go read and read guides, watch youtube videos, and scour forums to learn this game. I want to be able to learn by playing. But then nothing is apparent about what you should do. 

There is also plenty of content and mechanics that turn me off. Everyone in the galaxy knows where everything is and how to get there. But all these busy sectors, with massive traffic and huge space stations is all a great big unknown to you. Because apparently maps aren't a thing in this universe. Like all space games, flight in this game is more like atmospheric flight than space flight. Distances in this game are ridiculous, being measured in hundreds of kilometers. Rather than millions. Probably much of this wouldn't bother me if the game wasn't lacking in other ways. 

The writing in this game, such as it is, is definitely something that has received none of the attention the engine has. It is shallow and unbelievable.

It took me hours JUST to figure out how to get to my ship (seriously second day at this thing and I am still in tutorials). It is rewarding when you finally do figure out what it says to do (Press F for teleport and nothing happens)  MY best advice to you is to not play any of the teaching modes. 

The combat tutorial was ok but flight via mouse was cumbersome and apparently not all joysticks are supported. (my thrust master was not) weapon handling fortunately is easy and getting pasted so far is thoug expect to drift all od trhe time when doing an new anything (i was just trying the 3rd tutorial and even that was kind of glitched with the constant want for me to drift down and left???) 
 
I can say that there is NO FPS in this game, it's just flying about in some actually very slick looking ships, the scope of the game is expansive, the community looks large but by and large not much help at this stage. I have seen enough that if the UI is cleaned up a lot more this thing would be an amazing game and COULD be the best game I have played in decades (it's currently it largest issue is massively confusing)

 I don't want to do a book trashing this game but unless you have a lot of time to sink into it look elsewhere. The UI is way to complex, the tutorial teaching you much without a steep learning curve is not overstated. to it's credit it launched many expansions (probably ship skins on re configured prims) and it does had an open sand box world I love where it lives no matter what I do to it. It boasts an economy system, and ways to get a better ship with not much effort (youtube will teach you how to exploit this game no sweat) It has a lot of potential but currently is needs a ton of work to see it realized. Not for the casual gamer by far.

I feel pain in my heart to leave a negative review. Although I have 0 regrets investing some money into this game. I have high hopes to come back and see all of those awful things fixed, in a year or two. Until then it just not worth it, an endless irritation.

Most of all, since this is sort of a grand strategy game, I beg the developer to spend some time optimizing stuff. It crumbles and starts dragging its feet in the mid game. The late game is probably not possible, at least not enjoyable, unless you use a liquid nitrogen, or something, to overclock your CPU beyond reason.

Upd 2023:

Tried to give it another chance. Tried tutorial, immediately got stuck on shooting the drones. It wants me to cycle through targets with Page Up/Down - clicking, targets change, no reaction from tutorial engine.

Alright, let's ignore it. New game, walking. It's too slow, want to run, Shift doesn't help. Let's check out controls. Here it is, there's Run option, *unassigned*, wtf? Trying to set Shift + W whoops, all menus close players inventory has opened. I don't want that - close. Whoops, now the game froze and in the middle of a screen it says ""Game Paused"". How to unpause? Esc doesn't help. M - oooh, the map opens, okay, let's open Settings menu from here. Click - all windows close, game is frozen. Same message in the middle of a screen: ""Game Paused"".

Okay, just my luck, new game, Go to settings, finally manage to clear Shift + W from opening player menu and then set this combo for running. Okay, I'm walking, now clicking Shift - nothing. What the hell? Tinkering with keys - AHA! It works if you FIRST PRESS Shift and then W.

[h1]Here's why I'm changing it[/h1]

My previous complaint boiled down to two major issues I have with this game:
- Terrible UI
- Terrible AI

Both of those are still true! However, as I dive more into this game I'm learning that Egosoft is actually putting an effort into making both of these better. I'm finding lots of changes from old forum posts where these two elements were much worse. I also previously shared a scenario where I was trying to board and take over an enemy ship and my AI did nothing to help. I haven't had any issues since that initial issue and I've determined it was because that ship was a story ship and wasn't supposed to be taken over.

In my additional 30 hours I've been getting so much enjoyment I cannot justify my ""not recommended"" review any longer. There's so much to do in this game, it's so deep, and I keep wanting to peel back the layers that I find myself wanting to keep playing more. It's been a while since I've been this engrossed in a game for this long that I just can't let the negatives overwhelm the positives.

[h1]Here's my initial unedited review, for reference[/h1]

I've been playing this game on and off for a few years now and played a lot of X3 before it.

HERE'S WHAT I LOVE:
- The depth to the simulated universe is amazing. I keep wanting to peel back the layers to learn more about what's happening around me.
- You actually make a difference. I love the fact that X4 lets you be more strategic in your approach to warfare. During war in many other 4x games, you win by having more forces and engage in a full-frontal assault. In X4, you can also do that, but you can also prioritize raiding supply lines, taking out miners, and starving the enemy of resources. As a single pilot in the early game, you can join a faction and help them in their wars immensely by doing these small strategic things.
- The visuals are pretty solid. Given the amount of simulation that's happening in this game, any level of visual detail left to squeeze out of your system is respectable, but X4 does a pretty good job at making the game look and feel good.

AND HERE'S WHAT I HATE:
This is really why I cannot recommend this game. After all the hours I've invested in this game, I still find myself online Googling and watching videos to help me figure stuff out. I'm not just talking about the complex mechanics that are difficult to figure out, I'm also talking about game breaking bugs and poor AI that just make the game unplayable.

In regards to complex mechanics, the game does a really poor job at explaining how things work. And the UI does not do it any favors, so you'll spend a lot of time watching videos and reading to learn what menu you need to access and when in order to complete anything.

In regards to the game breaking bugs and poor AI, I finally, after many hours of playing, have enough fire power and knowledge to start boarding and capturing large ships. After spending hours reading, watching, learning, and earning money in-game, I finally have a wing that can stand up against the big ships. I find a ship, fly to it, and start shooting it to take it over. It's one class above my own, so it's going to take a long time to poke through the shields. I'm alright with that as I did my research and I know what I need to do to be successful. I also have a wing to help me get through the shields faster.

After I start poking the ship, I command my wing to start attacking it with me. And they .... do absolutely nothing. One of them flew directly into the enemy ship and got stuck, so I had to reload to a previous save before he blew himself up. I'm shooting the ship for about 20 minutes trying to get through the shields and keep pausing the game and interacting with my wing to figure out why they won't shoot. I do what I've done for every other issue in this game and I go online to see if I can figure it out. Come to find out, I'm not doing anything wrong. 

The AI just sucks. 

So I finally find a mod that supposedly fixes this. On one hand, it's great there's a way to enjoy this aspect of the game since the devs don't seem to care to fix it. On the other hand, why the heck won't they fix it? The sad part about these mods is you also have to have all the DLC and you bet I'm not going to throw more money at this game to use a mod to fix the game when it should just work to begin with.

About 20 hours in, the disappointment sets in. The core promise of the game is never delivered upon. If you are like me, you probably wanted a complex space sandbox where building your empire feels satisfying and gives you a sense of pride and achievement. But what you get instead is a poorly optimized game with an utterly terrible UI and user experience. The mechanics aren't deep or interesting, they are just tedious. There's a reason why every Steam guide or Youtube video recommends the same utterly boring ""tips and tricks"" to ""earn money quick"" because the game is terribly designed and poorly balanced. The game slows down to a crawl just from exploring the map.

You'll read posts from many people who want to avoid flying in their ship, just dock at a station and control their empire from the map interface. That's right, the same players who are probably recommending this game to you are going out of their way to avoid 90% of the game's mechanics. Don't do missions, they suck. Don't do the plot missions, they are poorly written and have weird lasting consequences which the game refuses to tell you about beforehand (but you won't mind because you have drunk the kool-aid and think that having to watch Youtube tutorials and read Reddit posts is an acceptable replacement for good game design).

There is a half a good sandbox game hidden in here somewhere which a lot of people want to play. But it is being smothered, choked, and buried by 90% of the rest of this mess which you will hate and look up guides and tutorials to avoid at all costs. Do yourself a favor and just avoid the whole game.

As we all know, X4: Foundations was released back in 2019 in a downright deplorable state. As an X Universe fan, I just couldn't let it slide and whipped the game something fierce in my review at the time, quite deservedly. X4 was basically an unplayable mess, most of the usual races/factions were missing, entire game mechanics missing or FUBAR, game balance utterly out of whack, terrible gameplay, abysmal performance, and and the whole thing drowning in an ocean of game-breaking bugs and crashes.

Now, 4 years later, I can finally say X4: Foundations is now in a very good place. Egosoft is notorious for releasing games in an utterly appalling state. However, they are also notorious for never abandoning their projects, sticking to their guns and with the help of the community fixing their games through the years to become some of the best space simulators in gaming history! And that's exactly what they did!

Four expansions in, now we finally have:
- all the major races/factions. 
- a great selection of ships, weapons and upgrades.
- a huge map with many explorable sectors.
- working gameplay mechanics AND several additions since
- major, game-breaking bugs and crashes are (mostly) gone, although with new expansions come new bugs, so this is an ongoing process, but what EGO did so far is admirable.

I could go on for pages, but sufficed to say, x4: Foundations is a really enjoyable and one of the best space sims out there currently, well worth the price (and expansions).

In a similarly obsessive manner I played the previous version X3 plus DLC plus the XTended Mod for what was an entire 2 years non-stop. So this game is my kind of thing and read my review in that light.
By now I have completed a few of the major story line plots, have an impressive fleet of stolen Battleships and am now about to wipe out an alien infestation. 
One small note I have here is that Boarding and Hijacking ships is a lot of fun and can be a challenge. 
It running smoothly on my modest hardware so far and I've had the occasional technical glitch with Vulkan but just running it again seems make it work again. 
So there's bugs and they cause the fun to stop but it's only temporary and I can only suggest to save often.

The game's features all seem to work as expected and yes the UI is a complex thing which is actually better than it's predecessor's one. I am merrily hijacking ships, building running factories and making a decent amount of change in the process. Of course there are some strange design choices made and sometimes the missions don't complete as intended.
But I've not yet hit a Game-stopper glitch in the missions or the gameplay.

As for graphics, this game runs 50fps in 1080p on a RX570 4GB and it all looks great. I'm happy with that. 
Also happy that they implemented AMD FSR which really helps a lot.

The flight mechanics of the ships is a bit simplified model where they just make the bigger ships slower to react to input.
Also the juggling of the Travel Mode takes some doing but on the whole, flying ships is not too big a learning curve and there is room for skill in hustling an XL ship through gates at full speed.
Speaking of speed, some of these very large ships are capable of physics defying speeds. If one is a purist, one might object to having a thousand plus ton behemoth outrun a small scout ship but it's still fun.

I must mention combat and state that the AI pilot combat AI is janky and stupid. But it's by design and meant to encourage you to try upgrade your NPC pilots but it be frustrating. 
Also you will need a spreadsheet to calculate station building parameters. It's just how it's always been but I would have liked it if the UI presented you the figures in the station build out screen.

I have no problem in recommending this game as it's my thing but the novice to the genre should be aware that it can get very complicated mid to late game as there are a lot of moving parts to manage.",1691050518,1691050518,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are some incredible changes, not to the game itself but at the side of mods, supported by egosoft and it has now become an incredible game that actually allows the player to enjoy a space adventure to their liking on so many ways.
AI is improved to some extent on vanilla game but it seems egosoft deployed some mods that actually fix the AI capacity on several aspects. Together these changes led to a situation where IS battles are viable and enjoyable, closing the gap of X4's biggest mistake, the lack of enjoyable situations where a player was in the scene.

I was kind of thinking a swashbuckling FPS type game in space.  What I ended up with is an empire builder and while the space is all nicely rendered in 3D, I spend most of my time on a 2D map managing ships and my empire, small as it is at the moment.  There are no limits to how big it can be.  All the stations are built from the same style of building blocks, though each race has it's own style.  You can construct massive stations and manage them. Fly around them and land on any of them, if your reputation will let you.

But the bugs and brain dead AI will drive you crazy.  Every ship has to have a pilot to be it's AI.  You'll watch them try to run from attackers by flying into them for a few seconds, then turning their backs to them, then just stopping to take a beating, ignoring the path you gave it to get out safely to your incoming fleet of warships, which will also just take their own sweet time getting there.  Overall, it's very frustrating and I've reloaded a few times to anticipate a better outcome.

Design decisions on the GUI and interfaces don't help much either.  They're functional, but clumsy and nothing that foster a good working environment to manage an empire with.  But they do give you quite a bit of control over all the products you'll be producing and shipping all over the place.

And you can boot any of the pilots out though and fly any ship you want, which is pretty cool.  Each ship has it's own cockpit and look and feel in how it performs, and you can upgrade them and swap parts out to build the type of ship you want or can afford.  This is probably the best part of the game.  You can actually ignore the empire building if you wanted and just get ships through the repeatable quest system.  I haven't messed with it much, but seems workable in some degree.

You very quickly learn, however, that every station is the same.  Every one has the same stations, the same elevators that go between them, and it's all very generic.  And as I said, the AI is braindead most of the time.  Sure, you can setup ships to do automated things like mining and trade, and that all works pretty good, until it doesn't, then you're left scratching your head trying to figure out why.  The tutorials don't really go into the nuances of the game.  There are tons of options and various ways of doing things, but sometimes they'll work, sometimes they wont, and then you have find another way to do stuff.  

You usually can though, and that's where, I guess, I give it a yes vote.  It's totally playable and you can spend many hours managing an empire for war or for trade, whatever suits you, or maybe even a little bit of both.  In the end, with around 150 hours played and feeling like I've still a long way to go on just my first game, I have to give it a yes.

The game is almost unplayable, unless you pilot your own ships. Egosoft, if you care a bit about the players, please fix the AI. Sure, DLCs will put money in your pocket, but that won't work long-term.

First of all, I should mention that I want to like the game. I hope one day to give this game a thumbs up, but I'm not convinced that day will come. I didn't find previous games polished enough. The community is great and steps in, but I would prefer not having to use mods. I hope Egosoft will prove me wrong and deliver a great game. X4 has huge potential.

I find X4 very enjoyable at first. It is easy to get lost in the game world for hours and be astonished by the level of immersion. And then you get to own a fleet/stations and have to rely on the AI... I've lost so many ships, credits and time due to this. I find it less annoying to not build an empire and just control a few ships myself...

Just to name a few problems. Destroyers dance around xenon capitals instead of using their main guns. Ships fleeing into xenon sectors, ensuring their destruction. Losing 2 AI controlled manticores (~10MM credits) and only getting about 5 small wrecks - at least they could have prioritized the medium wrecks, but that's another matter. A fleet of behemoths causing friendly fire because they all gathered into a small point in space when ordered to attack a station (in v5.0, after the so called ""fix"" to destroyers attacking stations). The only part of the AI that is decent is fighter behavior. Everything else will dissapoint sooner or later. It is simply too unreliable.

Besides the useless AI, there are also some bugs (getting stuck into stations/asteroids/gates, falling through the ship deck, visual bugs for NPCs). These are less of a problem after the main plot, but I had to reload old saves 2-3 times before finishing the main plot.

Finally, there are also parts of the game that need improvement. Why can't I report bugs from the game (with automatic savegame/logs upload)?! Why are ship modifications random?! Why are paint jobs single use items instead of ""blueprints""?! Why do I keep finding hidden mechanics after so many hours into the game?

Sure, you can build an empire, but what's the point?! It feels lonely to be the only (somewhat) capable being in the galaxy. And yes, you can eventually build ships for free and not care about losses, but that's not how I like to play. I can't think of another 50$ (or even 25$) game with such major issues 3 years after launch. And what does Egosoft do? Launch Tides of Avarice introducing new (buggy) mechanics... couldn't think of a better term than ""avarice"" to describe Egosoft's strategy.

You build a station that refines mined ores of any kind. For most normal human beings, this would be a straightforward thing: Your miners mine, fill the cargo space of your station and your station processes stuff and sells it.

Now in X4 this is as follows:
The moment the production unit of your station is built, your station will casually, fully automatically, without request or cancellable orders, basically without any form of human agency, start to contact all surrounding sector's traders and buy its cargo hold full and starts to bill you millions in upkeep.

So you say: Alright, bad ui design, lets disable buy orders.
Except you cant disable buy orders for several reasons.
Reason a.) is that there is literally no such option, only a bunch of sliders to adjust the amount you want to buy and for how much you want to buy it, but where it starts to spiral into outer space and get completely removed from sanity: 
Reason b.) Your miners, in fact are working based on buy orders. That is to say, if you screw up the buy orders, in any fashion that would stop the station from importing goods, your miners will stop mining as well.

Or lets take another example: Crew skills.
For any normal human being this would mean that your npcs, your characters, your whatever, gain xp over time. In X4 this is a loot box cause whenever characters complete an assigned task, they have a % chance to gain xp, which may or may not be entirely disabled by your presence and god's will at random.
I had a miner, mining for 50 hours, and it didnt gain a single skill point.

Or lets take another example: Looting item drops
You'd assume you get auto looting or some fancy system like drones or tractor beams to do your work for you. Not in X4 sir. You gonna hold the O button till you start hearing your trash vacuum cleaner, then while you hold it, you press M to open your map, then you right click individual drops and set autopilot to it, and then you turn on the auto pilot, and dont even dream of letting go of the O key cause you cant even turn it back on unless you exist the map screen.

I have been gaming since the 90s. Started with a 286 XT that had barely anything running on it beside the bios's basic programming language.
Im using steam since 17 years, and... lets just say i played a few games during all this time.
So trust me when i say that X4 is a trashpile of such proportions that its basically one of a kind.

Its not the graphic, graphic is decent
Its not the sandbox, sandbox is pretty good
Combat is meh, but you can still have your fair share of fun with it
You can design and mod your ships, you can run capitals, carriers, etc etc etc

But what essentially kills X4 is the... i dont even know. Rationality? Common sense? Sanity? That lies behind the UI and structuring of internal commands and functions of the game.
If i had to make a guess, this was designed by someone who has clearly had some sort mental illness, and im not even saying this as an insult.
When you try to get something to work here, all common sense goes out the window.
Its like you enter the world of a schizophrenic.

The entire game is in essence a ""work around the developer's mental illness"" simulator.
You try to write your own buy and behaviour commands and scripts to battle the utter trash that the developers puked out as a released product.

X4 is currently at version 6.10
From my play through, i would rate it 0.6 alpha test version
I have no idea who designed the internal command system of the game, but i hope they get all the help they need cause i personally wanted to off myself after 100 hours of interacting with what they created.

Problem number one comes from how little is explained in game. Half of the tutorials are broken, most descriptions don't clarify any of your questions, and I believe I spent half of my playtime on google trying to figure out how something works. You'll need to rebind half of your controls too and mess around with your settings extensively. This really is a huge problem with the game and annoyed me for a long time, but you do work past it eventually.

Problem number two however is why I don't recommend buying the game. The base game is lacking so much, it feels empty of any purpose. I think in my 47 hours so far I only actually found two 'story' missions, that being the HAT vs SCA plot and getting your HQ and research. I get that it's a sandbox game but it really lacks any direction at all, would it be too much to have any kind of long term goals built in or some more story? I feel no motivation to build up my fleet or improve my station(s), why would I? Look Egosoft, this isn't minecraft with its myriad of plugins, servers, modes and things you can invent and do without a story or missions. Would you enjoy playing Skyrim if it had no quests at all, you just went off and killed things and levelled? For a time, but it feels tedious and gets old fast. This is my issue.
Looking at the price and the focus the developers have placed on the large number of DLCs it feels like the base game only exists to try and get you to buy the DLCs for content. It simply doesn't feel like a finished game by itself, it has all of the mechanics but little to no content. Like Egosoft decided that the base game had enough that they could frankly abandon it to focus on only DLC. And for £40 for the base game and £12.50 for each of the four DLCs totalling £90, that's a huge price tag and to me feels exceptionally greedy.

I do wish that the AI factions would actually have more organized militaries, as right now it really just feels like a handful of ships come in at awkward times to fight each other. Every so often I can see 2 terran capital ships (Asgard & Tokyo with no fighters lol) moving generally in the same direction, but they dont seem to stay in a formation nor wait for each other. Having an actual battle squadron and/or battle fleet prepare then go through the gates would be awesome to watch. This could be related to economy issues I generally see in my games where there are massive shortages in hull parts and other resources used to build stations and ships that end up crippling some of the nations, but I havent gone far enough in the game to where I am pumping out a lot of resources for them to use. 

As a last major grievance (TERRAN QUESTS SPOILER): As of the last time I did it, when the Terran questline gives you the Syn to help Intervention attack the Yaki, it felt very messy and unfinished. It just sends an asgard and tokyo out to invade their systems, and numerous times I've seen them just completely fail without player help, and bug out as the marker brings you to a random fighter or small ship, which I am only able to fix using a cheat mod to kill the ships until no ship of the fleet is left, which will then spawn a new fleet (I think). With player intervention with only the Syn (as you would think), the invasion was very hard. Many times I would savescum, around 15 times until I finally was able to finish off the Yaki.

All in all, its a very good game with lots of content tucked away inside, however there are also a decent amount of things in the game that feel very unfinished and the lack of advanced documentation for a lot of things hurts alot. Hell, a decent amount of inventory items dont even have descriptions. Despite all of its issues though, the game still sucks me in with the idea of eventually fielding a fleet and forming my own form of nation (which cant be done, but you can effectively own systems and have fleets transfer resources to different places, as well as military ships and fleets to defend).

I didn't buy it on Steam so there's no official record, but I'm certain that I logged 2x-3x as many hours as I did on X4. Not that it was a better game. I'm just not as interested in this type of game as much as I was back then. X4 is just as good of a game, and maybe even better than X3 was. I may not have logged as many hours, but I certainly got more than my money's worth. Any game that I can play for over 1000 hours is a good game in my book.

The only real drawback that I don't like about the X series is an issue that is shared among both X3 and X4. The way the games handle OOS combat (When the player is Out Of the Sector that the AI ships are in) is what usually kills the experience for me at some point. Ships and loadouts that work great IS (When the player is In Sector with the AI ships) usually falls on their face when OOS.

I believe that this is a limitation of the current level of software/hardware technology and not necessarily a defect in programming. The amount of calculations that the CPU would have to do to have real time actions in every sector of the game at once would likely cripple even the best gaming computer that can be built right now. But this limitation is still immersion breaking to me.

I would not let this dissuade me from purchasing the game again. This is not an issue that many players would notice and it may not bother a lot of the players that do notice. I don't usually start noticing until I am 100's of hours into the game. But I also get real deep into the logic of the game. For example, I like making my own scripts to essentially create my own AI.

I'm done. There's plenty of other reviews to read if you want to hear more positives about the game. You will either like it or you will not. It can be a very difficult game to learn if you've never played them before. It is certainly not casual friendly.

It scratches every itch in terms of atmosphere and holds many of Star Citizen's flagship features without the game-breaking problems.  This alone makes me highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys grand strategy games like Stellaris.  Some cons, though, don't expect this to be an Elite Dangerous-like experience playing as a sole ship; the game intends for you to at least have a small trading, mining, or salvaging fleet to fulfill your role in the galaxy and experience the whole game.  As for another con, the AI has quirks that can become annoying in combat, but a lot can be alleviated with the mod ""KUDA's AI Tweaks"" on Nexus Mods.  Unfortunately, this game has another problem, THE START; the start of the game is cool in concept, being that you're a lone wolf or a generally unknown entity in the galaxy.  The problem is with the execution, I'm still working on my first playthrough currently, and I started with the ""Young Gun"" start.  This start throws you into the galaxy with an awful ship, and my main gripe is how hard it is to get missions.  For some odd reason, acquiring most of the game's missions requires you to scan/linger around station exteriors.  A mission board and greater mission variety with missions like bounties would go a long way to mitigate this problem.  Once you get your second ship and the PHQ (which you most likely will have to look on the internet to get the quest for), the game gets into a great flow which sucks your time away.  Another nitpick about the game is the lackluster explosions for bigger stations and ships.  Overall, if the game had a better tutorial/introduction, I could see it being one of the most popular space games out there.

1.in game tutorials tell you that youre able to do something or have text flair but lack actual context that makes them tutorials ie how where and what. 

2. controls, the best comparison game to this is probably avorion for ship building, trading and empire building and yet its ship controls are margins better than this games lol the starting key binds are abhorrent to all other space flight simulation games that ive played so far. still wasnt and currently isnt a deal breaker in of itself, just a tedious learning experience.

3. weird balancing, mainly with mission difficulties, very easy and easy are exactly that, easy and pay very little. once you jump up to medium however, seems to be a deathtrap unless you have a  small fleet or a destroyer. i was lucky and managed to get a enemy factions medium patrol ship with lvl 2 and 3 components and yet even with that ship im unable to do most my medium missions without risking losing my ship halfway through. Random encounters are pretty similar, you tend to come across weaker ships but theres alot that basically destroy you once they hit you even with a medium ship with lvl3 shields. honestly cant give a review on higher quests since im stuck with one ship and quests that pay 1/300th the price of another escort ship to help me take on medium quests. (ive tried taking over ships but they tend to just flee or refuse long enough to call for high level backup) leaving me with just a sense of tedious work rather than fun.

4. and finally, just generally tedious, doesnt seem to be a way to automate mining crews or trade missions leaving you to micromanage every ship in your fleet. Money making seems to elude me aswell as the best thing ive done is just sit outside of a gateway taking out xenon ships one by one and gettign payed by the local faction. quests like i say above are tedious and imbalanced seeming. Trade runs with cargo vessels seem to be essentailly worthless until late game from the letsplays ive watched and as theres no trades with a ratio for inventory size vs cost that seems to even be worth trading( best one is for like 1300 credits and can maybe scrape a extra 200$ off of another station leading to less income than easy quests). lockbox quests are even more so annoying as they have virtually no health and you have to shoot the locks off to open them(also thanks to reddit for telling me how to actually do it siince the game doesnt lol) I had to reload multiple times to not fail it but luckily some awesome person in the workshop made Qol things so i dont have to reload to even attempt to succeed(load times are worse than late game skyrim characters lol).

the keybinds to accelerate and decelerate get weird, along with wanting to move your camera you must either press CTRL X to move your orientation with the mouse, or hold leftclick, which is a mighty pain if wanting something to enjoy for the long run

you are unable to keybind anything to shift, ctrl, or leftclick.
your primary fire is spacebar
secondary fire is R
trying to change any of the controls to be even remotely user friendly is met with hard walls, blocking user input rather than letting you actually change settings.

I have given this game years to develop, solve bugs, and to become what I hoped it would be... and Egosoft have come very close to producing an expensive version of what I desired.
I hope that you, dear reader, will continue to support Egosoft and buy this product. Someday... perhaps a long, long time from now, and in a galaxy far, far away this game will be good. They have the recipe, they just need to execute (and use math, for goodness sakes, the numbers are all over the place with no rationale to explain how they arrived at the final value). 

My primary call is for Egosoft to rebalance ships and weapon classes; there is too much useless crap (ships and guns) for you to have time to swim through the process of discovering how much of it is useless. Allow me to shorten your journey, dear reader: use Paranid ships, split engines, terran shields, and pulse lasers on everything. Done. Happy vanilla hunting! Malkovich-Malkovich! People will say to try VRO; I did, and it was crap. Total and utter crap, which is why the guy that makes it doesn't get paid to do so. Egosoft does get paid, so they cannot afford to make crap.

Gameplay: 2/5
Combat is... lackluster. It requires so much offline research to figure out what actually works (who has in-game money and time enough to test every combination?) Different weapons are different, but that is the extent of it; if you only had the basic non-military equipment license and fitted pulse lasers and turrets on everything you'd do just fine (probably a lot better than using certain other ""military"" loadouts/weaponry). It's fun enough to blow stuff up, but something fundamental has changed; I am not sure if weapons do less damage than in X3, or if shields and hull are better, but the result is it feels ponderous even in S class vessels. The balance between ships is... not right; it is very easy to kill a large ship with a small ship (just takes time), but the reverse scenario is not true (even your 10 flak turrets might take 3 minutes to shoot down a single Xenon N). The old games felt more deadly, and the feedback (audio and visual) used to be commensurate with the punishment you were taking; now you can die to the sound of *ping, ping* with no visual effect, or inexplicably expire with no sound at all but a screen so bright with lasers and bursts of light that it's impossible to tell what's happening in this beautiful game. 

The AI has become a decent enough challenge, but it relies on the Xenon Capital Ship superiority to appear that way.

Fleet management is fun until you give attack orders and watch in horror as your carefully crafted fleet gets annihilated by two Xenon K's or an I, despite having superior numbers. You can learn to control the big ships (L class destroyers) and actually snipe from distance to great effect, but it is ponderous and intensely boring to me. I want to feel action, to feel the station blowing up. I used a Rattlesnake to kill a Xenon Defense Station and it took me 3.5 hours of semi-continuous firing (I take regular breaks, getting old so I can't just hold the fire button down for an hour at a time like a youngster).
Building stations is a labor in going bankrupt (due to unrealized costs - build an L container and watch in awe as your station requires 30 million credits to fill it with goods) and dealing with a funky visible/invisible objects interface that gets clunkier the bigger your stations become.

The economy is intensely ""fiddled with"", which veteran players and forum-goers are aware of but new players might find horrifying. The Terran economy is so simplified as to be an Easy Mode for the player that focuses on using Terran components. This upsets me. Human supremacy is not far off from... other things.

Graphics: 4/5 
Pretty enough; this is the one thing they did well. Now, if only they'd kept the old game and ONLY updated the graphics we'd have something worth playing.

Sound: 3/5
Ok. I like explosions and these are a bit muted, but still satisfying.  This next part is not quite sound related; however, the game warns you that the capital ships have a tremendous explosive range upon destruction, but losing 1 million credits worth of laser towers to a single explosion is upsetting. The music score is not quite varied enough; you will be conscious of how often it loops/repeats. I intensely dislike the station announcements; it's an opportunity to be funny, and they failed to do so... instead it's just annoying, especially the crackling music at the Shipyard upgrade (where you apply mods) can't be intentional (it sounds distorted and crackly in a way that is incredibly unpleasant to the ears).

Entertainment: 2/5
Using a random seed is the best you can hope for, for a slightly altered Universe.
This could be a 5, but their execution of systems are so obviously broken that once you arrive at a new gameplay stage I promise that you will be disappointed with what you discover you can/have to do.

Replay value: 3/5
Once you figure out that the random seed affects which sectors the Xenon invade (and the population of the initial station types, per faction) then you can get something from this. Just don't use the same seed, unless you believe in prophecy.

I have had several crashes-to-desktop, and several times where the game just hung/froze, which has only recently improved with the Boron expansion. So apparently they can figure out certain game-breaking things, it just takes a few years for them to resolve.

The AI is really good at balancing the economy, I didn't enjoy Eve as there were too many tryhards running 6 accounts being much more powerful than I was and coming from a pvp standpoint you would get CRUSHED if you didn't play 8 hours a day lol. Combat is more simple, you shoot your guns they shoot theirs let's see who wins. Theres no complex systems like frameshift interdictors to prevent a ship from running away or system hacks to stop movement etc. However it is heavily compensated by the complex political system the game has to offer. Factions will fight together to control galaxies and you will enjoy taking a side fighting war. Their factories need ship parts and metals and gases and you will be mining, building giant bases and feeding their economy with this. There are plenty of ship variety and esthetics, factions all have their unique types of architecture and lore. There are light main quests to keep your entertained while your other ships make money for you. 

I'm having a BLAST playing this game, recommended.

CONS ? : make sure to save VERY often cause if your ship gets destroyed, yes you can ask one of your miners or spare ships to come pick you up but it's a massive loss of time and money so most of the time you will soft reset. In eve online you would buy an insurance for your ship and get a par of the money back and get it built again which is a feature that I appreciated. Map is much smaller than other games however since you will run a giant business economically it's a good thing to know your sectors and the such. And the map is still very big, we're comparing 1:1 ratio with the GALAXY in elite which is probably the biggest map in gaming history so don't be disappointed by that.

- The interface and controls are painfully clunky, and I'm no stranger to clunky interfaces. For me, this is the main deal-breaker for me. Most of the several hours I've played, I've spent trying to navigate the menu system. It's horrible, and desperately needs an overhaul.
- Similarly, the controls suck. I want to use a controller to fly around, but I HAVE TO left click on the station right infront of me to select it. I can't bind that to my controller. WHY!?
- The performance is poor - game apparently only uses one core, so works your CPU hard, no matter how many you have. Why would you develop a game these days to not utilise multi-core CPUs?
- The game requires a huge amount of time spent on YouTube and on forums just to learn some of the basics. I don't mind this, but this game takes it to a whole new level.
- The bugs. Oh the bugs and glitchyness. Even the tutorials often break or fail to works as intended. Getting through these alone was painful enough, not to mention the game itself.
- The AI is awful. Hilarious at times, but most of the time just annoyingly dumb. Especially when you kit out a trader vessel, only for it to run straight into an area full of enemy ships, and boom, there goes your hard earned cash.
- Oh I died early game, now what - respawn? Nope, I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere with a puny jetpack and limited oxygen, ready for a drawn out death. Better reload an earlier save game then. Oh great, the last autosave was an hour ago. What should I do game? Oh apparently my ""options may be limited"". Helpful...
- You can play the game like a space sim, but honestly, Elite Dangerous does this aspect far better than X4. You play X4 more for the strategy / management side, else there's no reason to choose this over ED.

It's a shame, X4 is a great concept and is a truly unique experience. I really gave this game a proper go, and did start to get some enjoyment out of it. Docking with a station and walking out of your ship is cool, but the novelty wears thin quick. And after a long, frustrating session, I feel mentally drained and cannot muster the energy to play any more of it.

Story is good, graphics are great, variety of ships fighters to capital ships you can own and pilot yourself, the music score is very good, many things can be expanded with mods. If you can pick up the game with all the DLC on sale it might be worth your time.

However before you buy know these things:
[olist] [*] [b] The game does not use hyper-threading well, infact as far as I understand the game uses 2-3 cores regardless of how many you have. [/b] So you especially in late game when you have many ships and stations the CPU bottleneck is going to be especially noticeable even  if you are rocking a RTX 4080 or 4090 you are still going to have certain sectors somewhat lacking in the FPS department.
[*] [b]The AI scripts are terrible. Its been 5+ years and Egosoft has never fixed its broken mess of a game and never will. [/b] They just think if they keep adding features (albeit bug ridden) people will keep buying the game rather than fixing whats already there.
[*] Going back to the AI scripts, the trader AI sucks. I have an issue where my AI traders will take 5-10% (regardless of the AI behavior) of a ware, go off, and do ONE TRADE, then come back, take another 5-10% and rinse and repeat. This makes making money very difficult and slow, as well as keeping your own stations properly supplied as they pitch running your own Faction as a selling point of this game. However if you manually order a trader to 100% fill its cargo hold it will do dozens of trades until its empty then come back and take 5-10% and do one trade.  [b]Once you have 150+ traders and miners manually babysitting every ship is very tedious, keeping you from really efficiently playing the game or running your own faction. [/b]
[*] So the Poor AI affects making credits efficiently, but also deliveries of goods between your stations. But what will also drive you crazy is the Autopilot AI and combat AI. Constantly running into other ships, crashing into stations, plowing right into asteroids. When one of your capital ships runs into an asteroid usually you can kiss your engines and turrets goodbye for 15-20 mins while repair drones fix it. Also even if you do a coordinated station attack, your ships are supposed to line up and hold position firing with capital guns. But often they do not even bother using the capital ship weapons, instead moving in close to a target to be destroyed by turrets and drones. 
[*] The AI pathing of NPC controlled ships is also bad, it leads to you losing a lot of ships as a fleet working together is not very efficient. Your ships often spend more time uselessly navigating than efficiently fighting. [/olist]

So yeah initially you will enjoy the game, but once you run into these AI issues its going to break your immersion and make commanding your forces and [b] running your own faction a huge micromanaging nightmare [/b] and for me it kills my enjoyment of the game. Its been 5+ years and these shortcomings are never going to be fixed and most cannot be fixed by mods. So buyer beware!",1688801811,1688801811,False,113,4,0.836622059345245361,7,True,False,False

The controls are very ""unique"".  Just because you've played every other space game, don't even think you will be able to step right in and pick X4 up on the first try.  It just will not happen.  There is so much to do and control, you'll need a lot of patience in learning the game.  I wish Egosoft would have put more consideration into their Help Menus and Configuration.  I'm convinced the game controls can be so much better, and yes... more intuitive.  A space game shouldn't take you very long to learn.

The WORST part about the game, in my opinion, has GREATLY IMPROVED, and that is the tutorial.  Tutorials OUGHT to hold you by the hand and since its earlier releases EGOSOFT has taken the time and effort to detail out the tutorials.  Experienced X-Series gamers are not the ones who are usually going through the tutorials: it's the newbies who just spent hard earned money with the hopes of playing a great game.

A confusing patchwork of tasks that cost more credits than you get (getting a different, worse ship all of the sudden- Terran Cadet Scenario- after the ridiculous warp - Kukri into idk, having to build station elements without credits after 3hours of playtime, paying for mission items (Satellites))
Then you get a ""medium"" mission. You have to destroy an ambush of 5-6 Xenon ships. With some backup. But they instantly die. And you have to fight them with an S(mall) class ship with 1! beam weapon (that doesn't have range or does any damage), and you die in seconds.

The UI is atrocious. 
The mission window goes from the left end of the screen to the right end. Without a border. The rest feels like a text based UI.

Combat against the AI is just a numbers game. Or who got the bigger one.

I just got my police license for one of the major factions. Few patrols later I got a shady mission from an other faction asking me too use my contraband investigation skills and my license in a different way. They wanted me to scan cargo of competing factions to see how many units of silicon they were transporting. So I used my police license to scan their opponents and report back to them any units of silicon found. Very rewarding mission with zero danger involved.

X4: Foundations is the most impressive, ambitious and biggest in scope space sim I've ever played in my life. It is also one of the jankiest video games I've ever played, with a lot of bugs and other things that will test the limits of your patience. Which ever one will end up being the winner for you, I cannot really say since it depends on how much you love the space sim genre, how much time you're willing to devote to learning a complex video game, and how resistant you are to things like bugs, interface labyrinths, and general jank.

There is too much to talk about, the game is just too massive so I will try to give some highlights to have you understand what it is you're getting yourself into.

[h2] Wide as an ocean, deep as a sea [/h2]

First off, the scale. You know how Star Citizen has a bad reputation for feature creep and being too ambitious, causing it to still be under development and maybe even never release? Well, X4 is in a lot of ways EVEN MORE ambitious than Star Citizen, but here the game actually exists and you can play it. If that sounds too good to be true, I assure you it is not. X4 is an absolute giant of a video game, there is no other space sim out there that does as much as this game, on this large a scale. Massive fleet battles of ships of all sizes, where you can command your AI pilots to do things? Check. Building your own stations and actually being able to dock them and walk around them? Check. Starting your own empire and playing the game like it's an RTS? Check. A simulated economy where every trader and miner matters? Yup. Don't want all that noise and want to just fly a small ships and do story missions and dogfight? Check. This game truly lets you do just about everything you could want from a space sim, the only thing missing would be flying to actual planets, but let's not be greedy, eh? You can still terraform them though!

[h2] Rougher than Moon's surface [/h2]

That sounds amazing, so where's the catch? The catch is twofold. First part is really simple: the game is rough around the edges. VERY rough. Think Skyrim levels of bugs and weirdness. Yup, that's the level we're operating at. Your autopilot will occasionally crash you with a station and your ship will try to merge with it. AI pilots will sometimes do really stupid things and fly your really expensive ships right into their doom, or refuse to correctly point their guns at the enemy. The game may simply crash (although only had that happen once). Quests will get stuck and you won't be able to complete them. We're talking major issues that have actual in-game consequences, and you will be seeing those fairly often. 

Fortunately the worst of them are still very rare, in my 200 hours of playtime I only had one instance of a hard crash and one time where my story quest got stuck and I was not able to complete it. But smaller things like AI being stupid, ship hitboxes interacting weirdly, things like those will happen fairly often. To the point where you stop perceiving them as weird and they just become a part of the game.

[h2] Where's my PHD? [/h2]

Second part of the catch is the sheer amount of time you'll have to put into learning how the game works. The fact that the game is incredibly vast and complex is both it's biggest strength, and also the biggest reason majority of the people who try this game will bounce off it. There are a few games worth of menus here to learn, a wealth of mechanics that are not very well explained or not explained at all, and the game doesn't care you're new. You will be thrown into deep water and expected to figure it out. And since it's a sandbox game primarily, you need to understand what you can do and how you can do it before you can actually start enjoying the game. The game REQUIRES you to devote substantial amount of time in order to understand what it is all about, and then another substantial amount of time to learning how to do all the different things that can be done. 

To have you understand better: I have played this game for 200 hours, supplemented my learning process with lots of youtube videos that help teach the game, and I still feel like I am behind in knowledge in terms of the actual veterans of this game. I am still learning things regularly that I didn't know before. Heck, a lot of ""issues"" people complain about on the Steam discussion boards and reviews (not all of them, but definitely a lot) are simply due to not understanding how a mechanics works or doing something incorrectly (things like boarding for example). That's how much there is to learn here, and how fiddly some of it can be to make work properly.

[h2] A rough journey with a big payoff [/h2]

So, after all of this, what's there at the end of all that hardship? A diamond of a game. At it's current state it's one of a kind video game that will give you an experience you cannot find anywhere else. If you're able to tolerate all the roughness and able to overlook shortcomings that I honestly think are unavoidable in a game of this magnitude, this could easily be considered the greatest space sim to come out to this date. At the same time it's a game that only a small segment of people will actually enjoy, because of a huge barrier of entry. But, if you are able to get through that barrier... there is something truly special on the other side of it. 

It's like going to a restaurant where the waiters are rude, cooks are shouting, seats are uncomfortable, and you have to wait 2 hours for your food. But then you get served the best damn meal you've had your whole life. It is one of those rare games that will let you experience things so incredible you might completely forget or simply be willing to dismiss a myriad of it's issues, simply because what is there is so great and full of wonder that even game breaking glitches are not enough to ruin the fun you're having. Don't believe me? Read other reviews, they are full of personal stories of wonder and adventure, only to be found in this game.",1687828593,1688341464,True,94,0,0.877393722534179688,3,True,False,False

X3TC/AP were among my favorite and most played games, but I feel that X4 has now eclipsed them in every area.  
       Breadth with Depth:  With 130 Sectors, spread amongst over a dozen factions this is a large universe.  Each sector is like a city unto itself, with dozens of stations, resource opportunities; each station can be docked at, walked about and sentient beings interacted with.  With the full complement of ships from each faction there are now hundreds of ships to choose from with nearly unlimited upgrade options for shields, chassis, engines, weapons.  One can simply switch out weapon types for each mount, or add engineering modifications of different levels to further enhance performance.  There are limitless missions available at various challenge levels spread evenly across mainy domains, from simple personnel transport, to cargo deliver, to escorts, attack craft, and many other areas.  
       Strong Storyline and supporting missions:  The storylines have grown from fairly pitiful at release to very well done, very complex, interwoven to a point and add nearly limitless new things to do.
	Freedom:  X4 is like Mount and Blade in space.  You start a nobody with nothing, and you chart your own course.  You could just be a miner and find success.  You could be a business tycoon.  You could be a freelancer trying to raise capital to build your own ship-building station.  With the DLCs you can almost use your political connections and gifts to make that a career.  For each path there is so much freedom; you can design your own stations and build them where ever you like (if you have the capital).
	Replayability:  With the simulated economy and randomization of starting conditions, every playthrough is unique.  In some playthroughs the universal enemies (Xenon or Kh'aak) will trash whole sectors, in others they will have little impact.  Factions will war which can also shift everthing.  Even with all my hours in the game, there are still many things I haven't done-- for example terraforming.  
	Interface / Automation:  Still not perfect, but the ability to control formations and do routine tasks has improved greatly since release and is now at an acceptable point.
	Graphics/Immersion:  The graphics for this game are very good and quite beautiful, which leads to an immersive environment.  Performance is not perfectly optimized, but it has also improved since release.  The addition of strong story characters and more dialog options has added to boost immersion, an area that was very weak at release.",1688251108,1688251108,True,5,1,0.553161263465881348,0,True,False,False

The problem being that it would just randomly fly and spin around in space forever.

I'm only downvoting this because the game is listed as having full controller support when it clearly does not!

Seeing it was listed as such, I had hoped that they made a proper controller input scheme for X4. Even if it was not as fast as K+M. But some basic things just can't be done on a controller. You cannot target things in front of you like you would with the left click mouse button. So for example, you can't go to an asteroid field and select asteroids like you would with a mouse.

This is 100% ""partial controller support."" Not full. And it should be labeled as such.

Your courier fleets are constantly moving wares from one station to another while fighters, frigates, gunboats, and carriers are rolling off the line ready to reinforce.
Your trading fleet are constantly on the look out for the best galactic deal and are trekking the beaten tracks from NPC station to NPC station trading goods and building alliances.
Your home defence squadrons patrol your borders repelling invasions leaving the husks of vessels floating through space awaiting the time your lazy salvagers decide whether they undock to drag the blasted hull in for reprocessing.

I would liken this game to Mount and Blade: Warband in space.
I love M&B and was really trying to find something along the same lines.
The basics being I wanted a game where you start off as some small timey nobody who can eventually amass an empire of NPCs to do my bidding.
I really enjoy games where you can essentially automate NPCs to do tasks you can do yourself. 
Don't get me wrong, the NPC are peanuts and are seemingly abysmal at flying and make very questionable decisions at the best of times, but that is the same for the enemy NPC as well.

Now when I looked on the steam forums to see if other people were having this issue, it turned out that YES, a ton of people were having issues with crashing. Now the solution that was given was that their PSUs were faulty and that they should just replace that, its a cooling issue or some other insidious problem with the user's hardware. 

Now, there is a number of problems with that response. 
1. My PSU is completely fine because the computer didn't actually turn off when this happened, but did a complete restart at crash. I have a tempered glass case so I know that my computer didn't shut off for a moment. 
2. People are saying this is a heating issue, it likely isn't. I play games that raise my temps more than this game ever did. Funny thing is that my computer doesn't hard-crash when I play those games. Also that isn't how hardware works, since it this is the ONLY game were I am having this issue. Bad computer's don't just have a stroke when playing this particular game, and I actually saw people in the forums defending this game when someone made that clear to them. 
3. The game runs like ass. Now before someone says ""gEt A BetTtar pC BrUHv"" I want to make something clear. I have a RTX 2080, a Ryzen 7 processor, and a total of 24 gbs of RAM. The game has no business running this badly. Will it run great in space? Yes. Does it run like shit when you go into a station that doesn't even look that impressive, with player models that look like they came right from Gmod? Yes. And again, I surpass the recommended specs by a county mile. 

So in summary, none of these issues are due to things on my end, and since neither the developers nor the fan-base want to accept that, I can't recommend the game in good conscience. I think it might be more generative to not interrogate people about their hardware and instead focus on figuring out why the program is behaving like this.

But enough about my woes, since you're probably telling yourself ""Well I probably won't have those issues, just look at those reviews!"" and you're probably right. Chances are, for whatever reason, the game will run fine for you as it has for a majority of players. So how's the game? Well, lets get into the meat and potatoes. 

Every game has a promise to the player. In fallout, you are promised that you will have a hand in the events of the world around you and that you will become a powerful force in the gameworld itself while navigating challenges that are engaging to you, the player. Games like No Man's Sky promise a grand universe of adventure and opportunity. This game makes the promise of dropping you into a world of intrigues and space operas. The game says that you'll start as a lowly traveler in this universe, and through an exciting climb to the top, you could one day be emperor of the galaxy. So how does that pan out? 

Well for a start, the beginning missions are boring as they possibly can be. From running a character from one station to another, to clearing out minefields, to scanning for things that can only be detected form a subtle AUDIO cue, you'll be scratching your balls in boredom of the empty gameworld, the piss poor voice acting and the intermittent crashes. Not only that, but the availability of quests in the early game are disappointing. You'll find that many stations seem to be there for little to no reason. Some don't even offer you the ability to upgrade your ship, so that's a lot of fun. The story is drab, and so is the gameplay. 

I really wish I could recommend this game, especially after seeing videos of other folk's playthroughs and loving the idea and complexity that this game has to offer, but under the hood it's just a gigantic mess. Now I did open up comments, so if you have PRACTICAL solutions to the issue, please feel free to let me know.

Take for example, the Teladi - this species is portrayed as lizard people, who prioritize profits and greed above all else. While it may not be the intent of the developers, this description does remind me a lot of caricatures of Jewish peoples that have been harmful and demonizing in both past and present.

We can also look at another species, the Split - this species is portrayed as humanoids with honor being prized and dishonoring family or empire being worse than death. Further, this species is exclusively voice acted with broken English that mimics some pronunciation found in East/Southeast Asian languages.

This is not at all an exhaustive list of things that I see as potentially harmful, nor is it my intent to say one way or another if these species are racist caricatures.

Original review:
Every minute of those 33 hours on my record I've tried really hard to like this game. I failed.

Pros:
+ game looks pretty
+ music is really nice even as standalone soundtrack

Cons:
- UI looks like just some debug placeholder and is the most confusing UI I've ever seen (chaotically ordered, many unnecessary complicated functions, nothing is where it should be)

- chaotic map with many hidden functions (just try to sell a ship without looking on the internet how!)

- missions, even after 30 hours in a game I had to check on the internet not for the solution but just how to do basic things (for example: to finish standard delivery mission you have to SELL those goods .. what??)

- docking mini game is fun .. maybe 2 times, then is just annoying and navigation to landing area is glitching through walls which makes it even more annoying

- English voice acting is horrible

- character animations and glitches

- 3 inventories (really, why? .. maybe because that gives us extra 3 menus? .. each of them on different place!)

- inability to do many things remotely without walking through those empty stations over and over and over again",1599337958,1687617166,True,0,0,0.547082841396331787,2,True,False,False

That said, this is the sort of game that you can turn into a second job if you're not careful. It supports a wide variety of playstyles from the casual Han Solo style FPS pilot, to RPG-style completing quests and storylines, to grand empire building and complex industrial/trade styles. And if one gets a bit stale, you can easily dip your toes in another.

If you love Kenshi and want a space version, this is it. It's not the same game, but it has the same vibe. If you love the grand promise of Star Citizen but are frustrated with the current shallow state, this will fill the void. If you want a singleplayer Eve that you can pause and walk away from, this is it. If you grew up loving Elite on the C64 (like I did), this is its spiritual successor. Bannerlord with spaceships? Yep.

The visuals are ok (I suggest desaturating in the options to turn down the gaudy colours) and performance is pretty good on older systems. The developers are very active and mod support is excellent with both Workshop and Nexus thriving. It's not great for streamers as it can be quite a slow burn, but it's largely bug-free and most frustrations are down to player ignorance or can easily be fixed with the right mods. Replayability is high with different starts, dynamic generation and such.

This will push people away as todays generation has alot of people who want that instant gratifications and you're not gonna find that here. 

Once the controls and buttons are set up and you've completed the tutorials, id say, only then that's when the game actually starts, but even then, you're still learning so much about factions and missions and the this whole new world, so I encourage people to push through. 

After that is all done, I can say with confidence that this game gets really interesting and now I love it. I enjoy saving up money to buy a ship, hire a pilot and crew and give it a task, then sitting back and watching my ships automatically do my requests. You feel like a boss/manager. 

However, the combat is still fucking fun too! Like I said, I come from Elite Dangerous, so I know what im talking about! When my Gunboat reported that shes encountered Xenons? With joy I kicked the pilot out of the chair and immediately took over, fuck me! I had fun, locking on and blasting away. I really love the feel of the Auto-Turrets in this game, more so than what I have experienced in Elite Dangerous.

I love how there is so much factions to choose from and its not a simple game of ""You can be allies with everyone"" there is choices to make, because one faction will hate you more if you become more friendly with one of its enemies, which is good and realistic, helps with the sense of immersion, like the world is alive and interactive. 

I enjoyed unlocking reputation levels to have the license's to buy military ships and enforce the law in my ally's space zones. 

I am still so NOOB! Like, I literally JUST started the first module installation on a station and once again, I've en-courted another learning barrier. Constantly hitting Alt-Tab and google searching stuff like ""How to hire a builder"" or ""How do I use Long Scan"" Lol. 

You get dropped into this space and there is no MSQ, Its an open-world sand box feel. Which is sick, cause I feel like you can really customise this place. 

Graphics look amazing, I'd say they look as good as Elite Dangerous or even better, however the performance isn't as good as Elite Dangerous. In ED I can play on Max Settings without SSAA and be on 150-160 FPS @ 1440p res using a 3070Ti. 

On this game, deep space im on like 90fps and in the big stations im on like 40-60fps. 
But you can literally do so much more in this game and I feel like its way more alive and interactive. 

Star Citizen is a scam. Holy fuck that was a waste of money and time. So many bugs, bad performance, promised the world and delivered a dead pig.

  1) A million options for everything you want to do translates into 6 hours of trying to figure out how to fly the ship.  
  2)The graphics are poor.  Heads and bodies vanish, items vanish

  3)the controls are difficult, combat ai is a joke.  

  4)The game is full of bugs.  For me, the worst one is the map.  It keeps glitching on me, even with the graphics turned all the way down.  

  5)Load and save times are terrible. 

  6) Auto save only works when it wants to.  Good bye 4 hours of work because auto save decided to take a vacation

  7) The ai is so bad that you can't play any missions.  I look away for 5 minutes and they all turn retarded and die.  A whole area of the game, completely off limits because I am trying to protect what little I have accumulated. 

  8) The controls are not compatable with steam.  Many of the things you need to do brings up a steam menu, and ruins a timed run or gets you killed.  fail

   9) They build a series of levels you have to complete within structures, while most walls can be passed through accidentally or on purpose.  allowing you to simply walk through these or to fail because you got stuck in a wall.  This is not a finished game.  It was obviously never beta tested.  Quality is a 1 out of 10

  10) A million micro commands for your units means that fighters won't attack carriers to protect their carriers and transports think they're warriors.  You spend more time in the menu trying to fix the problems than playing the game.

  11) pirates will demand you drop your cargo, then attack if you do not.  If you send another ship to kill them, you lose rep and you are the criminal.  God forbid you stop someone from robbing you.

 12) The constant drifting of larger ships for no reason.

  13) The ai completely ignores my orders.  I will tell my destroyers to fire on the thing my carrier is tanking and I will look at my map and they are pointing their main guns away from it.  WHAT THE HELL.  Inexperienced programmers.

  14) freezing issues with game.  On large scale battles, game freezes.  Not my computer, the game.  My music and netflix still work, just not the game. 

  15) Game crashes constantly when I try and build a new base

  16)  being given missions then IMMEDIATELY failing.  Like kill turrets right next to this base...that the base will attack.  if the base attacks them then you lose.  Thanks for the game hitler.

  17) When I give a unit an order mid combat with a hundred fighters, I can't teleport to every ship to take the ship from your stupid ai.  When I give an order, do it.  I shouldn't have to go three deep into menu's for every fighter to get them to obey.  My ships, my rules.  They shouldn't be allowed to make the decision to to obey me or do what they think they should do.

  18)crashing.  did I mention crashing?  a ton.  combined with the forgetful auto save, you end up with loooong grueling fights that take hours sometimes, only to have to start them over again because the climax was too much for the program.  The strangest part of it all is that my computer doesn't even slow down while the game is freezing.  Feels like Windows ME again

  19) This game likes to pretend it's some kind of economics game, but you're the only one playing by those rules.  I auto saved and loaded many times to have a completely different scenario in front of me than I had before.  Ships and fleets would just appear out of nowhere and I would be left trying to kill 3 or 4 larger ships with a destroyer.  Go back and load game and go in with 3 battleships this time, because I know what's waiting for me.  Nothing there.  The game literally generates units in space for the express purpose of just making you lose ships.

  20) Blacklists.  Why add the option if your units are going to completely ignore them?  Hey guys, don't go here.  it's bad and you will die.  What, boss?  Go  here?  OKAY.  I have units going OUT OF THEIR WAY to go through blacklisted areas.  I have units mining in xenon controlled areas while there are closer places to mine.  WHY?  Because you can't program.

  21) ships getting stuck while undocking.  that is the end of that ships.   There is no fix.  The ship is simply gone.  hope you didn't spend a small fortune on it like I did.

Nothing like saving to go back and have it vanish, or send a ship to go do something for it to just be gone later with no report. The translation sounds like a German guy who took French for a year trying to order at an Italian restaurant.  The quests are not clearly explained AT ALL and if you don't have a good translation, you're just screwed.  There is no online community who seems to share information other than a few video's up trying to explain everything.  Menu's in menu's in menu's.  Some of these you have to access WHILE IN COMBAT.  Capital ships have huge blind spots you can just park a gunship in and fire till it dies.  Nothing like having your ship that is the size of a city getting absolutely demolished by a medium sized ship.  
  I cannot stress enough how much it ruins this game to have the ai ignore your commands and do whatever it wants.  Ships running away from protection because they get a little flee icon, can't get rid of it.  your game sucks.

  I was told that the game could be fixed with mods.  But every mod I downloaded changed the game in some way that a whole new set of issues would arise.  VRO was fun to kill capital ships with fighters, but that meant that your capital ships were vulnerable to fighters.  Every issue fixed created more issues.  The game just isn't playable until it is finished.  I guess the game makers in Germany just don't compare to American standards.

  The thing that saves this game is the community.  The players banding together and creating new and interesting mods for this game is what makes it playable.  Things like VRO, new weapons and ships, fixes for bugs and problems.  Auto looting, more efficient search commands, creating complex behaviors, fixing common problems, creating more parts to the map, even rebalancing the entire combat system to make it less boring.  The game creators should be falling over themselves thanking these individuals.  Without these people doing what they do, you have a buggy boring economy simulator game.  They all deserve recognition for what they have done for this game.  

   I hope they make better games in the future, but right now their content is trash.

  Playing beta, they made a lot of promises with 6.0.  But they make a lot of promises with all their releases.  So far I have more problems with their improvements than I did with their original game.  I hope they fix them.  I will not  hold my breath.

They came out with a brand new system!  it fixes all the minor problems while making more issues and problems.  Often times interfering with the main quest line.  Fixed a bug where you can accidentally fly through some walls sometimes and created a problem where you can not scan signal leaks or shoot triggers on the walls anymore.  Well done you morons.  lets just hope you don't fall through the floor of your ship when standing up before researching teleportation.

As of June 2023 Egosoft have still not fixed the issue with the Virpil throttle but there is a workaround.  X4 only recognizes a HOTAS with an axis that shows up as X-Y.  The Virpil throttle does not have an X-Y axis.  I fixed the problem by creating a virtual X-Y axis in the Virpil software.  So now the throttle is recognized and works fine.  Why Egosoft has not addressed this issue is beyond me.  Every other game/simulation I own (a lot of them) has no problem recognizing the Virpil throttle out of the box.  Egosoft really need to address this issue as not everyone who uses a Virpil throttle has the knowledge or willingness to create a virtual X-Y axis.

Can recommend to those who are looking for an economy building in space game.
As I just wanted to explore and to feel myself small argon in the galaxy I was literally forced to build 2 self sufficient shipyards, conquer a few sectors already taken by Xenons from Patriarchy and to protect most gates to Xenon sectors. Otherwise Xenons were tend to erase Patriarchy, Teladi and Hantiqua (sad, it looks like these 3 nations donated great part of their AI to Xenon and thanks god Terrans did the same, otherwise they would clean all Xenon sectors with a single cheating Asgard in the first hours of game).
With story line (which I started after about 300h of game play) is also almost impossible without building your own stations and empire.

You are who you choose to be. Pirate, smuggler, captain of industry, fighter pilot, grunt, trader... the list goes on. This is a sandbox game with story-driven elements and a litany of quests to help you drive the game forward, give you a sense of accomplishment, and help you earn some much-needed credits. 

The actual game has an intense learning curve. You will be deposited in the middle of space with no context and nothing to tell you what to do. That is both exhilarating and daunting if you have never played before as the scope and scale of this game are vast. It is well worth sinking 20 hours as a ""tutorial"" and then restarting the game when you know what to expect and have met all of the factions.

Underlying the game is the Xenon - an artificial machine race, much like the Borg, bent on eradicating life from the universe. They are constantly trying to overrun the galaxy and have multiple incursion sites which, after about the ten-hour mark, are constantly active and they employ bigger and deadlier ships as the game progresses, much like the AI empires. If you do not assist the AI in optimizing their economy, the Xenon will eventually wipe them out. They rely upon you to produce parts, effectively transport materials between stations, sectors, and even factions. As the game progresses, you can even begin to employ your own fleet of dozens, then hundreds, and eventually thousands of ships to stop the onslaught or make your own push into Xenon territory.

Outside of the Xenon, you may conquer sectors or claim unclaimed sectors, declare war or join an existing faction, and generally do whatever you want. There are even mods that let you play as the Yaki, Xenon, or Kha'ak, the three factions with which you are always at war in the vanilla game.

Word of advice - sink about 100 hours into the game before you download mods. There are some mods that people exult which drive me bonkers and some which I have deemed essential but others hate. It is a matter of preference. With that said, Egosoft is deeply committed to this game and it is still in active development years later with major updates (currently on 6.0) coming regularly. The vanilla game is truly a work of art. Full stop. There are things which are not great (fleet AI, for example) but they are easily tolerated as the rest of the game more than makes up for those frustrations.",1686931862,1686931862,True,149,1,0.931199789047241211,1,True,False,False

Overall, it is possible to wring a somewhat enjoyable X experience out of this game, like blood from a stone. The abysmal attention to basic quality-of-life problems, inexplicably favoring unnecessary pet projects in terms of development hours, is absolutely inexcusable (reminds one of X rebirth - a debacle from which they obviously failed to learn the lessons) - and that is what this will focus on.

All of the below constitute basic problems that have been identified by the community countless times on the forums, most several YEARS AGO and most could be fixed in a few hours of coding. 
Impossible to get a fleet of capital ships to simply fly in formation and attack targets within an FOV cone within range. This would seem to be easier to code than much of the ""AI"" behavior already there.
Ships will not fly in formation with the player (this is absolutely game ruining).
Inability to give ships default response to combat in a way that is remotely useful (all options break the game in many instances, thus requiring individual setup, see below).
Inability to change default orders for multiple ships at a time.
Intersection of the two above problems leads to overall game-breaking problem in terms of clicking through menus to manually configure all ships, or they constantly die.
Similar for stations, e.g. inability to remove auto-generated buy and sell orders.
Default orders for ships generally useless - fighters and corvettes easily stray 20+ km from anchor fleet, even when NOT set on intercept and die.
Almost identical problem with turret orders.
Intercept and other orders are NOT what they actually mean - interception is attacking incoming fighters that are attacking the parent capital ship, interception in x4 is suicidally attack anything within an enormous radius and dying. Similarly defense is attack anything that attacks the target, so a ship can chase an enemy multiple sectors away ""defending"" its parent.
Station behavior is absolutely beyond broken. Miners will be sent 5+ systems away to mine resources that are in the same sector, requiring manual individual configuration of every ship.
Station trading similarly broken - there can be lots of profitable trades for one ware, but it will instead fill all of its traders with smart chips failing to complete trades.
Associated potential connections to resource probes etc are totally meaningless and actually do nothing (but generate useless upkeep missions).
Ships will not adopt sub-formations (e.g. five capitals in a cross, each protected by a wing of fighters in delta).
AI capital ships inexplicably drain their entire (and very large) shield pool to ""boost"" their speed by ~10%. They are most likely to do this when it is least useful/appropriate.
Right clicking a ship in the world vs. in the map bring up different menus - ironically the orders you need to ship management in combat are NOT in the world menu (the one you would obviously want to use in combat) but all of the useless options you would never need in combat, and only need once in a blue moon if ever, are listed there instead (e.g. ""redesign"" to change the paint mod is there, but arm/disarm turrets is not).
The max one builder ship per station is incredibly stupid.
Station builder is simultaneously fantastic and an absolute nightmare - bad and over-aggressive snapping.
Patrol/police orders are essentially useless - ships assigned to these activities ignore ongoing attacks on your ships in the sector etc.
Lazy gamey Khaak mechanics - instantly appearing out of nowhere, bases respawn constantly, etc.

Pet peeves:
Betty given an accent
Initialising

Breakdown of default response to attack failure cases:
Use judgement leads to constant attacks on friendly factions and/or suicidal behavior
Flee leads to suicidal behavior and is basically useless since faster ships rarely escape slower ships unless they have enough shields to be effectively invincible against the attacker anyway. OOS attacks have ""sticking"" for no reason.
Attack of course leads to suicidal behavior
Because of this, ignore is ironically the only one that is usable - and of course leads to plenty of cases where this too is suicidally stupid. This same basic mechanic also leads to the same suicidal behavior for ships assigned to a commander, which is supposed to be the only way to control multiple ships at once.

[h1]THOUGHTS ABOUT THE GAME[/h1]

[b]As a seasoned player of Egosoft's X games I always approach the game as a sandbox. My primary goal is to build a self sufficient network of stations. Because in X4 stations are built in modules it seems more efficient to build MEGA stations that can produce at minimum the basic building materials in order to build other stations. In the old days each station used to serve a direct purpose such as making food or weapons. In X4 building a cross station network is frustrating because of how unreliable assigned ships behave. It's so bad in the game that one almost has to use mods to accomplish this task. It's really sad because it used to work so great in the old games and it was super easy to understand.

If you don't use mods you can still manage to get stations operating but it requires a good deal of babysitting. The end game for me is to take control of a bunch of sectors with a massive fleet or police the sectors keeping the peace until boredom overtakes the will to keep playing. This usually takes a few hundred hours for the truly hardcore[/b]

[h1]GOOD STUFF[/h1]

[b]I do enjoy the others aspects of X4 but Building and Trading is my Primary reason for playing.[/b]

[h1]BAD STUFF[/h1]

[b]My favorite part of X4 is the building and trading aspect of the game and this is where I'm going to be the most critical. This also carries the bulk of my feeling towards the game and where I put my highest weight into how much I like the game. So why is this thought under the bad category? Well because this is where the most borked part of the game lives sadly. 

It's truly frustrating especially thinking back to the original game and the first expansion where these things where never a problem. Interconnecting hundreds of stations was never a point of contention in the game. The trading vessels would simply do the job assigned to them unless they where destroyed. However mining vessels did not exist in that game only trading ships. You used to have to build a station around a giant asteroid which was much better in my opinion.

Don't get me wrong I like the idea of a station manager running each station and assigning ships to the manager if it actually worked well. But often the mining ships are too inefficient even with a maxed out manager and maxed ship captain. Assigning a trade ship to get needed resources for production hardly works. Assigning a trade ship to gather building materials is even worse. 90% of the time they will sit saying unable to find a resource. Which is why I try an bypass this frustrating process building a station that is self reliant.[/b]

You spend more time on YouTube trying to figure stuff out than you will be playing it, I know there is a legend for the map and encyclopedia but still it took time for me to find them, and I'm used to this series of game.

Managing stuff

The command and control aspect of it makes me think this is some poor attempt at a console port!
The commanding of the ships is OK, but still you don't have the flexibility as you did with X3.

Trading

The trade aspect has been dumbed down massively, there is a serious lack of Wares, or so it feels, it's very sterile everyone wants the same things to make the same things, the game is lacking variety (in my seed),
my main play style is 99% Trader / Empire builder, so I love to find a niche and make a big buy and sell, in this  the most I can find is little sales of £100k profit because every station needs the same stuff, so there is an abundance of basic stuff, the bigger ticket items are so slow at producing it's hard to trade them unless I build the empire to supply it all!

Combat

The ships are in dumbed down classes now (S,M,L,XL) Why?
Why can't I mix weapons from other races with other races ships? (Could do it on X3)
*I haven't done much combat as I don't enjoy it as much*

Performance! - Why performance?

I'n my gaming rig I play all my games in 4k, high settings, maybe have to tweak one or two things,
X4 on the other hand.. I can play for a good 4hrs before I'm starting to hit the 25fps mark, then within 30 mins it will eventually hit 1FPS! Reset and repeat!

Yes, I have looked online for fixes, updated system and drivers, have the game on my . M2 C drive, still no different, even if it stick it on 2k with low settings it chugs itself into a grinding halt! 

I'm ONLY 3 days in to a game (game time) X3 wouldn't be having this problem after a month! It's not even like I have a massive fleet yet, either! I have 7 Ships and 2 Stations! No active wars (that I started)

To be honest, I would suggest you keep your money and buy X3:AP it's the best you are going to get! This game could be 100% better if it wasn't so bad performance wise.



Forgot to add, The AI pathfinding is pronominal! They fly your multimillion credit ship straight into the side of anything in its way! And continues to ram its way there or clip through the item!

The station building is cool but sucks so bad, if it could have been put through a Quality of life team it would be a lot better to use.

The Star Wars Interworlds mod... oh boy, is it out of this world! I mean, using random numbers and randomizing my start is more fun than a game of Dejarik with a Wookiee. I'd randomize my small ship types then my system the same way. Starting from zero credits? Now that's as thrilling as navigating an asteroid field.

In my inaugural ""tutorial"" playthrough, I conjured up a backstory as an escaped Falleen slave, originally hailing from Ord Mantell, but indentured to the Hutt Cartel in a smugglers den shipyard on Ryloth, the Twi'lek's homeworld. A little intense? Maybe, but who doesn't enjoy a bit of intergalactic drama?

Currently, I'm embarking on a journey as a runaway teenager who's grown up under the shadow of a Black Sun syndicate family. I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee than deal with their bs anymore. Son now he's commandeering his family's treasured TIE Fury /H - a Heavy Fighter picked up in a risky raid on Empire Space. They stumbled upon the secret TIE prototype (a nod to the brilliant mod dev’s brainchild design). 
Our young hero's about to turn it into his personal escape vehicle. Straight out of Cerea, he makes a run for it. (I logged in and found myself in 2 Black Sun ship crosshairs in under 8 seconds). My first escape? Let's just say I ended up more as a bantha fodder than a hotshot pilot... Whoops. Second times the charm?

As for me, I'm turning 33 next month, so naturally, I chose the 33rd ship and system in the start custom campaign mode. Talk about hitting your mid-life crisis moving faster (or traveling shorter?) than the Millennium Falcon on the Kessel Run!

The learning curve: any entrancing game will have a learning curve because there's a lot of meat on the bone. Have some patience, watch a youtube video if you have to and the payoff will be great.

My favorite part if I have to pick one is the sense of scale and immersion. For example, at a station you can walk out on the docking area and look up at the huge modules that you just built and attached to your station. You walk from there to your little fighter, that is still quite large when walking around it, on the landing pad. Fly away and see a large carrier, go dock on that and notice how small your fighter really is in the scope of things.

One of my favorite things to do when just chilling and managing the empire is standing on the dock of a carrier and watching the squadrons of fighters taking off and landing. That and flying a fighter in the middle of a capital ship battle. The game isn't the best in any one area, but it has many areas that all come together and can't really be found anywhere else in the genre. You can sit in the map view all day and play it like an RTS, or you can go fight stuff yourself and bring fleet members along for the ride, or even just run a trading ship back and forth being space trucker if that's your jam.

Things as simple as station logistics jobs for fleets are 'solved' using a sort of economy hack where you get your traders to buy from stations and have to set a specific manual series of orders to get them to do something that one mod easily solves by making a station mule job that just tells a ship to take the damned wares from one of your production facilities to another facility where you want them.

Fleet AI is fucking awful, it really is awful, fleets do not function in the base game, which is not an insignificant problem considering that building and using a fleet is 90% of the end game. Do not play this game without mods, because it is so awful without mods, I cannot give the base game a positive review. Because I had to fix the game to make it playable with those mods, not just improve my experience. If they didn't exist, I would likely not play the game.

AI in general is bad, patrol is a functionally useless feature, ships protecting a sector do not respond to threats detected in that sector, only engaging enemies on patrol if they happened to path into them, this is solved by a reaction force mod which tells ships to do the extremely difficult task of watching if threats exist in a system and if so, attacking them.

Fleets won't use the space autobahn if you tell them to move sometimes, in sector miners are broken and will not mine if you sit in the ship and just spin around an asteroid all day not using their mining lasers, all sorts of problems.

REVISION: Years have passed, two DLCs were released following me quitting the game for a while the first time with my fleet combat grievances, I have come back since and purchased both of the DLCs that came out, Kingdom's End and Tides of Avarice, and I regret it. I regret it for the same reasons, and I regret that the reasons I initially quit are weighing on me about whether I should quit all over again this time.

Fleet AI and combat is, fucking, terrible. It has not been fixed with over 5 years of bug reports, complaints, feedback, developers cannot even implement something as simple as ""Attack at Weapon's Max Range"" commands for fleets, and that is when you can use fleets at all! Other long-term players are downright allergic to using fleets because as they are implemented, it is a clown show of capital ships zooming and bashing into each other in a downright embarrassing fucking clusterfuck of a sight.

And again, this is not a part of the game you can just ignore. This is the heart, the fundamental meat of the game that you spend hours, days working up to, setting up an economy for, to have fleets, to be among fleets, when the FPS doesn't shit the bed on it itself, you still have that to contend with. Your pilots are fucking braindead, the dementia that they suffered for over 5 years has not gotten better! And they are just as ungodly awful to train today as they were back then, with grind times for pilot skill levels, which supposedly make everything all better mind you, being in the weeks of real life time to achieve even a handful.

And then you are rewarded with a commander who will take your capital ship and ram that fucker right into the nearest Xenon station, die horrible, take all the fighters it had with it, and then the community will tell you that it's fine and there's nothing wrong about being on their knees for this company. This game needed to have fleets fixed YEARS ago, it was a core feature of the game then, and it is a core feature of the game today, which does not fucking work, and modders over the years have tried to make it work to no avail!

If you are looking for a space game that allows you to build an (trading or fighting) empire or just want to shoot some ships for a while, then I would say this is a game you will have fun with. I'd almost describe it as a civilisation building game where you have more control over ships instead of starting a research project and managing people, but its not quite that game. It also has a limited multiplayer (beta at present), which allows you to send ships into other players games (and usually shoot at them or you from the other way around).

How I play it at the moment:
I really like this game, though they way I like to play it, I find it does takes a while to start doing much of the activities however, this is not too much of a problem since I have been letting the game play while I am studying and if I hear something that sounds like the game needs me, it is usually a welcome distraction for a few minutes and I can continue studying afterwards. That said I have started to get to the more exciting part of the game having built a lot of small blockade stations to keep the Xenon out, which I am just about finished so now I can start fleet building to start taking the fight to the Xenon!

How I got into the X games:
I have not played all the X games and really only started at X-Rebirth since i tried the very first X game when X-Rebirth was being released to see if I might like it (a cheap way of seeing what the games are like). I figured I would give X-Rebirth a go based on that and I was not disappointed though some parts did feel a little unfinished (Planting a bomb at the end of the main story was opening a box). That said I was very happy with the game play in X-Rebirth and the story was good (not counting the box). Anyway I was certainly going to buy X4 foundations based on X-Rebirth and it is a much better game in many ways, the only thing I miss from X-Rebirth is some of the ship designs but they keep adding ship designs to this one so I am sure I'll find some I really like here too (Not found most of them so far with 401 hours of play).

The game is amazingly complex and satisfying to devour, at 80+ hrs in I'm just beginning to really get a grip on it, and that's after watching tutorials (recommend Captain Collins & Francis John). The learning curve is huge, with many different aspects packed into one game. It's not a 4x in any way but mastering concepts like economy, demand & supply and especially ship loadouts is vital to success in the game. I'm new to the X series so while I can't compare it to the previous games I feel like each game should be evaluated for it's own worth.

Don't pay attention to the negative reviews about the AI or gameplay - >90% of the negative reviews are obviously written by people who either wanted a different game and didn't get it or people who don't want to spend the time to learn a game. At >80hrs I haven't run into a single bug with all the expansions and the AI is not actually as bad as people seem to think... that said the AI is exceedingly simple, don't expect a rookie captain to out fly/gun an equally equipped enemy until they get more experience. A slow miner/trader can't outrun a fighter, that's not an AI fault that's not setting up patrols or defending territory correctly. Also, while autotravel is amazing, you're travelling across the known galaxy, it should take some time in a slow ship.

The main/top reason why I am quitting (after over 100 hrs) is that boarding is scuffed. I LOVE boarding, and I like how it was implemented in this game-except for the AI. I've spent hours saving before a board, the loading and reloading trying to figure out what was wrong. You can start the boarding process, and sometimes the stages work, or some time a stage gets stuck. fine. But then you disarm turrets, but your ships still decided they want to wreck your target anyhow. Or, you start the operation to board, and they decide to go on strike after *maybe* destroying shields and externals, leaving the hull at 80%, in which case the operation gets stuck and you have to manually grind it down with *one* ship out of your whole fleet. And when things get stuck? gl resetting things. You can tell your fleet to drop all orders and all assignments *and* remove all ships from the boarding menu, but the ships will magically reappear, with the added benefit of the screen locking with zero marines selected to send over. 

OFC there are other ai woes. All the commands are confusing at best. You can't command a fleeing ship to go somewhere safe (it'll override your command as it dashes toward the ""safety"" of a Xenon sector). Ships will randomly travel at slow speed when the other members *of the same fleet* knew that travel mode would get them there much faster. And no, it was not an issue with pilot skill (I checked). And most captains must have been sourced from classical dance halls, as they pause duties to pirouette here and there.

There is a lot I love about the game. Anything a regular AI faction can do, you can too, including building stations, owning sectors and policing such, etc, with the added benefit of being able to fly everything manually if you want. It is ridiculously sandboxy in a good way. Also there is plenty of variety, and the strategic aspects are really lovable.

There's not even a controller profile for one of the most popular flight sticks, the Hotas X/ Hotas One.

One of the only things I like to do in space games is to bounty hunt. I do this all the time in SC and I do this all the time in ED. However, as soon as you take out one (red) target/ enemy ship, it's incessant wave after wave of other ships...until you explode.  

I also can't figure out how to upgrade my ship and I don't know how you find anything because nothing is on the system/ galaxy map in the way of ""hey there's a station over there!"" I basically just pick a direction and fly in it, hoping a space station is there. I've only found one in this way and there are no ship vendors or engineering places to upgrade your ship at. 

I've also been digging further in forum topics of this game and reading that this game is meant to be played from an ""empire builder"" perspective, and so is meant more for the RTS community looking for a different take. So if you're into RTS? This is for you. I hate micromanaging. About the most I'm willing to micromanage is in Elite and SC, with keeping up on my system module integrity and power distribution. That's it.  With the size of the empires you end up building, it eventually translates into progressively less and less actual space flight, as it then becomes a scenario where you just sit back and watch the light show, as your armada go to work. Apparently this is why the game is coined a ""spreadsheet simulator?"" It's more management than flight. I just thought maybe you could explore and bounty hunt, but it's a faction dependent game. If I wanted this sort of game, I'd get Stellaris instead. Spacebourne would have been a better investment and Steam will not take my refund because I've been trying to figure this game out for 7.5 hours and I am done.

Also, for some reason you need a super computer to run this game smoothly, as a 3950X and 6950 XT aren't enough. And I hear that once your stations start to get bigger it gets progressively worse in the CPU department. Sounds like the game needs DX12?

Don't get me wrong...I also started Elite, back in late 2014, on Xbox...until got a PC account. Even back then, when there were no instructions and no directions, I could at least always count on finding a stations, job boards and components and at least get some progress going. It was as easy as looking at your map.

Don't get this game thinking that it will be an analog to Elite or SC. It is Not! Contrary to what other space game aficionados try to hype up to be on Youtube, concerning this game versus SC and Elite. They are not at all the same.

Do get this game if you come from an RTS background and want a fresh take on a sort of first person RTS and you have a lot of time to study forums for instructions on what to do. Every starting out guide I can find has you aiming to take over your first ship, so that you can have an immediate second ship and get things progressing faster in assembling an armada.

The one mission that got me hard stuck was early on in the Terran Cadet storyline. Right after (what I assume to be) the tutorial mission, you are sent to impersonate a repair specialist to gain access to a ""criminal"" who is trying to reactivate a station with gravity anomalies. Without making a huge wall of text about this one instance, you are eventually ""tasked"" with building a station that you may or may not have the resources to actually complete with no way to get the resources once that part of the mission starts.

This isn't the only time this happens either. Vague dialogues that indicate you should do something are dropped everywhere and if you don't pick up on them your game gets hard stuck.

More than this. Certain gameplay elements just fail to function at times. Take the same instance, I eventually just restarted the campaign because I was only a small way through it. This time I made sure I had passive income working before I got to that point, so at the very least I could wait out the lack of resources if I missed anything else (already a poor game design decision but oh well). Well I got to the point where I could afford the materials to build the dock on the station (so far the only requirement) and you are supposed to order the materials from traders in the sector with you because that's what the tutorial says to do to automate the situation.

Well. The traders refused to bring two of the three necessary materials for construction, even after I offered over 10x market price. Eventually I caved and just went to collect them myself and I discover that one of the materials isn't even present in the sector. That's about where I turned the game off.

I don't know why that was part of the mainline quest, or why the devs thought it was worth separating you from your primary asset up until that point, or why the core game systems just don't function, or why none of this was explained in a way that a normal person could understand, but it took me so long to get to the point where I turned the game off that I can't even refund it.",1685437506,1685437506,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

X4 seems to promise everything we ever wanted since the release of Elite on the BBC micro all those decades ago. Trading, fighting, mining, empire building, warmongering - the lot, all in glorious HD graphics. It's ambitious, to say the least, and has some stiff competition in the likes of Elite Dangerous, EvE Online, and the upcoming (?!) Star Citizen. I'm no developer, and I can only imagine what has gone into this game in order to just make it function. So has the effort been fruitful and satisfying? Ehhh.... I'd love to say yes, but I can't help but feel it makes the same mistakes as it's peers. In promising us a galaxy, it also brings a galaxy of complications. In the only way I can think of to say it - X4 gets in it's own way far too often, and can ruin the fun.

X4 on its surface looks amazing. A whole galaxy for you to not only explore, but to basically shape as you see fit. You can build a devastating warfleet and wipe out your faction of choice in massive space battles. You can become a trading empire for good or evil. You could become the next crime kingpin if you so desired.
Now managing a personal fleet in a galaxy which is constantly evolving whether you're involved or not, is a daunting task. You may be managing whole fleets of traders, miners, and warships on your way to your personal goal. What X4 needed badly was a quick, intuitive system that allows you to set your fleets tasks and then leave them to it while you pursue your current objective. Sadly, that's not what it has.

Now don't get me wrong, X4 is billed as a complex game which does have somewhat of a learning curve - this you expect going in. You might expect to be at least fifty hours in before you feel like you need to have a ""proper"" grasp. However, from hour one, X4 is beset by overly convoluted systems, obscure and imprecise mission briefs, and a frustratingly unintuitive interface.
For example: flying around, you spot a mission that asks you to find a pilot for an organisation. That's it - that's the entire mission brief. So you have to dock somewhere, run into an npc who has at least the minimum pilot skills, and somehow figure out how to get them to your destination. You can't just ask them to board your ship, for example. You have to actually hire them as a pilot yourself, and assign them to your current ship. Then fly to your destination, where you now have to figure out which menu you need to have, what button to click to see the roster, how to select the pilot, and THEN how to make them work for the new organisation.
What should be a simple ""find pilot, tell them to follow me, land and get credit"" mission becomes a trek through message boards to find ansewrs, rooting through menus, all bogging down what really should be a simple exercise.

Another mission might ask you to scan ships carrying ore. Seems simple enough - find a refinery in space and scan ships travelling to it, ???, profit - right? Well, half an hour later of fruitlessly scanning any ship in range that might be some sort of trader or ore freighter aanndd.... nothing. Am I missing something? Back to the message boards. Nope apparently I'm doing the right thing, just for some reason my starsign isn't rising in mercury or some such, because I can't get the mission to progress.

This will even trip you up during story missions. Go here - scan this station for data leaks. Ok! Again, half an hour later, and several orbits of the station, I'm still no closer to figuring out what data leaks are or how to find them. Sigh - back to the message boards. I find I have to back off from the station and look for specific blue flashing lights. Simple enough, you may think, but could that essential little tidbit not have been included in the briefing of what is essentially a level one mission? Why do I have to constantly refer to external sources in order to make any progress? ""Play the bloody tutorials then!"" will come the screams.

Of course, modern games have been lambasted for too much handholding, and X4 DOES have a full suite of tutorials, as dry and funless as they are, and some players will love the whole ""drop you in the middle of the pool and learn to swim"" approach that X4 brings - and I'm all for the satisfaction of figuring out how to become an ace trader or miner or battlecruiser commander, but not when I feel like it could have just been thought out better. I'd never ask the game to play itself, but when I'm floating in space, giving up hope because I feel like I'm doing EXACTLY what the mission is telling me to do, but nothing's working, just throw me a bone is all.

All in all, X4 feels like it has the scope to be epic. Something you could potentially sink hundreds if not thousands of hours into - IF you have the mental stamina to slog through the first 50 hours of learning curve. Had X4 been more user friendly or even a bit more intuitive, I feel like I'd have struck gold here, but all I seem to have right now is a banging headache. It will for sure appeal to a hardcore subset of players who live for games so deep you can swim in them, but for the rest of us who just want to run missions and make some money.... you've got a little ways to go first.

As for now, I will have to make the decision to either put aside the time to unravel the knots of menus in what I know will be a frustrating and slow process, or decide if there is something else I could be doing with my time. In the meantime, I will still be on the lookout for an immersive space sim that is smooth and accessible.

As many people have pointed out there is a steep learning curve, and it can take a while before you get the hang of it.  but stick with it, as it does get a lot better.  There are various starting scenarios which come under three ""levels"":

1. Guided - For new players, during which you'll get plenty of tips as you play.
2. Assisted - For returning players/those who have played the X-Series before.
3. Sandbox - You get no help at all.

Regardless of which level you start at you'll get all the same opportunities and missions.

The game is a living world which lives out its life whether you interact with it or not - it's not waiting for you to interact with it.  You could sit in a station and the whole economy/civilisation will continue without you.

Though not as big a map as Elite Dangerous, I do feel X4 is better as 99.9% of ED 's map is uninhabited.

You cannot land on planet's in this game as all the action takes place on stations and in space.  You can walk around stations and interact with them and the AI.  You can even build and own your own station.  You can own many ships from tiny fighters to massive ship carriers.  You can employ AI players to captain your ships if you wish.

Missions range from ""Very easy"" to ""Very Hard"".

I play with a RTX 2060 and have very good frame rates and lovely graphics (though I am upgrading to an RTX 4090 in the next couple of weeks - pause for dramatic affect).

I have started off with the ""Young Gun"" scenario, which is one of the unaided sandbox starts.

You play the role of Darth Vader and you must administer a vast galactic empire for your overlords the emperors Bosa Talpatine, and Dal Bustapeen. Every once in awhile they will give you commands like ""Incite political chaos among our vassals to keep them off balance and drive up demand for the military hardware we manufacture."" or ""Build a fleet for a race of slavers so that they may crush an upstart rebellion."" As Darth Vader, you must find a way to achieve these goals which usually involves utilizing vast sums of money and building a military industrial complex capable of producing such.

You have an army of underlings under your command, these faithful servants will fly your ships, captain your destroyers, and board those of your enemies. They will usually disappoint you with their bad aim, terrible tactics, and inclination to charge assfirst into enemy station defense turrets. You will find yourself saying things like ""The admiral came out of hyperspace to early, he is as clumsy as he is stupid."" and ""You have failed me for the last time, commander!"" Luckily, as Darth Vader, you can use the force teleport around the galaxy to take command of every capital ship, trading/mining vessel, or pilot any fighter craft you own. Don't worry, the force will guide your aim. You can also just stand in the cockpit while your nervously sweating underling taxis you around.

Occasionally, the rebel alliance with their Xenon warships and their Kha'aak fighters (sorry admin, am I allowed to say that?) will stage raids on your stations and supply lines. As Darth Vader you may crush them utterly, you may also allow them them impression of success as they raid the rogue states who have not pledged allegiance to the empire in order to drive up demand for military goods. Of course if they become a nuisance and you wish to contain them, you can always just build a death star to block travel to sectors you control, which you're free to do in this game.

Beyond that, where you go and what you do when you get there is entirely up to you. Life is good for a galactic despot, and while you're out there, whether you're decimating an alien race or pillaging entire sectors of their natural resources, don't forget to look out the window occasionally and admire the tranquil, but lonely, beauty of space.",1684895356,1684895552,True,9,2,0.619083821773529053,0,True,False,False

While I love it, it's not an easy game to recommend because it's aimed at a niche audience and has largely relied on those dedicated fans rather than trying to lure in the masses by dumbing down it's complex interface. This isn't an instant thrill action game, your time is rewarded with one of the deepest experiences of any game you've ever played.

That's why despite the frustrating and unavoidable bugs with AI, this game is a huge achievement. The bugs themselves are due to the massive scope of a galaxy chugging along in the background without any input from the player. Hundreds of ships are mining, trading and at war with each other while you're doing your thing. It's mind boggling to think about, but this game does it.

I wont go into the details of what you can do in X4, thats better suited to watching someone else play. I also wont say just buy it, I'll simply say if you're a sci-fi fan and have a good amount of free time it's worth the effort to find out of this might be something you'll enjoy.

Who ever made the default controls needs firing. I spent about 40 minutes remapping them all because they're all out of place. Like there wasn't even a roll? That's usually right stick when you push left or right corner.  The thrust and decelerate where in the wrong place too. Accelerate is using right trigger and de-accelerate is usually left trigger. This games controls were both left triggers. I also noticed you can't put roll with strafe as it doesn't allow them to be bind together. 

The controls let the game down and make it confusing. Such as when I was trying to dock. I couldn't dock because the game wouldn't let me turn once roll was activated. It was only when I changed them myself that I could. 

So the game needs better controller support as using keyboard in this game is too much. There is too many keys to remember and functions for each key. Only a robot could remember them all.

It goes out of its way to make everything unnecessarily complicated and chaotic. So many things are simply just terrible - controls, UI, missions, saving/loading times, tutorials, game mechanics, missions, progression, grinding... quite close to everything. I really tried to like the game, but I finally just thought enough is enough and decided to stop wasting time.

The game is riddled with bugs. For example, traders just disappear from multiple stations, so you travel from place to place to buy important stuff, not finding anyone, wasting hours. Or you're doing a mission, land on a cruiser that is scripted to get hijacked, that cruiser promptly gets hijacked, but your ship with it... you're standing next to it, can walk inside... but can't take off, because you've just lost your ship too. Or you reloaded a save and suddenly your ship is going almost at the speed of light. Good luck stopping it and finding yourself half an hour away from the nearest jump gate. The list goes on and on.

Speaking of that... Loading and saving times are horrible. So if a game crashes and you didn't suffer through a minute-long saving process, tough luck. Or you simply die or do something wrong. Let's wait 5 minutes to reload a game. I understand there's some massive game world that needs to load, but there's obviously some memory leak going on too. Why going back to the menu or quitting the game takes ages too?

Controls are superbly wonky. I had to reconfigure quite a lot of things. Still, it's not fun. For example, there's this mission where you are supposed to follow a ship from a distance and not lose it. There's a button combo to match speed, but it's so unreliable. Either it doesn't work, or the ship you're following suddenly slows down and you frantically slam the keys to match its speed, but instead it cancels that and goes full throttle, exposing you and failing the mission.

UI is wonky as well. Lots of the things are so chaotic. Your trader contacts you because he is being attacked and you're in some menu trying to wrestle with it? The prompt disappears. Precious seconds go by. You spend more searching for the right menu and then for the right trader. If you're lucky, you find him. Then you struggle to find how to tell them to flee. And as you struggle, you helplessly watch the trader getting blown up. Or you're trying to assign one ship to guard another. You find the ship, start creating the order, then have to find the other ship, realize you can't find it, close the order, start finding that ship, then start creating the order again. No, you can't simply pick the other ship from a list - you need to have that ship visible on the map as well. Then, you click on the ship and... nothing. Turns out, you need to right click that ship in the list, which creates a context menu where you click Select. Okay. Or you have a mission to build something. You either have to memorise the list of requirements or take a screenshot, because when you're in the build menu, you won't be able to view the requirements. Several things you'd like to do instantly, with one or perhaps 2 clicks, usually take at least 10. Generally, I had to use external resources to find out how the UI stuff works because it was so counter-intuitive.

Tutorials. Lovely. Lot of them leave you staring at a task, thinking ""what? how do I progress now?"" For example, the station building tutorial. You assign a builder to the station, but it keeps saying ""assign credits to the builder"". What? How? Is there an extra step that needs doing? What have I missed? Actually, nothing. It turns out, you simply need to wait for the construction site to get supplied with materials. Which can take hours. And I mean hours, because of the simulated economy. Awesome tutorial. Really teaches you what this game is about. You'd at least expect that this would get explained or sped up for this particular instance.

Speaking of station building (and economy in general) - it is a horrible mess. While you can try to rely on AI traders to make the necessary supply runs and while you can try to help things up by ordering your own traders to fill shortages... they still somehow tend fail miserably. There's a quest line where you build your own HQ. It nudges you to assign traders automatically and so on, but it turns out that designing the trades manually, step by step, was the only way to get a single module built after 3 days of waiting for AI to do the job. In general, there's a lot of false promise in terms of automation, but that automation is simply broken and you have to do an awful lot of micromanagement to make things work.

I could go on and on. Even though I wrote quite an essay, it's merely the tip of the iceberg. But I guess enough is enough. Unless you really have a lot of time and patience, steer clear of this stinking pile of garbage.",1684280642,1684281067,False,8,1,0.566976487636566162,0,True,False,False

One of the most frustrating problems involves the inability of NPC ships to navigate around stations, resulting in clusters of glitching ships that obstruct the movement of other vessels, including your own. This often leads to hours of stagnation, where your ships are rendered immobile and ineffective. Even attempts to resolve the issue, such as saving, reloading, or using unstuck commands, prove futile. The lack of attention to detail in addressing such fundamental issues, despite the game being at version 6.0, is deeply exasperating. Players have been reporting these problems since the game's inception, but the developers seem more focused on releasing paid DLCs with new ship models rather than fixing these game-breaking flaws. The recurrent disappointment in the lack of improvement has led to the conclusion that it is best to steer clear of this game until the developers prioritize resolving these critical issues. Additionally, the game suffers from a myriad of other frustrating problems, including poor AI pathfinding, ships getting stuck inside station walls, and a lack of accessible information and tools for players to understand and navigate the game's complex mechanics.",1684256660,1684256660,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You can also just do chores and shoot bad guys, if that's your jam, or hire people to do it. Then hire more people to manage those people, and so on, until your bureaucracy is the envy of the universe.

Seriously, though. This is one of the best games in the genre; not quite as scenic as Elite, but way more fun, and with story content you can enjoy at your own pace. It's definitely got a steep learning curve, though, and it'll try your patience with bugs (which Egosoft keep fixing; a substantial patch came out two days ago) and a sometimes byzantine UI (but where to shove all that delicious complexity?).

If you're just looking for something to while away the time with, consider that for the price of the base game, you could get a couple of nice indie game bundles instead -- but if you're into space trading sims specifically, then I'd say give the base game a try, and if that doesn't put you off, get the DLCs too. They expand the universe and add story developments, freebies/rewards and interesting things to do in general.

If you're someone that ever enjoyed ""EVE Online"", or any 4X Space Strategy games like ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" and/or ANY Flight Simulators to any degree, this game is for you.

I would say ""To any degree"" because you can choose to focus on building bases, being the commander in your own base at 'home', running the big ship, or the Ace interceptor pilot, or anything in between!  This game takes a lot of the imbalances out of 4X strategy games and MMOs, as well as the time kill, and allows you to ramp up at YOUR own pace.

There's a big universe out there to explore, and it's up to you to choose any way you want to do it.

* Want to be a pirate/bounty hunter? Sure thing.
* 100% trader and station runner. Sure!
* Captain of a Carrier vessel that runs chivalrous missions for your benefactors OR reigns indiscriminate horror down on anyone, at any time? Of course you can!

Or ANY mix of any of the above! It's all up to you! Great graphics, game play mechanics, great simulation functions, and there's always something to find and do.

I would say it is the ""Elder Scrolls"" of Space content, and if you like it you WILL be upwards of 100 - 400 hours plus in this game. Your girlfriend will hate this game, but you can pause it at anytime. So that's great for real life returns too!

There IS online content; in the fact that other players throughout the real world will create variants or ships or ""Something"" that MAYYY be introduced into your game... but you won't see any other players. I'm still not 100% on how this works, but I hear it's very recently introduced.

The only real downside of the game is the DAUNTING amount of things to learn when you start out if you're new. It's more to do than you could do in EVE Online... but it's about as deep as Albion Online - There are a lot of systems, and individually they are not very complicated. There is just a ton of them in the beginning to learn.

Oh, and the game has some really great music and SFX too. Some of the combat music is the best I've heard some time! The game lore is also not bad - it's got an older, simpler feel to much off it's universe's life, but that's not a bad thing. I'm good with less depth than a Star Wars franchise or Dune - it's complex enough but there's not an in-game quiz on the space opera going on.

Overall, score:

... When I was staring out, the game seemed like a 5/10 to 6/10.

Now that I'm 70 hours in, the game is a 8/10. And I can see that it is just going to get better as I get Medium and better ships, and my own Star-base or two, with a logistics train and a Space Army to back it up. The simulation aspects of this game are really amazing.

I'd give it a solid 10/10. 

And if any of this sounds like it was appealing to you, try it out for yourself. You'll be very happy with this game purchase.



------- Edit below:

After playing this game for an additional 80+ hours, a few of the serious bugs seem to show their ugly heads.

Ships getting stuck inside of each other
Ships not following orders
Ships taking to long to follow orders...

Ships acting very differently while I am on them as a bystander vs. not in the same sector, and a lot of these bugs are actually pretty serious.

Sometimes these bugs grind the game to a halt. Other times it causes you to lose ships when you otherwise shouldn't, or you'll just end up restarting the game because you cannot get out of the interior sections of a star base that you shouldn't have even been able to get inside of in the first place.

Occasionally waiting for ships to do what you asked them to, with no apparent reason as to WHAT they are even waiting for, is also a bit maddening. 

Or to watch half of your attack squadron that you are leading, suddenly jump into another much more dangerous sector, or 2 or 3 sectors over, just to attack 1 ship you asked them to shoot at 5 minutes earlier, and then watching them on the mini-map fight wave after wave of enemies and Die when they were originally told to ""Stay close, and guard me"" is just plain nuts. 

Having to spend so much time in the Map menu to manage your empire, I would not necessarily call this game a Flight Simulator. I would call it an RTS game, with some great attempts at making it a Simulator or Flight Simulator.

When you're in the cockpit the game is great! But your fleets depend on you to manage them... and badly too. They need constant reassurance and supervision to do even the most basic tasks. The game Ai will decide to fight an entire squad of enemies that it has no chance of winning, even if you've told it to ""Use Judgement"" in engagements that it might get involved in.

This game has a tremendous amount of incredible potential, and it really could be an amazing game if the Ai coding and in-sector aspects of the game had a re-work. It is in DIRE need of a re-work or bug fixing at this point. 90% of the game or more is very playable, and enjoyable. Another 5% is annoying or strange. Another 3% is downright idiotic and laughable at the constant reloading that you'll have to do. And the final 2% could cause you to just restart the game all together due to how screwed you are and physically unable to do anything at all. (like being trapped inside of a station without a good way out)

In short: This game is amazing, and most of it is absolutely incredible. But it has some really shoddy frameworks that need to get out of the ""Alpha"" and ""Beta"" stages of development yet. And that is really what is holding the game back.

I would recommend this game to Masochists and Hard-Core fans. If you're a causal gamer though that might be interested into something deeper later... don't say I didn't warn you. This game WILL cause you to get frustrated at it's lack of polish as the hours go on. And the amount of RTS Management seems to only go up over time.

It's all in how you choose to play it though, so maybe it's just the way I play it or the computer rig I'm using. But according to the discussion forums, I am not alone.

I do remember it been a learning curve from hell not long after release with no tutorial or in-game encyclopedia but somehow thanks to YouTube, I got to grips with it. I drifted away and years later had the urge to jump back in, and I assumed the learning curve would be less painful given they've added a tutorial and their in game encyclopedia is now fleshed out.

Boy how wrong I was. I'd say it took me about a month of watching videos etc to even get to a starting point of playing to a level that was doable. 

Unfortunately I have to admit I don't enjoy this game without using mods because the vanilla game is just to grindy and tedious.

Now with that all out the way, using mods, and being able to customise it on your terms, this game is amazing. I'm one of the idiots who has invested over 1K real money in Star Citizen, when for £30 this game does a lot to compete.

I've put some hours into the full release game including all DLC's 46.5 hours this time around. I'm sure that there is a great game in there somewhere. Hidden beneath the unintuitive UI , or maybe behind the missions that give you no guidance whatsoever, but I just can't find it.
God help you if you step outside the ship you were flying because it's likely to take off and fly to some random station on the map leaving you stranded. Or worse still fly into a pack of Xenon whilst you are in the map and out of the pilots chair (this happened to me just now and was the final straw for me)

I'm sure that this would have been a great game a number of years ago when we got hard copies of games that came with manuals , but I honestly feel that after nearly 47 hours I should feel like I'm making progress - instead I just feel lost.

- clunky, non-intuitive UI
- high learning curve (searching how to do stuff on the Internet is required) 
- AI that leaves much to be desired 
- in my opinion not the best flight system (especially true when jumping from Elite Dangerous). I play with HOTAS, which is supported and the game has working preset (which needs to be tweaked by the player). 

However:
Even with all this problems, it's still worth playing. There is no other single player game like this, which gives the same sense of scale and accomplishment. Every ship visible on the map has to be created using resources, which are mined by real miners, processed by factories and delivered to shipyards, which then creates new ships. Player can affect other factions by crippling their economy in numerous ways - destroying miners, attacking factories. Whole universe is simulated and factions can and will go and attack each other, claim sectors, fight with Xenon. 

There is something fun about knowing that both player and PC factions has the same set of rules and destroying their ships won't just spawn new ones out of thin air, but instead that faction will need to mine, process and build new ships to replace their losses, just like player. 
There is something fun about watching your trade station in FPP, where every ship coming and going actually has a purpose in this simulated universe and is not just nice animation. 
There is something fun switching between empire management and doing the same actions in person as player. 

If this is your type of fun, you won't be disappointed.

-----------review of the base game below-------------
I own every game ever made by Egosoft. The concept of this game is fantastic. The cockpit experience is great. But the management mechanics are awful and the ability to command your own company (Ships and stations) is so frustrating that it almost seems intentionally designed to scare people off or make them just give up.

Example: I had a frigate protecting a miner that I was piloting, and bought a freighter to pick up extra mined ore. Well the freighter wouldn't pick up the ore. So I switched to the freighter, set the miner to automine, then the miner wouldn't mine anymore. That's just how it goes every single time you try to command other ships to do anything at all. You might be thinking 'but you assigned them to assist you, and you changed roles.' No, I reassigned everybody each time.

Pros;
- Great cockpit experience
- Nice ship variety
- Interesting weapons
- Lots to do
- Good stories if you care to find them
- Ability to build pretty much whatever you want, after you get some reputation

Cons
- The mechanics of ordering ships is god awful. Whomever designed it maybe shouldn't have anything to do with UX in the future.  Example. Want to assign a pilot to a ship? You don't just select the ship from the drop-down list-box. You then have to right click on that ship you already select and select 'Select Ship' Seriously?
- Infuriating lack of control over your subordinates
- Missing commands such as 'come pick me up in empty space,' ,etc.
- Commands that just don't work at all such as 'protect commander' and setting commander as your own ship.
- Impossible to order ships to do stuff like pick up mining drops the user creates

Yes there is collision bugs and pathing bugs. On top of that AIs are garbage at fights, i think it's by design. If it wasn't the case, xenons would destroy and capture everything before you could have the power to fight them back, and even if it wasn't them others like paranides would. Teladis, the more neutral commerce oriented species, would never stand a chance against anyone since their ship are not aimed at wars. Since there is no diplomacy (yes there isn't 4X in X4 because X4 isn't a 4X type game, it's the sequel to X3), the strongest would win.

The voices and narration, are horrendous at best (in French at least, most voices look like there are coming from a 1999 voice generator. But i can't imagine from the French version that others are good, it would be a too big difference in quality to be possible). Music can be nice when there is any. Sometimes there isn't.

The UI can be quite complicated. Most of which comes from things that aren't working like they should, especially advanced orders, sometimes it's because of bugs, sometimes it's because of bad design. A lot of usefull features have to be found, literally dug sometimes.

Why am i recommending this game after all that? Because it's still an amazing experience with layers of complexity and game thresholds. The game is playing like a space shooters and exploration in the first hours, then it goes to a craft and design bases with economic micro decisions, to a weapon dealer phase, then an RTS phase where you crush your opponents ordering everything from afar, then a spy cloak and dagger phase where you basically define the politcal state of the galaxy for your own advantage to finshing by owning a galaxy wide terraforming conglomerate.

Sure doing all that takes time, hundreds of hours. It's not a ""push here to level up game, spam two buttons for five mintues then congrats you saved the world have a free chest as reward"" game. It's a niche game that will satisfies any space opera lover if, and only if, the player accepts to put effort understanding how things works, you can't have a complex games without complex rules. There is a lot of tutorials ingame, they aren't top qualities and are also hidden, but they are effective into making the player learn about basic stuff. Complexity wise, if you like space engineers and KSP's complexities then this game is on par (i'm stressing again i'm not talking about gameplay in that comparison, only the complexity). If you want to experience the game smoothly, pick a basic start where you character will be at peace with everyone (expect xenons because they are mean machines that just want to terraform your head).",1683472361,1683474583,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

RTS elements, UI, and AI behavior. Please, please fix these. 

My only gripe is those 3 things, the UI is a labyrinthine maze to find anything. Including simply buying consumables, ammo, and reviewing information on something. RTS elements and AI kind of blend together in my dislike, the AI is very basic, in travel, in combat, in about anything. This often causes them to constantly die in combat due to poor maneuvering and often can get stuck inside of stations. With the RTS being led by the poor UI and simple AI. As soon as I had two ships together and a ship I led myself, having to babysit and micromanage every little thing a ship or fleet does (including contacting a ship after it's been scanned by police so it continues it's orders) it just became too much of a chore.

Like many other reviews, it pains me to give this recommendation. I've always loved space games and the ideas that this game presents was (and still is) enticing to me. Unfortunately though, this game for me has these ideals locked behind the frustrating, head pounding train wreck that is Egosoft's execution. While there are tutorials in this game and they do help, I've probably spent more time in YT/the internet then I have in the game trying to figure out how everything works. The UI is a mess and confusing to utilize, this is probably the biggest aspect that's pushing me away from the game. There are other aspects however: the AI is more A then I, my ship has ""spazzed"" out or glitched into another ship more times then I care to count, etc. 

Having said all this, I do want to thank Egosoft for sticking with the game and continuing to improve it. Hopefully now that 6.0 is out they'll start focusing on core issues.

-- CONTENT --
The Base game offers a lot of content on it's own. 3 races, each with at least 2 factions, 2 pirate factions and 2 enemy factions. Each race has its own ships and stations. Apart from docking and production facilities and docks, every module looks different depending on race. Ships of each race are also split for the 2 respective factions. Each Faction also has unique ships. 
There is a large universe in the base game already consisting of 50 systems, each of which with up to 3 sectors.
You also get a full blown economy which I won't even pretend I understand. I don't. Even after 830h I don't.
There are 3 plot lines as well and through various secrets you can even get a summary of the entire X history/lore.

All of these gets expanded by the DLCs which I will get to later.


-- SHIPS --
The ships look amazing. In a lot of ships there is so much detail, it's astounding. From the small S-Sized craft to the Carriers of the XL-Size everything looks unique.
While S-Class ships usually consist of a cockpit and 1-6 weapons strapped to an engine, so there's not a lot of space, M ships however, depending on the ship, give you a lot more room to explore and even to interact with sometimes. Most if not all M ships have more than one seat/console too, so if you don't want to pilot and don't want to stand around doing nothing, find yourself another console!
L and XL size ships offer a very large bridge with up to 8 (9?) different consoles and even other rooms to explore. Those bridges and rooms get rather repetetive though. There's mods to fix that, but please, Egosoft, do something with these ships! Make em more unique!

Ships of all sizes are categorized into their job. Trader ships are marked as such. So are miners, even marked by what they will be mining. Gas or Minerals. Will go into more detail later. There's Gunboats which means lots of turrets, there's frigates which can carry other S size ships and drones; destroyers, which will be your main attacking force or even a small scout, having very little survivability but is very speedy. There are a lot more but too much to cover here.


-- STATIONS --
Like I already said, each race has unique station modules except for production and docking. Every station is modular and most of them are entirely random. So it's rather rare to see two of the same designs unless intended by the game.
This modularity offers the player a lot of ways to design their station. With the station building being a bit of a pain to get behind, it can be very nice to build some huge megaplexes.
You can build anything from a small Solar Power Plant to an entire self-sufficient shipyard/wharf or whatever. No limits except for the plot size :D
Station interiors and docking areas are very repetetive though. Again, Egosoft, please do something with those!


-- STORY --
The base game stories revolve around the center conflict of the game: The Paranid Civil War.
I would go into more detail about each of the three base game storylines there are, but I do not want to spoil anything. 

The stories can be rather short at times and the writing could use some improvements. Me not being a story guy however, it's totally fine by me.


-- MENUS/OVERLAY/GAMEPLAY --
The Menus and the overlay, truth be told, are a huge pain. This game feels like a menu simulator at times, rather than a space/economy sim.
What's that? You want your AI piloted ship to go mine a resource and sell it again? Alright, click through 5 different menus and still don't find it.
Once you understand the menu however, it get's very easy, yet still annoying. So best to get used to it if you want to play X4 for a long time.

Gameplay in general is totally up to what you want to do! It's a sandbox. What else is there to say about it?
Sure, there are limits, like, you can't land on planets, but who cares in the end? You can fight, you can be space Bezos, you can eradicate factions from the face of the galaxy if you want. And the abundance of mods around make that even better!
There's even a mod reworking the entire game into a star wars galaxy, replacing all the ships and systems!
One thing to note however: The start is difficult. As a total newbie to X4, or maybe even the entire X-Series, you got a lot to learn to start enjoying the game. The learning curve is Steep. Very Steep.


-- DLCS --
Starting with Split Vendetta, you get a lot to explore. 26 Systems, with a total of 30 Sectors. OH BOY! That's half of the base game galaxy added on top!
You get one new race, the split, 3 factions and another storyline.
The ships are no longer split between the factions. So you can get the exact ship from one faction or the other. They do have their unique ships though.
SV also adds 4 new weapons. Split weaponry. If you missed Dakka in the base game, SV got you covered. 
If you're looking for content, go for SV.

Cradle of Humanity.... my goodness, am I in love with it.
Content, Story, AMAZING.
5 Systems with a total of 19 sectors. The name kinda gives it away, but you're going to find earth in it! The Humans!
You get 3 new factions, one race, the humans, an extra economy even! Don't worry, it's easier than the other one. A lot easier.
You get three storylines revolving around the 3rd faction and the terran conflict.
You get a lot of unique ships, some unique weapons which can only be used on the new ships and a lot of new modules for your stations. So build away!
It also is *the* DLC if you want an easier start into the game. The new added game starts offer at least some guidance.

Tides of Avarice I am not a fan of. 3 Systems, 7 sectors, mainly story, almost no content.
Don't get me wrong: It all fits together in that dlc. You get 2 factions, revolving around piracy and scrapping. And EVERYTHING in that DLC resembles that remark.
From Stations, to ships, even the people! Also expect a huge performance hit. This DLC alone doubles, or even triples the amount of s sized ships in your galaxy in a small space. (Ok, I'm overdoing it a bit, but it's A LOT of ships!)

Ah, Kingdom End... the long lost Boron.
9 Systems, 11 Sectors. Very Unique ships and weapons, which are not modular. You can't use this DLC's Equipment on any of the other games ships and whatever.
It adds one race and faction, 3 storylines, which to be honest are very short. But unlike the rest of the stories, these ones are very well done! Short, but very good fun!
This DLC would be my #2 after Cradle of Humanity.


-- PERFORMANCE --
I don't really want to talk about it but it has to be said:
The performance is bad. Even on High-End Systems you'll struggle. The later you are in the game, the worse it gets. 
Why? Because the entire universe is simulated on YOUR Hardware. Mainly your CPU.
If your PC struggles, look no further than the CPU. I'm playing with a i7-10750 and a GTX 1650. And my CPU is the bottleneck. I rarely crack 60 fps.
But, even with lower/mid-end GPUs, you can still max it out without issues. So that's something I guess.

The Performance has improved a lot with the latest update 6.0, but PCs still struggle.

I bought a mining ship and hired a crew and sent them off to gather ore and sell it to AI factions while I did more missions. Eventually this grew to a huge enterprise where I had around 300 ships: miners, cargo transports, and some fighters for security. I went on to claim my own sector and build my first station.

That single station grew to 40 stations, and I was making millions per hour. I could build nearly any kind of ship, and was selling tons of ships to all the AI factions. I built up a great fleet, thinking I could use it to conquer some of the hostile sectors, and bring the pest AI factions to heel.

But this is where things get wonky.

Fleet AI is crude at best. You will watch in horror as your AI captains send your expensive ships, with all your crew, to senseless, pointless deaths. Again and again.  Sometimes you can micromanage your way through, but often times its just too obnoxious to deal with. The key to winning fleet battles is overwhelming numbers.

Diplomacy too, is quite simple: Unless you actively try to be antagonistic, you generally become allies with everyone, except for the Xenon (an apocalypse faction that only wants to kill). And beyond that, the galaxy doesn't really change much. New wars never start, old wars never end (beyond a few quest plot lines that trigger changes). It makes the AI feel kinda static while you are building up your massive empire.

Despite those flaws, I still find the game fun. There are some dedicated and talented modders that have stepped in to solve some of the more glaring problems with the game.",1671429559,1682912990,True,0,0,0.483662247657775879,0,True,False,False

TL;DR It's still crap, don't waste your money and more importantly don't waste your time.

X Has been a niche game for people who like big scale economy and war simulation with hand-on-yoke combat, but don't mind colossal amounts of jank and bugs. This game is just too janky, no way around it.



Early game is really fun, small fights with your single self-piloted ship or a few of them work mostly as you'd expect. But this is when you don't yet deal with masses of friendly AI pilots. Oh yes. Biggest issue above all is the AI. It's so incredibly frustrating, idiotic and lackluster that everything you think you want to do just falls flat because AI can't handle anything. Calling it ""intelligence"" anything is a fraud, it's FIVE FREAKING YEARS when this pile of turd launched in a disastrous -almost unplayable- state and the AI is still so bad that any self-respecting company would just fire the whole team and start doing gardening or something instead.

Fleet combat is a complete joke because of it, in or out of sector (which dictates if physics are simulated). You have no control, there's a bunch of different orders that are supposed to do different things but all that happens is your fleet runs face first into the enemy and then it's just a DPS war. Range is useless, your fleet will just melee the enemy even if they could absolutely by huge margin out-range them. Your destroyers with massive frontal gun batteries will just broadside the enemy and do nothing with them.There's no proper attack-move, what imitates that just doesn't cut it. Formations don't work, as soon as combat begins everyone without fail just goes anywhere they please. You can't keep your ships together without microing every single one of them and oh boy is that a can of worms of it's own. Giving orders is so slow and janky that it hurts.

When you are in sector with other ships even outside combat, most things just stop working. Miners won't mine, ships have trouble getting anywhere, stupid stuff happens. There are hazard areas that damage you in some sectors, when the engine has to actually render the zones AI just happily lemming trains themselves into their doom without a care in the world. Oh and they introduced more and more of these areas with DLCs but never bothered to fix how AI handles them.

AI factions are completely helpless, they can't figure out how to toss goods from one station to the next door without player intervention. They won't defend themselves, but sometimes they will send big fleets on a hopeless suicide mission just to make sure that their navy stays lacking. They will send police fighters to scan the cargo of every single one of your fleet's 100 ships' empty container so they can't move for 15 minutes even thought you are in amazing relations with them.



Other huge issue is the UI, it's SO FUCKING BAD. Everything is convoluted, cluttered, stuffed full of text and tick-boxes, hard to access and somehow still manages to lack necessary information in many places. Don't even get started on station building which is awful, there are ways to translate home PC controls to three dimensions. This ain't it chief.

Game runs like crap. I get decent framerates with quite beefy rig most of the time but you better have good CPU cooling cause that baby is gonna burn when the AI calculates how to screw you over the most. Saving and loading take forever even on blazing fast SSD. It doesn't look that great either but really that's something to be expected when you might need to render battles of few hundred invidual ships and huge station complexes.

Controller support is awful, none of the default profiles make any sense so you have to rebind half of the funcitions manually (which there are a lot of). So you're gonna do that? Well better have steady hands because the instant you click on a rebind it registers mouse movement as input. Brilliant move Egosoft.



There are brilliant ideas and somewhat good beginnings for an incredible game but none of that matters when the game fails in the most important feature in massive simulation; the simulation itself.",1543830223,1682610242,False,56,9,0.606550872325897217,2,True,False,False

Your ships will just sit there, unable to move or do anything, for hours on end. On the most recent occasion of this my own ship got stuck inside an NPC ship and I've been completely unable to do anything or go anywhere. No unstuck command, saving and reloading doesn't work, can't take command of the ship because the pilot just says he's busy. Literally nothing I can do except hope it eventually becomes unstuck somehow.

This game has a shocking lack of attention to detail [in some areas] and dozens of really frustrating issues like this one which players would reasonably expect to be resolved fairly early in development. The fact that the game is now at v6.0 and issues like this are rife is irritating beyond words. Players have been reporting these issues repeatedly since day one, but the developers would rather just release another small batch of ship models behind a paid DLC than to actually polish the game and fix real game-breaking issues like this.

I keep coming back, year after year, hoping things will be better, but I have yet to see any improvement to issues like this one. Stay away from this game until the developers start fixing these sorts of problems.

------------------

Update 27/04 to answer questions in the comments:

While the collision issues can be resolved by leaving the sector, my criticism was that it happens to your own ship while you're piloting it and/or while your NPC captain is piloting it. I'm not talking about ships bumping into each-other. I'm talking about 3+ ships physically inside each-other and unable to get outside of each-other. It's extremely immersion killing and has been a source of frustration for me on a number of occasions while playing. Right now, it's happening at every station I spend longer than a couple of minutes at, and particularly at trade stations. The fact that there are ships glitching in and around almost every single station in v6.0, despite AI pathfinding and glitchiness being a key and repeated gripe from players since day one, and despite there now being 4 paid DLCs, it's clear the experience needs a lot more polishing and attention to detail in quality testing.

With regard to the lack of attention to detail, almost none of the game and its AI are actually explained. Most people don't understand what the various AI behaviour and turret and aggression settings actually do and how they impact upon combat. At best, they're guesses based on forum discussions and various peoples' observations. There are no tooltips, very few in-game tutorial/encyclopedia explanations and no game development documentation to read. While I appreciate the AI is somewhat in a state of flux, how hard would it be to summarise what a behaviour script does and what the developers' intention behind it is?

As well as the above, and despite the fact that this is a game largely based upon economy simulation, there are practically zero in-game tools and data read-outs to assist you in interpreting what's going on around the game universe, what various factions are focusing on economically, what kinds of shortages the economy is facing, where bottlenecks in faction production lines are and generally how they're faring in the war against the Xenon and faction conflicts (other than stations disappearing and sectors flipping control, which are the more obvious signs). Sometimes it's also obvious what the economic issue is (ie, shipyards constantly being behind on ship orders because there's a shortage of hull parts, or large buy order sizes on trade windows), but other times it's hard to interpret what's going on. 

There are also virtually no clearly understandable (to the average person) readouts to gauge your own income streams and to compare income from products against expenditure to produce them. The tools that do exist are difficult to understand and obtuse in their meaning, with no clear thought put into why the data is being displayed the way it is. I'm sure someone with a degree/interest in economics or accounting could make some sense out of it, but I would be entirely surprised if they considered the in-game tool offerings genuinely useful by any measure. It's for this reason that people have resorted to using community-made programs like the X4 Log Analyzer, which are unfortunately linked largely to the creators' interest in the game and soon end up out of date.

Here's a number of other issues I've encountered:

- Poor AI pathfinding - you'll see hundreds of complaints about this on the forums
- AI piloted ships still getting stuck inside station walls and bouncing around the inside of the station mesh - an issue which has existed since day one.
- AI unable to dock at all in stations - they just sit outside the station as though all the pads are full, when they're not. Can usually be fixed by being out of system, but still broken.
- Recalling ships from storage in stations - ships occasionally just never get delivered to a pad. Requires a game reload to resolve.
- AI still largely ignoring resource probes, or the way they utilise them is extremely unclear.
- Xenon destroying stations while an entire fleet of AI ships just sits on the other side of the sector doing nothing.
- Poor fleeing mechanics which override player input and provide no meaningful way for the player to rescue a ship in a tight situation (which happens a lot with pirates).
- Poor and frustrating piracy mechanics - very hard to effectively understand, counter or avoid when the police scanners don't seem to do their job most of the time and you're unable to fire on pirate ships (which are literally already firing on you) without taking standings hits.
- Poor vanilla behaviour scripts (""patrol"" and ""automine"", I'm looking at you).
- Clunky and frustration station building controls.
- Ships completely ignoring blacklists.",1681878491,1682602738,False,93,14,0.81211775541305542,5,True,False,False

However, you [b]MUST[/b] buy the DLC to experience everything this game has to offer and that is why myself and a number of the community feel like we've been robbed, baited and manipulated by Egosoft's marketing.

As an example, the Tides of Avarice DLC has an amazing storyline which takes you through all of the piracy and ship takeover mechanics on offer. Unfortunately these mechanics also exist in the base-game but there is little to nothing explaining how it is done. Tutorials for base-game content should not be accessible through DLC only.

Egosoft have recently rolled out an [b]asynchronous[/b] multiplayer mode. This means you will be playing the game in the same manner as singleplayer and occasionally ships sent by another player may randomly appear in your game. Basically you send a ship through a sort of wormhole gate on a mission and then you wait 30 minutes to 8 hours depending on the mission. You have no control over the ship you send through the gate nor can you send it to actively attack another player. Even worse, missions have a static success rate which implies they have a random success roll instead of another player's universe deciding their fate.

The problem starts with the content you ""unlock"" only being available for that specific online save and no other save whether it's singleplayer or multiplayer. Furthermore you can speed up mission times by using a special resource called ""Brane Fuel""...

This game is GREAT, but saving and loading takes a too long. I'll be back to the game when I see patch notes about improved save and load times.

Long save and load times is big problem for someone with my play style. I like to try new things. Sometimes my ideas don't pan out the way I hoped, and I choose to reload.

When loading a saved game, X4: Foundations seems to perform the entire workload of building it's data structures and game state in a single thread, which is just terrible given modern multicore CPU design.

Load time is around one minute on my system. You be the judge, but I think that's unacceptable.

We have the old X-Series back. But this time with a huge buff in immersion. You can now walk around ships, can have massive ships as well, have large fleets and dominated sectors or piss of the Xenon.
The story telling is also finally done properly with nice cut scenes and voice acting and brings the universe of X4 to life.
So if you have been waiting for the next X game but was deterred by the state of X4, now is the time to buy!

This is not a ""pick up and play"" type of game. It's more like a ""watch 3 hours of YouTube videos before you can even get started"" type of game.

Most of my first 10 hours playing this was spent looking stuff up online to figure out how to interact with the basic features of  the game. The UI is just needlessly complicated and not intuitive at all. I couldn't even figure out what I had in my cargo hold for the longest time.

I haven't even done any of the station-building stuff yet. I've mostly just been flying around doing missions. Some of the missions are fun (destroying mines is easy money and you get to go pew pew), but others are just kind of pointless and dull. Flying across the galaxy to find a station that sells a specific type of item is easy if you've discovered a lot of places and dropped satellites to monitor trade items, but I only figured out how to do that after reading a suggestion on a discussion board.

I got a mission where i had to scan ships in the sector to find a ship containing silicon. Spent almost an hour doing that, each time the captain of the ship would yell, ""You're not supposed to do that!"" as I scanned them. Never found the silicon. I aborted the mission and moved on.

I got another ""medium difficulty"" mission telling me to destroy one Ka'ak ship. Looked up online where to find Ka'aK. Flew to that sector and got annihilated by an entire fleet of ships. You'd think the good folks of the previous sector would put a warning sign on the jump gate...

The spaceflight is excellent, although i had a rebind a few keys. The character models are awful, but you can look past that since you spend most of your time in space.

First problem is the learning curve. The game has some tutorials that are good enough for some basic flight and weapon use, but they don't bother to help you past much more than that. Example, using your short range scanners to find missions. Kind of important, but I had to find a YouTube video for this. 

The UI is horrible. It's a maze to find anything. Granted, there is a high level of complexity to this game, but there has to be a better way.

The human models look like something that should have exited 20 years ago. Things pop into view way too close. Nothing I can do in the settings to increase this. My computer is pretty good and could probably deal with it.

spent 20hrs troubleshooting bugs mostly, the tutorial itself required several restarts due to the mission removing itself randomly, causing you to not progress to the next part.

the forums/communities, dealing with the community who swears you're incompetent and that the game doesnt have bugs or shortfalls, only to see at the end of the thread it was a bug, taking 3-5 pages to find a single helpful and polite community member to just answer the question. 

the learning curve is artificial and the game isnt as nearly as desirable as they seem to think, its easily spotted as intentionally trying to waste your time for longer play time, offering little to no 'rewards/satisfaction' for learning the thing because it was mundane and just basic level gameplay to begin with that they failed to teach in the already unstable tutorial.

ex. Terran cadet start, repair some satellites with your friend, fight a few xenon ships, then youre in the sandbox. thats it. first station near you has nothing to do besides misc jobs. wander aimlessly taking random sidejobs as a literal member of a standing military force. never hear from them again (at least 13hrs in, never got the next mission) i was just a contract handy-man earning pennies for the most uninteresting missions, why does a patrol literally make me spend 20 minutes in an area to complete, with nothing happening. no ships, no events, no adventures even. just travel mode around passing the same rocks and empty stations for 20 whole minutes.

TL;DR: Almost 5 year old bugs still everywhere. artificial learning curve. many community members not worth your time. total freedom with nothing presented. feels lifeless and even the voice actors sound uninterested. 

game looks amazing, glad i have better things to do, 20hrs for a headache and to get insulted for asking questions by people who gave it thousands, hope yall found better time sinks man i really do because that seems unhealthy to act like that on a random bug fix question.

Also, this is what you're signing up for when buying X4:
[list]
[*]Significant chunks of space locked behind DLCs (get everything on a big discount like I did)
[*]Tons of early game grinding (mods of various degrees of cheatiness alleviate this)
[*]Your PC (CPU in particular) cosplaying a jet engine in busy sectors
[*]Ship AI being Absolutely Idiotic
[*]Broken pathfinding in certain sectors with hazards (a mod that removes hull damage from there is a must have)    
[*]Obtuse ship management mechanics requiring you to watch Youtube videos
[*]Uniquely convoluted interface (still better than the one in X Rebirth, in my opinion)
[*]Miner ships having an anxiety attack when you're in their sector 
[*]NPC economy breaking apart unless you plug their supply holes 
[*]Xenon murderbots overrunning everyone if you ignore the point above
[*]New and improved Physics (c) that takes inspiration from the golden days of Kerbal Space Program
[*]Bugs that get fixed about 6-12 months on average
[*]Plenty of frustration every now and then

This is a beautiful space simulating trading game where you may work your way up from insignificant mono-pilot to empire building ultra-commander. The story missions are quite fun and add colour to the game, but suffer greatly from Egosoft's very ""Germanic"" style of story telling which seems to often involve wooden voice acting and horrendously written dialogue. (Jesus Christ, can you guys just email me the next time you need a writer...)

The ships looks absolutely gorgeous and the game is extremely addictive... and finally, after being out for almost three years, it's actually a complete game rather than an experiment.

I have a number of gripes and more lavish praise, so let me now proceed to a simple pros and cons list.

Pros:
- Complex
- Fun space combat
- Fun space trading
- Can build ships and stations
- Egosoft are very Mod friendly and the Star Wars Mod (which is not on steam) is one of the best renditions of Star Wars space I've ever seen; and we can expect many more great mods to come in the next 3-5 years.
- Gorgeous ships
- The Universe is quite cool, mainly due to the fact it's been developed for like 20 years now...
- There are a lot of dimensions of play - including strategic management, spreadsheet management, ship navigation, ship combat, exploration, mission play, Easter egg hunting, etc etc. 
- The best single-player Space sim in existence in my opinion. This IS the modern day Elite; and there is no other - unless you like multi-player in which case it's Eve or Elite Dangerous. 

Cons
- The character models suck.
- The graphics engine has problems - long distant objects look back and to not get flickering lights at a distance you need to run at ridiculously high resolutions.
- Some of the textures are gorgeous, but they are mixed with horrible textures which look like Halflife 1998.
- The management UI sucks and is a massive step back from X3, which in itself was horrible but it was highly modifiable and the modders basically fixed it. 
- I bought the game and had to wait almost three years for it to become fun.
- Mod tools still haven't been 100% fleshed out and since this game will ultimately live or die on it's modding I think that Egosoft need to pick their game up.
- Voice acting sucks
- The script (for the story and for generic characters) is worse than TES: Oblivion - and that's saying something.
- Save games take *AGES* to load... I'm on the fence on this one though as it prevents too much save scumming just because the load cost is so high! Still, it's annoying.
- No planet stuff - Egosoft have always shied away from that, and tbh, I don't really want to encourage them to do it because I think they'll mess it up. Sorry lads... I love you, but I'd rather you keep your eye on the ball. Remember X:  Reunion.. Let's not diverge too much from what you do best - Space sandbox!

Overall - this game is WELL worth it - especially at the price it is today. 

With regards DLC, I'd recommend *eventually* getting it all. It's annoying but really this is a game which is completed by its DLC, and that's the PC gaming market we live in, unfortunately. Luckily, you can get quite reasonable packages for that.

Sadly combat is a bit naff, which in a space combat game is perhaps unfortunate. The scope of the game is however significantly beyond just combat, so it's something I can live with.

What I can't accept is the developer's insistence on locking new content behind online-only play from which you're excluded if you use mods.

I seriously enjoy the Graphics and art style. 

I love the sandbox. Flying all the ships, giving them commands, building my own stations.

I'm not going to list all the issues, bugs, and glitches there is far to many. Just spend a few minutes on the forums you will find countless posts about them. Not to mention the design choices that most everyone hates, like the insane amount of time to skill up.

The UI is.......awful but after a while I've started to figure it out, BUT ITS STILL ABSOLUTELY THE WORST UI I HAVE EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE OF USING!

A lot of the issues have work arounds but boy it IS REALLY frustrating trying to figure it out.

All that said I still enjoy the game, IF YOU ARE PATIENT because patience will be required to deal with the numerous glitches you will come across.

Edit: so after some more gameplay the performance is awful at times lucky to hit 20 fps. Ships still get stuck inside station geometry and other ships. This ships morphing into others geometry has been around for 2 years, 3 major version updates and a paid DLC and its still not fixed. This game should come with a disclaimer on it! Not to mention it should have been released on steam as an early access title. It is still a mediocre bug fest.

Edit: purchased the last 2 dlc after the 6.0 update only to find out that ships still merge/get stuck together and the ai simply doesnt work if your around it. 

a quote from the developer: ""since 1.0 i and many other are literally chanting the same prayer over and over again...

Do not watch while your Miners work, your mere presence is what brings them off track.

I don't know if you know the Folklore about those little People that did all the Peoples work during Night... but its the same for Miners...

You can theoretically build a huge space empire, with hundreds or thousands of ships and stations. Trade routes, production, supply lines, automated patrols, war, the works. There are over a dozen factions with internal politics and you can try to become friends, follow their quests and achieve interstellar greatness.

But the AI of your pilots is so infuriatingly frustrating... they will randomly turn around and fly into hazardous zones (frequent enough that it warranted installing the Hazard Rework mod to only let those zones deal shield damage). They will suicide into groups of enemies and take their sweet time shuffling about until they die. Your stations happily build defense drones, but don't use them when your ships are under attack next to that station. Replacing those lost ships costs resources, so the stupid AI indirectly wastes your time rebuilding things.

This game will suck you in for 10 hours straight, expanding your empire, and then you discover that silently half your automated fleet died an hour ago while you were focused on a quest. AARRGH!",1681982108,1681982152,True,12,0,0.669101059436798096,0,True,False,False

Positives: Lets start here!
- First person 
- Ship interior (Limited)
- Station interior (Limited)
- It actually plays similar to Star Citizen! 
- Trading/Economy is in a class of its own
- Automation for NPC crew is none that I've experienced before.
- Watching your NPCs or drones take off on your ship's dock whilst you watch it from within the cockpit is again something absolutely amazing.

Negatives: Boy oh boy.. please take this as someone who bought the game in 2023, have played multiple similar titles like Star Citizen, No man's sky, Elite dangerous just to name a few.

- Graphics: 
Absolutely horrid graphics! DO NOT believe the screenshots, its BS. I have a 4090 and with all settings set to ultra, it looks like a game from 2010.

- Performance
Performance is garbage... AMD 5950x and a few hours ingame can grind my system from 60+ FPS down to 10fps. Only way to fix this is to restart the game....

- Ingame Map System
The most confusing map and navigation system you'll encounter, nothing here is straight forward. It feels like the devs just did a brainstorm of what should go where, and dumped it in game and called it a day without any polish what so ever. 

- Quests/Missions
If you can't stand quests/story which only gives you a few lines of text with minimal info to let you know where you need to go or sometimes what you even need to do, then this game isn't for you. The quest system again feels very very unfinished and someone just thought of a bunch of missions, threw it together in a week and presented it as a final product. Sometimes the missions don't even make any sense.

- Physics:
OK sure, its a space game and there needs to be a balance between simulation and fun... But when you can fly light speed into an object and don't die or cause damage... you should raise some eyebrows.

- Music:
The Music (Score) itself is actually very NICE... BUT... when you go to land at a station and the music just cuts off and it starts playing the station music, its just bad! again... feels like someone coded it in in a hurry and didn't test the results.

- Confusing at best
X4 foundations is exactly what the name implies... its a foundation of a game which could've been an absolute BEAST of a game. Even with all its flaws, I still enjoyed my 34 hours of the trading/commerce/automation system that it offers. This is the only part that i feel that the developers have spent any time in perfecting. 

Conclusion:
Even at a 50% discount, I would not buy again, maybe at 75%+ discount, its worth a shot just to see the trading system. But the combination of horrid graphics, bad music cut offs, laughable physics, hard to navigate system and the degrading performance of the game is absolutely breaking immersion for me.

I remember it being a terribly slow game with awful controls... but there were some good ideas there that hadn't been done elsewhere. I avoided X2 and X3 for various reason.

I recently bought X4, and all DLC, on sale. The controls are... not great initially, but tutorials are decent. For the first hour of the game, I sort of regretted the purchase. It all seemed a bit slow and cumbersome. Then... I hired my first pilot. I made him do the mundane traveling. I was worried about my 2 hour return window and... 4 hours had passed. What!?

So I was stuck with it... so I played more. I got up to 4 ships. Whole day blew by. Next day, I bought 8 miners. The next, build a small station and a large mining capital ship. The next day, placed satellites everywhere and bought 6 more courier ships.

... this game does not give a fantastic introduction, but it becomes the space game that Freelancer and Elite Dangerous should have been. Its fantastic; I want to play this game more.

I'm only about a dozen hrs in, but I'm liking the game and the possibility. Compared to elite dangerous it's not quite as pretty or expansive and the movement and controls are a bit simpler, but the core focus is much different. There are many different things you'll have to do by flying your ship around so you still have the pilot feel to the game. 

The greatest benefit of X4 over ED for me is the campaign/overall goal. ED is expansive and there's a ton you can do, but unless you define your own goal(s), it can be overwhelming. Generally goals tend to be get X ship, fully engineer ship, get carrier, etc. but then what? and always a grind. I always felt kinda lost. In X4, there're main storyline missions, the overall goal seems based on creating a burgeoning automated economy. There's more purpose behind tasks and yet you can go about that in different ways: mining, trading, combat, etc to still allow a bunch of freedom that many people want in these space sims.

Now the downsides, there is a sharp learning curve and it's nearly impossible to learn without searching online. For a game that has in one form or another been around for a long while, it seems this should be better polished. I guess I should be glad there are a couple tutorials that teach you to fly your ship and basics of combat, but not much beyond that. There are tutorials that touch on various aspects within the game menu after you start, but their more specific and seem oriented around mid-game. For example, starting out in the young gun start, I had no idea what to do or where to go. I knew I had to start an economy to eventually get ships that would start bringing in income, but how do earn that initial investment? Or the main mission, is there one? how do I get it? No where did it tell me to scan a station looking for a data leak to start...seems like something you'd want to be guided towards. From there, a lot of points through that mission left me confused on how to proceed and off to youtube I go. 

Finally the menus where you spend quite a bit of time are not very intuitive. I think a redesign of this whole section could probably be the best QoL improvement they could make. 

Overall, I'm excited to continue learning and progressing in the game, even if it means spending basically 1:1 time in game vs researching online. If you're a fan of the genre (which seems like steep learning curves are the status quo) and don't mind the single-player experience of it, give it try.

So ill try to keep it as brief and concise as i can.

Will i keep playing this game? Yes, BUT i am very patient, i dont mind googling nearly everything (and you need to a lot with this game) i dont mind sitting watching youtube videos to figure out why my trading ship wont fucking trade. And i simply love this genre, and x4 is honestly a gem surrounded in muck.

Can i recommend it to other people? No. And heres why.
The performance, its atrocious, the game IS pretty but its nothing that should keep you at 15-30 fps at times for no reason on a high end system. Yes the game is alive and nothing is instanced, every faction is alive and everything runs in real time, BUT that doesnt excuse why a developer that would create such a intense galaxy sim game would only limit their fucking engine to like 2 cores
Yes, 2 CORES, so unless youre rocking an x3d variant of an AMD CPU or one of the newest 13xxxk intel CPUs you can forget about having an enjoyable and smooth experience. Graphic cards dont even matter, you WILL be running this game at 15-40 FPS at times and there is absolutely nothing you can do, and dont let any boomer online  tell you otherwise, the engine is shamefully poorly optmized for this game.

The game is written by someone on the spectrum, or someone who has no idea how to design a UI, be prepared to sit hours online trying to figure out the most mundane things.
 
The AI is honestly hit or miss, youll need to be ready for a lot of babysitting as the AI is simply stupid as fuck,it will kill itself and you will need to reload saves, especially early game, which is a problem because loading a save takes for 5-10 minutes, on an SSD!!!!

There are many more issues i can nitpick, but performance, UI and AI are truly what holds this game back from being a one of a kind gem that would recommend to any space game fan.
it has the potential to shine like a gem but its covered in mud of poor design and optimization choices, which is a shame, a big shame. You need a lot of patience with this game.

 If the devs ever resolve these (which they wont, its been, 6 years, dont kid yourselves) then i would gladly change this review.",1681912298,1681912892,False,8,0,0.554908990859985352,0,True,False,False

After meanwhile being able to play the game stable with my RTX 3000 Series Card (yes that was an issue in the past for me) I even went one step further and play this on Linux / Proton lately and this just works. 
The Game still is grieving for Hardware as hell, even though the core technology is not really looking like it should do that. Interestingly the Game slows down in Framerate even though the most consuming Part is the simulation of the entire galaxy in real time. One would think memory or CPU are an issue here, but considering my hardware monitoring this is not really the case. 
I honestly never have gotten past 10-15 hours in a run, which is nothing, as I am learning more and more mechanics through Youtube Videos or even with new implemented Tutorials and start all over again. 

But after some hours in total I have to say the game is full of deep details and every DLC has made it better as far as I can tell. 
If it weren't so time consuming. 

If you like space simulations, this game could be right for you. Basically you can see this a little bit as a mix of 3D Shooter with 80% economic simulation. Or Economic Simulation with 3D Shooter part. Space shooter of course. 

You can do pretty much everything tro earn your money and reputation. From hacking, to Bounty Hunting, Escorting, Mining and Trading etc. You can also let NPCs do this for you and just explore ... whatever you please. But the price is ... you have to dive into the mechanics of this game and this will cost you more hours then playing a regular game from front to back. But the reward is big, when it does click in your head and you can optimize your next run until you maybe reacht so much knowledge about the game to be creative in your runs and just try out more and more.",1616954996,1681912607,True,0,0,0.482087790966033936,0,True,False,False

I used to really enjoy playing Eve Online with friends back in my highschool days probably 15-16 years ago and this game brings back a ton of those memories. I am playing offline however I do see options for online features and chat but am not using them.

Although I still have a TON to learn about this game, I now feel I know enough to really enjoy it. Probably a solid 6 to 8 hours in I started getting the hang of the default controls and how to fly along with some easy mission based dogfighting.

I have not touched yet onto the mining aspect but plan to very soon. I highly recommend this game with all of the dlc, it seems as though I was able to scrape the surface of some of the dlc right off the bat.

The game does seem to really heat my PC up however, Ryzen 7 5800x and a EVGA RTX 3080TI 12gb, I can average about 110-155fps but man does that really heat the room up. Most settings of mine are set to high with a few on medium that really didn't seem to visually change the image but did put a dent in fps, so if you have got some PC horsepower you should be solid.

My conclusion is to definitely grab this game with the dlc, I've run into very few if any bugs at all, voice acted movie scenes and an unbelievable amount of ship customization it's hard not to get some fun out of this game, it is its own universe.....no pun intended.",1681910926,1681910926,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite it being ""Verified"" it runs terribly.
It's okay for the first 2 hours (refund window) while you do the tutorials but once you start the actual game it grinds to a stop.
Being around stations, fleets or anywhere but empty space will see frame rate drop to low 20's even on lowest settings. Big battles can bring it down to single digits.

Cannot recommend for steam deck and honestly not sure how it got verified status. 

EDIT: So after allot of testing, it seems the issue is the DLCs, with them disabled performance is much better. Each one enabled seems to take a big toll, although it sucks to be missing out on all the extra content I payed for it's at least playable.
Might explain the disparity in steam deck reports too.

Some keys can't be reassigned, it's intolerable, yet it's obvious, especially on a game like this one, to let the user configure his keys as he wants!

The game still runs kinda funky even on a 4090 with the latest X3D processor from AMD, but man it looks gorgeous at 4K. There are plenty of options to make it run on a coffee maker (lol) or last gen gaming rig.

The DLCS (I've got only the first three, for now :P) add meaningful content to the game and are generally a safe bet with Egosoft, they have an old school vision of only making you pay for lots and lots of additional stuff that I'm favorable with, and considering the work that they have done here supporting the game and upgrading it for free for all players over the years, regardless of dlcs, these guys need some sort of recognition at least for that.

I do own X3: Albion Prelude but haven't played it (I think I got it from a Humble bundle or something). I had this game on my wishlist for like 1-2 years but wasn't really sure if this is a game for me. As a casual gamer I just thought that this would be buried in my backlog and the money would be wasted. Also the reviews and the comments from hardcore X players made me feel that I wouldn't enjoy it that much. But now as I was searching for the next game to play I stumbled upon this game being discounted and decided finally to buy it. I read about the patching after many years and that it should be in a good shape.

The game swept me away immediately! The way it kind of starts as a space shooter with a bit more advanced controls and grows to become a space management game is amazing. This is the game I never knew I needed as there is always something more to do, always a reason to postpone going to sleep as there is the classical ""one more thing to do"". Even after 23 hours in just a few days I still haven't slowed down and the game presents always more to do and new things to aim for. I usually like some hand holding in games and was hesitant of the game's way of playing as a pure sandbox but somehow it didn't matter. There is a quest in the beginning but I soon found something else to do also and really created my own path from there. Some people say that you need to watch long tutorials on Youtube before playing but I think the basic tutorials in game are quite enough to get you started. I think I've only checked a couple of things online and maybe watched one Youtube video regarding how to start making money but after that I've always found the tools to advance in game.

In the scale of this game my meager 23 hours of game play has only showed me a little bit of what is to come and I wholeheartedly wait for everything to unfold.

- The conrtrols are a nightmare, same for the menu
- bugs, tons of bugs and glitches (eg. using the autopilot often ends with being stuck within a station or you get swallowed by an asteroid when mining and you're too close. Sometimes the mission objective is suddenly gone when you reload the saved game.)
- ridiculously long loading times(even from SSD)
- you spend most of your game time flying through space between the jump gates (or watching the autopilot do so). Yes, there are some highways, but most of your destinations are far away anywhere else in the sector.
- You can let your captains fly but I recommend not to look at the screen in the meantime if you don't want to suffer some kind of motion sickness ;)
- poorly designed NPCs (at least the human ones) and mid-class graphics. Very performance hungry though.

I'll pay for it. I swear.  I have all the other DLCs.  Just take the time and fix the god damn auto-pilot.  I'm not talking the complicated stuff either.

This my friends is the life of an X player.  Pure joy at what is truly an amazing game.  The space sim is sweet.  The visuals can be amazing and you can get in truly titanic battles.  Building your stations and sectors can be very satisfying to the spreadsheet lover in all of us.  

But you have to enjoy the pain too.  Because it is going to be there, it's going to happen alot and it is going to make you insane.  Mostly the pain comes from the AI and how it controls your ships.  Ships that jerk around and won't follow the leader in the fleet--lagging a system or more behind when all ships started together.  AI that rams your ships in to gates, asteroids and of course other ships.  AI that could have a capital ship fire it's main weapons at an enemy base--BUT WON'T.  It will just dick around and slowly fly around an enemy base, maybe taking care of a couple of fighters and then when it finds the enemy's heavy gun batteries it makes sure to fly on in and get obliterated even though it could have stayed at range and knocked those gun batteries out with it's main gun.

There more.  But I'm tired now.

(if ever Steam would introduce those)

The game is promising and you can instantly tell the immense scale of it from just learning how to pilote your very first tiny ship.

If you take the game little by little it's not that overly complicated as some reviews are saying; that must come by people trying to understand everything all at once. Your brain would just melt because there's so much to manage and to learn.

I had a blast learning all the shortcuts to properly navigate space with my fighter and i've earned enough credits to buy a medium sized miner ship, which i've assigned to one of my recruited captains and sent it to automine asteroids for me.

This is where i've started noticing multiple small tedious bugs that will eventually contribute to not enjoy the game.

To quote a few:

""Repair satellite"" mission: you shoot repair laser at them but they won't nudge. I've searched on Google and seems like a known bug. Ok, fair enough, that can happen.

""Deploy mines"" mission: as soon as you move, you get destroyed by your own deployed mines. Maybe i had to deploy them while moving? Nah, it's yet another known bug. 
Solution? Buy the Friend/Foe mines. Well, yeah, they cost thrice the amount of normal mines, so i think i will skip it for now.

""Destroy criminal cargos"" mission: sometimes works, sometimes not. I could oneshot one ship, and then target 3 others and they won't even notice it. I'm not talking about high armored freighters, i'm talking about man-sized ships where your lasers acts like a flashlight to them. 
You guessed it, another known bug.

Do you remember my mining ship i've written about above? I've sent it to automine (that includes selling what it mines inside the same sector, given the space station wants to buy that type of mineral). 

Result: my ship stucks attaching to random ships and just stays there, parked for good. 
Yup, another known bug i've learned about searching on Google.

Mix it all of this with random ships clipping inside stations and preventing you to land sometimes, with clones npcs which never say anything else than ""How can i help? / Good luck out there"" and no easy/extended modding scene (only a few Reshade/custom logo/FX tweak and QoL mods that should really be part of the game, a couple of ported ships from other X games) and i've got the perfect recipe to not even bother going further than this.

I might play this again if i knew these bugs will be fixed atleast, but since it's all a big cauldron of tedious game breaking bugs i will play something else meanwhile.

BELOW THIS LINE IS WHEN I'VE GIVEN A JOKE/POSITIVE REVIEW

Of the 4 hours you see on my playtime, 3 went to understanding which mod went in conflict with, 1 was for trying to load up the game after i've rage-uninstalled all mods and booting up a clean start, which got stuck at 99% loading time.

The proper ""rocket science"" game experience so i guess it fits very well!

U want to pilot and play it like elite dangerous (with the ability to walk around ship, stations, factories, sabotaging and slicing computers, pirating, or policing etc)  it can be great rpg game.  it can be great management game.  it is both imo. you choose the path.  

im just now getting into more fleet stuff.  so far liking that aspect

pros.  

u can do whatever u want almost.  (dont think u can befriend pirates.....but i could be wrong in that.)  You can be a pirate urself. 

most everything...

cons

missions are not well explained many times if at all.  
most things are not explained or done poorly.  like how to craft, where to get the items to do so.  
how to build stations, what each part really does.  setting up the buy-sell orders etc.  there so much i yet to understand.

of course there is a few great youtubers who explain most things well.  but they expect u to have some basic knowledge of the game.  so i find myself rewatching many of the videos as i trail and error.  but i not blaming them.  the game is again just so vast, complex.

So lets do that - maybe after 2000 hours of ""playtime""...

Yes, indeed: I had the game running for over 2700 hours now.
And I still recommend: do *not* spend any money on this.

Maybe you picked it up in a sale for ~5 bucks? 
Not worth it if you have to pay for the bugfixes (called ""DLCs"" in X-Game lingo; they use a special version of English, like ""goods"" are traditionally called ""wares"" and bugfixes and rebalancings are sold for extra, good money that you are expected to throw in afterwards.
If you can pick it up for a tenner with the DLCs included - and if you can stand the loooong loading and saving times: yes, you can extract that amount of fun from it.

The latest DLC Kingdom End does add a few more systems and does a better job at the introduction missions. Maning: a less terrible job, since the pacing is still anything but smooth and the lost feeling of ""what am I supposed to do now"" is still the main texture of the game.

Also the engine seems to be a bit more multithreaded now: using almost 4 CPU cores. And it can max out an RX6900XT in some situations.
And of course: no frame limiter, no setting to run fullscreen at reduced resolution or the like. Such gimmics are reserved for games built on engined not from the 90ies.

I still have the game running sometimes, usually in the background while doing other things, and let the built-in automations play themselves.
I use X4 for my gain: I sometimes have quite some exitement in my life that I need to balance out.
And *nothing* is a boring as X4: watching paint dry is - in direct comparision - riveting, almost exiting.

So if boredom - e.g. killing a Xenon K with a Nemesis or Kuoakami - is what you are after: maybe this is woth even 15 bucks. For the ""edition"" with all the DLCs included.

Yes, I did kill a K - many in fact while systematically eliminating their bases because they just annoyed me - by sliding in behind in the blind spot (the 2 turrets there are quickly gone and then you are pretty safe) and then systematically eliminating the turrents, then the shield generators (Split thermal thingies shoot through shields) and then wear the thing down.
Works 100% of the time - if you got into the blind spot. Which is just pure lottery, no skill or practise is involved. Just save+reload and therefore: patience.

Lots, lots, lots and then lots of patience in fact.
The same approach works for Xenon bases: kill the turrents one by one with the superior range guns of a destroyer and the simply pound the stupid base for an hour.
Or let loose 5 NPC-controlled destroyers for about 3-4 hours: same effect, the base is gone.

The game is chock full of concepts.
Obviously someone made a long list of features the game was supposed to have, like boarding ships and fleets and separate fleet wings and automations for trading and an autopilot and and and and...
And not a /single/ such feature from the list made it into a game concept.
""Boarding"" for exaple is even comically stupid in its realization: assemble a fleet with 200+ Marines on board - but the game does not allow you to actually send more than some arbitrary number (e.g. 92) which then face the crew of the target (also 92) to get completely slaughtered without weakening the targets defences by even /one/ defender.
Because --- well, its the game! It never tells you ""why"" or ""what"" happened other than to annoy with completeley useless ""info"".
Oh, and from launching the attack to the ""capsules"" actually lauched to the target takes some 5 to 45 minutes, depending on where the ""AI"" script decided to teleport the attacking ship.
And then during the boarding action all your fleet mercilessly pounds the target to dust unless you manage to manually fly them to the next system over.

And then the whole ""boarding action"" is one fricking screen where some numbers randomly count down until one side has won while randomly playing soundbites with no relation to anything.

The game is full of such stuff that sounds like a great concept - if it even was a concept and not just a pipe dream that never made it into reality but still had to be crossed of some feature-to-be-present-before-shipping list.

I once said I /want/ to like this game.
But I evolved and learned: I do no longer want to.
I just use it for amusement: how thind, boring, flat and stale can a somewhat nice looking game be?
X4 certainly sets records for boring and thin.

--- old review
Oh, Steam figured out that I played this again after writing about it.
So their Algorithm thought, I should update my review. Ok, lets do that.

Short: do not buy.
Well, unless its like 5 Bucks or so, that amount of fun you may get out of this.

Long: do not - under any circuimstances - pay money for this: it will only encourage the developers to throw more of this sort of stuff at us, the paying customers.

Should I even update an already lengthy review again?
I think I should: there have been positive reviews of this game recently which should be impossible.

I still *want* to like the game. I really do!
But it is physically impossible, especially since the Cradle of Humanity DLC.

Long story short: do not buy this.
Not only is the engine hopelessly outdated (never uses more than 1.5 CPU cores, still uses XML for the savegame, save/load take /forever/ and then some, out-of-memory-conditions inside the engine lead to corrupted data in the savegame which never auto-corrects or is correctible).

No, the lame engine is not the big problem.
The storytelling sets a new record for ""how thin can you get"". But that is kinda fine: all X games werde always /thin/ on story.

Not even the microscopically thin  story is the big problem.
The big problem is: you never know.
Whatever annoying thing is happening (""follow that ship! now scan!"" Aha. Scan. Scan what? How?): you never know whether its a bug or you are simply not getting the point.
The game does not tell you - well - anything, really. It keeps you guessing and usually you will assume yourself to be slow/dense/stupid when actually you hit one of the bugs. Or one of the conceptual flaws which are effectively bugs (as they are indistiguishable from such).

Again: Do not spend money on this.",1543618946,1681636260,False,5,1,0.302747040987014771,0,True,False,False

- Yep, I've played Elite Dangerous, I've even bought joystick to make it more immersive in VR (this is how much hyped I was about Elite) but boring and incredibly long (5-15 mins) warpes/FSD thing is WAY TOO IMMERSIVE for me... Nope, I don't want to play the game to alt+tab every time I want to make a warp jump to something far, especially with VR helmet on my head.
- Yep, I've spent few months in Eve Online which is great but I don't actually want to spend a couple of years to become someone significant or find a way to entertain myself (I tried a lot of things there: mining, scanning, null secs, wh, anomalies, faction wars, random teleports, small fleet pvp - a lot of different things but nope, eventually I got bored)
- Yep, I tried X3 back then but was too dumb to learn how to play it.
I have even spent countless weeks playing Space Rangers 2 (old but gold turn-based game) but X4... man... This is something special. I can only blame myself for not trying it before.
So... I can't even describe all the things that are done just right in X4. Warping is fast and filled with gameplay (there're a lot of things can happen around while you're warping), fleet is sometimes hard to command but nothing really frustrating (even the idea itself that you can control your fleet with variety of special commands is cool - something monotonous once in a while becomes just a set of mouse clicks just once and every ship just knows what it should do), seamless space is EXTREMELY EPIC (no loading on docking to stations or to other ships, no loading while walking on a station, no loading while entering new sectors. Space is a real honest space. Such things gives your some cool visuals like standing on your capital ship and watching from captains bridge how's the whole battle is doing without your direct control. I will be honest, even watching your ships docking on your carrier while you're standing on landing platforms is still giving me chills).

While you control only one ship in space-sims I've personally played before, in X4 you can control your whole empire of your own fleet, stations, minings barges, scouts, builders etc. I would say this gives me some Mount&Bladey or Eve Online-corporation-simulator feels sometimes.

But yeah, not without a fly in the ointment. 
- The game does not have great visuals but eats your PC resources quite greedy, especially CPU. Of course that's because instead of remote servers as Elite and Eve has, X4 have to simulate the whole universe on your side. But anyway, X4 lacks the visual charm and optimisation that vanilla Elite has (though I heard that Odyssey release was quite harsh)
- Joystick setup is a pain in a head. You have to know some tweaks to set it up correctly (like turn off your guns directing your mouse pointer and other little things). The most portion of the X4 players are playing using keyboard+mouse so it's not actually a big problem for devs or players. Buuuuut anyway...
- No traditional multiplayer (at least I still didn't get the idea of multiplayer that X4 has). Unfortunately, there's no traditional multiplayer and you can't just connect to the your friend's world to fly together. While Elite has some unique and interesting mechanics like Multi-crew, X4 devs are trying to integrate multiplayer mechanics bit by bit (and as far as I understood, even the idea of implementing multiplayer in X games are quite revolutionary). I will not blame devs as for me, muiltiplayer in such games (without remote servers I remind) is a hard task to complete.
- Not sure this is a space-sim for every enthusiast out there. I think X4 is more focused on economic and production part than on battling or using just one ship - though I don't really know - this is just how I started to play it personally.

Very sad this game has not a very big player-base but I guess this game lacks some marketing as I had to really lurk more to even find it. Oh and I've tried only vanilla atm. No idea if I will have to leave my job once I will got all the dlcs...",1670943696,1681608939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The X3 series weren't exactly easy to play, so I came prepared for a steep learning curve and lots of googling. In spite of all of that, just 10 hours in to X4 and I have already decided this game isn't for me. Here's why:

The user interface is unusable. Gone are the days of navigating menus at breakneck speed with hotkeys, getting to information like your ships equipment requires significantly more effort. There are usually multiple different ""directions"" to the menus, so you need to click, scroll, click and then scroll to reach information that would be shift+hotkey in X3. This is because the game is trying to display too much at once and it ends up just looking untidy

When you click on a friendly station, you get the same information screen as you get when clicking on your own ships, because apparently giving the player the screen for ""crew"" and ""loadout"" (90% of which is ????? because it's not yours) is more important than displaying the wares and prices in an easy to understand way. Those useless menu screens don't go away, btw. You can navigate more menus to find out wares and prices, but they'll be displayed on a tiny window compared to the huge wealth of information you don't want and didn't ask for. 

Viewing both your ships equipment and cargo on the same screen is impossible, in part because ship equipment is no longer a transferable ware... for some reason. This alone is a huge regression. Stripping old ships of valuable equipment before selling is no longer possible without labour intensive workarounds. 

The point I'm trying to make is that I'm no noob when it comes to both ""opaque"" games and the X franchise specifically. But compared to X3, this game might as well be a brick wall. The chaotic way information is chopped up and distributed far and wide just gives me a headache.

So far it seems to be random, make sure you are saving every 5 to 10 minutes. Typical Egosoft break something that was working just fine.. sigh. This will most likely be the last time I buy anything from Egosoft early at release. The Boron's are also long winded slow talking squid things, with lots of dialog. Ships look great though!

ALWAYS wait a few years to buy their games on a heftly sale of 60% or more. To buy prior to that is actually paying them to frustrate you with endless nonsensical bugs. On a side note the AI pathing, reaction speeds to the game world seems to have improved. So there are some positives in Kingdom's End DLC, I suggest waiting a year until they can sort some of the new bugs out. 

Do not buy, wait a few years until the game is complete. Buggy as all can be, missing races from the game. Which you are going to have to pay for in upcoming expansions. Egosoft used to be great, despite releasing buggy games, they always fixed it and add content for free. Now they are going to wait to add what should be in the game at release, and add it in expansions. So now Egosoft is company that releases buggy games with a new horrible DLC model.

I originally purchased the collector's edition. I have tried out Split Vendetta, unfortunately the game is more unplayable for me. I use mouse/keyboard and with cursor targetting bugged with mouse use, makes combat nigh impossible (at least for dog fights). Another new annoyance is a bug with Nvidia drivers where the HP/Shield bars disappear. When I played prior to Split Vendetta (3.0) neither of these issues existed, was hoping the game would get better, not worse. Maybe they just need to give up and stop giving us false hope for a playable game. 2 years this game has been out.. feels like it is still a beta.

Edit: As of patch 5.10 the game has quite a bit more content. However it is still plagued with inadequate AI, assign ship to follow commander they lag way behind and are very slow to react. Assign them any other command, same issue. So many possible commands and ways to set the AI, but none of them work majority of the time. It seems the more they add the worse this game becomes.

Game has its beauty, but it is not delivering most of its promises. It's simply aiming to meet ""criteria"" with the absolute bare minimum of potential player experience.

Lack of proper positioning in search engines and plentitude of things overly hidden in UI, combined with hardly possible to find tutorials or guides will make any knowledge forbidden for new players.

My recommendation is mid range teetering on barely recommend. My first experience was having my stomach made upset by the whipping motion I was put through in Grand Exchange. I don't know if this was a game design to simulate a problem in that system or not, but I found it not fun in even the slightest. My stomach tried coming up from the action. What was also worse was going from friendly with the Teladi to hated as I undocked my ship from a trade station. One moment I dock and walk around the station. The next, the automated defenses are shooting at me and the station is now red. 

""I had no contraband or items of any kind in my ship."" 

Oh yea, having a ship I had just purchased fly off and leave me behind because you are forced to hire a pilot was also not nice. I had just bought it and the interface would not allow me to finish the purchase without hiring a pilot. I had to order it to re-dock to pick me up. 

Btw, will the game play on an MSI Katana laptop? It has a Nividia GTX 3060? But the design of the machine sucks on power consumption. Meaning the battery cannot supply enough power to the GPU when not plugged in.

[2018 Review]

It's a buggy mess but I am holding out hope that they'll fix it. If they do I will change my review.

After a few updates I gave the game a try again. This go around I progressed further into the game. Still ran into bugs like falling through the floor, bad AI, etc. Had fun though.

Things get more complicated later in the game, when you start having a fleet and especially when you engage in large-scale combat. It's a very CPU dependent game and even with an i9 10900k at 5,1 GHz, the FPS drops to 30 or 20 during big battles, with 40% GPU utilization and 10% CPU utilization, BUT, only one of the 10 cores at 100%. There is no fix for this, the game was badly developed, because using a single core to calculate millions of calculations per second is destructive for performance and above all for gameplay.
This is the biggest flaw because it leads you to play the title only in the initial stages, in fact I started it 4 times to get over 200 spacecraft and abandon everything due to the bad performances with many ships.
Asking on the Egosoft support forum, no staff member replies and if they do they give you basic solutions which don't help at all, but after some personal research I was able to increase performance by 10%, going from battles with 100+ spaceships from 20-30 FPS to almost 38-42. The only thing you can do is set the priority of the process (.exe) to ""high"" (not realtime).
But be careful, in this way the core used by the game will give priority to X4 first and then to system resources, such as other background software, drivers, etc. I personally don't recommend this ""fix"" on a quad core CPU.

To this we also add the AI which is not exactly the best, as many Xenon have the habit of creating outposts near the portals or along the hyperways, destroying all the spaceships that pass through them, both yours and those of the owner of the sector. Same owner who despite having thousands of spaceships destroyed, prefers to keep the capitals stationary instead of destroying enemy outposts, causing their economy to collapse and causing problems for you too! Because if you want to buy yourself a spaceship it is possible that you will have to wait for REAL HOURS or even REAL days for the shipyards to receive the necessary resources. Or you have to carry them by hand avoiding the sectors where the Xenon have outposts 1 meter from the portal.

In X4 you finally have the ability to drive capital ships and not just control them with orders etc, but that doesn't mean it's cool, on the contrary! Because most of the capital starships are slow, I mean really slow, very slow, extremely slow, and have only 4 or 5 turrets (desired design to avoid too much load on the single core being used?). In fact many times I found myself thinking ""oh finally I can buy my first L ship, I will use this for all the gameplay!"" then after 2 minutes of driving: ""no, better go back to my S"", because that's it, you'll use the S ship a lot more because they are fast, they do a lot of damage, you can destroy an L ship by practically staying attached to it so that the turrets cannot shoot at you, you can quickly scan stations for building blueprints, etc...

Construction projects, yet another problem here. The idea is wonderful, unfortunately the function to position the modules is cumbersome beyond imagination. Rotating the modules is like trying to hold a wet bar of soap while you're showering and about to slip.

Superficiality in design. Although there are a fair number of spaceships, it is perceived that they have been designed with superficiality. While each major race has its own style, they all appear to have the same stuff. [strike]Also, the builder ship is the same for all races and is Terran-style, it almost looks like they made one and forgot to change its look for the other races.[/strike] In addition to the design of the ships there is the design of the stations to consider. All the same!! Then I don't understand why divide the offices... in the sense, if you want to go to the manager's office you have to use the elevator that teleports you to a floor where there are 3 doors, one of which is open and that's the one you're interested in. Then you want to go to the security office? You have to use the elevator again to be teleported back to a corridor with 3 more doors and only 1 open. But why couldn't you put a single floor and an office behind every door?

Since Steam doesn't allow you to make very long reviews, I'll stop here with the last point which is important to me but there would be many more negative things to say, I hope X5 will be developed TOTALLY differently, or my X saga will sadly end here.

The saves are made in XML ... come on, in 2022 are XML still used as a database and moreover large? An average save reaches 500MB (just one!!) while a mid-story save with 50 hours of gameplay can reach 1GB. Then there is to calculate that there are autosaves every X minutes, in the end you will have a ""saves"" folder with over 5 or 6 GB that Steam will upload to your cloud... Imagine having a slow upload connection.
But I say, use a database in SQLite or PostgreSQL or any other local database, huh? Extremely faster as well as weighing 10 times less, since they are not like XML which has opening tags and closing tags for each single node!

No, Egosoft, NO!

[h1]Patch 6.0[/h1]
The only thing that can really be noticed in this update is the redesign (finally) of the construction ships of the other races and some improvements to lighting and shadows. As far as performance is concerned, however, nothing has changed. I loaded my last save where I have 200+ ships and two fleets of 60 warships each, just moving them drops to 50 FPS, engaging some enemies it goes to the usual 30 40 FPS.
There will be no further updates to this review, as (for me) X4 ends here.",1670713562,1681430666,False,280,10,0.854987800121307373,17,True,False,False

The good:

- Many hours of solid content but X4 is not for everyone. You need at least two brain cells to rub together. Better get a good calculator for production line optimizations. 
- Sound effects and music are decent (Listen to the ship computer when the female voice says Manorina mineral vanguard). Asteroid belts, background objects like planets or suns are exceptionally well made.
- The game can be played as a sandbox by completely disregarding the story lines. You start with the cheapest weakest ship and work your way up to conqueering the entire universe by taking out entire factions with your carrier & destroyer groups. 
- Previous saves help new custom starts credits wise, research wise and knowledgewise. 
- Trading, manufacturing and combat has a good balance. 
- The ship scale is very well implemented. Best designs i have seen so far in a space sim. 
- I find weapon and module choices plenty and satisfactory. Ships can be customized including skins earned from missions.
- I have enjoyed designing and building factories, shipyards and defense platforms. Monopolizing production by sabotaging others and hoarding have satisfactory returns. Simply selling food and medical supplies to the nearby stations earned me millions every hour. Station managers automate some of the repetitive tasks.
- Good boarding mechanics. Sub-modules of capital ships can be targeted seperately.

The bad:

- X4 is released in 2018. The game engine is showing it's age. Most probably the designers are at the limits of what can be done with it. 
- The game physics require more work. A lot of unwanted results there.
- I believe that the game code has a memory leak. Performance of the game degrades after a few hours. 
- Regrettably the universe becomes stale after some time. Factions do not declare war to each other, they do not try to wipe out the opposition. They just blow up a few stations and stop. This game requires Bannerlord level diplomacy. 
- Every production ends up as a ship to be blown up in a skirmish somewhere. This part of the game requires more improvement. Economic recession is a thing. 
- The player can walk into the engineering or security section of the station and sabotage one of the many terminals with no consequences. No door lock, no guard, no nothing.
- Stations feel empty and devoid of life. Walking in a station feels like i am hovering above the floor.

The ugly: 

- There are so many bugs. Damn everything can get bugged. Save often.
- Character models and animations are very outdated. Hair and clothing looks like from late 1990 s.
- The UI is hideous. One of the worst i have ever seen. Microsoft Excel has better UI, that's what i am comparing the game UI to. Damn, Egosoft dropped the ball.
- Trading requires a seperate UI, independent from the universe map.
- Storyline missions are terrible. 
- L and XL ship AI requires rework. Although much better when compared with 4.0 or 5.0 versions, your destroyers still refuse to bombard with that 10 km range cannon and nose dives into a station which has dozens of 6 km ranged plasma turrets to decimate your large ship. 
- Formations do not work. Ships do not follow the formation leader properly. Sometimes there is at least one sector difference between the leader and the rest of the group. Hurts a lot when a coordinated attack is needed. 
- It is very hard to control the spacesuit. 
- Ship controls are sluggish if you do not have a good joystick. 
- I do not even want to talk about the autopilot.
- Collision detection requires severe rework. AI gets stuck inside station modules. Large ships get tangled to each other. 
- Module placement during station design can be used as a form of torture in the middle east. 
- Lack of proper reporting of the events took place. 
- Xenon AI requires rework. It simply cannot coordinate attacks and sends 2-3 ships to kamikaze missions continiously. Supply ships or miners try to go through AI controlled sectors and get annihilated. I find Xenon race very passive. Regrettably i was able to take out 3 K and one I class (Largest nastiest ship out there) Xenon destroyers with only four behemoth class destroyers. Something wrong here. 
- A new set of AI automation has to be coded for station logistics. The largest trade vessel, which can simply carry the annual production of the entire China in a single run flies across the known universe for 80 pieces of microchips. 

Conclusion: I recommend the game but be wary of what you are walking into. If you want to buy, wait for a discount as i find the regular price for the basegame and all the DLC s way too high for an 2018 released title.

The game itself is a unique one. Sandbox Singleplayer Space Game with heavy focus on Economy and Building ur own empire. 
Some very good improvements in 6.0 is the noticeable performance boost of the game. 
Also Borons Ships looks really cool and Egosoft made some big improvements on how they tell Storys. If you look at the older plots its kinda annoying how bad the Plots were.

Still there are some Problems with the game. 
-The Station Builder is clunky ( No simple Rotation of Modules by Key)
-Combat AI is at its best decent
-Macro AI is stupid too  (I would really like to see the Factions use their Ressource more Strategically and not just waste another Capital Ship dieing alone without decent support attacking a whole system. Or Xenon Miners flying through countless Systems of Enemys to die in a stupid way)
-Economy in Vanilla often dies after some hours playing time (Didnt actually look at it without mods in 6.0)
-Missions are boring and often frustrating
-Ship Design especially Teladi and Xenon are boring
-Too little Ship variety ( Yes mods can fix this but cmon)

Besides this failures the game is still fun and in times of Star Citizen MMO trash what i always wanted from a space Game. Just because of this i staid with the X Series for Years besides Egosoft F*** ups.

I can recommend everyone who dont like vanilla to download the Star Wars Interworld Mod from Nexusmods or the Discord. It lifts this game on  a whole new Level and makes the game more what it should be. Big fat Combats with 100 of Fighters, Capital Ships. Pew pew everywhere. 

Egosoft should really look at that mod because Combat feels 1000% better than Vanilla Combat and u really have this feeling of good fun combats with even a tactical level.

Hell even Disney could learn from the mod what Fans really want from Star Wars.

Anyway Egosoft keep up the good Updates u are on the right way but keep a look at good mods from the community and integrate them into X4 besides leaving good Features to community moders who could always can stop working on essential mods.

A few years of dedication from the team at EGO has completely flipped my views on this game.  Many of the early day defects (most probably?) are gone.  The DLC has enriched and expanded the universe in fascinating ways, the economy issues and trader AI brokenness are a distant memory.  Re-entering the X universe in the past few months has been the game that I had hoped for (even exceeding my earliest expectations)  I loved X3 and this successor is the followup that that game deserved.  Strap in for a very deep experience, be it pirate, miner, freelancer, corporate enforcer or empire builder and captain of industry.  It's all hear and now it seems to work REALLY well.  I'm very excited to experience the latest Kingdom expansion.  Thank you Egosoft for continuing to refine and hone this game into the great experience it is today.

Original Review 4/28/2020
I so want to recommend this game.  It is that combination of deep complexity + opaque mechanics that make it impossible to recommend.  Figuring stuff out is just a slog.  Most ""bugs"" are just the complex mechanics doing the thing they are designed to do but you have NO idea why or how to determine how to fix it.  On top of the albeit minor graphical bugs that have existed since launch (your pilots seem to have a penchant for sitting in front of their assigned seat) there are just too many f'd up issues on how your crew works, how you progress and how to get unstuck when you get the odd ""autominer"" from sitting idly by with a hold full of ore or an ""autotrader"" that appears to have gone mad and filled his/her ship with unsellable wares and is content to wander the galaxy until an errant pirate destroys them.  There is the framework of a great game in there, but it's entirely too high a wall to climb to sort it all out.  If, on the otherhand, you enjoy watching endless youtube videos (many of which apply to versions that no longer have the features in question) this is the challenge for you.",1588183499,1681381633,True,0,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Otherwise the game is a prettier X universe with some very weird mechanics most of them alright... the AI is hopeless with shield depleting boost, movement feels really slow and menus are a confusing mess. As with any X game keep a book nearby to read while your ship auto-travels around.

Luckily Egosoft had the foresight to add decent mod support so you can tailor the game quite a bit, with that it feels pretty good. Then again, it is kinda weird to recommend a game that you need to mod to make good.



Old Review: This game was released about 5 years ago and it still is a mess in so many ways: loading times are awful even on SSD, autosave doesn't respect it's own timeframes (i.e. you set autosave every 10-20 minutes and on reload the last one was over an hour ago). Opening menus stops your ship by default but doesn't pause the game. There's little to no explanation on how to take on quests, selling ships must be done through the map instead of an interface on a shipyard for some reason.

As a space game, it works. There are issues with polish here and there but the ship designs are great, the pacing is good if you know what you're doing and it's a game you can lose some time to easily.

Trade is serviceable and setting up the network of cargo carriers as you build your network is always fun, particularly when it works right. The fighting is fast enough and I enjoy the control schemes over other similar games like No Mans Sky. 

The AI however is probably the weak point of the game. There are times you wish you had more control over fleets and I'm led to understand that during fleet battles, it's best not to be in the area because the AI bugs out. Whether that gets fixed or not is up to patches to determine. I don't think my irritation with it overshadowed the fun I had.

What I really liked was the ship design. The split ships are beautifully brutal looking, the Paranid ships are smooth, Teladi are business like while the Argon and human ships just look right for human types of ships. Maybe that's our Scifi heritage but they....just look right to me From what I've seen the Boron ships also look great but I haven't seen many so far. 

Things I would like to see if I had a million dollars to give to them:
1) When you finally get your capital ship, you notice that you are still flying it like a small single person ship. It would be nice to have a more ""bridge"" type control and interface for the larger ships and maybe even the smaller corvettes. Running things off the map screen is ok, not the best.
2) I felt that I needed a mod to keep the universe from turning into a Xenon hellscape. It really felt like I needed to be there to keep the Xenons from overrunning everything and then some. While I don't mind the 'hero' job, I'd like to see something where I can walk away for a month and come back to changes, but not necessarily a map turned to red.
3) I had some missions that were bizarre. I had to destroy the Xenon station batteries but I really have no idea how to do that without obliterating the station or getting turned into swiss cheese attempting it. Maybe I'm just noobing it there. If I destroy the station, it won't complete the mission.
4) My 4090 can handle Ultra, but you can use the game to heat your room in the winter (and I've done this). Not a programmer but maybe there is some room in the patches to look at how it uses computer resources?",1681338364,1681338364,True,3,0,0.530340254306793213,0,True,False,False

I can't even navigate off the menus because there's nothing to read. it's all just literally strings of numbers. Hopefully I'll be able to get a refund because the game is unplayable.

I've been PC gaming for 20 years and have never seen a game literally break itself into a string of random numbers, let alone to an extent that it must have screwed up something in the registry that uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't correct.

Will update my review if I can stomach going back and staying just under my 2 hour limit so I can still refund.

EDIT:  Thought I would revisit this in 2023.  Just bought the Kingdom End DLC.  Tried a Terran start, flew around a bit...still hate the interface.  Progressed the plot, went to a gate, and a Xenon K(?) spawned in, then proceeded to spin around on its nose vertically like the whales in Start Trek IV during the cutscene.

Then, when I had control, the Xenon ship was still lazily rotating about its axis without doing anything at all while the Terran ships attack it.  I took out one of it's engines, then started working on the other one.  I got a bit close, and I was teleported away from it backwards.

The ship then blew up right in front of the gate.

2023 everyone, some 5 years later, and they couldn't even get this early cutscene right. Come on Egosoft.

I like real time strategy games and this game combines the concept of real time strategy with the immersion of first person space simulation.  The graphics are not the latest and greatest but I was surprised that they are as good as they are when you take into account the depth and performance of the game.  I think the developers did a really good job engineering the game to be able to handle the data and still be immersive as well,  The game performs well.  The combat can be difficult to orchestrate if you are flying a ship while commanding your fleets and It's really easy to outrun your pilots or accidentally get the timing off and have half your fleet wiped out before the rest get there but these are all quirks that can be ironed out with experience and player skill.  The crew and pilot skill levels greatly affect the performance of the ship they're commanding,  Getting your staff experienced and performing well when you have 200 ships can be a tedious challenge if you decide to give them seminars.  I hope the developers will include a station module that you can send staff to for training that would be pretty cool and I think would make a lot of sense.

The X series has been around since the 90s, getting steadily better, and these devs are super committed to their games. In fact just a year or two ago they released a free expansion for their 2005 game (X3) even when this sequel had already released. If a dev supports a nearly 20 year old game, you know they're solid.

With X4, there is still some jank that will remind you this is not an AAA game (the way humans look, for example) and the UI is a bit clunky to navigate. But none of that takes away from the other things this game nails like atmosphere, scale, and depth. Every other space sim I've played has fallen short of what I wish I could do in space -- this game nails that. I enjoy No Man's Sky too, but that is a very different end of the spectrum. NMS is more of a survivalcraft & planetary exploration game than a deep space sim like X4, so I like both for different reasons.

X4 has received many updates, and the devs said they are still working on more. It's very likely this game will see support for quite some time. You really can't go wrong at least trying it. Just know that in your first few hours, you're likely barely going to get anything accomplished, and that's probably okay. This isn't an instant gratification game.

Elite Dangerous has often been called a mile wide and an inch deep. This game is the answer to that. It feels like a living, evolving universe that you are a part of, with a dynamic cast of races all doing their thing, a bunch of factions also doing their thing, and a completely free hand to be whatever you want to be among this universe. It's the most immersive space sim out there right now, so if you want a great space sandbox look no further, this is it.

There are definitely still some rough edges, but with the entire game world being constantly simulated, the things they had to do to to get that working I think permit some of the jank.

6.0's big changes for me as a player with multiple hundred-hour playthroughs (around 1 per patch) who has yet to explore everything in the game still (granted, because some things take a long time and I dont use SETA's 10x time acceleration much) are:
* new visually distinct builder ships - yes its such a small thing but its nice to look at and the new designs are great - it was pretty weird everyone was just using the same argon builder model. Plus it hints at an upcoming Teladi ship design rework as their builder uses a brand new style, probably in 7.0, like the paranid got in 5.0
* new physics engine - usually you can get unstuck after getting stuck inside something, instead of just permanently being stuck in something. Also you can just hop out of the system now with teleportation (scan signals on stations to get the quest line that eventually unlocks research options. Its the one with the boron giving you a mission to investigate science things) and it will get itself sorted out when you hop back in
* capship AI is smarter now and doesn't usually fly right into xenon anti-capitalship weaponry anymore on attack. Move orders are another story though, but more easily mitigated
* more attack order types and options, including coordinated attack so your fleet doesnt just trickle into a fight

Some tips:
Get teleportation researched ASAP (See above on hint on how to unlock - if you still need more help I would recommend googling it or checking a guide, I dont want to put things people might consider spoilers in a review)
Buy miners and have them automine as a good way to get some starting cash. Once you have a factory station setup, you can reassign them to mine for the station
Buy a small fast ship and have it collect drops on repeat orders in a loop, and an order override of 'flee' on being attacked. This will get you tons of loot for later game crafting, crafting a SETA device to accelerate time, and simply for selling for cash. The early game wars can net you ~5 million credits per hour with this method
Do the hatikvah storyline - it unlocks pretty much all the lategame storylines and you get free ships from the early parts of some of them (the later parts get super expensive, but they are meant for when you have giant factory complexes and shipyards to sell stuff in huge volumes to the factions to make an ROI. You can totally get to a point in the game where purely from factory and shipyard profits you can walk away to lunch, come back, and find yourself hundreds of millions of credits richer, without even using SETA)
Dont sleep on war missions, especially the ones the Terrans (from the Cradle of Humanity DLC) offer. The ship building missions give good ROI, and the station building missions let you attach extra modules to a station and its still considered valid... this means you can slap an admin module onto an outpost the Terrans ask you to build, and they will then go and actively defend the system since they now have a valid claim on it (Even if its only a contesting claim rather than a full claim in many cases, since the system is usually claimed by someone else). The Terrans are the only faction that explicitly tries to defend against the Xenon (the other factions will attempt reactionary defenses) so if your galaxy is getting overrun, they are a good option to help out.
Terran manufacturing goods sell for a lot - my terran tech factories make more money than my commonwealth/universal tech ones do
* The L (large) size salvage ships that the Riptide rakers from the tides of avarice DLC is an amazing training vessel for engineers. Just load it up with crew, set it to salvage in a region inside of Silent Witness IX or whatever the highest numbered sector of Silent Witness is, and it will get them to 4-5 star engineering and morale usually in less than a day
* To level up pilots, give them a fast ship and some very short orders on repeat - or do station scan missions for 2*->3* seminars and war missions and get those higher tier seminars. basic (0*->1* and 1*->2* seminars are relatively common loot and the 0->1* ones can be bought from vendors in the traders corners of landing zones on stations)
* To level up station managers, make a station with a bunch of miners, energy cell production, and the 3 Terran production modules (it goes even faster if you have more of them, which you can easily manufacture with the parts they produce). They should reach 4-5* within a day - if not, make sure that the finished wares are available for people to buy and the station is not so remote (in terms of jumps) that the AI factions' traders can actually find it when they are looking for trades (they look out to a certain number of jumps depending on pilot or manager level)
* Admin modules let you claim systems - this means you can outlaw the raw materials to prevent the AI from wanting to mine in your claimed sectors, which slightly reduces the frequency of Kha'ak attacking your own miners. L and XL size shipyard bays also count as admin centers. the S/M construction bay does not.
* Don't rush to the end of the Tides of Avarice story (specifically the Protectyon one, the Empyrian Curs one is more of a tutorial on gameplay activities of dubious legality - depending on jurisdiction at least). You will want to either read a guide to cheese it or develop a big industrial base for the final stages of it if you go in blind.
* Once you can afford it, its probably a good idea to build ~150 Kyds for dirt cheap (minimal preset, or build them yourself) to park in the Vigor Syndicate's S/M fabrication bay to clog them up from being able to build more fighters (they cannot build them if all docking slots and internal storage for S ships is filled up) because dang those huge fighter fleets they can accumulate are LAGGY.
* Extra dirt cheap Kyds from the above tip are also useful for parking at other factions stations and on their carriers/battleships so you can spy on what they are doing
* If you want the Erlking, you can cheese the fight by simply getting a fast ship, aggroing the guards at the scrap yard by sitting near the Erlking for a minute, and then running off into xenon territory (like the one north of Hatikva's choice I) and letting them get themselves killed fighting xenon. You can then head back and repeatedly attempt boarding the Erlking with no further fights/resistance.
* The Erlking is an amazing freighter - high capacity and high speed - even before you can install the unique parts on it (it needs an XL ship maintenance or shipyard bay to install them, since only you will be able to own the blueprints - other AI factions cannot own the blueprints and thus cannot build the parts for you)
* Split L civilian ships (the buffalo freighter and wyvern miner) are great ships to add to your military. The Wyvern is an amazing anti-khaak patrol boat, especially with Argon flak cannons
* Dont sleep on ship mods in late game once you can build the Terran Asgard battleship or the Split Raptor carrier. They can make them incredibly powerful (esp the Asgard, because its more shield heavy and shields have better mod bonuses)
* The common tier slasher damage mod for weapons/turrets is hilariously good on turrets because they dont have heat mechanics for it to debuff, so just reroll it to you can get 40+% more damage and 80+% more reload speed for hilariously good DPS. Doing this on an asgard's turret w/ plasma turrets installed allows the Asgard to have ludicrous levels of turret DPS - enough to win a turret-only duel against a Xenon I without needing to use your main weapons at all.
* Use global overrides to prevent your trade ships from dying in Xenon sectors.

The visuals and the feel of flying are great, but the game doesn't respect your time. The tutorials are bad and lacking in breadth - I get that it's a sandbox and you can discover things on your own but the lack of guidance or contextual clues make things that feel like they should be simple needlessly complex. 2 key examples here are station building and missions, I've had to search the internet on each to figure out how to do them.
For station building in particular, they've made a system where if you know how it works you can created an incredibly complex station, having control over every aspect - but this makes it have a massive learning curve that seems to be just trial and error.

Also the time accelerator takes ages to get (luck-based acquisition of crafting materials) and then doesn't work unless you're manually flying the ship and aren't in travel mode, even though it's not a ship item but a personal item.

Deep, complex, lots of moving parts, just the kind of game I like. However my conclusion - not definitive; I'll keep trying - is that it has become a huge waste of time for the non-initiated. My impression is that the game has evolved incrementally for years, with a crowd of players that has never seen the game change to the point of being lost from one iteration to the next. However they forgot that a newcomer would eventually be completely lost taking the game from the beginning. And I write this after over 90 hours of frustration. We keep being told 'go to this sector'. But the sector is nowhere to be found. We're blind. And our ship takes minutes to traverse a sector looking for a highway or a portal, sometimes to find just the void of space at the other end. Luckily some people have published maps, but you have to google for help. There are locked boxes in space that you're supposed to open by destroying the locks with a laser. Once, I opened a box and a mine flew out in my direction and boom... game over. In my last mission, I'm supposed to pick up mines and deploy them in a certain location. The mines are in a box with a bright padlock icon on them. Ok... I put on my suit, open each of the five boxes, pick up the mines one by one. As I do this, some NPC tells me enthusiastically that the mines are of a certain type (friend/foe or something like that), leading me to believe that I'm doing what I'm expected to do. Ok... all mines picked up. Now I'm told to proceed to the deployment zone. Once there, I'm told to deploy 5 mines (the number I just picked up). All right... where are they? They're nowhere to be found. The vessel menu indicates that there's nothing deployable.  They're not in my personal inventory. They're nowhere. What a waste of time. Cancel the mission. Impossible. Can't cancel that stupid previous mission either, that sends me to spy on a station in a sector that identifies me as an enemy as soon as I exit the portal and starts shooting, and is surrounded by a swarm of enemy vessels that start shooting too. Boom... game over.  FInally, I don't recall playing a game that made me play as a male or a female depending on the set of missions I chose. That's utterly dumb. I just can't get used to being told 'Yes M'am' by a subordinate. I'm sure it's a great game. But it's like a vessel in the sky, with a ladder hanging for new passengers.

You can fight, you can fight a LOT, but this is primarily an economic simulator, and 90% of your first hundred hours is going to be spent doing odd jobs for various galactic powers and building factories. 

The economy is reasonably complex, with every good in circulation (except one in the DLC) being properly produced by stations, with nothing being magic'd into existence to keep things afloat. This is a double edged sword. On one hand, it creates opportunities for those keen enough to spot them. On the other hand, the AI is most assuredly NOT keen enough. Without player intervention it is very likely that most every faction in the galaxy except for the terrans will fall into an economic spiral and gradually lose the ability to make anything due to a combination of ship attrition and bad station decision making. The AI sees a critical hull parts shortage and decides to build one piddly manufacturing unit, when they need 20x that.

Regarding the DLC ware mentioned earlier, the way it's made and delivered is somewhat non-standard and impossible to automate on the player's part, but it requires no overhead and sells for a lot. The MASSIVE, GLARING PROBLEM with trading this ware is when you get to the point where you can trade it in large quantities, the game gives a trade station thousands upon thousands of units of it which sells to all the AI stations at rock-bottom prices that makes going out of your way to use it entirely pointless, since the AI would rather die than buy from you, even if you set up a blockade around the aforementioned AI station, the AI will just queue up forever and ignore you.

The combat aspects of the game can be fun if you know how it works. And where it doesn't work at all. Something very important you need to understand before committing to anything is that the AI is shockingly bad at maneuvering in space. It will overshoot simple movement orders by tens of kilometers, and god forbid you have it do any z-axis movement at all, it will just have a stroke and do something completely contrary to what you actually told it to do. The only way that the flight AI is even semi-competent is the S and M class fighter behaviors, which besides having a suicidal tendency for jousting does actually perform rather well. L and XL ships piloted by the AI are very expensive fireworks. They can't understand turret angles or engagement ranges, so will try to get in range to optimize THEIR DPS while entirely ignorant of the ENEMY DPS, so you frequently get destroyers grinding all over stations to get the extra 8 points of damage from their crappy laser turrets while suffering tens of thousands of damage in return fire from plasma, often times killing the ship and its crew before you even have a chance to pull them out. I highly advise avoiding L and XL ships until you get a good grounding in fighting against them with S/M class ships. Fighters are king in the X4 universe for everything except attacking stations, which is miserable no matter how you go about it.

This game is very flawed but if you work with it you can have a lot of fun and get a lot of satisfaction out of growing a galactic business/Paramilitary company/Government.",1681087656,1681087656,True,2,0,0.429870367050170898,0,True,False,False

Over the years of development, quality-of-life improvements make their way into the final build then I return to the game and put a significant amount of time into the game to only see some problems carry forward into the next build. The learning curve of this game is significant, but it made it easier to access one patch at a time. The stories in the game are pretty good, and you get a more profound introduction to the different races and their motivations. Each race has a distinctive look and feel, and the supply chain only differs slightly among the core races, with the exception of the Terran race, which is a simplified, streamlined building process. The Terrans are typically xenophobic but have trust issues based on events from previous games' storylines. Terrans are a good starter race as their space is isolated and protected from 90% of pirate incursion and Xenon aggression. The trade network is very profitable as every playthrough seems different, and you can spot production holes like hull parts or advanced electronics or weapon components. You can exploit the hole and become profitable pretty quickly.  I did have some problems with the Split when starting as Terran, as by the time I reached Split space, the Xenon had overrun most of their space, and their wharf and shipbuilding were being rebuilt a few times by then.

I am very excited about the new Boron expansion I tried not to get too far ahead in any storyline, but we will see if I starts over again for the .... I forgot, but you tend to start over many times as you learn better ways of doing things.

The game feels complete at this point, all the races are included (some as DLC), mechanics are better fleshed out, and the game is about as polished as you can expect from Egosoft. 6.0 brings real collision detection, which allows tighter wing formations, and an improved lighting engine, all as a free update. Players complained that carriers weren’t useful, and Egosoft listened and added new carrier commands to improve their utility. If you’ve waited to get into X4, now is the time. Please know that the nature of an Egosoft game hasn’t changed. Expect there to be obtuse mechanics which often elude reason, expect features that sound cool but don’t work, expect bugs everywhere. However, again, the game feels quite polished comparatively, but I don’t want anyone to misunderstand that the game can indeed frustrate you in stupid ways sometimes.

The rest of this review is focused on what X4 actually is (or attempts to be), from my perspective:

X4 is a simulation of a small galaxy filled with humans and aliens, where, with some exceptions, the economy is real, every ship has a purpose, and if you can see a ship then you can one day fly it. While X4 allows you to play it as an RTS, you are always in the game somewhere, a real person in the simulation. You can pilot any ship from fast scouts to devastating carriers and massive battleships, or you can hire pilots to fly them for you while you play admiral, or you could even get on an alien ship and allow it to shuttle you around the galaxy as it goes about its business (which is useful if you want to sneak aboard a hostile station). You start as a small fry and grow your own empire economically and militarily, eventually building your own wharfs and shipyards to field massive fleets. While there are multiple starts, usually you’ll begin in a small fighter with few credits to your name. You’ll feel a true sense of accomplishment when you buy your first trader or miner, when you get your first corvette then your first destroyer, when you build your first factory, board your first ship through piracy, etc. Then one day you’ll realize you have dozens of traders and need a system to manage them. Alas, the game grows with you and gives you the tools you need to manage your empire as you go from single ships to fleets. Ships can even be assigned to factories or even mega complexes to work for them. There are several plots which give the game not only story but modify the simulation by creating wars or peace amongst varying factions. There are pirates and an enemy common to all non-machine races in the galaxy: The Xenon. You’ll run into them as you explore the galaxy, mapping it out and laying satellites to keep track of ship traffic and trade prices. You will need to earn the trust of various factions, who keep track of your reputation within their territory. They may love you or hate you, and this is reflected in game. If they hate you too much, they will go after your traders instead of only focusing on your military. However, if they like you, they will give you discounts, sell you their stronger ships, and allow you to buy blueprints to recreate their economy for yourself. There is no winning condition… it’s a simulation after all, so you’ll usually end up playing until you meet your own personal goals. The game is highly moddable, and some would argue the game isn't complete unless it is modded. Of particular note is the Star Wars Interworlds mod, which transforms the X universe into the Star Wars universe, complete with Star Wars ships (and interiors) and sectors!

All in all, there is no other game like X4 that I have found; if you know of one, please let me know.",1680919668,1680919668,True,373,4,0.959235846996307373,12,True,False,False

To be honest I've never been a fan of the X series, they were always pretty complicated and the interfaces felt ancient and the mechanics were just way to complicated, but X4 has changed my mind about the series. Don't get me wrong, the interface is still not perfect and the mechanics are still complex, but they did enough changes that I feel I can actually understand and enjoy playing this series now. (finally too as I've always been intrigued about this series)

60 Hours in already and I feel I've barley scratched the surface of this game on my first campaign I'm going through. Granted, I came to the party massively late so I've had 4 years worth of improvements before I started this thus keep that in mind if you are thinking of taking the plunge now. There is a story (basically through the factions themselves), but it's mainly through the DLCs that really bulk up that story content I believe, and unlike other DLCs for other games which sometimes feel optional, these DLCs feel pretty necessary to really expand your game, so when you are buying this you will want the DLCs without question, which means if it's not on sale you are looking at a hefty 100 dollar price tag (main game and first 3 dlcs at least), not including the 4th DLC which is coming out in 5 days. If anything, maybe the publisher will do a sale when the 4th DLC comes out, so perhaps wait till then if you've been on the fence to get this one. 

The best way I can describe this game is take your space faring classics like Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer, etc... add a 4x economy with Fleet and Station/Empire/Economy Management and this is your game. As other reviews have said I really don't think there is anything on the market like this outside probably Star Citizen, but at this rate we'll probably see 5 more X series games before that game ever gets released, heh. 

Yes as mentioned earlier, this game is stupidly complex too, you will be using your 2nd monitor (if you got one) or your iphone (like me lol) to constantly look up stuff, or looking up Youtube videos to get the hang of the vastness this game has to offer. But once you begin to really understand the game it makes all that learning totally worth it. 

As for the controls and mechanics they offer keybindings that you can change most things and the fact that you can literally run your empire, stations, fleets (when you get to that point) from the Map screen as the trailer videos have shown is a fantastic feature. Do yourself a favor though, go in the game settings and make sure you check mark that option for your ship your controlling at the moment to continue moving when opening the map or else you will come to a complete stop every time you open your map (unless you're using autopilot), going into a complete can be rather annoying if the map is open, so it's a helpful check mark to activate for sure. Even in this game space is pretty big, so while you travel and take on missions it's helpful to look at the Map and order your other ships around or check on your stations if you need too while your ship continues to move to where it needs to go. 

Well, that's really all I have to say, so if you were on the fence of getting this like I was and at least have the patience to learn the complex mechanics of this game then you'll be in for a treat as it's well worth the purchase :)",1680842828,1680843418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is it! The game I've been waiting for. 6.0 addresses a lot of the past issues and so far having a blast. Highly recommend and big thanks to the developers to even make a 6.0 patch! amazing.
Carriers can now be ordered to defend a system with their fleet, this makes things way easier.
Also new (to me): AMD FSR can be enabled in the graphic settings, this also works on NVIDIA cards! This fixed all frame rate issues I had before.

Still too buggy in 4.0. I just started the second campaign as trader after giving up on the first campaign after hundreds of hours. To sum this up, you will not be playing the game too much but exclusively manage the terrible, terrible game interface as well as trying to avoid the PLENTIFUL, game-stopping bugs. The game idea is great, but man, the interface designer should be driven out of town and made to resettle on mars. Worst game interface of all times?? Every screen has at least one scroll bar, sometimes a scroll window within a scroll bar. Game interface works perfect for up to a hand full of ships. Have a fleet or empire? It's basically non-functional. Better luck in version 5.0?? Dear lord....

It has a bit of everything, not enough of anything

Honestly It is worth the price tag and the DLCs so far are decent and actually add something to the game, not just reskinned ships. I took ti wiith a grain of salt when I bought it and find it enjoyable for a few hours at a time. The missoins can be tedious and very repetetive. I like to run mods with my games, part of the reason I play on a PC, when modded you dont get to have onlnie initeractions I do not agree with this. Thiis has a good make up of being a decent low pop server(s) online game (maybe 50 players max per server unless they expand the galaxy to included uncontrolled areas that players can fght over or somethiing). I am looknig forward to the new DLC that is sapose to release here soon and will probabaly update this review after i give t a good play through. 
Vanilla is ok, DLC 1 s rough but fun DLC2 Defenitly my favorite has the best quest chain out of all of them and I am still working on DLC 3 so far Abandonded is my fav out of the two starts. The ships remind me of Reapers from Firefly would like to see sleek sexy designs but thats what mods are for right... just cant do anything online if ii use em... again hate that. 

this deffenitly isnt for everyone. I am a fanatic for space sims and this scratches an itch very well. But it does leave me yurning for more inmersion and some storyline FYI voice acting SUCKS but take as the comic relief and it feels better.",1680756931,1680756931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For context, I prefer games with long grinds and lots of fiddly micro management.  Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, Crusader Kings, etc.  These massive and expansive worlds are my go to for filling my leisure time.  That being said, the grind in X4 surpasses the grind in all those other games combined and multiplied by a factor of 2 or 3.  Currently I have 241 hours into my game and I am JUST NOW ENTERING THE MID GAME.

Pros: There is a lot of detail and the players have a great deal of control.  If you like building something from the ground up then you might enjoy the challenges of this game.  The fact that it takes so long to do anything makes the feeling of accomplishment when you do finish a project that much more satisfying.
There are a lot of ship variations with a great deal of customization.
You can build space stations customized exactly how you want them.
You build alliances and make enemies, trade, pirate, police, or steal your way to a position of power in the galaxy. 

Cons: The graphics are mediocre but the way they are rendered is awful.  All stations look the same from the inside, all ships have the same cockpit.  There are like two or three locations on every station you can visit but they all look identical.  The character images look like PS1 level graphics.  Space travel and combat all exists on a single plane.  You can manually fly off that plane, but without doing so specifically everything gets built on the same plane like 3D space isn't a thing.  The physics engine is basically non existent.  It is not really fun to go flying or to be in a space battle.
The AI is terrible.  Some of the basic functions work OK but if the computer has to ever think it will simply fail to come up with a good answer.  Capital ships behave the same as fighter craft, which renders them useless unless you personally are in command and forcing it to stay at artillery range.
It is very buggy, and when somethings goes really wrong and you have to reload, you will be waiting several minutes for it to load up.

After many years basic function and polish are still not here.
Core functions and staples of former games in the series are missing
Races are lost
Ship bland
balance non-existent

This was a serious blow and I am a little at a loss as to why so many positive reviews exist for the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review Update April 2023

Quick notes:
The races are mostly back, mostly for the price of DLC
The ships number has increased, not the blandness though
Balance is worse, a lot of rank disparity for start up

Still glaring issues:

The real time economy is still not quite right, factions run out of ships and supplies. There just isn't enough cargo moving to make it work.

Auto traders are really just manual traders with the word Auto attached. If I wanted the trading ship I bought to be run by me micromanagement fashion I would be flying it not my fighter. Yet setting my new Trader to a system where both hull plates were needed and sold yielded a warning that no trades were available. I tried putting up satellites over the wharf and the hull plate factory but in the end I was forced to just setup a bunch of manual trade instructions. Over the course of 6 hours of constantly supplying the Wharf with hull plates my trader never leveled up enough to select another option or start working on his own.

Missions are still wild, I started new play through and my options were either shoot at ships that could one shot me or maybe do some manual trading in a ship not suited for it.

I know I could mod the game and it would solve some of these issues, in fact I have but that completely removes the multiplayer features which I never did get to try. 

Finally, load times. I run on what some would consider a higher end machine, New i9 and 3080 ti with more than 64gb of ram. The game was installed to a 2tb NVMe SK Hynix. Hardware is not an issue. I still experienced load times that were higher than 5 minutes on a fresh and new save, loading my save took even longer.

This is typical of Egosoft to release a game like this in this state and one can only hope that they follow suit like they have with other titles. Certainly there are not major design problems here, so the bugs and problems that do exist can be patched out and function improved. 
As such, we have a modern great to play a true X game in, to build and manage and fight and explore! Things are looking up for the X universe!

UPDATE: It's now March 2023 and the game is in version 5, and 12 days away from releasing the Boron in the ""Kingdom's End"" expansion. There have been other expansions bringing in more and more. I've been playing this version for 240 hours and it has been a breeze. Better systems, better controls, better flow in the menus, more things to do, more factions, more missions... MORE! This is now a highly recommended game of the space sandbox genre!

You can just fight others, or be a pirate, or be a trader, or build space stations that build thing you need to fight, or build wharfs that make you more ships, or just build the stations that make you rich. Hire pilors and marines and managers and workers and maange them all, or skip all that and go exploring and becoming a mercanary. You can do whatever you want to do, even to taking over a sector and making your own rules about what is legal or not in your space!

If space sandbox is your thing, then this is the game for you!",1551297086,1680277798,True,2,1,0.498972982168197632,1,True,False,False

Starts off as a first person space flight/combat/trading/mining game, then as you accrue more money you can start designing/building stations to produce profitable materials and ultimately manufacture your own ships and equipment. After enough time you've got so much money it starts taking on RTS elements with the fleets you control either vying for ownership of sectors or assisting an AI faction against its opposition for fun or profit. 

On top of this you can run about both ships and stations (planetside travels not a thing) on foot. Or just throw on a space suit and float around outside. In its way there's a joy in watching your fleet conduct a battle while running about on your bridge, deciding to head to the hangar, grabbing a fighter and launching to participate.

Does come with some caveats, IMO the DLC are mostly not optional, the base game was that lacking. While there have been constant updates to the base game as expansions come about, many mods and features are locked to DLC. It's not the worst in the industry seeing as Egosoft averages about one $15 DLC every year typically with new ships, factions,  storylines, and map expansions. 

And while there is story with some fun set pieces, the gameplay is ultimately a true sandbox so your enjoyment ingame almost entirely comes from self-directed goals. The story missions largely are there to give you a little framework as you get settled in on a new run or flat out act as a tutorial. 

Also lastly it's singleplayer only, the only multiplayer aspect is you can send your ships on expeditions to other players games to populate them as NPC controlled ships.

No denying that the learning curve is steep, even for an X games player, but there are plenty of tutorials out there to help get you going, and once you have it, you'll begin to appreciate the intuitive details.There isn't much of a plot or story line - yet, but there is plenty to do. I'm currently playing the Public Beta and started with 3.0. So I can't say much for the negative reviews from the past other than; you will likely either love it, or hate it. More so the latter if you struggle to understand how to play.I do miss the Boron and hope they will be introduced soon, and I'm waiting on the completion of the split DLC, which I expect will add a lot more to this massive game. I don't run a powerful machine with a GTX 1050.

Post updated driver and it is rare, but reloading the game fixes it. I hope to upgrade my gpu in the future, but until then I will enjoy this game as is. Honestly, reviews are just personal experience and opinion, and everyone's will be different. Give it a fair try, watch the tutorials first to get your footing, and then jump in.

With over 250 hours of gameplay in just 3 months, I can confidently say that this game is a solid time sink with endless stories to make for yourself. It's fascinating to learn how to better exploit the galaxy and its resources, and the missions are always varied and exciting.

However, there are a couple of downsides to this otherwise excellent game. First, the large fleet battles can be a bit overwhelming, especially when you're in control of a dozen or more capital ships. Instead of calmly picking off enemies from a distance with your long-range weapons, you find yourself frantically maneuvering your ships into close-range combat, hoping for the best.

Secondly, building your own station can be a nightmare, especially as the complexity of the station increases. It's as if the game is mocking you for wanting to create something truly magnificent by making you wait for what feels like an eternity for it to be constructed.

But all in all, X4 Foundations is a deep and addictive space adventure that's perfect for anyone who loves exploring the vastness of the universe. Just be prepared to lose track of time, and don't be surprised if you find yourself frantically clicking away in a massive fleet battle or cursing at the construction time of your latest station.",1679408240,1679408240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I especially love complicated flight simulation such as DCS and games like this.   I've played X since its first version and I loved what they tried to do.  I've wanted them to succeed from day one.  After X3 I wrote the company off as their modus operandi became clear.  Years later I decided to see if they atoned for their mistakes and got it right.  I can definitely assure they've FAILED again.  I spent 100 hours in utter frustration and struggle to enjoy this. 

Their MO is to try to do too much in a patchwork fashion.  The problems are too numerous to mention.  The community is great and helpful and great in making mods to help with the shortcomings of the devs but it is far too little.  You'd need to load every mod imaginable to attempt to compensate for the bugs, and poorly written AI.  

My overall take on the game is  - its trying to do too much and adding things piece by piece instead of looking at the whole, such as the actual user experience.  It ignores basic polish and game elements that exist in every other game out there.  Extremely bad voice acting,  story telling, interactions, and even spelling.  

What has shocked me the most is that there are what 5 expansions? They still are selling games that have the same bugs and lack of polish I saw at release.  As far along as this game is into development, I can't believe how poorly polished and a buggy mess this game is.  I've come to the conclusion the dev ""just doesn't get it"" at all.  They put a great deal of effort into some really cool things but by ignoring the BASICS such as a logical UI. 

Even with HOTAS fully programmed doing anything in this game is a hot mess.  

Poorly written and ungodly bad AI that requires constant micromanagement.

I spent dozens of hours learning the intricacies of this game in running stations, ships, fleets only to run into bug after bug.  I don't think I've ever reloaded a game more times in a life from savegames that take minutes to load.  The cons outweigh the pros.

If you're burned by the relatively shallow and inconsequential feel of a game like Elite: Dangerous where a lot of spectacle happens, but it ultimately is just smoke and mirrors to represent a low-level background simulation on a server somewhere, then this game will have you covered. The knowledge that every ship, station, outpost, satellite, and turret belongs to someone and serves a purpose is unbelievably cool in an era of false light shows, and it's super cool to watch factions building new equipment and economies shift around sometimes in part to your own actions. Ship handling is noticeably more arcade-like than Elite or Star Citizen, but not as much as something like No Man's Sky, so you're still engaged with the flight aspect when travelling around and have full 6DOF freedom, including toggle-able flight assists and such. (noted that I made the potentially stupid decision to entirely spend my initial hours in the 6.00 beta branch which sports a new physics rework supposedly, so take that how you will - but it's worth noting that it looks absolutely fantastic both in screenshots and in motion with it too!)

Ship scale is incredible. While you can't walk every hallway and deck of your ship like you can in Star Citizen, you at least have a little bit of immersion walking into transporters and heading to your cockpit - an improvement over something like Elite. There are four ship classes, all of them flyable - small, medium, large, and XL, and a medium frigate is big enough to have a landing pad that can hold not a tiny fighter bay like Elite, but an entire small ship. It really is a shame that this game is singleplayer only as getting in the cockpit of your first larger ship with multiple crew seats and built-in ship storage really makes you want to bring your friends aboard for the experience.

But the real meat more than anything seems to be the ability to build up an entire empire of your own. You hire pilots and crew to man your ships, training them and ordering them around on the map, and you can construct and manage your own stations and large-scale fleets. Everything requires real, in-game resources to be collected, manufactured, and delivered, so in addition to your standard credit cost of ships and modules, the materials must be present to produce them as well - this very early on shows the player how important having your own fleet is when you get held up waiting for ship upgrades so you can help expedite the economy a little. There are several factions even in the base game, and you can do missions for each and gain reputation to unlock better ships, modules, blueprints, and other benefits. And of course there's the token 'eat everything' enemy faction in the form of the Xenon, taking a similar albeit much more prominent and destructive role from something like Elite's Thargoids.

In essence, having played a wide variety of other games, I'd most closely relate this to a combination of Mount & Blade's empire building and Elite Dangerous's style, albeit lacking the incredible UI work done by the latter - as others have noted, the user interface is a mess and you will find yourself looking up how to do what you'd imagine are basic functions. Do NOT skip the tutorial as it is a vital part of figuring it out. I've also noticed a few pathfinding bugs that take a while for the AI to figure out, whether that be from your current ship's autopilot, your pilots trying to go through a solid wall to dock, or NPC ships getting stuck at a jump gate - though they have thus far all figured it out eventually, so be prepared to be patient.

It does however have very good sound design and an incredible soundtrack that's somewhat similar in style to Stellaris.

Admittedly, 12.5 hours in this is nothing. I can see that from where I am in the game now - every playthrough is going to be RPG-length, easily. But my god, if you've been on the fence about this and you come with experience from other space games wanting some real depth for a change, do not hesitate.

The flight is modeled in a way that is totally underwhelming, with no real sense of velocity or thrust.

The weapons are incredibly unsatisfying to use, full stop. The on foot experience is limited and unenjoyable -- no combat, just flying around in zero G or in areas with basically nothing to do like a bridge where you can move 3 feet in any direction.

2021 reviews, 
Years later and 5 star pilots can't fly them selves out of a paper bag. 
Still flying into sh iat 

19-Mar, 
Base building controls are screwed up, there appear to be workarounds within the community but it's definitely not efficient. The current issue is flip vs rotation and was not an issue prior to 5.0. So, betting something bigger is going on and immersion will surely take a hit. 

18-Mar,
If you are particular about your controls be sure to come with a truck load of patience. The control mapping sucks on several different levels. It's like they started with a bad plan, but instead of kicking the previous geek out they let him/her/it slap a bunch of band-aides on the previous dumb ideas. Careful with the camera settings you can literally control yourself into not being able to see the settings menu in both analog and the VR equal. 

15-Mar
My hopes for better optimization are dropping fast, I am hovering just below 80, which is hot for my setup due to the controlled (AC) room temp my PC resides in. This 80c is generated from 98% of my time so far... spent in the menu/settings 

816 hours later, 07/17/2021
Several restarts and a serious effort at trying to make it work... but it's still a PoS. Coding is a joke and the entire game goes tits up as soon as you hit mid to early late game. Pilot skills, so called stars are worthless, they will remain stupid throughout the game. 

Damn, really want this game and EGO to work as there is a ton of replay-ability here but they continue to ignore fixing the basic mechanics of the game.  

____________
nearly a year ago,
I love the idea and where this game is going but EGO needs to stop expanding and work on the fundamentals. 

Pilots are still stupid, flying to general gate locations (gates with my sats), often over shoot then slowly fly to the gates in their routes. While the enemy flies right at and through them as they should. Often times my pilots will not use the highways instead putting along right next to them. Both friend and foe get stuck in station sections. 

Instead of flying and crashing into stuff they now fly at stuff till they almost crash then stop and micro adjust with directional thrusters rather than adjusting course during flight.  

5 star traders buy 30 when the deal-qty and cargo space allows for hundreds. 
The new resource probes are not consistent.

There is no game I've played that gives you the kind of sandbox complexity as the X series does, with the logistical depth to create your entire game however you see fit, going from a tiny starter ship to massive fleets where your production lines and supply ships move every single ware around the universe to support you.

Despite how immersive and amazing it can be, you only get to the fun parts by blocking out the sensible parts of your brain that try to make sense of the UI, or that feel annoyed by having to go search out Youtube tutorials to understand what logic options do that are buried two pages deep in a random menu, but are crucial for getting things to operate as intended.

Nothing is really intuitive, and you have to learn the game like a second language to get it all to operate somewhat predictably. But once it clicks, there's really nothing like it.",1576700983,1678672426,True,14,3,0.568282663822174072,0,True,False,False

I loved X3 when I played it around 2008. It was a nearly perfect space sim in its time, so it's just super disappointing to come to X4 and its just a buggy mess.

a true sandbox game, x4 will not tell you what to do or where to go, so you might find yourself taking advantage of the tutorials in game to learn the controls around flying, and then you might find yourself going to youtube and watching tutorials for how to get passive income coming in, whether through automining, autotrading, or building a station. you can even build ship-producing stations, which cost a lot of money but net you more passive income.

it's not uncommon to have massive projects which will take days or sometimes even weeks to complete from a logistics standpoint, and the economy responds very quickly to the market. ship parts will go up in cost in a sector if a large war is happening, because there is more demand for them.

Tl;dr: This is an *insanely* complex and deep empire building sandbox set in space, with a fully simulated economy, factions and diplomacy. When it works well it can be amazing, but it is *hugely* held back by an almost vertical learning curve, the impenetrably difficult interface for controlling your fleet, and some very iffy AI.

What actually is X4 Foundations? Is it a space sim? Well, yes, kind of... It does start you off in much the same way as Elite Dangerous - as a pilot in a rubbish ship with 10k to your name and a whole galaxy to explore. The tutorials do a decent job in guiding you through the basics of flying your ship and navigating around the various sectors. They also cover running missions, combat, trading and mining, which are the main activities you'll be engaged in while playing X4. There is also a kind of in-game tutorial/mission you'll find early on which introduces you to the other big selling point of the game - the ability to design and build your own space stations. While you start out small, once you earn enough money you can eventually fly around in huge capital ships, onto which little fighters like the one you start with can actually dock.

What does it look and sound like? The space and ship bits look pretty decent - stations feel appropriately huge, and big pitched space battles look epic. The bits where you get out and interact with other people on stations and in ships are very ropey looking. The graphics in these sections look like a decade old game. Sound is good. Music is tense during combat and majestic and sweeping during exploration. Sound effects for weapons and explosions seem suitably beefy, and there's a nice claustrophobic effect of hearing your breathing you get while in a spacesuit, as your oxygen slowly depletes...

What does it feel like to play? Not really like Elite Dangerous, or No Man's Sky, or any other space game I've played. There are a few reasons for this. This is how space in X4 is split up and organised: each sector is a large-ish region of space which contains various stations with which you can interact and, often, asteroids and gas fields which you can mine. Planets are shown but are backdrop items only. Apparently you can terraform them in the late game - but you can't ever fly down and land on them, explore them on foot or anything like that. You *can* walk around your ships, and you can walk around on the many stations in the game. But... I don't really get why you'd want to do this much. The main area of your ship you can walk around is the bridge and the stations are big but pretty empty. You'll mainly use transporter rooms to get quickly from A to B. You can also get out of your ship and spacewalk, which is neat, and you need to do this to complete certain quests, particularly data vaults, or to repair your ship. In between sectors are jump gates or accelerators: these whisk you quickly from one sector to the next. There isn't really much in the way of loading times - transfer between sectors is more or less instantaneous, which surprised me in a good way.

At the start of the game you will not know where anything is and in the future they don't sell maps, so at some point you have to go out and explore. Exploring will reveal stations and other things like lockboxes and data vaults, which are effectively loot chests. You can scan a sector which will show up locations of objects or stations but to find out what type of thing it is, you have to fly up to it. You can drop satellites and resource probes too, and you'll want to do this liberally because to keep track of what resources are available in a sector and what prices stations are paying, you need to either have a ship or a satellite in range.

The really good bit about X4 is that it's a space sandbox, it simulates the factions, diplomatic relations, and economy of the various sectors you fly around. You can just sit there not doing anything and things will happen around you. Miners will go out and mine ore, then fly to an ore refinery to sell it. Traders will buy and sell goods and prices will rise and fall in response to demand. Fighting around a jump gate in one sector might mean that trade ships can't get through to deliver goods to a factory further into the sector, so that factory might not be able to produce whatever it is it produces and this can have knock on implications further up the chain. It's quite something to see this in action and it really does feel like you're part of a living, breathing game world which doesn't revolve around you. 

As well as the main factions there are pirate factions, but mostly you can get on the good side of all of them if you do missions for them, destroy their enemies, or trade with them. Doing this eventually gives you access to better ships and equipment. There are however two factions in the base game which you can never trade with and which are always hostile: the Xenon, a sentient AI race, and the Kha'ak, an insectoid race. Both of these will send out raiding parties and sometimes launch full fledged invasions of sectors, and it's often breathtaking to watch or participate in pitched battles between huge fleets.

Once you get the hang of the game you will want to start expanding your fleet. I started off buying a few miners and getting them set away mining ore or silicon is pretty straightforward. While you can mine yourself, you can't be everywhere at once, so eventually you'll need to recruit pilots to manage these jobs for you. This will get you a steady income, though it won't be particularly amazing. For the big bucks you'll need to buy some traders and identify some good trade routes (this is where all those satellites you put down while exploring will come in handy). 

This was, for me, where the limitations of the interface - and the pilot AI - became glaringly apparent. Suffice to say there is a horrendous amount of right and left clicking through menus, filters and sub-menus to be able to see what there is to trade, and then assign a trader to a route. It is very fiddly and difficult to get the hang of this, rather like playing a spreadsheet. One issue is that the advanced autotrade command is locked until your pilots are 3-stars or more, and this takes either a *lot* of cash to hire a suitable pilot, or a long time running trades to grind the experience. You will also find that your traders start attracting the attention of pirates, so you will likely need to buy some fighters to escort your traders. There are several ways to do this but some of the commands seem to leave the escorts inexplicably far from the trade ship they're supposed to be protecting. It seems needlessly complex just to have one ship guard another. And when they do get attacked, if you're not around to help it is difficult to predict the outcome. 

Another place where the pilot AI seems weak is navigating through asteroid fields. I often have the AI pilot navigate my ship while I'm scoping out a new trade route or dealing with a miner who's misbehaving. But it's painful watching them pick their way through an asteroid field, slowing down for every rock, and giving it a wide berth. If you need an AI ship to get anywhere in a hurry you'd better hope they don't have to fly through an asteroid field!

I've played this game 25 hours and I can tell I've barely scratched the surface. There's a lot more you can learn by watching YouTube tutorials than what you get taught in the game itself. To be honest, I'd say you need to invest a good chunk of time doing this to get anything from this game. There is a helpful community on Reddit too if you get stuck. Overall, I enjoy the game, but then I'm a sucker for ambitious space sims, and I can quite easily imagine someone being put off by the brutal learning curve and fussy interface.",1678228874,1678228874,True,114,1,0.899164438247680664,0,True,False,False

This review is really for my friends who have seen this game. And might be interested or curious about what its like.
To be frank there are plenty of people who have left reviews and all of them are well written.
I'll will not go over in exact detail as to not try to bore anyone reading this.
This game is like Star Citizen meets an RTS game. While this game has some of the features of Star Citizen its not exactly like Star Citizen. You have mediocre ship internals, there is not ground combat of any kind nor can you visit any of the planets. You can only visit space ports and other parts of galaxy thats it. If you play the Star Wars: Interworlds Mod. These effects linger even more so. Because planets like Coruscant exist and are apart of the mod. You can control your own imperial star destroyer if you want too. This is game is more space combat focused, with extreme amounts of RTS empire building and growing. With tons of complex moving parts and systems in place. I myself do not fully know each system.
All in all this game is very fun, and generally stable for the most part. The only bugs that i encounter are docking or building ships and having them all dock onto my vessel all at once. Sometimes they clip through the station and its hard to get them out. No game breaking bugs to be honest. There really is no story line even for modded play throughs. Its up to the user to decide their fate in the galaxy. Tons of RP potential!

After building a massive empire and the ability to manufacture all the capital ships I could want, I was hoping see some really impressive fleet battles. Unfortunately the AI is so bad that half your ships will often sit around doing nothing in the middle of battle, and some will fly directly into enemy stations or capital ships for no reason. After giving up on the idea of the AI actually conducting a battle, I tried micromanaging ship actions, which ends up being about the same.

A very fun sandbox that makes a few concessions for it to run at all, specifically in regard to AI efficiency in combat and depth of the main gameplay pillars/loops. In return there are several thousand ships and hundreds of stations being simulated at all times in a universe of a few dozen systems to do with as you please. Befriend them, help them, pirate their assets, cripple them by destroying their miners and economy. 
Although at its core the gameplay is emergent and dependent on player actions, there are story lines or ""plots"", which are scripted missions that give the player some goals to achieve. Due to said sandbox nature of the game, some of them can be quite funny, where the player can complete the mission just with the starting fighter sized craft, but instead you can roll up with a fleet of destroyers screened by multiple fighter squadrons.
There truly is not game of this type on the market (singleplayer specifically). The closest competitors could be (but its a massive stretch) space sims like Elite: Dangerous or the venerable Freespace, and in such comparison X games fall short. In here the combat is fine, but again since its a sandbox there won't be big BoE battle scenarios you had in Volition's games and the amount of things you can do with a single ship is not nearly as deep as what Elite offers. However, what neither of these have, is to allow you to fly in your space suit, board a fighter, sit in the fighters chair, shoot enemy fighters fly to a frigate, dock with the frigate, get out of your chair, walk all the way to the elevator next to the fighter dock, ride to the bridge, take control of the frigate, shoot some more NPCs, then dock the frigate with a carrier and then control that carrier by yourself and maybe dock with a station or go ram the AI, while at the same time you control several fleets of other carriers, destroyers, corvettes and fighters and manage multiple stations across a galaxy.

Forget immersion or a self maintained empire of spaceships and stations.

200 hrs in and start to get managers and stations under control?
Your miners are under constant assault!
Doesn't matter if you get the miner the size of a destroyer or babies.
They'll eventually die. incapable of defending them selves.

So you either need personal escorts for every individual or perform 120 individual commands to scouts to sweep the sector until one dies to a hidden installation.

THEN kill it with some destroyers... and then repeat in 2 more sectors because why mine ore in the same place forever? Cross half the universe for this shit in other places!

Your not making specialised fleets and and stations for the tactical/organisational benefits.
Your making it so one ship does one thing or god help you they'll spin around in place jenga tower and crash your game!

You want a miner to take his excess ore and sell it somewhere in high demand 1 sector over?
Eat dirt and die! He rather park and die then go one sector over. You need a station. and another miner ship assigned as a trader for the ore to go through one gate without you telling a MFer to get out of the captain seat and doing it your self!

If you want to sink hours of time into trying to find the ONE way to get a functional empire to work, so you can do more then stare at a map in disbelief of these god testing levels of dumb. You got your game right here!

For every level of potential espionage and sabotage pirating and straight up business and war tactics.

I am barely scratching the surface of my first play through at the time of this review but I am having a blast. I have a few stations up, loads of miners, and have my own little empire going. The AI and aggressive nature of the enemy faction known as the Xenon is great. I have spent hours repelling and building defenses around the jump gates into Argon, my allies, space to repel the swarms of battleships and fighters sent through. The enemy even back door-ed our defenses with a Superbattleship called an Xenon I. The thing took me hours upon hours of testing its defenses to figure out what would work best. I ended up baiting it in close to an ally station and with the stations help and my fleet of 30 fighters, 2 gunships, and my own personal destroyer was able to slowly kill it.

One of the biggest pros of X4 Foundations is its deep and complex game play mechanics. The game features an extensive economy system, where you can trade goods, build factories, and manage your own businesses. Additionally, you can hire and manage your own crew, build your own ships, and explore a vast and detailed universe.

The graphics and sound design in X4 Foundations are also impressive, with beautiful space vistas and immersive sound effects that enhance the overall experience. The game also features a dynamic and responsive AI system, which provides challenging and engaging game  play.

However, X4 Foundations is not without its cons. The game has a steep learning curve, with complex systems and mechanics that can be overwhelming. The user interface is also cluttered and can be difficult to navigate, which can be frustrating for you trying to manage your empire effectively.

Another issue with the game is its lack of direction or clear objectives. While some may enjoy the open-ended nature of the game, others may find it frustrating to not have clear goals or a sense of purpose in your game play.

Overall, X4 Foundations is a deep and engaging space simulation game with impressive graphics and sound design.

Factions can actually fail to replenish their fleets due to a broken supply chain, that's actually pretty darn cool. Just be aware that the bad guys don't care about the size of your fortune, and their expansion is likely to go unchecked if it's not invested into combating them. More on that in the latter half.

It can be debated whether the economy system is balanced or even works very well. By that I mean that I feel like a faction should be a bit more concerned if its shipyards are incapable of production due to a lack of material, when their combat fleet was vaporised a while ago. The factions seem mostly headless, and could do with some self-preservation mechanics, like a crisis event where they buy materials for more and set up missions to supply ships, manpower or material.

That said, the fact that supply and demand is simulated to this degree is amazing in and of itself. A supply and demand chain based on actual physical wares being transported by actual physical ships is just very cool, and I've never seen it achieved to this level in a game of this type before.

- - -

When it comes to combat though (the other half of the game for my preferred game-play loop):

- My best ship needs me to be in system and control it to output a fraction of its massive damage potential, due to the piloting AI being garbage.

- Contrary, the fleet escort keeping my best ship alive functions at its best when I'm out of system, because the simulation is simplified and more efficient.

* In conclusion, my Schrodinger's fleet is both capable and incapable of of attacking and destroying a target based mostly on chance and who has the biggest stick.

Solution? Grind to achieve the means to introduce overwhelming and expendable ship spam to guarantee a win and overcome the shortcomings of the game, but lose the satisfaction and challenge of winning a strategic fleet victory and subsequently make the late game combat portion/fleet combat portion of the game moot.

Fleet combat in this game has enormous potential, and looks beautiful when it works, but if the most common consensus is that the best way to command your AI combat vessels is out of system in the map screen with a sub-par command suite, why bother? Go play an RTS game instead..

Seeing an intervention fleet beat a Xenon incursion that is screwing you over, only to insist on dying to a Xenon station in the adjacent system without allowing shields to replenish or resupplying fighters or ammunition is an emotional roller-coaster.

The X games are one of a kind and the learning curve and tolerance required to really get into them is often huge for most people. Yet investing the time comes of very rewarding in my opinion. The only black sheep in the family is X: Rebirth. 
X4 had a slow start but is at a point where the whole product just makes sense. 
For me it took like literally multiple attempts at the games until it eventually clicked, a process that took me month and month (of course not learning, but playing a while, then taking some weeks break, touching it again.. and so on).

That was just the general background for my and my opinion. 

Specific to the game:
Music is usually good, I like most of the music playing in the game. 
Visuals are mostly fine, if you ignore the abysmal NPCs running around.
Gameplay starts of on quite a miniscule scope by scrounging together credits in your initial ship and broadings the longer the savefile goes on. Eventually you will buy additional ships to let them mine/trade for you, eventually you will start building stations to earn money or produce necessary goods. 

Eventually you start boarding and taking over enemy ships, you start securing entire sectors, your fleet grows larger and larger. Then you might jump into new savegames, experience the game out of a different perspective on how to approach the game. You might start to like the game enough to like spending the time into it, without looking for the always shortest and best solution. Impose rules on your savefile. 

Rarely does any game actually get me to the point to want to spend a lot of time in there. 

The biggest issue is, the game is not exactly self explanatory and just feels offputting, if you are new to the X series. A hurdle that can probably never be solved without dumbing down the game, which in return will make a worse product.

I should have claimed a refund. It was obvious from within the first two hours the game was broken. When the tutorials are bugged you know you're into a real bad game. But I just assumed it couldn't be that bad and carried on playing- thus fishing forty quid down the toilet.

Within four hours I'd clipped into an asteroid, clipped into two different space stations, constantly needed to check wikis for the most simple gameplay elements (""How do I find missions?"") and couldn't actually do anything. I got given a mission where I needed a spare ship but couldn't afford one let alone find one, another mission where I needed a bigger ship (same problem) and a third I could actually do which involved nicking a ship and leaving it somewhere for a client to pick up. The drop site was many kilometres from my ship, requiring a space walk of over half an hour to get back, staring at the screen as I slowly inch forward and get lost in the superstructure of the asteroid station.

That's when I gave up. There could be a great game in here somewhere, I was looking forward to building my own fleet and facilities and was prepared to sink hours into the game to get there.

But this is just miserable. This is the pits. Even when the game works on the most basic technical level I can't see the satisfaction. Gamefeel is non existent. Dog fights feel like old 90s rail shooters more than space combat. Ground navigation is awful and redundant.

A boring, barely functional wiki game with appalling build quality and shoddy game design. If you want space combat and trading go with Elite. If you want creativity go with No Man's Sky.

What it DOES do: I would describe this game as something in between 1st PoV RTS and sandbox trade empire simulator. I say in between because it doesn't give you a clear goal to build forces and defeat your enemies like an RTS would, but it doesn't really simulate an economy like a more trade focused game would either—what you have is basically a production chain. Nearly everything you produce and trade ultimately goes to building units/structures which fight and die. In fact if you arrange it so that the fighting and dying stops (which you can) there's almost no economy left. It becomes just like an RTS if you win the match, hit 'continue' and just chill out on the map with your allies.

So basically if you want to be part of an endless war, or the CEO of a trade company supplying the endless war, that's basically what this game will give you. You can also mix the two and be something of a PMC which is supplying and fighting for a preferred side(s). It lets you design and build stations, build and outfit (but not design) ships, and send them to do your trading, mining, fighting, et cetera.

You can also, technically, perform a lot of things yourself. You can be a miner. A fighter pilot. A destroyer... pilot (you might think 'captain' but destroyers behave like big, sluggish fighters, so I'll call it a pilot). You can trade. You can salvage wrecks. You can explore.

However, this is where the warnings come in: it doesn't do a good job of any of those things.

Mining, trading, salvaging, etc. might hold your attention briefly, but it feels very much like controlling a single unit in an RTS—really, really shallow. These tasks aren't designed to be especially engaging or rewarding, they're designed for a fleet of AI controlled ships to carry out on your behalf. You're never going to make an exciting finds when you go salvaging or mining, they're basically hauling jobs. There *are* things you can loot while doing them, but even the most valuable of them are something you see pretty often, need many of, and can and probably will automate the collection of. Automation is actually one of the game's strong points, which is a mercy when you discover how boring it gets to do things yourself after the novelty wears off.

Mining, specifically, has a small number of solids and a small number of gasses to collect. Some are rarer than others but not in a jaw dropping 'wow this is going to be a great haul' way—the biggest mining ship full of the most valuable ore you can find is nothing to get excited about. There are also some crystals you can shoot off asteroids, but these were nerfed so that if you ever harvest a rare good one it turns all the others in the area into bad ones. There's also some loot you get in the process of blowing up asteroids, which can be sold or have some utility purposes, but again it's not really a big deal.

Salvaging got an even more raw deal. You pick up wrecks and haul them to a station where they are I guess heavily irradiated or something because it requires a lot of power, and this turns them back into wares that can be used to build things. When a wreck is too big to carry back (and you got the Tides of Avarice expac) you can have a nice ship saw it into more manageable pieces, then you haul it to the station to be irradiated. That's it, that's the whole task. As someone who normally likes to play scavenger roles in games, I can't bear to do it in this one, it's just too depressing.

Trading suffers from the same issue, in that you're never going to get any really amazing deals or anything. Remember, this is balanced around having a whole bunch of ships doing it for you. Doing it yourself is not only unrewarding, it's actually kind of gimping your trade ship because when the AI trade, they will make reservations to buy or sell a ware at their destination, and thus cannot arrive to find what they wanted was bought or the place they intended to sell got what it needs already. You as the player cannot make reservations, so it's better to just sit in the bridge of your trade ship and queue orders for the AI pilot.

Exploration is mostly finding boxes of boring loot, and videos of lore.

So... combat. Other than managing the ships that complete boring tasks for you, this is your one role as the player that may actually be somewhat interesting. The problem here is that you are simply too good. Whoever you happen to be, reader, you are easily the best pilot in the X4 galaxy. Combat can be fun, relative to everything else, but it's honestly not challenging. The AI are bad at everything they do, and there are things the ships are capable of in player hands that they don't even try. It's nice if you like slaughter, but don't think you're going to end up in some kind of epic dogfight with near-peer adversaries. The best they can hope to do is swarm you or outclass your ship, and they have to do either of those pretty intensely for it to work.

As a subset of combat I will address space piracy. This is up there with salvaging as my favourite game thing... in theory. The good thing here is that this game lets you capture enemy ships. Small and Medium ships work by pestering them until all the crew leave, at which point the ship loses some weapons and shields (this is important, we'll come back to it) while L and XL ships do also have their crew bailing but it takes a long time and the captain will always remain on board, so you need to send marines (or at least one marine) to actually take the ship. It's probably the most engaging interaction you'll actually have in the game, but it's still not exactly amazing. As a consequence of this more engaging design, it's also something the AI are very bad at and will only perform when you personally tell them to. There is another faction that boards ships (I think? It's very rare to see) but only abandoned ships.

Anyway, you can take ships. Then you can refit them and add crew and use them against your enemies. But here there are some hitches. Unlike in older X games, weapons, shields, etc. no longer drop as loot. Instead you use some of the wares from the production chain and convert them into these things in a dock. In order to do that, the dock owner needs the blueprints. Blueprints can be bought from friendly factions, and some (but not all) station module blueprints can be stolen, but those are the only kind that can be.

A few problems emerge out of this. Firstly, while you may be a pirate, you're beholden to at least one faction to refit your ships and (if you want to refit your own ships) sell you blueprints. So you're not, like, a very independent pirate. You can't amass gear as loot or by stripping it off ships, so when you capture one and it has no shields and one of four weapon slots filled (remember how they fell off when you took it?) all you can really do is lamely go dock at a friendly faction's station and buy new gear. This means that while you might steal another faction's ships, you cannot really get at their equipment in the same way. And unlike older X games, you can't reverse engineer captured ships, either. When you see how badly the AI fly them and how prone they are to dying stupidly, that makes the prospect of using only the ones you directly capture pretty tedious.

That leaves piracy feeling very incomplete to me. I am essentially more like a privateer for the faction I buy gear from than a real pirate. And to top that off, the piracy of cargo, while possible, is just as unimpressive as trading it because the cargo itself is just never worth a lot—even when it's 100% profit.

So in closing, while I recommend this game... I really only recommend it to people who want to lead a minor faction and partake in the endless war they could win but choose not to.",1543600518,1677493427,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This while sparse in spot (compared to X3s number of ships and such) is getting better and better. I am looking forward to adding the Split soon. Keep it coming. Anyone familiar with Egosoft and the X series will know this thing will probably keep being worked at for the next couple years. But 'as is' still recommended for X fans others be cautioned 'X' has a pretty steep learning curve and little information to get you going for new players(they have all had this issue as far as I know) Hint for new players do not give it up as 'boring' without first figuring out how to play and give the universe some time to 'age'.

EDIT 2/25/23 - Well now we have the Split, Terrans, and a couple of new interesting pirate factions, and finally the Boron are incoming.. It has shaped up very nicely as I predicted. It's not hard to predict Egosoft either the same people have been working on the series for decades and they are awesome. I think it is finally time for me to retire X3 as hard as that is imagine.
One note to new comers - The system specs to run the game well are pretty darn high. Your PC will be simulating a fully functional universe full of stuff happening in the background while letting you play in it at crazy scales. From a lone pilot on foot on a station to leading hundreds of ships into battle at the helm of a carrier.

I've waited to write this review until I encounter something truly unique that I've never seen happen in another game. A quick prelude for folks unfamiliar with this game; X4 has several factions that spawn in set locations throughout the map at the start of a new game, the map is cut into sectors that each faction, including the player, can take control of at any time. Each sector has it's own economy based on the resources available and which faction is in charge. You can build and trade in any sector that isn't controlled by a hostile faction without issue. These sectors are connected by Jump Gates and Mass Accelerators.

I’ve been playing a tycoon focused playthrough at the moment with mining and trade ships scattered all over the galaxy making me up to tens of millions an hour when everything’s running smoothly. I'd just started expanding my empire with stations when I noticed next to the Jump Gate highway a Xenon defense platform appeared, an enemy faction I've been avoiding until I got more experience under my belt, with a Xenon K destroyer next to it causing quite a mess and disrupting one of my trade routes. “This is a slight that can’t stand” I thought, and a ship building montage with a hundred million spent later, I had 7 Odysseus destroys at my command to put an end to this Xenon incursion.

Against my Odysseus' the Xenon K and their defense platform proved no match and were swiftly defeated. Unfortunately, the Xenon were not standing idly by, they sent in another 2 or 3 K destroyers and a large fleet of fighters and corvettes into sector that took me by surprise. Suffering some loses I achieved victory once again. It was time to go all in! What I lacked in skill could be over come with money!

Another ship building montage and hundreds of millions spent later I had 15 Odysseus' on the warpath in Xenon space slowly destroying every Xenon Station and K destroyer in their path. An hour or so later my scout ship revealed two remaining Xenon Stations left at the far side of the sector next to a Jump Gate. Down to 13 Odysseus destroyers the campaign was going too well, so I decided to take the sector and call it a night. Little did I know disaster was lurking around the corner.

I called off the ship I was piloting and one other for repairs and sent the remaining 11 Odysseus' to begin their assault on the remaining stations. On my way back a K destroy (or possibly an I, basically scarier than a K, I don't remember) flew into sector through the Jump Gate from above my attacking forces with its main battery in range. They were sitting ducks! I hastily ordered their retreat, but it was in vein, another K destroy arrived from behind them turning their retreat into a route. I got in range of the flanking K to buy them some time but to little affect. Disorganized and cut off from the Gate we came from we were in no shape to take on two K destroyers at once, so I ordered what remained of the fleet to a Jump Gate I'd never explored, but anywhere was better than here.

Counting my loses with only 5 Odysseus destroyers remaining, my allies' ship yards pushed to their limits, and roughly five hundred million spent throughout the endeavor, it was time expand my factories and rebuild my fleet. To be continued...

That naturally happened, no scripted events, no story line, just ""hey! self replicating murderous robots, you don't belong here. GIT!"" That turned into an epic crusade that ended in epic defeat.

This game is a massive space sandbox I never thought I wanted. I've played grand strategy games in the past and they've never really hooked me quite like this game has, and maybe it's because X4 isn't just another grand strategy game even though that's how I've mostly been playing it so far. But because of it being massive and complex there is a huge learning curve and the tutorials don't do a great job guiding you through the games systems expect for pilot school, it’s hard to recommend.

My playtime is testament to how good the X series is. they dropped the ball with Reunion but quickly recovered with this latest rendition. It's been a long road and the pathing for AI spaceflight is still ludicrously bad after all this time but the one redeeming feature that Egosoft did was open it up to the work-shoppers to fix and fine tune the other flaws.

Having said that, I don't actually run many mods, most are aesthetics and war/fleet behaviour improvements. My one disappointment is how easy they made it to initially make money, previous X titles were no where near this easy and finally breaking into the factory building was a major achievement and as a result a LOT of the probably well thought out ideas such as hacking or other nefarious antics I have never needed to bother touching.

Looking back on X4's predecessors there is a recurring failing with the X series and that is the Flight AI. X3 i loved to bits but the small class ships were pointless as they would crash and burn into scenery within a few jumps, X4 as I have already mentioned is also appalling but ships aren't destroyed purely due to dev crash damage removal rather than fix the original flaw. Bit scary since we are now multiple DLC releases down the road. EA started an unwanted business practice that is being adopted by too many software houses nowadays.

I was hoping for an X5 but looks like we will get a X4 HD reload instead which must be proving worthwhile from the recent flood of enhanced older titles now hitting the market. I do hope that X4 is opened up to the VR experience that Reunion received, soon after the HD update is complete though.

So in a nutshell. Hell yes, buy it, they listed a genre as 'X4' for a reason and the X titles ARE that reason. Just be prepared to sift through the workshop ;)

X4 Foundations and its DLCs make a great package for anyone wishing for a space sim that doesn't hold your hands.

The game offers you so many options to play and you can create your own narrative or rules as for how you play (For example limit yourself to the technology of 1 specific faction or only fly ships you have captured instead of just buying them).

The game runs...fine. Performance will get worse the longer you play as the universe is growing (not in size but objects being calculated by your CPU). Every object is simulated even if you are not in system so that obviously is very taxing. Still, it looks great with good materials and textures and the upcoming live stream camera mode will make for some excellent screenshots.

Is there something I don't like? Sure there is! Personally I'd like the universe to be larger in scope and less populated. It feels a bit crowded - which of course makes gameplay more fun for most. I like exploring and just the feeling of being all alone in space... but there are mods for that :)

however after x: rebirth I was very hesitant to pick up X4.
I've been stuck for while in eve online now and weighing whether i should move on or not.

I'm glad I did, because with the current state of the game I'm really enjoying myself. With the outlook of the 6.0 update and even multiplayer support (even if its just instance based) in the future things look even more bright.

definitely do the tutorials before you start an actual game (hint: the tutorial doesn't properly communicate when it's over and how to progress from there. Just leave back to the main menu and start a new tutorial from a new game.)

X4 is huge and more sandbox like. Very early on you already get a glimpse at the xenon. I almost shit myself when i spawned next to  a full blown Xenon  battleship incursion in argon space after using a jump gate. I Loved it. 

While I'm not deep into the game yet I've done some homework and I really like how you as a player can play a major role in shaping the universe  by become your own powerful faction / empire if you wish to do so.


I still encounter bugs and inconveniences every now and then. But X4 is a very complicated sim so I don't ever expect things to be perfect.
However the fact that you can still glitch into stations and be stuck inside their hull is quite frustrating. I really hope this will be fixed with the 6.0 updates physics new engine.

If you're looking to immerse yourself into an epic space opera, become part of an empires war effort leading by the helm or establish yourself as the economic backbone, become a pirate marauding and stealing ships or bring about the certain doom of the coalition through supporting  the xenon invasion.

Buy the game and play it. It is awesome. In case you want to know what you're getting into, see below.

This is three games in one and not all parts are equal.

1: Top down Accountant  2: Fighter Pilot in space  3: First person walking simulator

Missing 4: Rich guy buying stupid stuff (like end game of GTA V)

What I expected when I bought this game was something like Alien Isolation and Wing Commander put together. I wanted to walk around the inside of my ship, and have stuff to do and people to talk to in my ship as if I were in the Ebon Hawk from Kotor 2. But then when I wanted to fly I expected to be able to go to the cockpit of the ship, get in the chair and fly the Ebon Hawk around.  

X4 let's you get in the chair and fly around.  If you get out of the chair there just isn't any ""rest of the ship"" to go to. You are either in the chair or standing right behind the chair. There is no where to go.

At a station I expected something like Alien Isolation but working with people and vendors. Maybe Whiterun in space from TES V in space. However, the stations are tiny and EMPTY on the inside. Also, when you are walking around you can't shoot anyone. I didn't get this game expecting it to be a first person shooter but I did expect to be able to use my hands. 

After playing for a bit I discovered the map and the ability to buy more ships and send them to do stuff. Dealing with the map is tedious because I use a controller as much as I can and the map was very clearly designed with keyboard and mouse in mind. So I avoid the map. 

If you want an Accounting Manager game, this is your game. Stick to the map. 

If you want a fighter pilot game in space, this is 100% the game for you and this is how I play it and I enjoy it a lot with the one caveat that I wish I could have a ship interior that made sense. 

If you want a first person immersive game where you go around and talk to people, X4 falls short.

I want to love this game as it is a huge space sim sandbox with many ships including massive ones but as I get in, finish the tutorials and start up a game, and try to hire my first npc captain I am met with immense disappointment.

The game seemingly put very little production value on the npc character interactions and models. After my 30th ""Hello There"" and ""Good luck out there!"", I couldn't take it anymore, that is all they ever say seemingly.

I feel like it would have been better if you never had to interact with the ps1 level NPCs in the first place and just did it Elite Dangerous style and no NPC, have everything done from the station window because its so bad. The walking around in the station and other ships seems to be a very shallow experience either way as it is all the same.

The time it would take to me get to the fun part of this game is probably not worth it, I spent almost 3 hours in and I felt frustrated at every turn because the pacing is like eve online, which is a game you have to have all the time in the world to really enjoy. For folks with limited time, interesting things to hook you need to happen in reasonable time, this just feels like an MMO grind in single player format.

X4 can be a complex game, depending on how many game mechanics you engage in.  The beauty of it is you can play however you want.  There are several branching story paths you can follow, or just play it as a sandbox.  The game offers several ways to start, as well as a custom start.

There are a TON of controls, so it may take some time to set up preferred keybindings or to set up a joystick or HOTAS.  The game can easily be played with a mouse and keyboard, and also supports HOTAS.  I personally use an X56, and the game feels pretty amazing.  I would recommend those using HOTAS to find an inputmap that someone else has already created for ease of set up.

The graphics in space are very well done.  There are numerous factions and ships that all have their own flavour.  NPC's are a little dated, and there is not very much variance in appearance.  To be clear, what I mean is there are only so many Terran faces and hairstyles.  Once you've seen 20 people, you've seen them all.  Same goes for each race.  Which is ok, since X4 is more about flying, strategizing, and management of assets.  Ships, stations, trading, mining, etc.

Mods are available in the Steam workshop.  IMO having mod support increases any games longevity.  Vanilla is perfectly fine, and modding is there for those interested.

The online portion IMHO is lackluster.  I'm not really into online features*, however, there are a couple of achievements related to them if that's something people are interested in.  Keep in mind that if mods are used the online portion is disabled.

The game tends to be more CPU hungry I believe, so your mileage may vary when it comes to game performance.

As for the gameplay itself, you can walk around your ship, out of your ship, walk around stations, teleport.  Some may feel that is gimmicky, others may feel it's immersive.  I'm the latter.  I love the fact that I can get up from my seat, walk around while the relief pilot takes over.  I can walk through a station and watch ships take off and land.  You can see NPC's going about their business.  Talk to them, hire them.  Build stations, destroy stations.  Fly in a single ship, or control a massive fleet in multiple sectors.

Above is a balance of some pros and cons.  Aside from that, I do have one negative that irks me.  That is: Friendly fire.  I can fight in a battle and be hit by a friendly NPC.  They quickly come on the comms and apologise.  It's water off a ducks back.  I understand I'm in the thick of it, and shots are flying.  However, when you accidentally hit a friendly NPC whether it be your main guns, or your automated turrets, they are more abrupt and tell you stop firing on them, or they won't tolerate that.  When it's like, dude, can you not see I'm firing on the enemy?  Can you not fly in the line of fire?  And eventually they may become hostile towards you.  This has made me avoid helping some friendly NPC's.  This has also made me use only beam turrets as they are more accurate.  Thankfully there is a mod that addresses this and makes friendly fire less of an issue so I can better guard the gate in Hatikvah's Choice without getting hostility from friendlies.

All in all, I would recommend X4 Foundations.  Would also recommend the DLC's for a full experience.

(now bare in mind, I got Elite Dangerous to work and started playing within an hour, and have not looked back 100+ hours in).... but in this game I spent hours trying to work out what the hell they are even talking about in the terrible tutorials. ""Click THIS THERE"" but they don't tell you what the ""THIS"" is or where it is... so over to another Google search and type; ""where is the ""THIS"" in x4 game"", then wade through another forum to just simply do a single ""click here"" in a tutorial. How crazy is it when you need to research on a forum to just complete a tutorial which is supposed to be there to err... teach you! 

Then the tutorial would just stop functioning and the ""Abort Tutorial"" button would stop functioning. So would have to quit and  start a ""New Game"" AGAIN. After this about 3 hours of absolute frustration, I finally said; ""Lets just try and play this thing"", 

So I started with a Young Cadet start... Accepted a mission to scan ships for power cells (putting aside the fact that the mission gives you zero help on where to even start) this is when the crappy flying mechanics, odd ship behaviour, and the so called ""right click to scan"" feature also failed to function. ""Right click the ship to scan it"" Sure... right clicks....nothing.... right clicks.... nothing.... right click faster than an auto clicker still nothing. Left clicks, then right clicks... ah there it is, scan, but now I scanned... errr now what? A massive list of ship details with no help on where to even look for the information...  Typical of the frustration this Game causes. 

Then for no apparent reason I'm in ""Travel Mode"" I come out of that and I'm in the middle of nowhere, then a ship starts to attack me, and despite doing the targetting tutorial and binding a key on my HOTUS 30 minutes earlier, and clicking that key, no targetting would work. So after 15 minutes of dog fighting with terrible flying mechanics, no targetting, and stuck in the middle of nowhere due to a travel mode trip I never even asked for, I was DONE! 

So I actually played the game for about 45 minutes to an hour (Which was buggy and frustrating), but spent 3 hours just trying to do the ""tutorials"" which also were buggy and confusing.

There are several starting scenarios to choose from, ""Young Gun"" being one of my favorites. It is not perfect though, no game is, so i will just go over some of the big pros and cons of X4.

PROS:

- In depth economy with fluctuations in supply and demand, your actions can affect this.

- Choose your own path and background, create a story with thousands of different possible endings.

- Hundreds of detailed ships you can fly and command.

- Unique battles, no two battles between factions are ever the same, again your actions can affect this.

CONS:

- Loooooooong save/load times, the farther you progress the worse it gets, HOWEVER, this issue is soon to be eradicated, as the new 6.00 Beta 3 version fixes this problem IMMENSELY, I am currently playing on the beta, and my save/load time has been cut down by a truly astonishing 80%, so once 6.00 is released, you can disregard this con.

- Resource heavy, there's a LOT of stuff going on all the time, so if you have a pretty middle of the road PC setup, specifically your CPU, the game may not perform the greatest. I would not recommend anything below an 7th Gen Intel core i5 or AMD equivalent. I would not go by the store page recommendations.

- Again another performance issue is memory leaks, so its best to have plenty of RAM available, minimum of 16GB recommended, 32GB is plenty. Anything lower can cause the game performance to constantly drop over time and eventually crash.

- The AI can be a little... stupid. Sometimes they like to pick a fight for no reason, especially with the Ministry of Finance faction for some reason (at least in MY save they do). Or they get themselves killed in unique ways, the previously mentioned 6.00 beta has definitely helped with this issue, but its still there.

- This one is personally not a big deal to me, but could be to some people. The game actually does have a history and codex, but it does not do a very good job at telling that story, if you are new to the X franchise like I was, it could be really confusing, I recommend watching a video about the whole X story if you want to actually understand the occasional references this game makes to the previous X games.

Over all I very highly recommend the game, don't let the cons scare you away! If you have a 2018+ modern system with at least decent mid-range components: Core i5-7600 + NVIDIA GTX 780 + 16GB RAM you wont have any real issues running the game on the right settings, and of course if you have a high end system like mine: Intel core i9-9900K + NVIDIA RTX 2080ti + 32GB RAM, you will very rarely have issues.

- Ship interiors? Check.
- Persistent NPC ships, which don't just ""spawn"" but get actually built and flown where needed? Check.
- Actual economy, where different resources can be in different supply in different areas, stations that actually have purpose, eve-like ""everything you see was actually built from raw materials"" feeling? Check!
- Vastly differently sized ships, with even ""medium"" ships being several times larger than small ones? Check!
- Ability to actually pilot any ship, up to and including MASSIVE fleet carriers? Suck it, Elite!
- Building your own stations? Sure! Owning your own sectors? Also yes!
- Being able to actually order your ships around and have massive fleets active at a time, instead of being bound to a single ship at a time? YES!

The combat is not as good, the mining is not as fun, but it doesn't have to be. Instead the fun is in the completely removed limits and the ability to own and order around anything you see in the game. The only space game I have ever played where trading is actually fun!

I one day I went from watching youtube and doing the basic controls tutorial to making a million bucks, buying my own new ship, and having fun with NO prior space sim or grand strategy experience. + the community is SUPER newcomer friendly.

Like many people, I am dying to play starfield. After trying out no mans sky and not really thinking it was for me, I give X4 another go. I tried it once back in 2019 and thought it was way to complex and clunky. 

I truly believe I just didnt even give the game a proper chance. Yes the UI is a little clunky and the game is a bit janky but coming from someone who has never played a space sim, nor do I like grand strategy games, this game really was  not that hard to learn at all. I spent the better part of a morning watching youtube videos and then I played through the basics tutorial twice just to really make sure I understood the controls. I then spent that evening just flying around the seeing what made the game tick. that same night i gave it a bit of a real try and found that I was making enough progress to be satisfying the day I started playing with no prior experience. On day two I was having a blast.

The game is not nealy has rough as some people make it seem if you just spend a day testing out the systems and learning.

This isnt a game you will play for an hour to two here and there, its an immersive game that will probably be the only game you play for a bit. I think of it like space morrowind, which is a good thing.

I wish I had read through the negative reviews before purchasing and gave them more credit.

[b][u]The worst thing is - the developers believe gimping the AI is the correct way to make this universe work[/u][/b].. There is no slider setting, there is just a mostly dead, unreactive AI. It is you and dead AI factions. It is empty. [b]If the devs were to have said that they will be working on fixing the AI to feel more alive, I'd have given this a recommend as I see hope in the base game [u]BUT THEY DEFEND IT[/u][/b]

[h1]Negatives: [/h1]

[b][u]AI Faction stability[/u][/b]
Currently the faction AI is set up to have an hourly delay before responding to just about anything for two major things:

* invasions -- If there is a large attacking fleet, the AI will not really ramp up production of defense ships, or moving a remote defense fleet do engage for about an hour -- assuming it can. If it can't, the AI will not try to resolve bottlenecks more aggressively to be able to respond, and will instead be run over. This is a fairly common problem as invasions happen regularly in the game between factions. So it is not uncommon to have a faction be mostly unable to continue functioning within about 12 hours of the game running.

* Production management -- If there is a bottleneck keeping AI from being able to produce ships, stations, or otherwise, the AI will let that bottleneck exist for 1 hour or longer. This is a [b]DESIGN DECISION[/b] by the developers. I do not understand why they have done this, and consider this good gameplay for a universe space simulator title, but they have. Their justification is to let the player make profits, but at the same time this makes the AI factions unable to at all hold up against [spoiler]xenon and hives[/spoiler] -- because those do not have any supply chain to manage. It is not uncommon to have factions wiped out within a 24 hour game if the play has been exploring casually on a first time playthrough. 

[b][u]Pacing:[/u][/b]
Continuing from above -- if you want to be able to explore content, have a leisure time building up your own trading empire, spend time mining, spend time doing small missions and getting reputation -- I would recommend looking at another title. All those actions mean you're not managing the AI factions. if you do not manage the AI faction issues, you will find yourself (if you do take a slower pace) being overrun and just gaming the AI to get to the end game because all the AI factions are more or less dead.  

Within about 10 hours of gameplay you should have about 50 ships running supply trades for the AI factions to keep them going -- Also you should be moving trading ships around as needed to prevent one faction from overruning another if you want to keep all factions alive/going so you can be able to build their ships/parts. Once a faction is wiped out -- there is no way to get their ship designs, parts, etc. 

There are only a few ways to play this game at the end of the day if you want to maintain the universe at all to be able to enjoy a wide variety of what the game has to offer. And I guess that is my hangup -- in a playthrough the AI is too weak/unstable to feel like I have time to play the game at a relaxed pace. I have over 100h in the game now -- and I don't wanna start it up anymore because of this. I don't like having to go ""How do I maximize the next hour in the game so I can keep the AI factions going better"" is not really what I would call 'fun""

[b][u]Captain skilling[/u][/b]

Captains in this game fly ships. They have skill levels. When you purchase a ship you get an unskilled captain. There is a skill gate of 1-4 stars (5 being highest) for you to be able to assign captains some of the more ""self-driven"" tasks -- EG: you want a miner to be able to mine and sell to the higest bidder? Get to skill 3. You want a trader to trade goods at highest profits that can be found in a range? Get to skill 4. And many more.

The game  doesn't have any training methods for training at scale. AKA: you buy 50 trading ships as your production starts ramping up? Make manual trades FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE repeatedly -- constantly. You're not gonna find that many skill trainers. You're not gonna be able to supply the galaxy with them being 0-1 star. You're stuck with 50 ships that can't do anything on their own. 

You get trainer skills [b]RARELY[/b] as mission rewards. Your pilots will skill up over time -- but this time is in the tens to HUNDREDS of hours depending on what skill you want them at. And remember what I said earlier? Factions can be wiped out in 24 hours? Yeah. Have fun with this invigorating gameplay.

you can spend an hour trying to find a single 3 star captain -- there is no way to purchase them in masse. further they can cost upwards of 100 million of the game currency -- which is more than the 50 trading ships I described earlier.

[b][u]Universe immersion[/u][/b]
Okay you still want to play cause the game is an already existing franchise and it must have great immersion right? If the above doesn't take you out of it -- one thing almost certainly will if you're trying to play the game blind as a new player. The in game wiki is just a skeleton. It has basic stats but ZERO descriptions for 99% of the content in the game. Want to know what a weapon does? Is it plasma? is it a shotgun? is it a long range sniper? What do these numbers actually mean in how the weapon behaves? You get nothing. Every single item has a description called: ""No description available"" or similar. If you want to understand the game, universe, etc -- go watch youtube videos for new players. Read the forum. read their dev blog. Don't expect it in game. And that is horribly immersion breaking.

[h1]The good[/h1]
[b][u]Mods[/u][/b]

Mods are trying to address all of the above... But not really a unified vision on how to, making it just feel hacky
There are mods for:
* Faster leveling of captains
* Buy captains at a specific level
* Train captains
* Auto exploration that makes sense
* AI faction overhauls 
* Universe weapons/ships overhauls to be more like X2/X3 (THERE IS AN ACTUAL DEVELOPED IN GAME WIKI WITH DESCRIPTIONS. WOW)
* and many many more.

If you're going to buy this game, you're buying it for the modding scene and what this game can offer. Not for what the developers have made. The vanilla experience is horrible as a new player. And the devs do not set the players up in game to know why things are failing, and to know they are INTENTIONALLY gimping the AI factions, making the universe an overall more broken experience to play.

Yes, I have a great gaming rig; and could play without any issues of performance.  There is just a serious issue with game mechanics and the controls that remove all fun for me.

Pros:
  looks good.
  gives you the experience of how hard it is to be in outer space.
  looks to have great depth (I had to give up because unplayable because of controls)

Cons:
  controls so bad cannot be played without way too many hours of learning how to even land a ship
  can bounce through solid objects
  outer space is a very hard environment; this game makes it no fun to do things like open a door or land a ship.  Yes, in real life this would be almost impossible for an untrained person; but the controls should presume we know how to exist out there.

I'd played 114.9hrs on the game at the point of review and I said not recommended: if you do get it get it in the sale because the game is so riddled with bugs that it's just horrible. Essentially, why pay AAA-prices for a game like X4 when you could get X3 nice and cheaply and enjoy a game that worked, right?

Now I am at 354hrs and some time has passed. Most importantly the Devs haven't gone to sleep with their work on X4 and have sorted the bugs out well enough for me to stream this game on Twitch in anger and for it not to be embarrassing to show people. Far from it, I have all the DLCs and it draws my highest viewership amongst the games I stream. Not a bad turnaround!

I'd still stick by the comment about the sales but solely because you really want some of the DLCs and the sale offers for this game a really good - offering you the game and DLCs in bundles works great and I might particularly recommend Split Vendetta as the Split have a special place in my X3 heart and the Devs have added a lot of systems for the Split - nice work with that! Thew Terran DLC also seems to be popular and I have it but haven't run-in to them yet so I cannot really review that DLC just yet.

I think 354hrs is a decent amount of time to get from a game but I expect I'll get way more to be honest and now the game does feel so much better than X3 did.

Pros:
Incredible Concept - What you can do (in theory)
Incredible Content - The ship and station models, the weapons, the stations

Cons:
Nothing works - literally there is not a single part of this game that functions as you would expect.  You'll spend hours reading forums posts to figure out how to do that relatively simple thing you'd expect to be able to do naturally in any empire builder.  Attack something properly, protect something properly, communicate something properly, be warned of something important properly.

Obviously a lot of work went into this title, and I have been a fan of the X-universe games going back decades.  I don't want to belittle what the devs were trying to accomplish and they've worked hard, but in it's present state this game not only isn't worth full price or even what it's sale price is because all the beautiful things that they've put into this game only promise something it can't deliver.  Mostly it has do do with the NPC AI's behavior and prettuy much their inability to do anything, from fly properly to fight properly, and the issue that even though there are menus upon menus to define exactly how you want them to behave, they just don't... usually ending in their needless destruction.

The one example I'll describe is attacking enemy (Xenon) stations to take over their star system:
The fleet you'll need will never fly in a recognizable formation even thought there's like a dozen you can assign.
They cannot pathfind in a 3D environment.  You can sort of mitigate this a little by ""leaving the sector"" and watching icons of your ships crawl, like 20-mins crawl, toward their objective on the map. I didn't buy the game to have my character not where the action is.
If you do want to take part in the action and you stay in system to say fly your ship into battle too, well you'll see that most of your ships probably won't actually fire their weapons at the enemy station.  If they do it probably isn't going to be their main weapons but just the turrets (which actually the turret AI seems to function properly).
Sometimes you feel touched by the divine when a majority of your ships actually open fire.  But be warned it's likely during the attack they will one buy one suicide themselves towards the station where the defensive turrets are going to shred them in seconds.  If are watching very carefully and catch your fleet doing this you can tell them to flee instead, but mine usually actually flee towards the danger, so not great.

There is a pilot experience level system in place, so the badly behaved AI will behave even worse if you have an inexperienced pilot at the helm of your fleet ships.  So you put a lot of work into building up their experience before giving them big expensive ships, only to have them suicide themselves against the first big threat.

Keep in mind it took hours of playtime to figure out how to control the fleet at all, and many more hours reading forum posts because these problems are being had by everyone out there.  The above description is not even complete but it typical of the frustrations that run throughout the whole game.  For me this breaks the game, I haven't even had the time yet to actually explore all the stuff you can do in this game like boarding, hacking, a lot of the many mission threads, and all the beautiful complexity of this game.

It's not even like missed potential, all of the potential is already in the game, but the interface to control that complexity is crazy to learn and SUPER GRINDY because the menus are themselves overly complex and even though it seems like you can tailor every little aspect of the game there are no good sweeping options you can select to say control your miners differently than your traders or destroyers.  But yeah go ahead and spend hours defining these things ship by ship.

The moments of joy and achievement are so blunted by the realization of how many frustrating hours you've put in to get that fleeting dopamine dump... 

I know the die hards would say there are mods to fix all these problems.  I'll likely take a look at them, sinking even more time into this game, just because my goodness if it worked, it would be such a beautiful thing.

But as a review of the vanilla game, (that isn't cheap BTW considering the release date) it just doesn't function; not even as well as some of the old classic X games which suffered from the same issues often.  If you're willing to buy it just to explore and fly a ship then it stands up ok doing that, but that's nowhere near what the slick advertising promises.",1675975982,1675975982,False,56,7,0.718163073062896729,0,True,False,False

To give a brief overview, the [i]X series[/i] is essentially a long running space sim franchise that leans heavily on the economy management side of things. You are dropped into a sandbox and mostly left to your own devices. The usual and expected trappings are here: Missions, mining, dog-fighting, fleet management, station building, etc.

At launch X4 was a bit rough, and the previous entry [i](X Rebirth)[/i] was not well received. However, after some patches and DLC, X4 is now in a [b]really[/b] good spot. I will mention that there is an extremely large patch on the horizon that will give the graphics a face lift, improve the physics, AI & quite a lot more besides.

There is a modding community which is spread across the Steam Workshop, Nexusmods, Github & the egosoft forums. The majority are QoL, but there some popular overhauls, new ships, etc. Better modding tools are also being developed by egosoft now as well, so that will likely get better.

Before buying, I would strongly recommend watching some gameplay videos so you can get an idea of how the game works [i](this is not Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen)[/i].

If the price puts you off, it could be worth trying [i]X3: Albion Prelude[/i] or [i]Terran Conflict[/i] (AP is probably the better one to grab). The games are significantly cheaper, albeit older with all that entails (more dated graphics, UI, etc). They do play differently, but will give you a rough idea of what to expect. They also have a matured modding community too.

Finally, if you do buy this game - Do the tutorials. They won't take long at all and will help give you a better grasp of the basics.

Also watch some how-to videos, some things can be a bit un-intuitive.

Lastly some basic gameplay pointers that may or may not be of assistance. If you buy this as well as all the DLC, consider the [i]Terran Cadet[/i] start. It puts you on the right path for some important storyline events, lets you access some important content a bit easier and you will get some other [i]benefits[/i] from their quests. There are some non-permanent 'difficulties' regarding faction rep that come with this start but they are easy to tackle when you get to them.

Once you get to about 600k-800k credits, investigate [i]mining[/i] and think about the term [i]passive income[/i]. That should hopefully set you on the right track.

- Endless possibilites (provided you are willing to invest 100+ hours into them)
- A large open map full of derelect ships, loot caches, and lock boxes
- Mushroom Hunting in the Forest (Crystal Mining in the asteroids)
- Clunky and unintuitive management controls
- Hard but very engaging combat
- OG Minecraft tutorial design (wiki and youtube lol)
- Dope ship designs
- Dope modding scene
- A universe that feels full of life but also completely lifeless

A very specific kind of person will like this game. I would argue that 80-90% of people who read this review probably think they are that person and are wrong. This is not to gatekeep the game but just do your research and understand what you are getting into before you purchase this game. It will take at a minimum 8 hours to get your bearings and figure out how to do the basics. After that it will take dozens of hours of grinding to really make a name for yourself in the universe and after that it will take even more hours before you even get in a position where you can think about building the largest ships in the game. It is awesome and a brutal experience all at the same time.

From its 1.0 version to its version as of 2-4-2023, this game has made many improvements.  There are just too many to list here.

Positives

Game looks Great
Runs pretty Smooth with 14+ mods installed
Man rules and behaviors of ships can be set in the menus inside game
Game lets you have a deep level of detail, EG land on a friogate, take control of the frigate, Land on a Large class ship, take control of the Large ship, Land a M or S class ship take control of a XL.  All the white being able to walk around the docking area while a massive battle goes on above you.  No other game can do this except star citizen in its game developement future.
-Story missions finally work pretty well, there were many problems with them in 1.0
-Economy System is awesome.
-Terraforming is a good endgame feature

Negatives

-No max standoff distance associated with ships guns.  EG Shoot from a distance with longest range gun.
-Station builder UI is horrible and needs to be completely redone.  They need to make it like blender or other 3D modelers and put a UI element says what each icon and key does.  A F1 key press  inside the station manager doing this would help a lot.  Being able to lock the XYZ axis for rotation and movement is needed  very badly.
-Restricted movement in the station manager for the Y axis (verticle) needs to not be locked.  Movement keys in the station manager should never be tied to camera view!
-Better AI turrents that prioritize for certain hostiles..
  EG Targets of importance for a small turret from most important to lest ... Missile Defense -> Drones -> S ships -> M ships -> L/XL Ships.  Instead you have to set certain turrets to missile defense.  This would be ok if every ship had missiles, but that is not the case.  This makes the Missile Defense turret useless most or half of the time.
-Need more endgame gameplay features that make for more sandbox options.

The gameplay is amazing and station building is an upgrade too.
Eventhough the way things are being built pixel by pixel instead of component by component is a bit weird to look at.
Also very happy they implemented the auto miners and auto trader that we had to download as addons before.
I have tons of games to play but this is the one I get magnetically drawn to every time I sit down behind my laptop.
Plus I don't even have SETA unlocked yet.
So yeah it's a bit slow but its amazing to watch.

One thing I still can't really understand is the space highways.
It's something they introduced in X Rebirth and in my honest opinion it should have stayed there.
What I also dislike is that every trading station looks argon.
I expected the other races to have their own stations and style.

I also have to admit the game has been out for a while but still has some game breaking bugs.
Getting stuck inside a station or astroids if you fly against them at full speed.
Or your ship just teleports somewhere random.
I had this bug that I was teleported out of the map, 300K Kilometers away.... and without SETA it would take a year.
So had to reload my save.

But there many pros and many cons could write them all down but I don't see the point.
Everyone who enjoyed the previous X series will surely enjoy this one.
If you are new to this and never played an X game then sure go ahead and play it.
You're here for a reason or else you wouldn't read this review.
It means you enjoy this genre and then this game will consume your time.
I know I spend  thousands of hours on each X game myself.
(Except X Rebirth cause that game was just not a real X game but more of an arcade remake or like a X for Dummies game) 

Update: So after years you can still get stuck inside a station or astroid while flying and bumping into them.
Also the AI is still very bad and does things you do not expect or want a lot.
Like also flying into buildings and astroids and get stuck inside.
The only fix for that is to be on a station in a sector where there aren't any of your ships.
When you are in a different sector your ships just fly through everything as if there are no walls so ships won't get stuck or create traffic jams.

If you feel like this can still give you an amazing time playing then this is the best space x4 (genre) game there is.",1577656366,1675243743,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is fairly similar to previous games in the series, there is a number of starting scenarios to choose from, although they don't really have that major of an effect, the game is ultimately a sandbox with plots and missions for extra flavor not the main focus, trading, mining, combat and station building is easy enough although the UI is sometimes tedious to use.
The main negative compared with previous games is the universe is a lot smaller, in addition a number of factions and sectors are gated behind the DLC which is almost enough for me to not recommend it.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics are reasonably decent but certainly not Star Citizen level of quality, still it could be much worse and each ship type has a unique if slightly bland interior, you can also walk around on stations and large ships which consist of a number of areas linked by an elevator, some of the textures are quite blurry and detail is lacking in some areas.

[h1]AI[/h1]
The AI can at times be as dumb as a rock, it's fortunate that there is no collision damage in X4, on the larger scale factions can also fail at economic management leading to shortages of important goods which can screw you over by for example preventing you from building ships, they can also fail at defending against the Xenon which can lead to factions being destroyed, some of the plots allow you to start or stop wars between factions, the bad AI can however lead to some amusing situations.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
X4 is a pretty good game as long as you're willing to make your own goals and deal with a less than optimal UI, if you're looking for a deep story this is not really for you, there can be a lot of waiting around and empire management as you progress towards the later game but it gives you quite a lot of freedom to do whatever you want which is one of the big attractions of the X series, overall I would recommend it but wait for a sale before you get the DLC.",1675092953,1675092953,True,3,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

You could argue whether or not dog fighting was better in X2 or not but both products are very similar at the core of the game. The developers actually work on this game.

Brilliant sandbox game! Not buggy at all now. Just so many things you can do in this game. Space combat sim, empire builder and management, trading and commerce sim, Design and build space stations, customise then fly 60 odd ships, from nimble fighter to heavy bomber to to dreadnought and aircraft carrier. All seamless experience. Plus story lines and missions you can follow. 

Example: I customised and bought a fighter from a wharf I was on. Once finished it waited for me to board, I got on the ship and assigned the fighter to protect one of my merchant vessels that was set to autotrade. in beutifull 3d fps, I watched the pilot walk onboard the fighter take off and flight through the jumpgates to get to my merchant.

Much later in the game I built a wharf myself, with money from my commercial empire I bought the blueprints for ships and components and built a personal navy- with 50 fighters assigned to a carrier protected a region of space where the enemy i had chosen to fight in a fully dynamic universe of factions trading or fighting with one another. Obviously I had destroyers to protect my carrier from enemy capital ships.

So cool to watch the turrets on capital ships (the type of anti-fighter turrets that I chose) swat small enemy fighters out of the sky in a beautiful laser show.

The things you can do in this game puts elite to shame!",1546935679,1674891739,True,3,2,0,0,True,False,False

After the debacle that was the X:R release I even gave that my best shot and got some satisfaction out of it after couple of years, patches and mods later.  But Foundations in its current form has simply failed to live up to even limited expectations.

35 hours in and the stark reality is that this game is frankly rather dull.  There is no meaningful enemy, the much-vaunted sector expansion seems to be non-existent, the economy is bland.  Ship models are weak in comparison to X:R, let alone X3, the universe is small, upgrades are unimaginative and common to all races.  All 3 races that is, since Split and Boron have mysteriously disappeared.

Where is the awe of Argon Prime with its majestic capital ships guarding the heart of empire?  Where is the sense of exploration?  Of racing from one end of the universe to the other in pursuit of those faction specific modules?  The excitement of trading high profitsss space weed through lawless pirate space?  Where is the ever present threat of Xenon or Khaak invasion (I thought we defeated them in X:R btw?)  Where is the sense that any of this actually matters?  Even X:R had a more compelling reason for being.  In X:F, I witness a small corner of the universe that has entered an era of peaceful coexistence and think OK, that's nice, but there's nothing for me to do here.

The map is much improved (though still 2 dimensional) and the UI has made a giant leap from 1990 to 2010.  RTS-like squad command and control is a massive win but sadly redundant because there's nothing for my squad to shoot.  I even enjoy the added immersion of getting out of the ship and walking around.  But I can't help but feel that I've seen all the game has to offer after only a few days of casual play.

My initial impression was that Egosoft had listened and acted upon the feedback from X:R.  Sadly those impressions were premature and Foundations appears to be the last gasp of a tired series, milking the last drops from a loyal fanbase.

Positives:

- Large dynamic universe and economy, that you can affect however you want.
- Actually and realistically capable of creating and running large empires.
- Intense combat.
- The designs of the ships and stations are great.
- Build and upgrade your ships.
- Can build stations and customize them however you want.
- Play it from a small scale, taking part in the trading/combat/exploration personally, or command your empire from a larger scale.
- Walk around stations and ships.
- Do and be whatever you want, wanna wipe out the Terrans? you can do that, wanna be a peaceful trader? can do that too.

Just to list some of the problems that can't really be fixed with mods:

- AI can be frustrating to wrangle (KUDA AI tweaks mod helps).
- Oversights like for example: capturing an enemy ship while an enemy ship is docked on it will make the docked ship refuse to get off, or not being able to trade remotely from your own ship if you're sitting down.
- Wonky physics.
- Absolutely god awful learning curve: tutorials in-game are bad, information in-game and out of game is incomplete, loads of information people give is either wrong, conflicting or out of date. Be prepared to be learning for a while.
- Very intensive, but understandably so as it simulates so much.
- Loading takes forever.
- Clunky UI.

Missiles and shields, light pulse lasers and large plasma cannons. They're ALL manufactured at star bases.

1) Making money. Inspite of awful AI, broken economy, bugs e.t.c we still can make lot of money. Its too easy, but this part is OK.

But what do wee need this money for? How can we spend it? Here comes the second major part:
2) Making combat. In other games we could spend money to upgrade our ship, buy new ships and unlock new combat opportunities. But does X4 has these combat options?
- no combat at all. EVE has lvl1 to lvl5 missions, mass battles. X games have kill-patrol-escort-defend-mass battle missions/events too. X4 has nothing.
- no combat at all2. You can push SETA and return - none of your stations or ships will be hurt. The game is totally peaceful.
- bad AI. Ships, controlled by AI cannot do anything in combat. I can oneshot any S ship but when i give order to my captain - it flies around for hours unable to hit target.
- unplayable balance. I can buy 1 ship for million on the start of the game and that`s it. This ship can kill any L or XL ship without any problem. This ship can pass through the whole combat content.

So whats the point in making money if there is no where to spend them? The only combat content here is to make billions with SETA, buy 50+ ships and jump in the enemy sector where i can kill everything while dumb AI is flying around. But what is the point? Where are local battles with 5-10 enemies? Where are combat missions? Where is defending of my empire? And why does the combat feel so easy?

And new ventures feature is huge didisappointment too. Now we can put some money in black whole and gain more in 10 hours. Is this a joke? What do we need it for if there is no combat in this game? Pls add sand to this sandbox, not some unnecessary features.

So thats is why ratings are going to mixed. You build stations, make make money and that`s it. What is the point in making money just for make more if there is no combat? The game feels like real time stratagy without enemies.",1546322031,1674463809,True,0,0,0.542580187320709229,1,True,False,False

Only reason it has a learning curve is because there is so much you can do in this game and the game is absolutely huge. So now the reasons why this is clearly one of the best scifi games ive ever played in my 47 years of gaming...You can choose between a few different starts, for example one giving you 10,000 credits and a basic ship. Galaxy maps are procedurally generated in hexagonal sectors and these sectors are big. Ships come in four different hull sizes...small, medium, large and extra large. You can upgrade and modify ships like in a 4x strategy game and it's not just a stat upgrade or anything like that, you will actually see the parts added to ships and it changes their look. Oh and there are parts, LOTS of parts to choose from. You can play this game however you want, like in a hands off captain or fleet admiral approach too. For example, I bought a medium ship, referred to as a gunboat. Now you would think medium is kind of small, but when i saw the size of this vessel, i couldn't believe it! I walked down the ramp and got out this ship, walked a good ways away and turned around to see a mammoth size vessel, this thing was absolutely huge. Then i noticed the bridge house on it and that is when i truely realized the sheer size of this beast. Then to think there are large and extra large is insane and i have yet to own one of those. Anyway, I packed a full crew on it, climbed aboard and had my pilot head out of the wharf. Not long after, i got into a battle with a few pirates. So I stood on the bridge looking out the windows and watched with my arms folded in full confidence as my ship took on all three of the pirates, one medium ship and two small fighters. You can walk on the bridge and look around as the ship is underway or in battle. On exterior view, I can see the turrets open firing on those small fighters making attack runs. It was like watching something out of a Starwars movie. I didn't just torch these pirates either, it was a fight but my ship came out victorious, defeating all three but i had heavy damage. Had I wanted to, I could of took control of the entire vessel by myself but I figured my pilot and crew can handle the threat and ill just monitor the battle. So there are moments like this in the game, lots of them when you realize how awesome it is. Next to mention, you can build entire space stations of your own selecting from modules and things like that depending on what kind of station you want to build. You can get out the ships and walk around on the space stations too. In fact, you can even get out your ships, do business on a space station and order your ship to go off and do something while you are shopping, looking for crew, missions or whatever. Then when you're done, have the ship (or another ship) come back to pick you up. Loads of detail in this game and at over 70 hours in only two weeks of owning it, I am still learning and having a blast with it. Whatever you do, if your a scifi fan then don't miss out on this X4 game, just buy it and be done but, you will want to spend the time learning it to get the most out of the game and as i mentioned earlier, it is worth every minute. Want to see things in action then go check out a video on youtube by ragnos28 stating what he enjoys the most in X4.",1674155271,1674155271,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The market simulator side of the game is so opposed to the actual game that even being in the same system as my AI to watch what they do has a massive, negative impact on their performance, because the game is just a hollow shell which can't even handle simple tasks while I'm watching it. It wants to just do math in the background without all that actual game nonsense getting in the way.

There's no mid-game to speak of.  I can wander the edges of a system to kill enemies who come in small vessels 1 or 2 at a time, do incredibly tedious quests which often end in instant death when it turns out the box was full of mines (because that's fun right?), or fight massive fleets and space stations which vaporize me instantly unless I have my own fleet.  Want to know what the time in between those two extremes is filled with?  Yep, fighting with the AI to automate my growing trade empire and leaving the game on overnight so my numbers will be big enough to do something the next day.  Bonus points if I leave my character sitting in the competition's system, which results in their economy crashing due to the AI in the game not being able to function while the player is there.

Exploring was fun for a while until I realized that there isn't that much to find.  There were only a few locations which really stood out from the copy paste stations procedurally scattered everywhere.

X4 is way too overpriced for the little actual gameplay it offers.

*You can no longer give simple commands to your own ship. Instead, you have to click bit-by-bit to explore, trade, or battle. Or you could pilot yourself. You can assign a crewmember to be the pilot, but they'll simply get stuck.

Come on, developers. You can do better. You've stripped all the best parts of X3 and added things that no player asked for.

You can fly around, pick up some missions and just chill through them, or you can go full on merchant magnate complete with a fleet of ships trading anything you wish for you.
You can even build your own station and customise your ship and it's kit, which reminds me I must also mention there is nothing quite like standing on your own space station out in the black, watching as it gets constructed by multitudes of drones right before your eyes.

A gigantic sandbox universe, fully simulated with real economy, and a wonderful sense of progression.
Hundreds of hours pleasantly spent don't lie!

You go from worrying about every 10 credits, to casually spending a million here or there, to swimming in billions as you expand your empire. Or not, you can be an ace fighter pilot if you want, or a fleet commander, or.. or.. or.. 
X4 gives you a handful of everything, so if it's [i]only[/i] fighter pilot you want, go buy Strike Suit Zero or something; if it's [i]only[/i] empire building, look at Civilisation, if it's only fleet command, any RTS, etc.
X4's strength is its broad variety.

What you should decide for yourself, is decide how you want to play X4. You can have lots of quick, short playthroughs with the various gamestarts (incl. budgeted, to ) or settle in for a single long-haul save like I did.
If you're a modding person, also choose your mods to complement your chosen play-style: mod sets can turn it into an almost completely different game, and depending on how you focus the mods, in quite different directions too.


Graphics-wise, X4 is beautiful; I spent many an hour just strolling or hovering through the modules, admiring the attention to detail. My favourite model is Hull Parts production, with all its moving robot arms, although the Courier-ship interior is a close second.

With the current three DLCs (Split Vendetta, Cradle of Humanity and Tides of Avarice), the universe is already  large enough. I regularly feel I'm missing out on happenings in one side of the universe, because I have my hands full in another corner. This is a [i]good[/i] thing: there is always something to do!
Given the quality of the game in it's current state, the upcoming Boron-DLC (Kingdom End) will be a launch-day purchase for me.


If I have any critique, it's crew skill progression. Egosoft deliberately scaled crew leveling to the ""thousands-of-hours"" players. I appreciate that decision, but it doesn't work for me personally (a job and young children); 3-5 hours/week increments is the best I can afford, and I want to progress more quickly than Egosoft intended in that time.
Fortunately, mods (Crew Seminars for me) help. I deliberately limit myself to only the 1-3 star seminars, to get halfway-competent crew. The 4-5 star levels I try to acquire ""naturally"" to not spoil myself.
It's a single player game, so you can make your own choices on how to have fun.


Compared to X-rebirth (where I also have a couple-hundred hours), X4 is hands-down the better choice.
I appreciated X-rebirth while I played it, but now that I've played X4, it was obviously a half-step on the way here.
Everything that ever bothered me in Rebirth has been fixed in X4.
- full-freedom station designer
- streamlined employee management: no more playing taxi for every.. single.. expert.. and.. architect.. and.. manager.. and..
- all ships flyable (though Fleets remain something I avoid)
- more-living universe.

All in all: have fun with it!

After couple hours more, I have to, sadly, change my recommendation to ""No"". This game is too much of a mess.
Bugs: They are EVERYWHERE. From getting stuck in textures, to losing control of the ship to getting locked out of menus (until reload), to being stuck in your own ship because door refuse to open (really fun 5 sectors away from the nearest station or teleportation target).
Missions: Obscure descriptions not really telling what is expected of you, where it is expected to happen and what quantity of consumables you need. Not before you pick up the mission.
Controls: Default bindings are atrocious, but fixable. Scan, consumable deploy and a lot of other time and aim sensitive stuff is on context menu. How the hell did this pass as a good idea?
AI and automatisation: AI is dumb as a pebble. Try flying a ship and see what your AI pilot is doing. Guaranteed despair. Auto-orders - the single least intuitive part of the game that, even when done properly, make your subordinates act erratically and without any sense. Or not act at all, even when they should. This is especially painful with station management. You regularly end up with some goods being ignored, not bought or unsold and your station not running properly.
Economy. Speaking from a terran perspective. Economy is a joke. You oversaturate market without trying and wares handle without much sense or cause and effect. 

It was supposed to be a chill game about exploration and slowly building up your own corporation/empire. It ended up being frustrating mess, full of bugs, obscure unexplained mechanics that don't even work properly in the first place (if forums are anything to go with in terms of figuring out how stuff was supposed to work).",1672616766,1673183199,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fighting gets more complicated too with capital ships, frigates, fighters, and support vessels. Keep coming back to this one as it has a lot to offer.

I'm planning to study more aspects of the game in this mode before starting again. So my impression - game is very cool, but a lot of things needs improvement.

Optimisations - obv one.
AI - You know, AI is like a school child here. He can do orders without much problems, but here and there occasionaly it will do some shit that you will have to deal with. It's minor mostly but annoys well.
Ship Equipment Upgrades - I wish we had better system for that, right now it's lacking. You have three ranks of upgrades for modules yeah, but their acquisition is either too simple or too hard and boring in all of these cases. It's too simple, needs some deep touch from developers.

Economics - as modern space economics game (Because you can't run away from it when you literally is a faction. You can even set up ""empire name"" lol, they want you to build an economic empire, which can destroy npc factions with how it's strong. I mean it's possible to create an independent production line and print your ships after all but boy, the amount of money you will need for this...), you need some better modern instruments and systems. Again the current economics is ""simple"". Both in instruments and in backend mechanics. Like the demand mechanics, it's not tied to faction, some clusters, some sub-faction traders or whatever. Station has a shit ton of it? Low price. Station has low stockage? High price. That's it... No stock market... In economic game... There is no stock market... You get the idea.

Here goes the stations. I got a few headaches about it. The way to set up stations is not really clear, orders for AI is sometimes doubtfull at what will they do. How stations will trade, will it buy from your people or from everyone else? Filter? You have to find a clever way to set up all of this bypassing those tools that would be intended for this... Acquireng blueprint? The lamest thing in the game. Pay the price or just look around trying to hack into it. Bad design, need something better. Perhaps the blueprint guy that requires some research, modules, resources and battles to unlock new blueprints. Current research tree lacks a lot.

Factions - would like to see factions to get more personall. Right now it's just a faction, giant npc. Yeah there are some policies about illegal cargo and backstory but i would like that factions could generate some stories, events. Right now it's just faceless npc.

But after all I liked it.With some mods a lot of minor/medium problems vanishes. You spend a lot of time in the map managing your faction which i love doing. Standing at command post of your flagship, commanding your fleet while everything around shoots, flies, blowns - literally dream came true.

Game did a lot of improvements in 4 years of it's existence, but i don't know how much time will it take to bring it close to the very good and deep game. 6.0 Promises upgrades in AI and UI and we will see how it goes...",1672769815,1672769930,True,4,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Enjoy this game, but remember to get your foundation of your chair once in a while (!)
Seriously, you need to have some kind of time device (i was thinking of a clock but hey , go nuts with it) in your direct eye sight or even set an alarm if you have to work next day :D

I had good times with this, specifically the missions in cradle of humanity were really good, 
few bugs here and there but i may have avoided a few by playing from an earlier save game from vanilla.
the race of the split is very nice, i love their accent and condescending behavior lol

(the list of cons is far greater not because the game sucks , on the contrary i.m.o. , i just want to explain the issues without nitpicking intended because they make it not a game for everyone, and to have a fair shot at what to expect)
in my opinion these types of games are as big as it can get, which is an achievement on its own when they can keep it from falling apart. 
Sometimes you think, hmmm this should be different..... here and there compromises have to be made in order of optimisation , always remember that in this gametype . 

This is not an excuse for everything though ,it needs a continious stream of effort to improve things like the pathing and the use of a single cpu core (this is just silly). Sometimes i don't know where Egosoft are going with this. (no offense i try to say this in an affective way : it might just be because they are German and quirky AF , they have a reputation to guard xD ) If you don't have a great cpu , don't grow your empire to large , maybe this game is not suitable for you untill you upgrade . i also recommend having 16 gb ram

pro: 
-steep learning curve , but once you understand the game you can put it all to good use
-great industrial grinder, love the production chains and being able to make stations anywhere and make billions then create a massive zerg army and see your cpu burn down the house(a more con side-effect of this pro quirk, still better then having a lame popcap ) 
if this is your thing, and ur pc can walk the walk, stop reading this and buy it on sale today  :p 

-lots of  ship/station customization,  stations could have a bit more but still sufficient, ships can have their own color skins , you can make your own logo if you can !gimp! and download a normal map plugin,  and lots of  different kinds off mods that enhance speed, shields ,damage etc
-you can do anything anywhere , help your allies, or rob them blind, kill aliens and loot them , in the beginning loot their wrecks near war zones

cons
-steep learning curve , but once you understand the game you can put it all to good use, however it is recommended to save some space in your brain for usefull stuff so you dont forget: phonenumbers/what year is it/which town am i in/do i really need food??? the list goes on and on....


-wanna see a live space battle while you chill out with a nice view on it? prepare to loose.

While you are not flying the ship the a.i. does everything.That said it's a blessing but more so a curse. : while ur in the system where the battle is taking place, your fleet will perform badly, because  the a.i. (i lovingly call them ai.ai.ai. )has more resources while you're out of the galaxy and it shows in the result of the battle. 

you are much better off to either fly the ship that's fighting, yourself, or do everything the RTS way but then be in another solar system, its called O.O.S. combat and sadly this is a thing. So if you want to do this in system , have ur own warf and be prepared to burn ships lol

a.i.  behaves poorly in pathing / maneuvering  while you watch them. 

*literally turning your character to a wall makes something go right that repeatedly went wrong* this is also a gameplay tip if your npc for example epicly fails at parking lol. things magically go right if you are not looking at them.

* Things magically go right if you are not looking at them. *

This could be a hidden subliminal message  from the developers to their egosoft management right?  :p  
(i wouldn't know just spit balling here lol, in r.l. this only works because u will never know how you were screwed over while you weren't paying attention)

 while ""anything"" in attention  needs to be rendered that ""something"" will not behave as good as when it doesn't need to be rendered there by freeing system resources that the process really needs.

To solve this tickle: create a wharf and sell ships to sworn enemies who fly out and instantly start killing each other in ships they bought from you, then loot and scrap em, rinse , repeat> profitsssssssss, amuuuuusssssementssssss......have your graphic eyecandy cake , and you can eat the cake (profit) too! Wharfs dont be cheap tho

-terraforming a bit too realistic, takes about as long as the real thing i guess , several hundred years lol ,(we dont have s.e.t.a. in real life tho, stil too long) its not real planet  its just a changing sky box and it takes a lot of materials for a very long time.
Don't do this if you don't have your sheep (or ships) on the dry yet

- this game costs a lot of time that you maybe don't have

- some unfortunate bugs here and there ,  remember to save your game before doing anything big

This game is a mixture of Elite, EVE, Star Citizen, but none of them.... 
You can do a lot here, but everything seems a little over complicated.
(It is not worth the full price for sure.) 
With the ""avoid collusion ON"" your ship is able and will go into any station's wall / structure. Missions are very hard to find at the beginning (especially what you will able to complete too.) ...some mission just never can be completed as they ""BUG out""....
Almost everything you'd like to do in this game you have to go to the Internet and search for it. Watch hours of ""secondhand"" Tutorials how to do things. (There are built in tutorials, but they are ""e"" and buggy too.)

OK, to be honest, for me, the learning curve is often the big part of the game. Discovering the world and the mechanics within is what I love ... simply exploring. To that extent, the UI adds to game play ... it is so complex that it is bewildering at times ... plenty to explore ... implying a complexity and a nuance that I hope is real! 
At the same time, it is also frustrating. Very Easy' marine delivery missions can only be completed by using a particularly obscure series of menus ... with no logical indication as to why you would even try this ... and seemingly no alternatives such as going to the station manager and saying 'I have those two marines you asked for'. Similarly, the map UI with text over text, key info missing ... it is a mess. More frustration, a disincentive towards playing/exploring/buying DLC.

Some features in my point of view:

Start your journey: I really liked that you start the game in underpants, which turns into a whole empire if you have a month and your nerves are made of steel

Build space stations and upgrade your ships: building the stations is a real pain in the ass, because the modules are built very slowly and a lot of parts have to be delivered to them. The station design interface is downright rubbish. Rotating the modules, for example, is nerve-wracking

Manage your empire with a powerful map: powerful map.. my ass! the map is a disaster! Overlapping windows which are always disturbing and the product search system works scandalously badly

Fly every ship: NOPE. XENON ships are not pilotable, so you can fly almost all of them. The L sized mining ships, for example, can be piloted, but you can't mine with them manually. Mining... You can mine manually with a medium mining ship, but you have to catch the scattered pieces of ore with the ship, which is as agile as a block of marble. I never thought that one day I would miss limpet drones :D (the limpet drone known from Elite: Dangerous is a collection drone with suicidal tendencies)

Missions: some of the missions are interesting, there are a couple of good stories, but basically they are annoying and give almost no reward

Mod support: the game can be modified very well, if you install 10-15 MODs, it will be relatively playable

A relatively easy-to-use UI would greatly improve the game, such as CCP's photon UI. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that CCP makes good games, because actually they keep messing up the logic of their games, but they perform very well in terms of UI and graphics.

All in all, the idea and the concept are very good, even brilliant, but unfortunately the implementation was not successful.
It can be seen that the flight simulator part was developed in the first round, which is completely fine, then the UI came in a hurry, which is neither user-friendly nor beautiful. So far, for example, I haven't been able to figure out how to tell a ship to automatically sell the goods produced by the station...

The game would have been a great opportunity, but unfortunately it turned out to be a missed opportunity or epic fail, you say.

as a final word: I recommend this game if you have very strong nerves and you like to micro manage things, and if you are a sci-fi fan. 
If not, throw it away",1672654777,1672654777,True,4,0,0.494166076183319092,0,True,False,False

After having game-breaking issues which I couldn't resolve (freezing, extremely low FPS, glitching, etc.) I tried playing this game again on the same exact laptop I had tried unsuccessfully before. NOW it works great! I still have absolutely no clue what the issue was before. Whatever... I works now so I can actually comment on the game itself.

It has a lot of similarities to Elite Dangerous (sans the MMO part), but unlike ED, you can hire NPC's to fly ships you own and  even buy/build your own stations. So instead of being just a lone pilot who can only work for others, X4 lets you build your own corporate or national empire, all while leaving you free to whatever floats your boat with a decent supply of missions you can do for the various factions. I really like the fact that even though it focuses on the ""empire building"", no is stopping you from hoping into the seat of a fighter or donning a spacesuit for an EVA. 

The spaceflight is fairly simple and typical of space combat games. It also has an auto-roll setting that some may find quite helpful with keeping their bearings. You also don't actually have to fly, you can just hire an NPC and ride shotgun while giving commands if you prefer.

Combat (piloting) is challenging and quite enjoyable IMHO. There's an adequate number of ships as well as build options and modifications, but I would prefer if there was a bit more depth to that. 

Combat (commanding) is very immersive and demanding. The AI so far has performed pretty dang well, though the fleet controls for NPC's can take a while to learn how to use proficiently. 

This game is really about whatever you make of it. While it may not be the flashiest in any one aspect, it is well rounded and moderately habit forming.     




 
***Original post:
Purchased this game with the available expansions and was super excited about it. After a few hours of play, mostly on pause figuring out the controls, the gameplay started running rough. Eventually bad enough to where I tried turning the graphics down. That helped... temporarily. Then the slow, stuttering, glitching, madness came back to where even with the graphics turned down to 1980's levels, still having issues. Tried getting help from the developer. WHAT A JOKE! I don't have endless hours to spend searching forums with irrelevant conversations and potentially inaccurate information to maybe, just MAYBE find some useful help. Since I crossed the 2 hour mark, I can't get a refund (paid $69+ tax). I really just wanted to play the game as it looked great and was of the type that really fit what I like.  My computer HAS NOT had any issues with any game, even recent releases at all until this. If you want to try this game, only get the base game and try it for a while BEFORE getting the expansions otherwise you'll be out that money too with no hope for a refund if it starts getting progressively glitchy on you.***",1586320494,1672632628,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Although this game has beautiful graphics and a superior game engine... it's simply not fun and doesn't manage to drag you into the game as previous iterations did. 

When X3 Reunion came out in 2005, I was amazed by the sheer size of that game, Ego moved away from the muppet design ships of X2 and X3TC was IMHO the best of the 'regular' X series. But then came X-Rebirth and what I believe is Egosoft's pinnacle achievement: X-Rebirth VR, which I find to be superior to X4. Yeah, I'm probably going to get a lot of flak from the X fanbois, but who gives a toss. 

Here are five reasons for my negative review:

- 1) X4's Ugly ship designs. 

The ship designs of X4 lack the realistic approach from X-Rebirth (except for the S and M classes made for the 'Tides Of Avarice' DLC). I understand that it is hard to reinvent new ships for every new game and I do respect the amount of work that has gone into the creation of them all. However, it is my opinion that X-Rebirth (who the majority of dedicated X fans seem to hate) did a much better job at creating believable (I am talking Expanse TV show-wise) modular designs. Even mods like Lost Sectors and Hershel's Gift with its Vacana addon ships even did a perfect job to retain the vanilla game look and feel by implementing new ships that fit the X rebirth lore and aesthetics. Of course this is just my personal preference and your mileage may vary.

2) NO VR support. 

Being a veteran VR player of Elite Dangerous, DCS, IL-2, Battlezone, House Of The Dying Sun for a couple of years this game simply does not accomplish the feeling of immersion or 'being there' that X-Rebirth VR does... Not even with a 55 inch screen. Some games you just don't play 'on screen' anymore, once you went full VR. It's like putting training wheels on your mountain bike and being forced to ride on flat tarmac, when you're used to getting your kick riding steep downhill muddy trails. X-Rebirth VR gives you an unparalleled immersion, 'On screen' is something for Jean Luc Picard and Star Trek.    

3) No dedicated cockpit. 

It is pretty logical that given all the ships available to pilot, the devs are not going to be able to create a fully fledged cockpit like the one we got for X-Rebirth's Skunk.  But the cockpits are about as 'fleshed out' as the ones we got to download as a mod for X3 reunion. That was somewhere in 2005. That was almost 20 years ago...

4) No Yisha.

Although she could be a pain in the ass sometimes, together with Bitchin' betty; the Skunk's COVAS (cockpit voice assistant); these cockpits or 'flight decks' feel desolate, even with the crew you can hire. They are robots at best, Yisha in comparison had a great personality.

5) No 'Blade Runner' atmospherics.

Some sectors (something no longer exists in X4) in X-Rebirth have this kind of 'Blade Runner' feel to it. The haze, the big factories, the smoke... even some ships. X-Rebirth can be a scary place, where you really see that corporations are in charge. X4 lacks that too.

That sums up why I want to like this game, but keep returning to my modified X-Rebirth VR edition. A game which would have been a much better contender to be 'restyled' by Egosoft, instead of trying to accommodate the old fanbase of X3 and reinventing the wheel again.",1672586980,1672590815,False,5,0,0.507948219776153564,0,True,False,False

I originally gave this game a thumbs down, although i still agree with my original review i warmed up to it after much frustration, forum diving and youtube guides.

Tips:
Do the tutorials, they are insufficient but essencial to begin.
Don't go youtube guiding just yet, select the first scenario and go (young pilot I think).
Be patient, stick to one ship and starting area and learn the controls, menus and the most basic ways to make money.
After you are ready to explore, buy new ships and have AI employees/pilots then start youtube guiding when doubts arise.",1672173810,1672549810,True,0,0,0.554431021213531494,0,True,False,False

The game is pretty jank. Graphics are a bit weird, UI is all over the place, AI can be a bit dense at times and save/ load times can take forever. On release it was literally unplayable- crashed constantly, bugs all over and just didn't run (Thats fixed now- although it can run pretty slow later on at times)

The pros:

Its fucking great. 

Dont expect a game like Elite, Star Citizen or NMS. Its more of an economy simulator. You start as a single pilot with no money and a crappy ship, and end up managing a whole empire. Its the most immersive game I've played and you get out what you put in. I love the game and keep coming back to it. The DLC is fantastic and adds tonnes. The universe is MASSIVE. Theres just so much to do.

It takes a while to get used to it and I really recommend watching some Lets Plays first, but despite all the jank, its really worth your time if you like this kinda game.",1543672500,1672522959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- I run through first tutorial - flying. Controlling ship was ok, controlling spacesuit was terrible. Navigation in general very poor. I had huge problems to see what I supposed to do, how and where. There were no proper indications on the screen. Even basic stuff like coming back to my ship after using spacesuit was very tricky, couldnt find a way in... Of course I could teleport back I guess.
- First mission: get captains for my ships. Had no clue what to do... what captains? where to get them? After some googling I found answers but game doesn't teach you that... mission text is just waste of space, it doesn't help with anything what mission is about.
- Then after that I had no clue what to do next, so I flew around in mining ship, gathered some ore and had no clue what to do with that ore. No one in a station wanted to buy it, I couldn't even store it anywhere so it was left in a cargo of my ship.... what to do with that? Have still no clue... 
- After watching couple YT videos I was told to look for a missions... Imagine that to get mission, no you do not walk around station talking to NPC's... no, instead you fly around station and look for some tiny, tiny sparkling things on the station walls....Seriously... how I supposed to know that? I read somewhere that I should use short range scanner and some bars will tell me how close I am to the mission... great... except bars do not show until you are already seeing the bloody sparkling things... 
- So, I found my mission finally... all it told me was to: sabotage, disable station turrets, quietly... So, I flu to the target turret and .... then what? No clue what I supposed to do... mission says nothing. I had to google again.... apparently somewhere in mission brief text says: destroy(because apparently another the same mission can be about hacking, but how I supposed to know that). that destroy word I found as a mission type and that suppose to tell me that I should destroy turrets... Because obviously mission text is not there to actually explain player what to do...
- So, because I was already outside of my ship in spacesuit(I expected to click on turrets, use something on them to disable them) I used whatever it was (have no clue), I think it was some sort of attack because suddenly station became hostile and started attacking me back, not really me in spacesuit but my ship which flew away... At that point after coming back to my ship whole station attacked me with many ships I had no chance to even fight against... That was first proper mission???? lol

In general, I think game could be good experience assuming someone wants to spend tons of time watching YT and googling stuff... 
Do I want to put effort like that into the game like this? No, I consider games as fun activity, also games should teach me how to progress thorough it. I am not really interested in chore of learning what I supposed to do and how, in a game which, with all due respect is not worth that kind of time commitment. I played games like EVE back in a days when it was real, proper game with very little tutorials and no YT to help, yet still I could find may way around it but I couldn't fine my way around X4...",1672499163,1672499163,False,32,4,0.631022810935974121,0,True,False,False

The flight controls are awful. Like... REALLY awful. See, unlike every other halfway decent space combat game out there there's no point to even trying to dodge since the AI has near-perfect accuracy and any decent ship has all the maneuverability of a pregnant yak.
The UI is rediculously complicated. Needlessly so. It takes around 20 hours just to figure out where everything is, and even then it's still easy to forget. By contrast, I spent thousand of hours playing EVE, a game of fabled complexity, and even that wasn't as awful as X4.
The AI pilots and autopilot routines are STAGGERINGLY bad. Watching a ""nimble"" fighter navigate around a single asteroid is just painful.
So Easy to glitch through objects and get stuck. It's like they never bug-checked it. 
Ship selection goes as follows: get in the biggest ship you can and avoid combat at all costs. In fact, combat tends to go better for you when you let the AI duke it out while you're in a different sector so everything isn't completely hobbled by the pitiful AI piloting. 
Avoiding ship combat (which is desirable given how terribly it's executed) is impossible if you want to, you know, do story missions. 
Lots of thought apparently went into the different fleet formations you can put together. Too bad the AI pilots are too stupid and unresponsive to perform ANY of them.
Escorts for your ship are completely useless. You spend all your time waiting around for them to catch up even if they're in faster ships. Same is true for drones, which take FOREVER to launch and recall, and even once launched they spend most of the time staring at you while enemies fill you with holes. 
The writing and voice acting are pathetic. 
Frankly, a lot of this can be boiled down to one simple truth: Egosoft bit off WAY more than they could chew. They tried to do too much and as a result they did almost none of it well. (I will say the graphics are quite nice and the music is decent, but that's the end of the list.)

Буквально, начинаете вы голожопым ободранцем, но постепенно, продвигаясь по различного рода халтуркам начинаете строить свои замки, выстраивать логистические цепочки по торговле пшеном или хлебом, покупаете прокачанных лошадей, прокачиваете наездников и так далее. Да, сравнение крайне грубое, но первые часов 15 именно такое ощущение преследовало меня во время игры. Если вам нужен маунт в космосе - вот, это оно, покупайте.

Но вся проблема начинается когда вы сталкиваетесь в этой игре с сюжетом. В Х4 самый нарративно сломанный сюжет, который я когда либо видел в современных играх. Вот представим ситуацию: (тут щас будут спойлеры) вы начали игру за кадета Террана (новичкам не рекомендую), и первый час игры у вас проходит как миссия из Колды: вы летаете, взрываете опасных врагов, проводите какие то диверсии, вас куда то внедряют, и вы такой думаете, мол, ого, сюжет то какой крутой, но на одной из миссий происходит ХРЕНАК, и вас на сюжетной силе таксипортирует за тридевять секторов, и первое задание, которое вы получаете после часа экшена это: построить стыковочный модуль к станции, которой вы только что завладели. И тут вы (и я) впадаете в ступор: как его строить, из чего? Почему он не строится? Почему не везут ресурсы? Вы ахреневаете и либо идете гуглить, либо выходите из игры и пишите негативный отзыв.

Сюжет игры не пытается погрузить вас в историю, он пытается поставить перед вами ТРУДНУЮ, абсолютно нелогичную с точки зрения повествования задачу, а вы должны найти к ней решение. Например, на одной из квестовых веток, спустя непродолжительные полеты туда-сюда в виде курьера, с вами связываются и говорят, мол, надо бы нам подорвать экономику одной фракции, построй-ка станцию, чтобы производила всякие товары, и продавай их себе в убыток, обрушившая цены в системе. Окей, да, мы уже научились строить ранее, но ЧЕРТ ВОЗЬМИ, ОТКУДА У МЕНЯ 10 МИЛЛИОНОВ В НАЧАЛЕ ИГРЫ, чтобы РУШИТЬ КОМУ ТО ЦЕНЫ? Игра поставила перед вами задачу, и у вас уйдет часов 5 на добычу денег, на менеджмент логистики и на всё вот это, чтобы станция наконец начала работать ВАМ В УБЫТОК. (Благо как только квест засчитывается вы можете выставить цены на нормальные и это ни на что, кроме вашего кошелька, не повлияет).

Но полный абсурд, это когда через пару миссий вам, полностью обедневшему от постройки станции скажут, мол, дружок-пирожок, тут есть один нехороший человек, летает на своем корабле, его бы надо сбить. Вы летите на точку и обнаруживаете там ОГРОМНЫЙ ЛИНКОР. Сбить такое дело ни на истребителе, ни на ганшипе у вас не получится - у него такие толстые щиты, что восстанавливаются быстрее, чем вы наносите им урон. И что вы должны сделать? Правильно! Полететь в магазин и купить там такой же корабль. ЗА 20 МИЛЛИОНОВ. А вот где вы их возьмете... Ну, наверное на станции заработаете, мы в егософт о таком не думали, лол) А пока вы будете зарабатывать 20 миллионов с вами постоянно будут связываться и говорить, мол, ЭЙ ОН ЖЕ СЕЙЧАС УЛЕТИТ, МЫ ЕГО ТЕРЯЕМ! За 3 часа гринда репутации и денег, чтобы купить достаточно мощный корабль лично у меня этот парень никуда не потерялся, и прилетев через 3 часа на новеньком разрушителе я все таки смог закончить квест.

А, ну и да: эта квестовая линия доступна для кадета Террана, как часть ДЛС, и прикол в том, что начиная за кадета террана вы в плохих отношениях практически со всеми фракциями в игре, и чтобы строить станции, что то покупать, или хотя бы приземлится на станции, на которых сидят важные квестовые НПС вам придется ГРИНДИТЬ РЕПУТАЦИЮ С ФРАКЦИЕЙ, а че бы и нет, ну реально? 

Ну и полный расколбас: квест за кадета Террана, в рамках которого вы летите с флотом вашей фракции уничтожать пиратскую базу. Ухх, как же я настрадался с ним.. Игра выдает в начале этого квеста крутой корабль, хоть не на своем лететь, спасибо, и говорит, что мы должны прикрывать командира флота, летящего на огромном дредноуте. Проблема в том, что нам предстоит пролететь через 4 вражеских системы, чтобы добраться до нужной станции. И вместо того, чтобы пролететь эти системы в режиме путешествия - этот полоумный командир флота будет останавливаться у КАЖДОЙ вражеской станции, чтобы ее уничтожить. У КАЖДОЙ. Проблема тут только одна: у каждой станции, примерно, по 15 миллионов ХП, и уничтожать каждую из них вы будете примерно 1.5 РЕАЛЬНЫХ ЧАСА ДОЛБЕЖКИ ТОЛЬКО В ОДНУ СТАНЦИЮ. А их у вас на пути будет ШТУК 6. Так что если вы вдруг имели глупость натыкать тех же вариантов в диалогах, что и я - просто летите на своем драндулете прямо сквозь врагов к этой пиратской станции и убивайте ее в соло. Поверье, это будет проще.

Сюжетец прям агонь, но тут вы еще учтите, что в игре около 10 разных ориджинов у персонажа, и у каждого из них разный мейн квест, так что имеется вероятность, что проходя игру за другого персонажа вы ничего подобного не встретите. Я, правда, на это не рассчитывал бы. 

Теперь про главную фичу игры: экономику. Да, экономика тут есть, она очень сложная и без гугла вам будет трудно что-то понять (учтите, что на русском языке гуглить практически бессмысленно (в целом играть на русском тоже не рекомендую, как минимум из-за качества русской озвучки, а как максимум из-за того, что перевод достаточно кривой)). Игра предлагает вам много инструментов по управлению своими флотилиями, которые могут добывать, строить, патрулировать ваши сектора, торговать или делать еще кучу всяких вещей. Примерно треть (если не половину) игры вы будете сидеть в карте, наблюдая за своими флотами. Казалось бы - сделайте управление кораблями на карте как в нормальной глобал РТС, типа стеллариса, но нет, управление отвратительное. Вам придется лазить в громоздких меню с тысячами параметров чтобы выбрать вид деятельности корабля и заставить его сдвинуться с места. Однако на часу 30-м эта гадость примелькается и проблем не будет.

Строительство станций это отдельный прикол: во первых, я не знаю, может это сюжетный спойлер, но чтобы поворачивать предметы в определенную сторону надо, вдумайтесь, ПОСТАВИТЬ ПРАВИЛЬНО КАМЕРУ В РЕДАКТОРЕ СТАНЦИИ. Посмотрите на деталь сверху - будет крутится горизонтально, сбоку - вертикально. Ууужас как не удобно. Еще учтите, что станции это не золотой грааль, и требуют они оочень больших вложений при не всегда высокой окупаемости. Вам придется купить чертежей для модулей миллионов за 20, потом потратить еще столько же на ресурсы для стройки, подождать РЕАЛЬНЫЙ ЧАС (ну а че вы хотели, строится все не быстро), внести пару милионов на счет станции, чтобы в итоге достать калькулятор и понять, что окупится ваша станция, с учетом производства, примерно через 30 часов игры. ВОТ ЭТО КЛАСС, говорите вы себе, и идете на нексусмодс скачивать мод, позволяющий продавать станции (по умолчанию так нельзя типа).

Уф, получается целая книга. Подводя итог: большая часть проблем в игре вызвана тем, что мы в нее неправильно играем. И станцию можно оптимизировать, и 10 лямов в начале игры это копейки, но как новичок вы обожжетесь о кучу трудностей, потратите на них десятки часов, и, наконец, разобравшись, получите кайф от того, насколько сильно вы возвысились над прошлым собой. Иных причин играть в эту игру я не вижу. Как космосим Х4 рассматривать не следует. Посадок на планеты нет, космос тут весьма условный и декоративный, визуал мультяшный и при этом достаточно скудный, а оптимизация при присутствии на экране более, чем 20 кораблей - это ужас. ФПС больше 30 вы не увидите, оно и понятно, игра задействует всего одно ядро процессора, и вычисления во ВСЕЙ ВСЕЛЕННОЙ происходят именно на одном бедном ядерке вашего процессора. И вам повезло, если у вас последний I9, но в иных случаях.. Уфф...

This is a dense, difficult, amazing, rewarding, sometimes intensely frustrating game. I like it quite a bit-your mileage may vary, and it may vary heavily. This game is about managing space empires from the first person. Or, fighting missions as a single ship. Whatever you want, really. 

Since you can read lots of reviews on what this game is like, I'll distill what might me ""counterpoints:""

-High system requirements. I'm not a gamer, and the game runs quite well on my laptop with a 1050Ti MaxQ (basically a slower version of the 1050Ti, and yes, that's possible). However, the laptop as 32gb of RAM and and SSD. This game simulates basically everything, and it will test parts of your system lots of other games do not. It is generally considered to be CPU bottlenecked instead of GPU.

-Poor AI. I read every ""fleet AI terrible/don't buy this game due to frustrating AI/don't give this company any money because they refuse to fix AI/etc"" review and bought it anyway. Fleet deployment is relatively complex, and AI pilots are semiautonomous; they make many of their own decisions unlike RTS-style pathfinding; it straddles the line between a game like Starcraft, where you give every order, and a game like Starlancer (2000), where you order your wingmen around. MOST (>80% or so) of the problems with the AI are not knowing how to strategically utilize the complex ship order system. This being said, I do have a couple of AI mods installed, and sometimes it just seems bizarre (why aren't you shooting at that capital ship I ordered you to? It's RIGHT THERE!). 

Really, the game has so much complexity, content, etc it really boggles the mind. Elite Dangerous doesn't do most of what this game does despite having a much larger dev team. Much of the issues stem from the fact that I feel they painted themselves into a corner with ambition and features. The game has some jankiness-It definitely feels like it was designed by a small number of neuroatypical super-genius programmers who may not percieve how the average gamer thinks.

Good game. Good hobby at that. But know what you are getting into.

[i]Will try and edit this at somepoint but main thing is game is on sale for Steam Winter sale and it's hands down my favorite space simulator, probably even space game ever and deserves your attention if you are a fan of these type of games.[/i]

[b]It's got everything you can ask for. Great visuals, outstanding space soundscape & OST, tons of ships, tons of unique factions, deep engrossing lore and epic replay value.[/b] Best way I can describe it is if you took a game like Elite Dangerous and combined it with a 4X game like Stellaris, this would be that game. It has all the juicy ""eye candy"" spaceship action while at the same time the depth and scale of a grand strategy game or I guess, simply ""brain candy"" ha. You can build your own massive shipyards, trading complexes and various production factories designed down to the smallest details. I must say there's something truly magical to design your own station from the ground up then after it completes, dock at it and just admire the view. 

[b]It's truly unlike any game you'll ever play, I promise you.[/b] 

You can play the game in first person, 3rd person or via the overworld map, clicking on your controlled AI to bark out orders. The learning curve is steep though! I am not going to sugar coat this. It's not a game you'll be able to sit down and in an hour be a space god. It's going to take you many, many hours and even after hundreds, you'll still be learning. You'll probably think things are busted or the UI is too complex at times. We all did starting out. It's completely normal. Frustration is normal. But if you stick with it, congrats! You'll be enjoying literally the greatest spaceship game on the planet. [i]Once you get past the learning pains, my goodness, it's pure bliss.[/i]

Which reminds me. [i]Everything in the game matters to some degree and [b]nothing in X4 is filler.[/b][/i]

You look at large openworld games like Cyberpunk 2077 or most other big name RPG's that have a ton of stuff going on in the background. They look great sure. It adds immersion seeing all the AI NPC's coming and going, mindlessly doing whatever. But they mean nothing at the end of the day. Just smoke and mirrors. You can murder the NPCs in those games. Blow up cars or buildings but it doesn't effect the game world. In X4 everything has a purpose and is meaningful. You start blowing up trade ships or stations and it sends ripples throughout the entire universe that is felt. Everything you do impacts the game world, down to smallest details like mining ore or selling trade goods. It's all connected. 

It's another reason I love this game so much. Out of all the games I've ever played, including the 550+ games on Steam I own, none of them feels ""alive"" as much as this game does. It doesn't just stop with the ships either, even all the human/alien NPC's you'll find have a purpose and can offer you something, whether to be hired as pilots, captains, marines, or to trade with or find new opportunities and missions. You don't see the worthless NPC's like children running or hobo's asking for change that while might look nice, don't add anything to the actual gameplay. Everything has a purpose that you'll come across in X4 and everything you do in X4 has a meaning. 

It's getting late but I really did want to give this game a solid thumbs up since it's on sale because devs deserve it. It's still being worked on, in fact a new DLC is on the horizon and that reminds me, the DLC's in this game are GOOD. Worth every penny. Each DLC comes with new starts, new ships, new sectors, new missions and my personal favorite.. new music! Highly recommend them and the game. There's also 1000's of mods on Steam and Nexus if you want to spice it up once you get bored with vanilla (I recommend to wait on mods until you master basegame myself). 

My only hope is we get a stock market added in at some point and maybe some more customization options in terms of paint jobs and extra rooms for our living quarters/ships (but mods fix this). Otherwise I couldn't be happier and can't wait to see what the future holds. Considering this is FOUNDATIONs.. they are off to a damn good start for the X series! It's only going to get bigger and better from here. 

[h1]Highly Recommend for fans of space games, 4X/strategy games or just like games that offer near infinite replay value where limitations to how you want to play are only held back by your own creative imagination. It's without a doubt the best space sandbox game available and is worth every penny[/h1]",1671780309,1672123875,True,34,0,0.705849885940551758,0,True,False,False

However, for the first tutorial...there is no ""complete""
For the second tutorial, google/reddit helped me to have this completed.

My main problem with this game is the lack of usefull feedback-to-player.
I.e. : Went to a station...bought this landing MKII autopilot at the ship-dealer.
I have had no confirmation that the deal was successfull and how to get this thing into my ship.
The only feedback I figured out was, the money was gone...so deal might be successfull.

Went back to the ship, no MK2 there...but money still gone.
Went into the seat of the ship and checked the ship stats again.
Out of a sudden, II see an ""ETA until upgrade done"".
Ok..so let's wait...it took about 3 seconds to complete, but I have to confirm the upgrade.
However, If I will confirm, the money will be gone AGAIN. 
So I would end up with -20000 Credits.

This and the bad tutorials (reading story and hints at the same time, while pressing buttons..) was enough to hit just ALT+F4.

I am not willing to watch hours of YT-tutorials just for the basics.
The game/UI has to teach a new player the very basics in a sensefull way.

But in this game both: the UI and the tutorials are not helpfull in any way.

On top of that, it seems to be very buggy:
I my short playtime I encountered two game-braking bugs:
1. Stuck in the station elevator (needed to reload a previous save-game)
2. out of a sudden, not able to interact with any station-terminal (needed to reload a save-game here , too)

EDIT: (after some more playtime)

Ok, I will give this a thumbs-up for now.

The reasons:

-the atmosphere got me hooked in, nice settings no lolly-pop NMS-style
-the many small details like the factory animations and the lore-texts (ok...voice acting is b-movie style...but it's ok)
-native Linux support is a big plus
-strong nice helpfull community, who helped me to get things going

Because of all that points, I think it might be unfair to leave my review as ""negative"".
However, the develpers should more involve non-X-players for testing to make esp. the very beginning more human-friendly.

Performance should be more optimized as mentioned by many others before.
I.e. why not dedicate a working-thread to male a save-game-snaphot in the backround instead of halting the main-thread for many seconds until the save has been finished and archived ?
Should not be too complicated....

What I have learned so far, how to best deal with this game to avoid frustrations:
-take it slowly, nearly all missions and can be started/paused/continued as you like
-save often (F5)...even if it takes time...esp before trying the so called ""very easy"" missions....
-don't focus on just one goal..again...take your time and do something else..ignore YT-easy-money-guides

The game claims to be a sandbox, and I belive they def. reached this goal much more than other so called sandbox-titles.

So much so, over 600 hours later [i]I'm still on my very first play-through[/i] of X4: Foundations. It won't be my last.

[hr][/hr]

Make no mistake about it, it's been a tough climb - especially for someone like me, who has never played any of the previous X games. There is just [i]so much[/i] to do in this game, so many different ways you can play / things you can pursue, that it makes for a very steep learning curve. Add to this a deep and intricate UI, simply because there [i]are[/i] so many wide and varied options in the game, and it can definitely be an uphill struggle...

But it's well worth the climb, and the view is absolutely gorgeous! (Even on a mid-range build like mine.)

In the beginning, there's just you, your tiny ship (though starting options are varied and configurable), a small pot of cash, and a whole big universe to explore and exploit. You're an insignificant drop in a staggeringly huge wide ocean of possibilities, but even total galactic domination is not - ultimately - beyond your grasp... Darth Vader, eat your heart out.

This universe has it all. Intrigue, politics, competing factions at each other's throats - at least economically, if not also militarily - and a whole plethora of dubious characters with whom you can interact to pursue your own ambitions while pretending to help them with theirs... Thrown into this heady mix is a species of killer machines hell-bent on galactic genocide, and a right royal pain in everyone's butt - including your own, for quite a while... Great loot from their ships, though! ;)

Pirate, smuggler, assassin, humble trader, aspiring Merchant Prince, wannabe Darth Vader... the decision is yours. As is the sheer [i]fun[/i] of it all.

The only thing I've really missed so far? An option to romance and canoodle with that cutie trader I discovered on a remote outpost at the back end of nowhere... Yeah, I'm sad. Oh, well, guess I'll have to settle for galactic domination and just play [i]The Witcher 3[/i] again at some point!

     life sucks, that's why i want either the Egosoft team or a modder(but i doubt a modder[in this community] will put the time in) to implement ""survival"" and other RP mechanics as an option. 
     I really want to feel Fully immersed in this world. You know, to distract me from REAL reality(i write this with full understanding of the irony[but the Sims & ""reality shows"" are successful for a reason]). Some how X:Rebirth got me closer to feeling immersed than this rendition (X:rebirth being the only title in this series ive played besides x4)

    Also, for some reason, X:rebirth felt more fleshed out. 

    Ok, let me tell you what i love about this title. I love EVERYTHING except the character models, the lack of immersion in the announcements in the stations, the low amount of NPCs in the stations(especially the bar; an actual bartender would be great), the immersion breaking ""attitude"" NPCs have on player owned stations. etc.  

   My point is, id rather see a focus on Immersion than another DLC; focused on new skins and some quests(though the Boran skins look sick AF; Ill def buy that when its available) 

I Fell in love with X via X:rebirth, I appreciate the changes and how open it is now. However, i cant recommend X4 over X:rebirth until the ""universe"" feels more ""alive"". 

I understand that this requests would put more of a strain on some users computers; this is why id gladly take such improvements in the form of DLC(though, preferably 1 DLC and not how EA or Paradox greedily/nihilistic-ily  does it)

I say such critiques from a standpoint of pure love. I really, honestly, want to see this game absolutely(and this company) become insanely successful. It has the potential to humbly put ALL of the space simulators(even Star Citizen) to shame

When it happened again not an hour later, I had already forgotten how!  I finally stopped playing after my map (which I hated using, btw) stopped working without explanation.

All this game ended up doing was make me nostalgic for X3 AP, so I started playing that again.

Edit:  I spent another 200+ hours in the game.  With Out of Game resources, I was able to figure out how to do things. (like assign a mining ship to mining)  I have a few station complexes built with a decent passive income generation, and my own wharf/shipyard to make whatever ships I want.  After dedicating almost 2 weeks to learning the interface, I WAS able to enjoy this game.  Note that there are still many things I don't know how to do...  Things that were simple in X3, like fleet management.  I never bothered to try to figure it out because I would just leapfrog between my Raptor and Asgard to wipe out enemy fighters and capitals, respectively.  From what I do know of fleet management, the AI is a joke compared to X3.  

Eventual enjoyment aside, I would still not recommend this game.  This is literally the LEAST intuitive game I have ever played.  You CAN NOT learn how to do some very basic mechanics unless you look it up out of game.  I've never had that problem with X3.  I could not, in good faith, recommend this game to a friend.  They would ask what they did to deserve such punishment.  I would suffer such a thing only if there were multiplayer options.  

Bad AI, Terrible UI, INSANE save/load times, (coupled with ridiculously unnecessary game loops like trying to unlock loot boxes!) and no multiplayer.  Also not a fan of the puzzles and mazes you have to navigate in your spacesuit.  You know how many times I had clipped into a wall and got stuck?

It was a bit intimidating for me at first as I don't have a lot of previous experience with the genre.  Some of the AI is pretty jank.  It would be nice if autotrade, automine, etc worked from a little further out when you're learning things and have low level crew so you can get some basic economy moving without manually setting up routines.

The ability to create space stations is awesome.  Sure, you can only visit whatever standard areas you built in them, but the production capabilities and trade opportunities that result go a long way and get you moving towards creating an empire.

It's nice that there are a few quests to lead you into the world for newer players.  They were a bit buggy when I played though  Sometimes missions progress in a manner that you are entirely unprepared for difficulty wise, and you need to be cognizant of that.

Flying ships feels good.  There's a ton of variety, and it's great that you can fly any ship you own.  I don't find that fleets are very intuitive, or that they even work that well at all.  However, it's a good organizational tool if nothing else. Carrier fleets are somewhat difficult to manage at times, and I believe that the repair orders/menus could be streamlined a bit.  A repair all docked ships option would be amazing.

With all that said, I would certainly recommend it.  It's not for everyone, but there are plenty of people out there that I think would really enjoy the management aspect of the game.  As you continue to expand in the game, there are numerous things to keep on top of.  You might be at war and needing to manage a front line.  You might also be wanting to build another station to produce goods that are just not readily available in the global market.  Maybe you're working on research to give yourself a distinct advantage.  Perhaps claiming sectors for yourself and setting up a base of operations. You'll be able to do all of that and more.

1) Their  name was on the station was a acronym, not the name, you have to figure that out on your own, its not stated at all in the mission info.

Most of the time, you're just managing your AI workers so that they can make money for you. Then when you have set up your workers, you have to wait for the money to accumulate. Then when you have enough money, you can now buy the ship/fleet that you want and go do the actually fun part of the game which is dogfighting, base sieging, wars and so on. 

If you're like me, you like huge epic battles with multiple capital ships, fighters, frigates and so on. And to be fair to the game, it does give you that ability and it's awesome. But guess what happens after the dust has settled after the battle, after many ships have been lost and destroyed? That's right, back into the economy game where you have to do more managing and waiting so that you could rebuild your fleet.

I still recommend this game because it is legitimate sandbox and the economy is interesting. The Star Wars mod is also one of the best Star Wars experiences out there.

The learning curve here is ridiculous but much of that is due to the poor controls in many of the interfaces.  Gameplay itself is disappointing.  It feels like many parts of the game that should have logical coding behind them, use some sort of randomization code instead.  As an example in my current game you can't buy advanced electronics anywhere (and I have a lot of stations discovered and tracked with satellites) so I think ""maybe that means the electronics factories are short on a critical supply"" since the game claims to track production chain issues and with good coding I would expect to find a bottleneck or choke-point in the production chain.  But no, I check multiple production facilities and none of them are trying to purchase the materials needed to manufacture this item.  It seems that the ""randomization"" they tout as a plus in that every game is unique, doesn't actually have any logical components to it and is instead used to fill gaps where intelligent coding should be.

Currently, I can't make a single medium sized fighter with a decent load out because components aren't available and I see no way to trade anywhere in the supply chain to address this issue.   I guess I could plod along very slowing until I can build a factory that makes this resource.  Then as the only one in the galaxy producing this, I should make a fortune LOL.  But that's so dumb that it's beyond frustrating.

If there weren't a bunch of upgrades for sale, I might think that the devs just haven't had time to address this yet.  But with all the expansions they have made it's clear that they are ok with how poorly this game actually plays, as long as it sells.  

Maybe I am missing something, maybe someone else will say ""oh this is how you fix supply chain shortages""
I don't have enough time playing to claim to understand nearly enough of the mechanics, but that's my other complaint.  I have logged a fair amount of hours so If I don't know enough by now, one would think that perhaps the tutorials and on-line help (again the bits that don't earn $$$) need to be fixed.

I am genuine happy to have discovered this undercovered game. It is exactly what I was looking for and I think there is nothing like this game out there. This is a first person RTS game. Do not compare it to any other game because this I would say is a perfect convination between stellaris|DW2 and nomansky|starcitizen. 

It is impressive I have to say how the world is so reactive to the player in a very organic way, not player against focus. I do feel to be in the middle of this universe instead of being in a universe put there for me. 
Way ahead of its time IMO which is only unnoticed because of slightly dated graphics. This is a game I would recommend for RTS players and people who is looking for an MMO who actually cant | doesnt want invest time in it. You play your style, your speed.

I dont feel any kind of boring grind. No microtransactions. High mod support. 

Another point: This game is developed by a small team who develops exclusively this game. And I do feel that comitment in the patches and QoL improvements they include regularly apparently. 

Fly a fighter, command a fleet, design your ships with the guns you feel better for the task, create an economy, do pirate things (top top top), explore and find treasures...(or not xD), design stations and exterminate the Xenon!!

I find the different starting positions to help a lot to discover new playstyles. This determines your first couple of hours but later on you can do whatever you want. Is not like you choose a ""class"" or ""talents"" and are commited | restricted to it.

If you buy it, my tip: You need to assume your first gameplay is for learning. I am 80+ hours in game and I would say I got 70% of the basics. You need to play it googling at first. Then you will see your self doing everything closed eyes I promisse.",1670971200,1670971200,True,1,1,0.515069425106048584,0,True,False,False

You can do it all in this game. The graphics leave some room for improvement, but the gameplay, battles, and station design, really make the game a lot of fun.

Eventually, you'll reach a point where the AI will outright attack you CONSTANTLY. You need to blow up their base, and they will build back, rinse and repeat. This is REALLY annoying and has really stopped me playing anymore. I just began my all out take over in the sector, but now, EVERY ship is COVERED by 10 enemies. Day in and day out. Its more annoying than anything else. Destory their base, and you might have 2 hours of peace. Than, its like they never left. TOTALLY annoying. I wish there was a MOD to remove the KHK because it is ruining my otherwise really fun gaming experience. I'd give this a 7/10. But it could be MUCH higher if the AI wasn't so gung ho with ships made from glass. If you were the enemey, would you build MASSIVE fleets of the worst fleets and just SWARM the enemy? Its really the worst.

Oh and so you can setup your ships for automation, expect NOTHING works. ALL of the automation is broken. Yes local autotrade and local automine do work. Thats it. Build yourself a massive network of stations and now are tried of clicking 100 clicks to move your product around? Autotrade will make you throw this game into the trash.

The goodies - You fly in space.  With a press of a button you can fly in the traditional vector driven method or fly with assist on and go back to the days of X-Wing.  Once you understand the menu's you can command ships and stations to do your bidding as a space CEO.  There are plenty of missions and storytelling to keep you engaged.

Flying   The lint - Everyone has aim assist and it's a kill them before they kill you dps race.  The menu's are not intuitive and the UI gets cluttered very easily.  Your selected ship's information will constantly show on the map screen and will frequently cover other valuable information text boxes.  The payout for some missions is so low that you only want the reputation or a brief burst of ship shooting activity.  

The reality - This game is a sandbox of sorts.  You can do what you want, sure.  But what do you want?  In a sense, this game is also a idle game.  You'll grind a few missions, explore the galaxy a little while finding a few treasures here and there.  That will get you the starting capital to buy a few small miners that will then start printing 50 thousand credits every 10 minutes.  Buy a scout ship to explore and place satellites.  Get a medium trader to learn how to trade and then start printing more credits.  Get you about 10 medium miner ships and leave the game running over night.  You'll have 50 million in credits that can easily fund whatever you want.  Then you build stations and start printing more credits and can engage in fleet combat.  A few other reviews and forum posts have mentioned that the AI starts to breakdown at that stage.  I'm not there but I'm working on it to see for myself.  

But that's it.  That's the game.  Are there any others like it?  Maybe the other Egosoft games.  I like this one for right now.  Plenty of thinking required to learn the system, maximize the output and dream of a reality where I too could fly a spaceship and leave Earth behind.  

If you are going to buy the game, either be prepared to spend a few hours learning the menu's, watch a video or two, or just pass on the game.  If you invest effort, this is a great game.  If you won't take the time to learn, it's going to be a struggle.

SUMMARY: X4 is an ambitious spaceflight/empire management sim. It's a bit too ambitious at times, as it bites off more than it can handle. This can be a very fun game with a rather steep learning curve.

THE GOOD: This is the only game I know of where you can go from walking around inside of your ships to managing an empire of hundreds of stations and fleets of thousands of ships, all controllable by you. It's like Elite: Dangerous and EVE had an offline-mode child. It feels awesome to command fleets that you have built and wage war on your enemies.

THE BAD: This is not an easy game to learn. The controls can be baffling at times. Managing your empire requires you to wrestle with obtuse game mechanics and micro-manage a dizzying array of things that should be handled by the game. The AI pilots can be really dumb sometimes.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MODS: After playing for about 10 hours I realized that this game can be an extreme grind. Some people love that. I don't mind some grind, but I want some progression. Mods can make some things much more accessible and you can tailor things to your liking.

FLIGHT SIM TO EMPIRE SIM: As time progresses you'll spend less time in the cockpit and more time managing your stations and fleets. This is where you'll start to look up video references to figure whether you should set a fleet on ""follow,"" ""defend,"" ""intercept,"" or ""mimic,"" for example.

THINGS TO IMPROVE: The developers could really improve the empire management area of things. The UI could use more intuitive icons and better explanations of what things do. Trading is a huge part of the game yet trade stations and player-owned traders behave in baffling ways at times. If I want one of my stations to supply another station, I either have to manually set up a repeating trade loop or navigate a byzantine web of options. Oh yeah, your stations also need some amount of money or else they won't operate properly even if you're only processing your own goods!",1668648186,1670401347,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I may only have ~24 hours in the game here on steam, but that's only because I also own a physical copy which I played for ~250 hours.

I was raiding a SCA -pirate - Behemoth Destroyer that had just a crew of eight!  For my attack on it inside Teladi sectors, I was reported - and lost reputation - by Ministry Of Finance (MIN), the Teladis' self proclaimed ""Teladi protectors of business  interests""! Although the Teladi itself rejected their report!!! 
   I was at stage 2 of the boarding (when all your marines are on the ship preparing to breach it) when a MIN RESUPPLY ship started attacking the very ship I was reported for attacking - lol- killing all my boarding pods! A resupply ship attacked a Destroyer. A badly damaged by me Destroyer, which had no weapons to fight back!  During this stage, and before going to 3rd and final stage - the capture - the resupply ship managed to kill the Destroyer I was after, killing all my marines too! And when the Behemoth exploded I got a report that the ship was captured! DEAD! 
In short, a resupply ship, during one stage of the boarding procedure, was able to kill a Destroyer, which had no working armament, only fully charged shields, since I only took out its weapons so my marines could safely approach and board the Destroyer! And it did it during a boarding attempt at stage 2, with just 8 crew to defend! For the love of God, how STUPID can this be? It's QUICKER to destroy a Destoyer than board it!!!
Egosoft, should really FIX boarding, shorten the time needed to capture, especially when the defenders are vastly outnumbered by the attackers, like 7 to 1. Egosoft should not limit your maximum attack strength (your attacking marines). Also the messages you hear by your marines do not go along with the boarding processes! For example there might be just a couple of defenders left alive and you hear  the ""stiff resistance""  and ""falling back"" messages, etc. 
Sometimes it gets more than stupid, it gets hilarious!!!
One last thing I want to point out in the AI, is that defending races to Xenon attacks, do NOT respond to them, loosing stations and sectors one after another, while their Destroyers are patrolling distant sectors of their empire, without rushing to defend!

Starting off as a single nobody with nothing more than a ship and a tutorial on how to fly it (which I sucked at) I quickly found myself investigating the whole system. Avoiding fights because I knew I was weak, I felt honest fear when you hear an alert go off. Fast forward to the management phase of the game and I was hooked. I could choose to take an entirely RTS approach or hop in a ship and directly command a unit and fight on the front lines. 

Fantastic work, fantastic game. Perfect 5/7.

Because my T.Flight One was not connecting and when it did the mouse cursor in the menu would go off to the right corner top... Took me two days to figure this out barely to then get in and be more UNenthused... If you dont believe me look up X4 HOTAS bind issues... Id say 4.5hrs out of my 7 was on the net trying to fix the game and downloading drivers.... After all that i barely manged to fix all that it took all the fun out of it for me...to go through all that frustration...

As side from that mess. Its got a Star Wars the Old Republic Type of MMO Vibe but its single player which is interesting... Not bad tho but Someone who Comes from Games like Avorion, Space Engineers and Empryion... Id take Avorion over this simply because you have more deeper creative opportunity and freedom... The only difference between avorion and X4 is the FP Walk around the station action but in my mind if there is no Combat really on Foot (i think there is but lost motivation to get to that distant point) why have the feature? I Have a Battlefield/ Battefront like mindset where its be cool to create a fully Custom fleet with fighters and Have a epic Space Battle or a planetary Raid of ships taking over stations and villages. and while all that going on be in a FPS battle in the hangar or bridge of the enemy ship and Heck have you a scene like ROTS where the invisible hand Falls from Space and STILL in a fight while crash landing on the planet lol.. (Game has no Planets other than as backgrounds BTW)
Anyways enough of my ideas lol (defiently possible in Empryion and Space Engineers)

However dont let my words sway just trying to describe where i come from and what im used too. It probably is fun for a lot of folks but to waste 2 days on just getting controls to work is a red flag to me and i lost interest QUICKLY. Try it out and see how you like it.

Figuring they'd kick me out for entering a ship that wasn't mine, I wandered on board and struck up a conversation with the captain.  He said, ""Hello,"" offered me some directions, closed the door with me in the cabin(!), undocked and headed for open space!  Was he going for a quick lap around the station?  No. He was part of a patrol squadron and his sector was two jumpgates and two superhighways away, with me stuck in the cockpit pleading for him to take me back.

First and foremost the UI redesign and map are... just awful. I think X3s was far easier to understand and read and could have simply been polished up to greater effect. The game seems to have a lot of bugs at launch, though I know this is typical of an X release and given time they will be mostly smashed and the game will be better, however at launch i have already unintentionally no-clipped inside the Argon Equipment dock....just trying to dock , which docking is somehow worse than its ever been. Maybe it was just something I was doing wrong but it seemed needlessly complicated.

 As far as what to do well...you are just thrown into the world without even a hint as to what you CAN do, nothing saying...hey if you want quests go here or anything, the 10k creds you start with seem to be pointless as the Eq dock doesn't seem to be able to take any orders oddly enough, so you are stuck with a really awful burst fire laser that takes centuries to kill the incredibly stupid AI fighters in the surrounding area. The AI on those are just beyond potato, they literally spin in circles and spend more time maneuvering than bothering to fire, even when you are stationary...which leads to a boring fight where you stand still and just hold your mouse over them waiting for the slow burst fire gun to eventually destroy them. 

The station seems well modeled and everything but far too vast to be useful for anything game-play wise. It just feels super empty, even with the dopey looking NPCs running around ( and running into everything ) The animations and models of the npcs are just hideous and I honestly think the game would have been better without them or the station interiors at all really. The seamless ship to station transition is very cool, the ship models are extremely well done, the upgrade system seems very crude looking to put it kindly, and the upgrades don't really make themselves apparent and while its likely I missed out on a button or something , there didn't seem to be any flavor text or descriptions like X3 had. Rather, there seems to be a lot of QoL things that X3 had that X4 bypassed. Things like Scan mode are  just silly and i don't think it should be something you toggle on/off like you would travel mode.

 Some people mention the game doesn't run well, I didn't have any real issues in my short run with performance aside from when my ship noclipped underground within the Equipment Dock while trying to dock where things got really nasty and i was unable to free my ship ( and where I decided I was done with my play ) Anyways I think I've droned on enough, just wanted to provide some insight to those coming in that haven't purchased the game yet of my experience. I will be refunding this game and waiting until the fixes i mentioned prior drop. 

TLDR  : Game has various issues , and poor design choices that I personally don't care for. I would recommend waiting a while to pick this one up, if you are on a short budget and or you have some other games on your radar currently.

Update / Edit - 2022 

I made another attempt and within an hour of playing I already no clipped through a station, witnessed incredibly goofy levels of AI ships pathing around stations , the npcs are still unity asset levels of awful , the games performance is still very bad and numerous other things I noticed that still had not been very different or fixed from my initial play. I think sticking with X3 LU might be the way at this point. Also, hire a freaking UI artist , how can you be in business for over 20 years and still have UI this bad. Its not 2005 anymore. In order to enjoy this game you have to be high on loads of copium to get over its flaws or possibly just a new player who has no idea how much better some of the previous games were in the past. I am sure there are things that had been fixed over the years but the most mind numbing thing here is the amount of DLC expansions despite the game still being in its current state. While its not quite the X-Series experience, I would say that if you are looking for a successor and burned out on previous X games, Give Avorion a whirl. 

-Note to other reviewers- 

Do you not see the irony in leaving a postive review for something that you also did not play very long? The difference however is that you are doing it to spite real reviews pointing out flaws in the game instead of genuinely talking about the game and why you feel its deserving of a positive review. 

Jabs aside, the reason for these 1-2 hour reviews is pretty obvious, this is a near full priced game, its nearly December and we have a lot of big releases coming out, nobody wants to keep a near full price game that is buggy and clunky at launch when they could use the same money for a more polished and playable experience.

2018 review:
First time ever playing the X series. Always wanted to try it. Now seemed like a good time. As a oldschool fan of the freelancer gameplay this seems like down my alley.

First off, this is just based on a few hours of playtime. Most of which is simply trying to learn and google stuff, so if your a HC x-series fan.. this review isn't for you.

Performance wise the game is pretty okay, not any lag at all and decent graphics. I've seen better but then again, this isnt the frostbite engine. I see similar review complaining about crashes. I've had none. (1070, i7-7700, 16gb memory).
Gameplay wise its pretty easy to get the grips of controls and such, hotkeys are the biggest problem, learning them. Realising your ship will actually travel much faster in travel mode (shift +1) rather than in any of the other modes. Seriously this was ""new game"" moment for me, when I realized I was 28 000KM away from tutorial waypoint and the counter went down with 1km each half a minute. Still got no idea how I traveled so far so fast. 

Tutorials are not the best, they are basicaly text boxes showing up. Easy to miss, and if you miss it, chances are you'll have to start it over. 
As for story and such, there isnt any (that I have seen), its virtually a sandbox experience. Poke arround, learn to scan and navigate (dont enter anomalies that turns out to be wormholes), fly arroun, do a mission here and there.. get some cash.. get bigger ship and so on. 
The control of the ship so far has been pretty easy to master (arcade maybe if you wish), not that hard to dock and very easy to undock. 

I enjoyed it, and will probably continue to enjoy it. But I dont know how long I will be entertained. Hopefully i'll end up discovering more of the rabbit hole.",1543606984,1669311468,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is pretty demanding on your CPU, but it feels worth it when you get the upgrade to your pc and can witness the large scale battles.

Thats where I get to my biggest issue with X4. Large scale combat... It does not work! You can ofcourse have massive XL ship fights with fighter squadrons, just don't have any allies around. Otherwise, if one of your turrets hit that allied ship it will turn into chaos! I make a massive fleet with fighters, carriers and battleships. This is what I have been saving my money for!

My fleet moves to attack the xenon, but it all crumbles as I am now at a Free for all against the Argon, Hatikvah and Xenon ships.

Which should increase the ""threshold"" needed for the AI to react from your turrest hitting them. 2nd is Apologies for attack, it worked fine at the start, but if it has gone far enough.

I'm a rare player who came from the original series, but still liked Rebirth due to the major improvements in boarding mechanics, capital ship fights and drones. So it was REALLY WEIRD that Rebirth felt like a reboot then this game felt like ANOTHER reboot. 

For instance the ships all feel samey because now they need a loading platform for the transitions. So the design starts with a giant cube and then build around that. But this is a BAD trade-off since cool space ships are the core of a space ship game! And it's even worse there's less variety of ships due to them cutting out entire races like the Boron because ... drum roll please ... they couldn't find a satisfactory way for the boron race to work with seamless transitions due to them being an aquatic race. This is what I mean by sacrificing core gameplay. The very identity of the series was compromised to achieve a really cool, but ultimately unnecessary technical goal.

- There is a need to watch quite a few videos and read a fair few forum / redit posts.

I want to love this game, I really do. But even as a series veteran, this instalment is incredibly obtuse in terms of game systems and mechanics. The tutorials are woefully inadequate and don't really explain anything in any real detail. The basic tutorial will run you through the absolute basics, but everything else is more a demonstration of what you might do later, in-game. But it doesn't explain HOW to do any of those things.

Missions in particular are also poorly signposted, or even explained.

I started in the Terran Cadet start, completed the intro mission and prodeced to pick up a ""find the informer"" mission. Very little mission detail was provided, I was given a way point and told to find the ""ship"" No details, no description of what ship or what affiliation it might have, that might help me identify the ship in question. There are ships shooting by all over the place. Before I have time to scan even one ship, less than a minute into the mission, I'm told I've failed the mission as I took too long to find the suspect ship?? Urm. Okay?

I then go a pick up a patrol mission for the asteroid belt. I'm given a vague area to patrol and ... fly about for a painful 10 minutes of complete inactivity and I get paid 90,000 Cr? I grab a couple of basic upgrades for my ship and decide to proceed with the main storyline and familiarise myself with the game some more.

I'm told I'll be escorting a ship. I have to dock at a local station (which I proceed to do) as I approach the station, an incoming communication explains the upcoming mission in scant detail. As I'm coming into dock... all squadrons are told to launch...? So I cancel my docking and I see the ship I'm supposed to be escorting. I've barely left the station and the escort ship takes off into travel mode and disappears into a jump gate... I hustle to follow as quickly as possible only to come out of the jump gate on the other side and... I get dogpiled by a bunch of ships and nixxed. Sigh.

So many of the games systems are convoluted, difficult to fathom and straight up poorly presented in a messy UI, that dealing with bad scripting and terrible mission feedback and information, just doesn't endear me to try giving this installment any more of my time.

Edit: Fleet combat and interactions can really break your brain/spirit/keyboard/mouse. its just so awful; You set a formation, and they go into this formation for that instant, look at it again in 2 minutes and the faster ships are miles ahead. if you tell them to attack they disregard the formation alltoghether and just rush completely disregarding range of weapons etc.
the kicker is that a battleship will stay outside ITS OWN weapon range until all its subordinates is dead or close to it,then move in to die or win, its just so greatly performed and executed.

At any time if you set any ship as a subordinate the leader will think its a carrier, and work as such, not doing its job other than being a portable airport. 
setting fighters to attack with corvettes is also great, then that corvette thinks its a carrier too, and will immediately try to land as many of the fighters as it can, just to immensly slow down any quick responses to attacks etc, since it has to launch or land said fighters before moving anywhere!!!!!

As almost everything since 2007: New does not equal better/improved.

Boring because some people wanted space to be bigger.
Disappointing because the (imho) good gameplay was removed in the previous title and hasn't returned yet.
Uninteresting because less than half the game got released with no clear indication we get more than 75%.

Sure, bug might get fixed, but it's hard to fix bad design.

This review is brought to you because Egosoft asked us in a poll about their product.
Egosoft is happy I bought their product. I am not.



Edited Review. Currently 435.1 hrs played.

I resumed playing after the 2022 Summer Survey Egosoft launched into the world. Yes, another poll. Why can't they just listen to what people say on the forums.

What can I say. We are now at that 75% I mentioned 4 years ago. And honestly the original review still stands. Yes, sure, the game has improved in the last 4 years, making it better from its original release state. But that is about all that has happened.

My findings after getting more into the game:
The best thing: The music. Alexei, keep up the good work.
Improvements from X3: station designer. And yes, that is all.
Lets not talk about UI.

The problem with the game, IMHO, it is a game regarding flying spaceship, but it is designed in such a way that the players shouldn't fly at all, unless it is required for a story mission. You want to trade, sure, but you can't use the Trade overview with the ship you are personally flying. You want to deliver wares to a building storage, sure, but you can;t dock or transfer wares with it in the ship you are personally flying. And if you think you have managed to successfully placed a command, you'll find out it is the first ship on your property list that actually got ordered around, not the ship you are personally flying. Very annoying, and very disappointing.

Another problem is balance. A long time ago they added the Xenon I Battleship to the game because it was apparently too easy to kill Xenon K Destroyers. The thing however is that the NPC's can't take on K's so easily. Several K's can cut through a sector and destroy it almost unopposed. And now they have a Battleship leading them on. I took a screenshot of a small group of Xenon attacking the Trading Station in Open Market: 2 I's, 7 K's, 6 P's, 12 M's & 6 N's. It suffered the same faith as Antigone Station.
Worst part however is that the other factions, with the exception of the Terran's, didn't get a Battleship to counter the Xenon I.So now the ""global"" economy suffers form occasional rampages of Xenon I's and K's destroying large amounts of stations with little resistance, causing shortages. And the Split just aren't capable to do anything against the Xenon. They get overrun and eradicated in every playthrough unless the player intervenes.
And while the economy is lacking resources to build stations and ship from the start, the dynamic universe has the factions throw all their Destroyers against each other in border disputes. Fun to see, yet when the Xenon arrive there are no Destroyers left to repel them.
Oh yeah, guess who has the most sectors, strategically placed to annoy and disrupt everyone else equally.
In short it is an unbalanced s hitshow.

The game required 3 things:
 - The Boron Kingdom. Sorely missing, because wasting your time by Walking In Stations has to be a thing. But as said before, we can't fix bad design.
 - Far more Systems/Sectors/Zones, mostly inhabited by the Argon, Paranid, Teladi, Split, Terran, Boron & Pirates. And a layer of unclaimed systems between the different factions. We need more space just to handle with the Xenon. We are now, at best, at half the size of X3 (220 vs 113 zones) and really only at 42% (220 vs 93 sectors). But as I see it at just 30% of the X3 map (220 vs 65 unique systems). The Terrans may have 14 zones in 11 sectors, but we all know Terrans only occupy 1 solar system.
 - A standalone Station Builder, with all modules available to design stations. This is by far the most fun and interesting activity in the game, but hard to do due to a lack of owned blueprints. With the ability to reduce the Build Box to the minimum size needed for your design.

Do I consider the game good now, after playing 370 extra hours? Not really.
I'm mostly waiting for Terraforming Projects to complete. Which requires huge amounts of High-Tech wares which are produced very very slowly. Even on a self-sustaining station.
And I'm also waiting for my stations to make enough money and wares to complete several storyline missions with ridiculous requirements of credits and High-Tech wares.

Cool game, very dynamic for a space sim, a single player Elite like experience but with a smaller scale and more focus on empire building. It also has mod support.

Pros- 
-Dogfights
-Intricate trade and transportation systems
-Months worth of stuff to do. not hours months.
-Rewarding gameplay that keeps you coming back for more
-Semi in depth ship customization affecting turn speed overall speed boost speed etc
-Ship color schemes(would like more freedom here)
-Space is a beautiful sight
-Career paths for whatever you want to do be it pirate outlaw/trader/space fedex/military/Miner/
-Can make npcs do your dirty work for you creating a path of passive income.

Cons- 
-Quite a bit of repetition though varied enough to not feel dull
-Lots of overused dialog and character models.
-Not much to do on stations and very little exploration on stations (semi nitpicky) Also feel very empty and unlived on
-Some tutorials don't touch on everything.
-No planet side activity or vehicles or stations. All Space. (This would be cool to see from these developers since they do so much right. If this had that it would probably be the end all be all space game)
-Autosave does not happen enough. (SAVE VERY FREQUENTLY)
-Graphics are bad on stations. low texture quality on buildings etc...
-Controls are hard to learn on keyboard probably would be a lot more doable on a H.O.T.A.S. That being said now that i've given it some time and learned it, using a keyboard for flight is second nature now and easy

-Final thoughts.
This game is a lot to take in. So much so that i bought it tried it and then let it sit for months before picking it up again due to how daunting it initially felt. There is a very large learning curve in this game and im still learning too but i promise its worth it I am glad i stuck to it and learned enough to come back and enjoy it. It reminds me of eve's depth in a lot of ways but still not that complex. Overall id give it a 8/10 Because id like to see a couple things be different but I'd buy it again without a doubt.

I could go on but ill leave it there. I'm having fun and having a hard time putting it down. If you like games like Eve or Elite dangerous. This will be a happy addition to your library",1666695500,1666695500,True,19,0,0.707685410976409912,0,True,False,False

But after you understand how the game runs, your way to grow come more easilly!

It's a good game to invest your time to manage your empire. Start with a single ship, alone in the vast of the galaxy and grow to a huge faction!

Nice game!

One point I think they need to implement is multiplayer. Yes, this game don't have MP. For example, create my own server to my friends or a co-op play. It will be aewsome. This is the only negative point for me!!

So, if you wanna buy this game, keep in mind that is not like Homeword or Avorion. Its not a game for lasy players. You need to read and learn. Its a slow game that need you to invest time to play.",1666642866,1666642866,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I almost want to give this a thumbs down as I'm getting tired of games relying on me having to search up youtube videos (most of which end up being for outdated versions of the game) just to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing besides the basic gameplay. Beyond that its a great game. Its a space economy simulator that also lets you participate first hand. If you want want to fly, trade, mine or fight you can simply hire someone else to do it for you. Nothing like the feeling of standing on the bridge of a large ship with a nice cup of coffee watching your take out space bugs.

Graphics aren't the best and performance is not so great. The game simulates the entire universe at once, so the further you get into things the slower your PC will run. This is CPU heavy simulation so your 4090 won't save you here. On high end systems, don't be expecting frame rates much higher than 60, even at lower resolutions and settings. On the other hand, if your CPU is decent, you don't need an epeen GPU to enjoy this game.

Economy is EVE like in that everything is crafted somewhere somehow and distributed. And yes this applies to the baddies too. The game also features a somewhat randomly generated universe. The systems/sectors remain the same, with some basic facilities being universal, but absolute placement of stations and starting conditions for the different factions will change every new game.

Lastly I just really want to stress there is a steep learning curve and you will likely be spending some of your time on youtube. Thankfully there's a few good channels for this one.

Story element is almost nonexistent, game is almost entirely sandbox.

The main problem is the terrible interface:  The UI is cluttered and complicated. Flying ships without a joystick or controller simply sucks hard. The scanning system is weird and feels like it lacks precission.

On top of that even, at version 5.something there are still stupid bugs, like satelite deplyoment task areas being just a bit too large for a satellite to cover it, mission descriptions being just a bit too vaque sometimes, the in-game encyclopedia being still mostly empty. And the AI does a terrible job, at flying, at fighting, at mining, at trading....
Managing your NPC underlings is just cumbersome.

The menus in X4 also seem to be much more streamlined and intuitive than in X3. The weapon loadouts are certainly more intuitive. So far, the only complaint I have is the docking lights. Towards the end of the flight tutorial, the green lights I am supposed to follow would continuously have me flying headlong into the hull of the space station. I had to kind of poke around to find where I was actually supposed to dock. In X3 docking never had that issue, at least not for me. They need to fix the docking light system.

Controls are still trash, but the UI is an atrocity, and I found myself wishing i could go back in time and stop whoever was in charge of mission design from ever being hired; it really is some of the worst I've ever had to look for an answer on Reddit to get through.

The voice acting is actually a step below terrible, it sounds like they posted a set of phrases to read, selected which responses they'd use based on the submissions that expressed the least emotion, and then ineptly cut the audio together to make dialogue.

When I first reviewed X4 it was pretty bad. As a long term player of the series (starting with Reunion), I am very happy to say that Egosoft have worked hard on their creation and it shows. So much more playable. It still needs a fair amount of memory and a reasonably beefy cpu, though.
 I am also quite pleased to see the rather steep learning curve is still there but with guidance in the form of starting missions/storyline. Boso Ta would be proud. It almost feels like a completely different game from what I remember.
Anyhow, if you would like a game that has an almost Souls-like difficulty in mastering it, that can be played as a space shooter/strategy/builder aaannnnnd you don't have the attention span of a Goldfish? Then you should give X4 a proper chance. If your PC is below recommended then I seriously suggest X3:Terran Conflict, especially if you are new to the series. as it is by far, imo, more beginner friendly than the rest.

It's certainly not perfect, only having 3 races in the base game and slightly less ships per race as previous games there is less variety in what you see/use.

You could easily spend 500+ hours in a single play through, I am at 240 in my first game as of the writing of this.  This is one of my complaints however, there are things in the game that are very tedious and time consuming in vanilla that would push you you to 1000+ hours.  Luckily you can easily mod these things out or ignore them completely.  There are common bugs like clipping into stations, random lockups, and failure to target.  Default controls suck, took 10 hours for me to get the controls setup where I would enjoy flying.  Building up your faction is slow forcing you to manually take many recurring tasks in the beginning.  There are a few story line missions but they don't really advance much in the world.  The factions are single minded and don't really do much so if you play nice you can play all sides for profit.  After you build a decent fleet you will find that you play most of the game in the map screen, game shifts into a real time strategy game.  Game economy is built around the shipyards; they are the only economy sink in this game so as long as there is warring factions and Xeon around to wreck ships the economy keeps working.  Biggest spoiler I can offer is that by time you get your own shipyard you will be on equal footing to any of the factions.  You will soon realize that the money you been making from 100+ hours of play time is worthless; in fact the factions have unlimited funds to fuel their shipyards with parts.  The real wealth is ships and stations, to dominate a faction you simply have to deny them access to your shipyards and then go and smash theirs.  End game isn't as exciting as  early game as the fear of loss isn't there.  The mechanics here are not as well fleshed out.  I have multiple doom stacks of destroyers and carriers that can take stations/sectors at will because the AI doesn't respond to this threat well and there are some bugs with station defense that simply work in the players favor.

For the total price, relative to the sizable array of problems, I wouldn't recommend this game yet.  If you have to have it, just be prepared for some serious frustrations.  You'll probably still have fun, but you might also end up eating your keyboard.

Pros:
- Wide open space sim with elements of commerce, exploration, and combat.
- Single player: So you can focus on exploring game instead of all the nonsense that comes with endless pvp.
- Lots of flexibility in how you approach the game.
- It's done now and not on it's 12th year alpha release where everyone prepaid (I'm looking at you SC/Cloud Imperium/Dread Pirate Roberts)
- Runs native on Linux (ok, *lots* of love to Egosoft for that one)

Cons:
- Bugs, bugs, bugs.
- Stuff doesn't work and the game doesn't tell you why.
- Many quests are poorly explained making it difficult to decide what you will be asked to do ahead of time,
- Clipping issues can really ruin your day if you don't have a recent save.  Why are there still clipping issues?!
- Saves and Loads take forever, so you quite often don't have a recent save.
- Voice acting is really bad.  It's not a big deal, but it does break immersion.
- Dialogs are often written in a way that they feel disjointed or as if they were poorly translated from one language to another.
- AI pilots are just terrible. After 20+ years of making these types of games, the lack of progress is disappointing.

- The UI is atrocious.  Perhaps the worst UI I've seen in 30 years.  
  - Information is scattered
  - Nothing is intuitive
  - Keyboard navigation is awful and incomplete
  - Secondary contextual menu clicking is tedious and confusing
  - Poor feedback for long running processes  (you'll struggle a bit to figure out what's going on for quite a few sessions).
  - There's more, but let's stop there for brevity.

- Poor game decisions make for a frustrating questing/gaming experience 
  - One of the main quest lines has you sacrifice an employee's life like it's meaningless
  - The quest ""blow up 15 turrets quest"" fails if you blow up the enemy station instead.  
  - Ship computers can't fly without a pilot... yet there's an ""autopilot button"" if you are in the pilot's seat. (I get the lore here, but ""come pick me up"" does not an AGI terror make).

If you loved X3, then you'll probably still like X4.  Just be prepared to tolerate some pretty rough issues along the way.  I hope they work some of these things out.

Following on the steps of X3: Terran Conflict, Egosoft has finally released the long awaited sequell to the game.
After the 4.00 patch, for me, the game finally surpasses X3:Albion Prelude, in that You have again:

- Exploration: More then 100 giant sectors to Explore with many goodies to discover;
- Build: Beside Your own HQ, there are plenty of factories to choose from, all of them beautiful, and with 5 diferent races, You are sure to find the architectural style you love the most.
- Think: Plenty of missions to go for, and with Cradle of Humanity, Egosoft has taken Plot missions to the next level. We now can enjoy plot mission for themselves, not only as a means to get the final prize.
- Fight: You have plenty of wars around to meddle in. Evil Khaak or Xenon, Civil Wars or pirate Hunting. And You can do it alone or with an armada of ships, from small scouts to huge Destroyers, all of them beautifully crafted.

When in 2018 Egosoft announced the ""biggest sandbox this side of the Universe"" they just forgot to mention that it would only be ready 2 years later.

That being said, 2 years Later, they have delivered, and have never stopped working on the game, bug hunting and refining all the management tools. So now, it is what they promised.

It's a lot of fun and a game to enjoy for many years to come, not only in its vanilla version, but also with the help of an amazing modding community!

However, if you are easily frustrated by random bug, i would not recommend this game to you. Heck, the only reason why I write this review is to let you know that there are some bugs that might break your pace like those boarding missions that tend to bug from time to time. How can a freighter still flying with 80m/s with 4 broken thrusters ? Boarding process stuck with the mission to protect the pod for 30 minutes (i stopped waiting at this point at my reputation is down to 10 from 25 after blasting their thrusters and turrets for god knows how many times).  

So, the question is, will i still play this game? Most probably I will, but those hiccup moments really frustrates me. But will I recommend this to anyone? Most probably not. 

Another point that I want to express my awe is the modified label that persist with your safe file even after you disable all the mods. This is really a meme at this point. 

Finally would be the characters, why do they looks like trolls and have strange neck posture when you are talking to them on their chairs. The character models are ugly even by 2018 standards. But hey, they are not the main focus of the game.

The universe feels rather small even with all the dlc`s, especially with some factions from the previous games missing or beeing cut down severly.

New 'cool' features you wish never existed.
Beeing able to stand up and walk through you ship really sounds cool but becomes a painfull walking and waiting simulator after a few hours effectively 'walkwalling' many essential tasks.
This becomes even more dull as station interriors look exactly the same everywhere you go with slightly different textures. M and above sized ships each have one cockpit/ ship interior design for every faction.

The different components of a ship(engines, weapons, shilds, etc.) can now be individually be bought allowing a very pleasant custumization to any ship, now this is a nice feature, but wait.
These come in up to 3 different tiers, Mk1 ... Mk3, getting increasingly stronger but also exponentially more expensive, making them effectively a player ship only feature and nearly obsolete for ai controlled ships/ fleets.
For even more increase in power you can allpy mods to your components, which get random stats within a certain range...

Many features in the game don`t work propperly, or at all, looking at you 'fleets'.
Menues are arranged confusing and cluttered with unnecessary information, it is for example impossible to access docked ships from the larger ships hanger, you need to go all the way through all your owned ships to give it orders.
Tooltips and ship component stats are missing a lot of information or are simply wrong.
Crew management is a joke, or rather a single list of all your crewmembers from all your ships with no further information given. I to enjoy hundreds of entries in a unsortable list with nearly no information given except their x/5 star rating.
Your captains will glady fly through enemy stations to annoy you with the ships loss, fighters will hug stations they attack only to get blown up by the destructions blast wave, and yes, this makes 80% of your losses.

Ship and arnament variety has been reduced by a lot, in most cases factions just have 1 ship for every class.
While smaller ships, S and M sizes, can choose from a decent arsenal of main weapons, the turret variaty for capital ship is nearly non existent with 5 types across all factions across all turret sizes.
Missiles are now installed in main weapon/ turret slots and are either broken OP or ridiculous useless.

The balance between larger and smaller ships really doesn`t exist, small ship weapons are a lot stronger then turrets despite them beeing as big as a small ship, the concept of surface elements, which are very weak, that can be damaged without hitting the main shields and hull makes disabeling large ships way to easy.
This leads to stupid scenarios where you can easily disable all enemy ship functionalities without beeing even remotly able to scratch its shields.
Generally speaking M sized ships feel like larger S sized ships instead of their own class and all larger ships feel extremely weak, especially considering their size increase over smaller ships.

This accounts for most of the game problems and generall incomplete feel of developement.

It was after I replaced my laptop from another occasion that I am finally able to enjoy the graphics of this game a chunk better.

The game is also immersive, from being able to walk on station platforms to basically float in space in your spacesuit, the scale of the in-game universe never disappoints.

A bit of complaint though: as a X-enjoyer who started from X Rebirth, the lack of the ""one true OP ship"" in vanilla is disappointing (X Rebirth had the rather OP Albion Skunk), and I can see Egosoft went for quantity instead of quality, publishing many small sectors instead of XR's few but often beautiful, detailed clusters. But seeing that we can fly basically every ship and walk inside them, and the sector graphics are also nice (and other things), I think this is an acceptable trade-off.

I play this game with large-scale empire building in mind, so usually this game is a giant time sink. Excellent if you have lots of time to spare, but not so much if IRL demands more time from gaming.

I bounced off X3:AP more recently, with its hellish UI and lack of an obvious way in. I took a punt on X4 because apparently I'm a glutton for punishment, and it's genuinely surprised me how good it is. The UI is... understandable and reasonably intuitive. Hooray! The start I picked (Terran, from the DLC) led me reasonably steadily into the universe, gave me a ton of stuff and some idea of what I was doing before cutting me loose! 12 hours in, I had a handful of ships, the beginnings of the base-building side, and a feel for the factions! Inconceivable!

While the human character models are, well, ""interesting"", and there's plenty of quirks and jank - autopilot, I'm looking at you - X4 is very, very good. The ships, the sectors, the space-y-ness is very pretty - and in little touches like the breathing when you're out in a spacesuit, very neatly judged in terms of feel. The soundtrack is *great*. Planets, while they're skybox-only, have a genuine sense of scale and wonder. Being able to amble around on foot properly is great, however comically small the ""offices"" and ""bar"" areas on stations are, but has also helped make the ship models more than just a flying camera. The underlying mechanics are reasonably easy to understand (or at least accept for what they are), and interact with. The universe rolls along without you and that's fine - you can noodle around, do what you want, or not. Really, just chill.

I'll say its a good game. But i don't recommend it unless you are a lover of the X series. The Devs seem to refuse to want to fix the AI. After many months of waiting for AI fixes they just never come. Why not? They also seem to focus on adding DLCs that should be lets face it base game. Factions that were FREE in previous games cost money in X4. Weird huh? AI fixes never coming is the main reason i cannot recommend this to anyone. If you can look past the insanely dumb ai (worse than even X2 AI) then sure go for it on sale. Another funny thing you can own casinos but they don't do anything a casino does.

you need to manually toggle so you can see the missions you can accept.
when you walk in station, you tend to teleport back into your ship while you explore that station,

missions including briefing explains nothing of what to do in the mission.
example 1 is that i have to go to a station to deliver medical supplies.
the person giving you the job simply tell you to find the station by myself with the station they hired me to deliver to.

there is no hint or tip in where to find said station.   when you finally get there, it does not tell you how to deliver the medical supplies. (spoiler) you simply had to just sell it (selling and delivering is not the same)

then we accept a quest to kill ships from a faction called scale plate pact.
they simply tells us to go out in space to find them. IN SPACE.

fine fine. it was prob an side quest. so i go to another mission.
that mission tells me to hack one of their stations.

where? out there.,, in space.
this game have incredible poor mission dialoge and you cant ask anything useful that could show me the way to where the missions tells me to go.

i dont want to spend 80% of my gameplay on google and reddit when things should have been explained by the mission giver.

this game is extremely disappointing at how cryptic all missions have to be,
plus the autopilot is high af. its barely useful for its 1 job.

Decent UI, plenty of missions strewn about to make a name for yourself with one or another faction, and ships a-plenty to use as your own ship or to build a fleet with.
Station management can be quirky at times; I've had stations reset themselves to configurations I did not tell them to be in for no apparent reason. It might be that not all connector points are supposed to be used. I tend to build the things tightly packed, but even the randomizer does that at times. Not sure if that ever gets fixed.

Those who complain don't seem to understand how the X universe works.
You suck at the beginning. Your ship sucks. Your gear sucks. Your funds suck. Your map sucks. Your rep sucks.

However, most of the complaints seem to be about things that can be changed relatively easily.
In the X universe your skills such as trading, docking, AI piloting, autopilot, combat, etc. largely depend on your software levels. 

These are things you must find in stations, and buy for your own ship, as well as ships in your flotilla, then all the ships in your fleet, and eventually your massive, sprawling empire. 
These upgrades make your life in the X universe more rewarding and less frustrating.

For instance... Docking Level 1 sucks. It requires you pretty much sit your ship down on a dime.
Docking Level 2, you can pretty much bomb in at full speed over the target, be somewhat askew and half rolled over, and it'll land you almost automatically.

So go out there, explore, trade, fight, and buy your way into universal dominion. 
Or whine and cry, and go watch real gamers on youtube, who actually put a little effort to figure a game out, and don't want to make the X universe into another lame, shallow, tablet game.",1661724320,1661990740,True,26,0,0.691898047924041748,0,True,False,False

There are way too many surfaces ships/you can get stuck into without being able to get out of. In particular one mission requires you to navigate a maze in your spacesuit, and I'm very happy I unlocked teleportation well before this point because I got stuck at least a half dozen times and, if I had been not constantly quicksaving, would have otherwise needed to start from the last autosave. Once, a station plan I spent about 1/2 hour putting together just, vanished. This MAY have been my fault, but I'm not sure. The AI is highly customizeable using rules but still pretty stupid - Expect to kill a lot of your own marines in boarding missions when your fleet destroys the vessel you're trying to capture, massive trading ships ferrying 2 flowers across the galaxy, and small fighters losing pissing contests against capital ships. The base design mechanic may be the absolute worst I've ever seen in a game, with clunky controls that are very difficult to get a hang of (I had to read a few different tutorials just to find out that you right click and hold to rotate a module). Now, as I have mentioned some of these things may have been my fault - some tutorials skipped, a connecting piece accidentally deleted, and maybe try not to crash into everything you see - but with some reading I have found that even among fans of the game most of my thoughts are the consensus.

So why would I recommend this game? The absolute depth of it is astounding. The game is beautiful. Each ship comes with it's own joys and challenges in handling creating a decent sense of balance. It's challenging enough to keep you on your toes without necessarily want to pitch your keyboard/controller/flight stick. The combat is pretty much exactly what you'd want from a space flight sim. The story isn't bad, with a pretty robust lore and decently if not stereotypically portrayed factions all warring with each other while obviously putting not enough effort against the real threat (Hey, Game of Thrones in space!).

So, I would say any fan of the genre should give this game a fair shot, just be warned that it can be a tough start, you want to adjust autosave to be more frequent, and make friends with the quicksave feature.

Some things I wish I knew going in (spoiler marked only if you genuinely want to experience these pains yourself, no story is ruined here):

[spoiler]You don't necessarily want to rush into getting the largest possible ships - owning now something of every size I usually find myself in the fastest, smallest ship over 90% of the time, and the problem I mentioned earlier with trading 2 flowers on a big ship were pretty well remedied by rounding out my trading fleet with a few small couriers (still pretty dumb you can't set a minimum cargo haul for ships on auto flight, but whatever).

When you have the ability to steal blueprints from data leaks, I'm 99% sure you have to get out of the ship and into your suit to actually get the steal.

You might think you have a lot of crafting components. You don't. Hoard even the stuff you think you have too many of because the day will come you'll be glad you had 50 secure containers, tons of mixed fruit, etc.

There are no consequences at all from aborting missions. If you're in one that's gonna get a ship destroyed, drop it and move on (unless it follows the story arc, you'll be able to tell the difference).

Try not to get in fights you're not going to win, because sometimes it's impossible to get out. (no, your one destroyer is NOT a match for that Xenon one heading your way, run)  [/spoiler]",1661922259,1661923062,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

So I've been enjoying this until recently, I'll continue to play but unsure as to how long it's getting increasingly frustrating.

The ai is dumb.. I can live with that. But the performance I'm beginning to hate, and the longer the save goes on the worse it gets.

About 50hours in my first play through and it's bogging down.

 As you play the empires around you grow which is great. However the developers seem to have no clue on optimisation and utilising more cpu cores. this game severely bottle necks at the CPU. I have 32gb 3200mhz ram, 3700x and a 3070ti. 
None are being capped out.. instead it's a just couple of cores on the processor that's getting maxed out.. 

in a quiet system in space I get around 45fps.. in a quiet system station about 35.. the map.. 30.. although are acceptable but 
Move to anywhere remotely busy like a wharf and watch it tank. The map (where you spend a lot of time micro managing) becomes so unusual often dropping below 15fps. I'm dreading reaching end game wars as I'm sure the whole game will just grind to a half

Looking online this is a very common issue. Even running 5800x3d and the 5950x don't seem to fix performance by much.. the high end Intel chips look like they handle a bit better but a 4 year old game shouldn't be requiring top end hardware and these seem to still struggle towards end game

I think update 6 needs to be less about content and more about fixing the performance issues. 4 years since release, you've had plenty of time. No excuses 

Besides this the gameplay is great, sure the ai is very questionable but you get on with it..

Until the performance is fixed I will not be recommending this game, which is a shame

Came to this game game very late. So far I have been playing just Vanilla, but I intend to buy the expansions as well.

- [b] The Load Times [/b] are killer. Many of the following frustrations would be acceptable if if it didn't take 2-5mins to reload a save when something inevitably goes catastrophically wrong.

- [b] The AI [/b] is dense, and there are few player tools for fixing this. Overall a game like Starsector does a FAR better job of combat AI and it is developed primarily by one guy.
1. My 4 star captain of my capital ship refuses to outright engage an enemy capital with its main (capital killer) weapons, instead choosing to turn to the side and die. If you want to do large ship combat and you're not overwhelmingly advantaged you must manually control the ship.
2. If you tell an AI to mine or do something within a specific region on the map, and the AI isn't already there, it just goes dead in the water until you manually tell it to go to the specified region.
3. Small-mid tier combat ships are suicidal and will just throw themselves at enemy capital ships pretty much regardless of what sub-orders you choose for them unless you manually tell them to go away. There needs to be an 'avoid this enemy' function. Or a general setting for ships to avoid enemy capitals.
4. The AI often does things the slowest way possible. Many times my large fleet was held up by not being able to land subordinate fighters in a normal time. They could just use travel mode to get into a reasonable distance before trying to dock but they don't.
5. You can't engage in large-scale battles against enemies with friendly AI anywhere nearby, even if you're allied to them, because the ships will accidentally friendly fire and this will cause a war. There's limited forgiveness that in a large-scale battle immediately gets thrown out the window. 
6. Fighters do a bad job of retreating to recharge their shields, so if you're not in a battle where you're overwhelmingly advantaged you will take unnecessary losses.
7. Fighters/frigates often don't stay close enough to the target they are set to defend, resulting in them wandering out of your capital's range and dying.
8. Fighters will unnecessarily shield-boost out of range and then not even wait to recharge their shields to rejoin the fray. They should only do this when they are about to get overwhelmed and they should use that to recharge shields and wait for friendly backup.
9. When a ship 'recalls subordinates' (which it uses to bring back drones before travelling somewhere) it will also recall fighters/frigates which will not necessarily deploy again when needed without manual intervention.
10. 'Patrol this sector' function is useless because they just aimlessly (and extremely slowly) wander and don't engage known (via satellites or friendlies on the map) targets until they're within range. Furthermore they will not avoid targets they have no chance of winning against, so if your patrol of 2 fighters stumbles into an enemy station or capital they will just suicide into it.
11. 'Explore sector' function is useless because much like patrol the ship will just aimlessly wander at an extremely slow speed. To map a sector you pretty much have to use the 'fly and wait' function to manually tell it to go to each part of the sector, but even then this is slow because 'fly and wait' does not prioritise speed and so they will slow down out of travel mode way before they need to, I understand the AI needs to be a bit inefficient compared to a player, but it is often unreasonable.
12. Many non-specific orders will interfere with ships defending themselves or fleeing unwinnable situations, so they just sit there and die.
13. 'Attack with target' doesn't 'attack with' so much as send every ship to attack the current enemy of the targeted ship whether or not the others are there to back them up.
14. 'Defend target' doesn't really defend so much as 'attack when defended ship is attacked' such that they will often ignore relevant targets (because a nearby enemy is only attacking one of the other defending ships).
15. 'Intercept for target' would be the best command if the AI were clever enough to only intercept things that they won't immediately die to, and/or worked with fellow interceptors to stay safe. As it is, unless you're overwhelmingly advantged (as usual) this function results in unnecessary losses.
16. You don't want to be anywhere near an AI miner when they're mining, they seem to get far worse at their job whenever the player is nearby and the ship actually has to perform its function in front of them.

- [b] Manual control [/b] for many ship functions is confusing and not easily configurable, especially when it comes to subordinate (drones, slaved ships) control. Drones in general could use more configuration/deployment options. This would enable player control of large mining ships which is currently lacking. Let me control a turret, let me choose which drones to deploy and what they should do. Making mining more engaging than zapping a rock with a single laser and picking up the loot.

[b] Ship Mods/Player Choice. [/b] While there is some great examples of player choice/balance when it comes to ship loadouts, weapons, shields, etc. There often seems to be a 'best choice' (terran shields for instance) which transcend balance and make most of the choice redundant. The same goes for mods, which uses a sort of gambling system to improve your weapons. This is supposed to come with an associated cost, but realistically you just re-roll the mods until you get a favourable outcome. Mods should be reworked to involve no gambling, but the ability to TUNE systems such that you can trade some performance in one area for performance in another (at a cost, that is, it will always result in a less effective general weapon than normal, but it may result in weapons that are well suited to specific tasks).

[b] Enemy space. [/b] Aside from the Xenon and Kha'ak most factions aren't immediately hostile to you, and so preying upon them seems foolish most of the time when you can just avoid them instead. There's also often little-to-no reward for killing enemy ships unless you're defending friendly space. But even then you don't get rewarded for your faction's kills, just your own, so even if it weren't for friendly fire issues combat ships feel particularly useless unless it's just to defend your other economic activities.

[b] Unique things to find. [/b] Related to enemy space - I don't feel there's much reward for invading enemy space or going to dangerous areas to explore or fight. You can't scan Xenon/Kha'ak stations to get their blueprints due to lore reasons (who cares?), you can't their ships for the same reason (they're AI so your crew can't pilot the ships). Ship salvage also doesn't result in finding their weapons or components so overall again you are just incentivised to completely avoid combat. One of my favourite things to do in a space game is collect unique and cool looking ships, and it just feels like the best way to do that in this game is to grind reputation with all the factions so you can just buy them (boring!). The best rewards for exploration seem to be these 'lockboxes' which are trivially easy to open but takes time, and which drop things easily obtained from farming combat at a Xenon adjacent jump gate.

[b] Swapping pilots. [/b] Crew management in general is difficult and fiddly. You should just be able to instantly swap a ship's pilots, but you have to assign them to another ship or role, put the pilot you want in, and then swap the other pilot back.

[b] Station Construction. [/b] Station modules should just snap together like legos, but the controls are awful, you can't rotate pieces the way you want to, it's locked to an axis which is difficult to change, and often times the snapping function goes to the wrong place.

The thing about this game is that for every individual thing it does really well, it does at least 4 things poorly, and another 10 things outright weirdly.

Let's start with the autopilot function. An autopilot's job is to take a ship's current position and craft a route toward the desired destination avoiding obstacles in the way. Not so with X4. The game's autopilot is positively addicted to barrelling toward huge asteroids, and then either crash breaking or crashing through the asteroid's collision mesh into the asteroid's no-place interior.

You have 2 scan modes: short range (Shift-2) and long range (Shift-3). You mostly use the short range mode for detecting subtle signals on the complex, jigsaw-like stations that populate the game. These signals could lead to jobs, to discounts, to strange criminal contacts, and more. You have to fly very very close to the station to detect these signals. So far, so good. But the short range mode is also obsessed with ""scanning"" the station's modules for some reason, which I guess would be okay except that when it's scanning a module, it gets so excited that it paints the complex, winding modules you're trying to navigate with a light purple color. This makes it impossible (and visually repellant) to get close to stations unless you really need to. Potentially good mechanic, apparently implemented by a complete moron.

Long range scans are for detecting small objects in 180 degree arc ahead of you. And also large objects (stations) in a 360 degree arc all around you. But since the player's field of view is only about 100 degrees or so, whenever a long range scan reveals a small critical object (with, admittedly, a pleasing 'bing') there's a very good chance that you'll have no idea where it is. Potentially a good mechanic, again rendered weird.

And then ... then you start asking The Questions. Do these mechanics *actually* add anything to the game? Not really. They're just a load of additional key presses that don't do much for anyone. You can drop observation satellites, of course -- and you'll need to, if you want to find the prices for wares on a given station, because while videocalling across the galaxy is permitted, the idea of sending a price list gives X4 a fit of the vapors. But satellites can't detect the things that a long range or short range scan can.  (Why not? WHY NOT?) 

So much of playing X4 is made up not of playing the actual game, but instead wondering ""Why not?"" Let's say you have to investigate a station in your space suit. Now, these things are tricky to manoeuvre. And you definitely don't want to crash into any walls. At first you think, ""Hm. Crashing into walls would cause uncontrollable bouncing that would not be polite."" But then you discover a darker issue: crashing into walls has about a 50% chance of having you slip through a badly-coded collision mesh into the station's unrendered and hard/impossible to escape interior. The collision meshes are barely functional. WHY NOT? IT'S A CORE PART OF A SPECIFIC GAMEPLAY YOU HAVE DELIBERATELY CREATED WHY DO THEY NOT WORK?!

You can't set a navigation marker to a jump gate if you don't know the destination on the other side of the gate. WHY NOT?

You can (with some research) teleport yourself all over the map. You can even (with some more research and a navigation beacon) teleport your personal trillion-tonne headquarters wherever you'd like! But you *can't* teleport the ship you're in to somewhere else. WHY NOT?

Oh, and the station-building system is a bloody nightmare. As with most things in X4, you get used to it and figure out ways to exploit it ... but if someone had spent five minutes playing Kerbal Space Program (June 2011) and applied just a whiff of those design tools they could have come up with something 100 times more user friendly than the current lunatic mess.

People do say that X4 has a steep learning curve. In truth, it doesn't. Not really. What it does have is a janky and pedantic interface made of drop-down and right-click menus which will generally make you feel like you're using a copy of MS Excel from about 1996. What takes the time with X4 is actually *unlearning* what a decent interface feels like. Letting go of expectations. Letting go of frustrations. In this respect, X4 is one of the most spiritually uplifting games out there. I can honestly say that, 2000 hours in, I could have a wild gorilla eat my feet and I'd still be thinking something like, ""Well, at least this is easier than getting X4's auxiliary ships to work.""

There's a fair chance that someone will say in reply to this review something like, ""Well, 2000 hours you got your money's worth!"" And, the answer to that is, unfortunately, no. Fallout 3, NV, 4, Kerbal, Skyrim, Stellaris, Crusader Kings II & III and Hearts of Iron IV, Fights in Tight Spaces ... sure. I got my money's worth with those games. But I haven't even *begun* to get my money's worth with X4. It's simply too poorly made, too far from being a good experience, too distant from even the slightest consideration by the developer of what it's like to be a player.",1661220091,1661220091,False,196,29,0.858508884906768799,22,True,False,False

1. You start out as a pilot with a starter ship, and build your way up to a trade & production empire. Or be Blackbeard and lead a piracy campaign. Or play it like Civ and build stations, claiming strategic areas and/or pushing other factions out.
2. The universe feels alive and busy, whether or not I get involved. And if I do get involved, I can influence the direction. All games have to simulate this to one extent or another, it just feels much more vibrant with X4.

Right now I'm playing it mainly like Andrew Carnegie building my steel tycoon empire, with faction diplomacy and intrigue leading to some future interesting warfare, and with a bit of piracy sprinkled in for good measure. Which areas to pursue are entirely up to the player as they can all be combined.

I also love that passive income is not just allowed, it's encouraged. Hire NPCs to do all the grunt work, optimize their systems, and then go off and run missions while they drive money into your bank account. No more mining (unless you really want to); now your subordinates will take care of all that for you.

The main downside is the AI, but then that's pretty consistent with all these complex types of games. Just think of yourself as a brilliant leader, whose mere presence directing the battle field or trade empire turns the tide.  This must be how Napoleon felt when his armies would lose every battle until he showed up.

Honestly, X4 has so much replayability with how much the universe can change using different sets of mods or choosing different factions to support. Role playing in different ways (a lone trader trying to become owner of a trade fleet, a mercenary captain, a manufacturing tycoon, pirate captain, etc.) really helps bring life to the world in different ways and the wide variety of missions available amplifies it further. The support of the mod community has given this game a long shelf life.

Edit after 120+ hours: This is Eve Online if Eve were single player, which I take as a plus personally.

Original Review:
This takes a good 10-12 hours to learn how to play/what to do, including using YouTube tutorial videos to explain everything. This is a very long, somewhat slow burn of a game that honestly somehow keeps throwing new things at you at just the right pace to stay interesting. At parts, this can actually be a bit of an idle game. Once you set up some miners in a safe location, or some traders with a couple of ships to guard them, you can walk away for several hours or leave the computer on overnight to get a whole bunch of cash and kick-start the next play session. If you have the time, I recommend checking out the game + DLCs. Once you've learned the basics, modding goes a long ways towards replay ability but I don't recommend using too many on the first run as the game is already complex enough.",1630773769,1660780115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a huge fan of X3:AP and after watching YouTube vids on the game play, I had high expectations.

After the first 5 hours of getting my feet wet, I was blown away by the graphics, depth and detail here.  I was pleasantly overwhelmed by the amount of UI information here for ships, stations, NPC's and the orders that can be given to them.  Ordering your other ships to another station and un-docking with them made me smile.  The sounds all have a purpose to them as well, like the stresses on your ships frame while turning in travel mode or the attention beeps.  And the music, oh my god I could play these tracks in my car while heading to work.  The ability to walk around stations and hire crews is very nice, but it does need more.

The developers know about the problems, yet they do absolutely nothing to fix anything:
- missions can fail and bug your whole savegame if you do something slightly unexpected
- the game is totally CPU bound, yet it only uses 20% of a 12900k to barely keep up 20 FPS
- the AI constantly crashes into stations or finds ways to bug itself
- the autopilot constantly crashes into asteroids or other objects
- the game crashes randomly or the renderer freezes, and it takes at least 3 minutes to reload a saved game
- automation options are very limited and still bugged
- severe balance fails, basically allowing you to 'cheat' money without marking your savegame as modified/cheated
- many more serious shortcomings like the horrible UI design or the unreliable physics engine

Seen quite a few awesome large-scale battles and added a small scoutship and a ship auto-mining asteroids..... starting my upward money curve to where I can eventually get a few more mining ships and then start looking up getting larger ships or some perhaps my own personal station to process my own ores into more valuable stuff.

There are some good mods and you can find a bunch on the Steam Workshop to where it makes the install process super-easy.  Hopefully in a few dozen hours I'll have a small fleet of Destroyers or whatnot and start taking it to my enemies.  Fun game.

Edit-  Another 120 hours in the game- liking it a lot.  Using a few mods, some of them changing the game quite a bit, but I've been having a good time.  Building up my economy to prop up the galaxy against some rough enemies while trying to amass my own personal navy and getting my first station off the ground has been a lot of fun.  My first game had some of the Not Nice Aliens wreck havoc very early on but my focus has been on making money in ways that builds up all the other faction's navies and sure enough the borders for all the factions i've yet encountered are holding solid (with a little help from the couple of Frigate Strike Groups I've been able to put together and PILES of little laser turrets) so I've been able to build up myself and not have to try to put out fires all over the galaxy.  

I LOVED the X3 Game and put off getting this one because it sounded like it needed more time.  The enemy factions can be much more aggressive at times over the X3 Games, but I've been quite happy with my purchase.  

On a personal note- whatever Start you pick can have a pretty big impact.  Some factions are more universally liked/hated than others and picking one that doesn't have as many enemies is probably a good idea for a first run..... there is enough stuff to learn/worry about without having to worry about making the universe not hate you.",1656613523,1659280156,True,2,0,0.509325027465820313,0,True,False,False

THAT being said though I bought this game a week ago and have 200 hrs in game, I leave it running while I am asleep or doing other things and save it before I leave it (incase bad stuff happens.)

 The space combat in the game is fun despite your ships getting a noticeable idiot smack when you are also in sector. I took out a destroyer in my frigate the other day, for those who don't know a Destroyer is essentially the ""Star Destroyer"" of this game and the frigate I was flying was essentially a Millennium Falcon, I used my speed to out maneuver the destroyers turrets and weapons while destroying it's engines, then turrets, then weapons. It took a very long time as I had bolt turrets and weapons which is essentially like destroying an oil barrel with a .22 caliber automatic weapon... but considering I did it without dying was extremely satisfying and provided a massive Dopamine burst into my system...

Get this game it's a ton of fun, I should mention I haven't tried any mods but my understanding is the modding community is active, and I do look forward to trying them out and seeing how they improve/change the game.

*edit* 07/31/2022* So I got the 'Star Wars Interworlds"" mod, and several other mods for making the game a bit easier and streamlined, like a trading mod that enables me to better automate my trading ships, my miners, and my stations. A better functioning 'Patrol' mod that makes it so my ships patrolling actually respond to attacks on my ships. several mods that improve faction relations making the game more dynamic, also AI economic mods to help ensure the games factions are more competitive and function over all a bit better as a result. 
The Star Wars Interworlds mod is simply astounding it is a complete overhaul of the game the only thing that hasn't been changed is a lot of the station modules look similar (worth noting they have added some in recent updates and are continuing to update the mod regularly... Worth noting the mod is *SO* well done that Egosoft actually hired the modders as game developers... the ships are gorgeous they have overhauled every ship in the game and replaced them with genuine Star Wars ships currently the 'Executor' is not in the game as of now but it is being worked on. If there is one mod I can suggest it is Star Wars Interworlds because it is simply the best mod out there, the mods that provide Quality of life improvements are great and should be utilized...

Deep complex systems an micro management abilities but struggles to educate you in-game with learning missions like scan cargo for space weed on argon, gave up on that one.  

Advance rules to allow your station to avoid conflict area's, trade setup's on own stations allow only your ships to trade specific resources and block external buyers where needed.  

Nice combat system all the ships really feel different to handle.  

Have only learned the basics and found a few annoying things like when your pilot recalls subordinates they can get stuck an u have to keep deleting the recall an they move a little each time when it gets recalled.  An autopilot occasionally has a melt down in the highway an u just zoom past your destination an go in an infinite loop.

Not sure if I have even found the story line missions yet but its been great fun just doing random stuff.  

Remember to save before you exit and on a regular basis as a mine encounter or random raiding party can wipe you out pretty quick if your fleet is weak an that defence base that might popup near a trade route an wipe out all your trade ships can be an interesting experience.

Owned property can behave strangely as I thought I have lost all my ships a few times, then found one manually on the map and once clicked, they all re-appeared in their groups...  Phew..

Would be nice if you could toggle fleet commanders with a tick box so they appear in the main UI for quick commands and have hotbar with key binds or just key binds for things like civilian an military deployment instead of hitting enter or using the load out info page for spam drops on laser towers while warping around hostiles in drift mode to soften em up a little before moving in with an attack squad. An also pin stations to a favourites list for quick upgrade orders to ships.  Floating tool tips would also be nice instead of the right click, encyclopedia navigate away from the ship upgrade screen have a read then go back to upgrading ^_^.

Boarding is a bit confusing not done that an said impossible when i tried and didn't say why or what I needed to do to resolve the issue.  

Claimed a few empty ships after some pilot ejected and on a mission that set a self destruct that was pretty cool.  Took a few attempts as you only had a limited time before kabooom.

Overall having a great time trying to work stuff out and love you can teleport around to any of your ships when things go south then switching from hands on do stuff to set orders an switch to external view an watch your crew hard at work.

Graphics: 9/10.  Some things feel a little cheap, but overall, whoa is all I can say.  The sense of scale is staggering.  When you start in your small fighter, things seem huge.  Then your middle class, things seem ""normalized"" then in your capital ships, things almost seem small.  Collision surfaces are the model surfaces.  This comes with a performance cost and a glitchyness, but it also means you can fly your S class ship literally anywhere.  Inside a station if you want.  Between the wings of a capital ship where you can shoot at it from inside.  It's truly insane.

Gameplay: 10/10.  Build, trade, fly, fight, it got pretty much everything right.  But....
Controls and UI: 4/10.  You are going to spend a lot of time in the map screen, and a lot of it makes very little sense.  For example, the best way to hire a station manager... Go to your property list, select a ship, right click, choose info.  Click the crew tab.  Right click a crew member, say work somewhere else.  The map reloads on the property screen.  Now, find the station or ship, right click it, and a little menu pops up (keep in mind it never tells you any of this, even barely so in the tutorial and choose assign, pick the position, and OK.  This entire process is pretty much backwards from what it should be.  Trade filters are again confusing and not well explained. Setting up trade stations is never explained properly, the logistics screen is never explained properly.  It's super confusing and can take 100+ hours just to see everything.  So the UI is really terrible.  And yet not worse than previous X games.

Sound: 8/10.  The music is fantastic, the explosions and guns are serviceable.

Performance: 1/10.  The game runs like garbage.  In a completely empty universe, you might get 60 fps.  Once the game is going though, enjoy 5fps as you are looking at your HQ or shipyard, and when you jump out of sector to try and get some FPS just so you can dog fight, you will be doing it at 15fps with your CPU idling and your GPU idling.  The game has a logic bottleneck somewhere in it.  Sometimes it's from auto traders and auto miners trying to find something to do.  Other times it just seems inexplicable.  But if your performance is way down, go through your property list and look for ships that have failed orders.  These bog down your performance.
If your into spreadsheets in space, the terrible performance probably won't bother you.  If your looking for intense dog fighting, the performance will probably piss you off.  If you need 60fps, I don't think there is a CPU in existence that can handle it.

And a couple notes for people coming from previous X games.

You have to craft SETA, you are not given it like X3.
You do not need SETA to travel anymore, you get a travel drive that usually multiplies your speed by 10 or more.  One ship with a travel drive can move at 9000 (heh) which is nearly as fast as the super highways.
Jump drives are gone, but you get a universe teleport instead.
Collisions no longer blow you up.  They just drain shields.  This helps with Auto pilot crashing into things without killing you or your AI ships.  So they didn't fix the bad navigation AI, they just made it suffer less.  Betty will even say ""Autopilot epically failed"" on a big crash.",1658600273,1658600711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only reason why I don't play X4 regularly is because of the limit of my PC.
(2.9GHz, NVIDIA GT1030 & DDR3 16G) It's not enough to play X4. :-(

I have more than 1500 hours in Elite Dangerous for PS4, and I am active player in EVE online.
So I think that I can make some comparing:

Good in X4:
- No frustration like in EVE Online. I definitely prefer single player mode in X4.
- Nice main quests with a lot of RPG elements. you can't find this in Elite and EVE.
- Amazing soundtracks and music. 5*****
- Ambiance of the game is also fantastic.

 I have played about 100 hours. It's not enough to give better and dipper preview of the game.

Bad in the X4:
-Too much glitches and bugs, but it could be because of my PC also.
-X4 needs better training quests with more interactions for the new player like me.
-I didn't find solution to watch the X4 videos on you tube playing the game in the same time. When the game is active my second screen is blocked.

Very good game but to play X4 I have to buy new PC.

I have pictures that my wife took as we sat in the waiting area for our once-in-a-lifetime vacation to Australia (and for me to reconnect with my mates down-under) where I'm sitting with my laptop playing (at the time) X3.  I love the attention to detail and the simulation of a living chain of systems. A lot of games ""come to life"" only when the player is within proximity - but for all of the X-series games I've played, the systems are very much active and alive. Events happening - traders, ships and stations are always active and something is going on. Your actions (or in-actions) have consequences.  This is definitely a game where you can really see the cohesion and effect of both your strategy and tactics come together. It is such a rare trait in gaming that when you it coming together in X4:Foundations, it will simply just pull you in. Authors and readers of good books often discuss the quality of immersion (called versimilitude) for their stories. Some stories, some books and some games have this in varying degrees. X4:Foundations delivers this in true tonnage. I rarely write that much about games or review products - only the really bad ones and the really good ones. I am pleased to say that X4:Foundations is one of the really good ones. Probably not for everyone - we all look for different things, but if you at all enjoy the genre of survival, adventure and even empire building, you likely will not be disappointed at all.

Flight is cool though, you have different types of flight assistance that can make things confusing, but full control, including absolutely no inertia control, if you want, to fly totally manually, which is the most fun in combat I think I've had in a space game. It's NPCS, but so far, the combat is fun and satisfying.

 if in doubt about flying chart your course with M and let autopilot do the driving. You don't need a landing computer mark II. Learn to land, until then, hire the first guy you see on the dock in black hole to pilot any ships you get that don't come with them, you can afford these people, and you won't be able to much anywhere else yet at all, so go ahead.  They'll do the autopiloting and the docking and all you gotta do is go stand on the deck and they'll fly you around, another reason not to get a landing comp mark II ( like all the YT vids tell you to do lol )
You can do pretty much anything you can do from a cockpit vicariously through the M menu. 

Flying around in a space game is fun, but simulating being flown around in a space game is just downright relaxing. And there are tons of missions and stuff to do, you have to watch who you work for so you don't piss off your best allies, so that has more than a lot of games in terms of depth.

Couple mods are probably a good idea. I am using tatertrade and it's great. You can quickly just explore, have the gem fly around and update trade stations and join the free trade union and get a small freighter. Just let it rock and you have money coming in. Sweet.

However, I can't honestly recommend it unless you have a lot of patience to put up with its ""quirks"", or you were a major fan of the previous games. 

The number-one irritation is the piloting AI, it seems to delight in acting in the most frustrating manner possible, never doing exactly what you want it to or behaving as you'd expect it to.
The flight mechanics are clunky and unsatisfying - fighters will trundle along, taking forever to get into the incredibly short weapon ranges, and then handle like a brick when they get there.
There's a whole pile of minor irritations and issues that would be fine on their own, but together manage to yank you out of any immersion you find on a very frequent basis.

The game is however very immersive and impressive when it's not being frustrating. Ships coming and going in massive hangars, freighters steadily plying the space-lanes - representations of the macro-scale economy ticking away all around you. This is what X4 is best at, and if you like building a commercial empire this will hook you for a good while - until it comes to defending that empire and your warfleet decides the best way to attack the enemy would be slowly move to the other side of the sector, and then break formation and rush into the enemy one by one.

It's also has a lot of bad features that you don't see in other games too. Still don't even know if I like the X series having played this and rebirth for over 200 hours between them. 

It probably has the most features of any space game, but none of the features land unfortunately, thanks to poor UI and AI. 

The actual sandbox is quite poor with very little of note outside of stations, so don't expect any sight seeing or even the zone variation found in rebirth. 

It's fun to be able to fly any type of ship, and Dock them all, like taking an S to M, then piloting the M to an L and so on. This is something rebirth badly needed, but I don't think that's enough to say this is a good game. Considering this is their umpteenth release in this series I'd have definitely hoped for more.

In summary this is a vast space simulator where nothing really connects that you will find kinda disappointing if you are looking for any form of excitement. If you like organising fleets and trading via a poorly laid out set of menu's you're in for a treat though.

When you start the game, things are grim. If you have missions they are probably long term ones that you can't work on yet. Except for that one mission asking you to spend money for a pilot you don't need, that gives you nothing for it. You're lost there with nothing to do, almost no money to trade stuff, and looking at the prices in the systems you start on, no clear trade route that would be profitable to you. You can't buy a miner without selling your starter ship. So with what you have it feels like you can do nothing.

Then you look at guides and all you see are stuff that seem like half exploits. Like you have a few consumables hidden in your ship (not in storage, mounted on your ship, like satellites and nav beacons) that you can sell from the get go to get decent amount of cash. You can mine crystals, they go in your player inventory, so you don't need a miner for this, in fact a small nimble ship is better for the job. 
At this point I was thinking that the game design was very questionable if there was any. Nothing works as you expect it to do. So you have to forget about trying to do things your way and rely on following guides, or at least read a bunch of them at the start. 

But somehow, when you start getting things going. Even through the crashes, the 20 minute long loading screens every time you load a save, the bad graphics, and all the awfulness that this game provide, you find yourself hooked. By pure capitalistic magic. 
Probably because this game is so tedious it feels like a job you should get paid for. You find yourself immersed. When you finally get comfortable making money on your own, the game finally gives you decent missions. Thanks game, I needed those 10 hours ago.
And after playing for a little while, the scale of the game hits you. X4 universe is actually quite big, and getting your own station for a humble pilot like you is simply absolutely unaffordable. But if you order a bunch of ships around and afk for days, you might end up rich enough to build one after all. And then a station is nothing. You can make bigger ones, you can make more of them, you can claim your own systems, you can put together big fleets and go to war. Or you can go back to do one man missions or go exploring on your own and try to make sense of this universe. 
In a sense, the broke, miserable beginning really put what you will become in perspective. Because the number of 0s on your bank account by then will multiply a whole lot.

See I have almost only negative things to say about this game. Yet I enjoy it more that the other space sims I played. The magic that makes this game good is just hard to explain. I think it's a similar magic that makes cookie clickers somewhat enjoyable, as simple as they are (the ones that don't actually require you to spam clicks). But this one is not simple. It's massive, it's vast, it's hard to comprehend, and you get to live your own little adventures in this big space, while you build your financial empire and keep raking on ever bigger profits.",1657634792,1657634792,True,9,2,0.631316006183624268,0,True,False,False

At about 16 hours in, I feel I am starting to get a firm grasp on the basic mechanics and have pretty well digested the nearly mandatory period of let's plays, looking up information in the forums, and the series of in-game tutorials. I even understand what *most* of the icons on the HUD represent now! 

Did the Terran Cadet (DLC) start and feel that is a great way to learn the game. The controls seem a little odd at first, but after a while the game logic will become apparent more often then not and I personally do not find the default scheme nearly as obtuse as some new players do. I use a Controller (PS4) with K/M and a keyboard shortcut overview on my 2nd monitor. To me, the split controls are pretty immersive, and I feel like my controller is the joystick or flight yoke, while the keyboard is the instrument panel(s) in my cockpit. Sort of turns my desk into a virtual spaceship! 

I feel I have yet to even scratch the surface of this overlooked gem and love the way I can play it at my own pace, in my own way. The many different and distinct starts are a testament to the games versatility, that is unmatched in the genre. Reminds me of classics like Privateer, Dark Star One, and the classic X games, but, at least to me, blows them out of the water.

This has happened on two separate computers and if not being able to use the map, give commands, change weapon orders, the game is just broken.  

Pros: Beautiful game, lots of mods if you want them, and would be one to invest heavily into in regard to time as the difficulty increases. 

Cons: The performance is so inconsistent.  While I should be getting an easy 100 fps, it drops to 10 often when near anything or jumping into sectors.  Its not a hardware problem as i'm running fairly high end computers.   The trade commands built into the game are broken, if you choose a trader to trade for a commander with more than one type of material thats is gas or mineral, its will only mine one.

It's realistic, immersive, and I've been kinda obsessed with it since I started playing it a few months ago. It has a lot of moving parts, is governed less by 'gamy' mechanics and limitations, and more by physics. The game gives you an enormous truly sandbox universe that is partially procedurally generated for you to play with, and doesn't treat you like a monkey.

Stuff I like
Missions - There's a decent selection of different mission types you can take on, and the type of missions available directly relate to the happenings to that mission giver and the sector they're in. What I mean by this is if a station has been attacked recently, it's highly likely they'll request repairs as a mission. Additionally if there is enemy fleet presence in the system blowing up merchant ships, missions will trigger asking for help to import/access materials and for help in repelling the threat. I love that. It makes you feel like the missions matter, and thus so does your assistance as the player.

Dynamic economy - Everything in the universe is governed by availability of resources and the ability to refine them into more complex goods, wares, ships, and further manufacturing facilities. The AI is beholden to the limitations of every part of the manufacture and supply chains required to create a thing. This was a big drawback for me from a game like Elite Dangerous, where the AI made X amount of a thing available to the player, and would make no more until they subtracted a given amount of whatever commodity that was. Could they make more? Yes. Do they? No. Why? Because you're not allowed to capitalise too much on a good thing. In X4 Foundations, invoke your inner (or outer) Teladi and capitalise away. Can you corner markets? Yes. Starve stations of resources? Yes. Can they produce when starved? No. Can you create trade monopolies? Yes. Everything the AI does and everything you do really matters.

Living universe - The AI factions war with one another in wars that make sense, and are restricted by things like their manufacturing capacity, not a hard lock on what, how much, where, and when they can manufacture and deploy. There are definitely counters to threats to keep them from spiralling way out of control in a way that makes the game un-fun or unplayable, but there's no magic involved here. Instead of 'if X faction has conquered X amount of territory, summon henceforth the magical fleet of overwhelming whoopage to go wreck face', there are factions whose duty it is to contain/counter the threat. So they mobilise. This doesn't necessarily mean they win, though. But it's stimulus and reaction, balanced neatly in a way that's lore friendly, with no guaranteed outcome. This makes every playthrough different.

Sandbox - You can really do whatever you want. The game has some missions and background lore from previous games in the X series, but you are neither beholden to it, nor even 'strongly encouraged' to become part of a linear story-line. There is story-line, well, there are multiple, but you can choose to engage with them or not. Or even do a bit, decide nah scientist dudey man, I'm gonna do something that doesn't involve talking to you. It gives you something to do if you find yourself at a loss, but you can pick it up and put it down whenever you want.

Avatars roaming around stations and your ships with their own voices and faces; who you can hire, fire, order to fly your ship whilst you take it easy.

You can exit your ship after docking, walk around the station, chat to some peeps, watch other ships fly in, dock, and leave... go shopping at traders... watch the dude run out and clean the gunk off your ship real quick... hell you don't even need to wait for the ship to dock. Ever wondered what it's like to be adrift in an EVA suit with limited oxygen out in the expansive vacuum of space? Pff you can do that even when you're right in the middle of a major fleet engagement. Y'know. For a better view?

There are plentiful tools given to you to customise the behaviour of your ships and stations to make them do exactly what you want with a comprehensive level of detail.

If you see it, you can build it. 

The map is enormous

Stuff I don't like
User Interface - Whilst it has a delicious amount of options and things to play around with, the presentation it more akin to financial accounting software I've used. It's kinda clunky and is counter-intuative. To access a ship you own from the map menu, you find them under your map menu, rather than under 'personal' or their own 'property' tab. Then you can right-click them to open a context menu (with a tonne of actions you can order them to complete) to give them an immediate order to execute. However their general behaviour and queued orders are displayed under 'information', which opens up a sub-menu on the left of the screen, and is a different interface to control your ships. It requires a lot of time and attention, so I tend to let my pilot fly my ship from a to b whilst I queue up orders for my new additions.

In-game knowledge base/encyclopedia - There is a pretty comprehensive encyclopedia in-game, but the presentation makes it daunting. It's menus and sub-menus with a little box over the right that may or may not give you the information you need about a thing. This makes learning the game difficult for the player to work out where objects fit inside the confines of the game world. For example. A heuristic core. What is it? Should you buy one? What does it do? Is it a trade ware? Are they rare? Should you hold onto it for use at a later stage, scope out somewhere you can sell it for a nice fat profit, or drop it like a bag of weed? The encyclopedia provides you with nothing to assist you with making decisions like this.

Tutorials - The new flight school for piloting is pretty good. It will give you a good understanding of flight controls, and I kinda dig the guy teaching you is one of my fellow countrymen. That tutorial though is a self-contained experience, and the game doesn't tell you that. I expected upon completion of flight school that I would get maybe a little cash bonus, some kind of accessible license with my mug shot and begin my career as a certified pilot. Turns out the game wants you to exit out of the flight school and start a game from scratch. This was not made obvious, and thus wasted a lot of time after completion of training wandering around trying to see if I already had a ship, if I could buy one, and otherwise how to get started. There is a fairly comprehensive list of in-game tutorials, but I found them tedious, and really counter-intuitive. I don't use them. Instead I browse for solutions in the forums or Let's Players; of which there are some fantastic tutorials.

No fuel requirement - Minor gripe. I like having to plan routes and fuel usage through friendly and hostile areas. I like the strategy aspect that brings, and makes faction opinion a much more important factor.

The bad can be proven by the fact the number 1 mod is the cheat engine. All X games feel like the devs have never played them and this game is just as guilty as the rest.

Major issue one is the AI pathing. Most of the time the AI is fine, but other times you get it repeatedly driving straight into part of a station because it's trying to dock with your ship on the other side of said station.

Major issue two relates somewhat to the AI pathing but not entirely. Specifically, quite often the AI will, instead of accelerating at travel speed towards the destination and pulling out at a reasonable distance, they'll drop out of travel speed almost exactly half-way to the target and travel the remaining 100km+ at several hundred meter's a second. It takes a very long time.

Major issue 3 Station building. Or specifically, rotating objects in station building. It is the most unintuitive set of controls I have ever experienced. I spent 40 minutes trying to get that stupid silicon wafer production facility to rotate in the right direction. I did everything I could and in the end, it just refused to work. Please, for the sake of my sanity, devs, if you read this, add a method to control the rotation with keys or buttons on the screen. Please.

Except the ship was moving and it's  cruising speed was faster than mine, so I couldn't catch it. I didn't have a docking computer, so when I could get near it, it wanted me to manually dock which was not even possible. Had to abandon the mission. Second mission I accepted was to find mines and blow them up. Except the game wouldn't show me where they were. Mission step said ""Find the Void"" except, space is all a void, technically, isn't it?

Clipping through walls while docking is stupid. 

I found out I could pickup stuff that was floating in space. Except I couldn't. I could pickup some things and not others. Saw a note about two different sizes/types of cargos but it disappeared before I could figure out what it said. My ship said ""Cargo capacity 150 m3"" and the bar appeared to be filled in, but I when I could find a cargo list, it didn't show size, only value. I sold everything, but it still seemed to show the 150 m3 was full. Why is the interface soooo bad? I've played lots of space trading games and they all seem to show clearly what you have, how much space it takes and how much is left. How hard is that?

I died when I tried to escape from an enemy by entering ""travel mode"" (warp?) and then I tried to look at the map. You apparently can't do those two things at the same time. Couldn't get travel mode to re-engage after that and hull go boom.

There's ""long range scanning"" and ""short range scanning"". Long range scanning works like you would expect. Short range scanning is to find radio leaks in structures? WTF?

The tutorial showing how to blow up storage doors on derelicts to find a lockbox was exceptionally crude. You're using a laser to blow up locks but they don't even look like locks. The door on the ship doesn't really look like a door, either. And of course, the door to re-enter your ship isn't well marked and was also difficult to identify.

In 40-odd hours (at time of posting), I've bug into the inside of station meshes, the insides of various large ships, had a save game entirely disappear (taking 20+ hours of progress with it), and suddenly found myself in the interior of one of my freighters which was suddenly docked even though it should have been outside autotrading - and the ship I [i]was[/i] inside was nowhere to be found.  (it appeared out of nowhere when I told it to fly to a spot in space from a menu.)

Speaking of menus...  I've played X2, X3, and X Rebirth and all their DLC; four of the things Egosoft has excelled at with the X series is unnecessarily complicating things, appallingly bad UI, teaching new players how to swim by throwing them in at the deep end with their feet wrapped in chains, and horrifying character animations.  Well, the animations are better.  Not good, but...better.

There is so much potential for greatness here: fleet command, production chains, r&d of components, proper ship interiors you can walk around in while an NPC does the flying (and fighting!) for you... And it's ruined by stupid things like not easily being able to locate your ships beyond which system they're in (they can be BIG, and very busy), and notification not being recorded or accessible so if you're using the map and can't get back to the main screen in time you'll never be able to tell whoever that was not to go poke that Xenon K with a stick.

If you're one of the smallish group who actually liked XR, then this one might appeal to you.

I'm still giving this game a 'good' review at the end of the day because Steam only allows a thumbs up or thumbs down, and I think overall the game has more good than bad. I've known exactly what I wanted to say about this game for the past several dozen hours and since my opinion hasn't changed, it's now time to put my thoughts into a review. I had a lot of fun with this game, but there are three huge aspects of this game which really hold it back: the user interface (UI), the artificial intelligence (AI), and the Developers themselves.

I'm leaving out the good stuff I like about this game, because Steam will only let me write so much. Like I said, there is more good than bad (not sure by how much), but I think it's more important to lay out the bad and give it a 'thumbs up' to let you figure out the good on your own.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[b][u]The UI[/u][/b]
My god. Whoever is in charge of the UI decisions for this game needs to be fired. Not using hyperbole or exaggerating. Straight up, needs to be fired. In the video game industry, UI decisions like these kind of don't need the user's approval - most of the user's are children - they kind of have us by the balls. But no other UI in the commercial world could get away with being this horrible without someone losing their job over it.

There are people who specialize in user experience and how to do this, to which I have some knowledge of myself (I am a backend developer myself, but I do get involved in front end design frequently). The abbreviated and massively over-simiplified version is that if a user is used to a certain experience, you don't just create a whole new UI that will frustrate and confuse them.

Even on a smaller scale, the radar when you're piloting and engaging other ships doesn't show you a proper sight picture of what is around your ship. It basically looks at a narrow cone that is mostly below the nose of your ship, and only small amounts to the left, right and behind the ship. The developer would probably say 'as designed' and try to cite real world radar systems, but that's a cop out excuse for a game that is literally riddled with science fiction, impossibly fake, in an arcade space shooter (you can't play the realistic card in an arcade space shooter. It's like saying a diet coke is healthy). It gets worse when you're fighting other ships and the UI doesn't allow you see other ships in front of you to click on them (they're dots against the blackness of space at 1-2km out).

Placing stations is horrendous. Viewing the map is horrendous because it shares the same control scheme as placing stations, with the added turd idea that you can't move the camera along the Z axis in the map! Clicking in and out of menus is horrendous because of how the UI reorients itself all the time. I could go on and on about the UI, but there's a lot there and you'll just have to trust me that most of it is terrible.

[b][u]The AI[/u][/b]
Holy crap. Wow it's really, really bad. So to get out ahead of it, the game has something called pilot skill and morale which is supposed to be along the lines of 'bad pilot no fly gud'. I get that. Except that all pilots 'no fly gud'.  Steam only lets me write so much, so I'll give you a few examples instead of explaining to no end.

The AI pilots have a mechanism where they can 'flee' if they're being pirated or attacked. K...except why is it that when they're attacked, they literally stop dead in their tracks, turn around, and fly back into the other ship that is attacking them!? I've lost so, so many traders to this. I've seen a fighter in a fighter squadron I have defending an area, stop dead in it's tracks in the middle of a swarm of enemy fighters and not move for a good 5 seconds while being strafed. There's a hazardous zone where a miner will fly right into it and sit there, allowing himself to die (developer says this is 'intended', but I've never stepped my foot into a molten steel tank and then continued to stand there while in excruciating pain as I die without thinking to DERP take my foot out of the molten steel tank).

Combat mechanics in this game have a more simplistic heuristics if the player is not around to see the fight occurring, so you will frequently see players talk about 'you should be out of sector while X is happening' to compensate for how truly awful the AI is. The above examples I have given, were when I was out of sector though (and believe me there are more out-of-sector examples to give). So if everyone tries to get around the truly abysmal AI by being out of sector, and out of sector is that bad, then how bad is in-sector AI? I once wanted to see 2 of my own destroyers fight an enemy destroyer that I had the drop on, so I could see it in a cinematic camera angle. I watched them slowly move forward for a couple seconds, fire the guns at the enemy that was practically stationary at that point, miss by about 1km off when my own ship was only about 4-5km away (impressive to be that bad), engage his travel drive to get close, literally parks himself within .5-1km away from the enemy destroyer, miss the main guns again. All the while the enemy destroyer's turrets had completely knocked out my destroyer's shields and then started damaging the ship before my ship finally started hitting the enemy. This isn't an isolated experience either.

[b][u]The Devs[/u][/b]
The previous two points tie right to here. Because the developers have been told about these issues, and the whole community agrees it's stupid. The developers, very obnoxiously, will claim there is no problem and say it's expected. I refuse to even engage with the dev after I've seen how they talk to the community. I wouldn't call them toxic, perse, but they very obnoxiously refuse to acknowledge any issue and always just say the community is wrong. ""Working as designed"", I've seen them say...but I don't care if you designed it that way or not, that just means you came up with a really horrendously bad design. Fix your design then. They tried to claim that the hazardous zone I previously mentioned was ""working as designed"" for instance, saying that there are ship mods you can apply to your ship to allow them to get in there. Except the ship mods will only allow large ships to get in there, which need mining drones to mine, and DERP ship mods don't apply to drones. Not working as designed: it's a bad design. Also, the AI (oh man back to AI!!!) is so bad that the ships you never wanted to be there end up there for various reasons anyway. They claim you can restrict and all sorts of stuff, which is true, but that's like me coming to your house and telling your child, very specifically, not to go to Detroit and put their mouth on the hot exhaust pipe of a car. Why would I restrict your child from doing that? Are they so stupid that they have to be told that?

Let me get this straight, this is a game with at least 4 hyper intelligent races of sentient beings (one of which actually created real AI which makes up the key enemy of the game), and you're telling me I have to explicitly tell them not to put a metal fork in the electrical socket (i.e. don't fly into a hazardous zone and then just sit there as you slowly die). Huge turnoff to have such obnoxious devs insisting we're wrong despite their horrendous design.

Good game overall, but man I could go on for days with these 3 cons. Really makes the late game massively un-fun.",1656108542,1656261855,True,76,3,0.820745587348937988,5,True,False,False

However I have never had performance this god awful. I'm talking everything on setting below the low preset with no AA or anything and I am consistently jumping between 100+ fps in some areas then to <10 fps in others and it's really unfortunate because that <10 is at stations and busy space battles which happens to be a pretty big part of the game. I looked into it out of curiosity if it was just a me issue and no, there's tons of thread about performance issues. Supposedly it's something to do with the map as each bit you reveal adds more to your map which is being constantly being checked and as such system resources are being devoured by that and it can be mitigated by disabling bits and pieces of the map but TBH the gain was minor for me personally.

As for the actual game it's really good looking at it from what little i got to play. If you played Elite Dangerous I want you to imagine that but with it being single player, you have a MUCH larger impact on the universe, the ability to build your own ships and stations, and the ability to manage several other ships. Seems great and from what I played so far the grind isn't bad at all. In about 2 hrs of serious play (as in I knew some of the controls and knew how to find missions) on a save I had managed to buy a second ships and staff it with crew and had it running around supporting me while I did various missions in my slightly upgraded first ship. I don't know how that scales later but that was my experience for what it's worth.

It kills me because this is extremely early game and im hooked yet I'm also finding out the issues will get worse the longer I play.

I am very weary when buying new space sim games, because nearly every space sim since the now ancient PC game ""Freelancer"", has sucked absolute @ss. The X series however, has always had a good reputation, and X4 did not fail to exceed my expectations. When it comes to space sims, there is no game that can stand next to X4. Now, that doesn't mean it is perfect, or that there is no room for improvement. There will always be room for improvement, but I will go into greater details below. 

First, I want to say that you should buy, and play this game if you enjoy space sims. You won't regret it. Unless you are a Star Citizen d!ck rider or something. 

Second, I will be honest with you, and tell you that at times, this game will make you want to break everything near you. There are bugs, and strange things that will happen that could possibly finish sending you over the edge. I advise seeking therapy, before you do anything rash.

For example, the way your Large and XLarge ships will dive bomb stations, will have you losing millions, to more than hundreds of millions of dollars in less than 30 seconds, IF you are in system. IF you are not in system, they will slowly, moderately, almost lovingly, whittle the space platform down, and destroy it, with zero, or almost zero losses (unless you send fighters and corvettes). 

The learning curve, and discovering the way that fleet management works, will have you raging at times, but once you figure out how things work, around game play hour 400 (most likely longer, I sh!t thee not,) you will no longer have that many issues any more. I strongly, STRONGLY advise you to think everything through, for at least 30 minutes during your first few hundred hours or so in this game. You will thank yourself later.

Lastly though, I will also let you know, that if you stick with this game, you won't regret it. The pay off is high, and you will enjoy what X4 can offer you over and over again, play through after play through. Will you sit there, thinking of ways the game could be better? Yes. Will you wish a few things were different here and there? Yes. Most issues can be handled with a mod or two though, so keep that in mind as well. Yet, this game will keep giving you one hell of a time, if you keep at it.

In closing, wait no longer. Buy this game, get the expansions. Then play, rage, seek therapy, overcome, revel in victory, and leave your constructive feedback for the developers, so they can make this game, and hopefully the next one, even better.

At first I almost considered returning this game due to its very complicated controls and unconventional design choices. However, after giving the game a fair chance I can honestly say it's very enjoyable.  This is the space game I've been looking for.

Pros:
- a true space RPG sandbox (take on quests, battle, trade, build, produce goods, smuggle, salvage, piracy, follow the story or go your own way; the choice is truly yours)
- diverse activities allow players to break the monotony of doing the same task over and over.
- ""space legs"" adds a little extra immersion to make the universe feel ""lived in"". It's nice to just stand up and walk around sometimes.  Even if the places we can go are limited at least we're not restrained to a pilot's seat all the time.
- ""space legs"" here isn't a mandatory First Person Shooter mode! OMG, I'm so tired of devs and/or publishers thinking the only reason to get up from the pilot seat is to go shoot stuff! Thankfully Egosoft does not shove an assault rifle in our hands every time we stand up!
- mod support; community created mods can add content and provide much needed QoL improvements. mods are available on the Steam Workshop and Nexusmods

Cons:
- complicated controls and systems may be overwhelming at first
- some of the older gamestarts drop you in to the universe with no guidance or breadcrumb quest to follow (somewhat canceled out by newer expansion gamestarts providing a much better new player experience)
- lack of a proper character creation system is a little disappointing. we only see our character briefly in a few cinamatics (or through ship windows in external view) but still it would have been nice to be able to easily create my own character appearance from the available resources. It's an overlooked aspect of immersion here and a missed opportunity for player engagement.
- ""we don't need physics where we're going!""- The player controlled ship and personal spacesuit (EVA) flight mostly obeys Newtonian physics. AI controlled ships frequently ignore physics in specific situations. This can sometimes be immersion breaking like when station traffic performs impossible manuvers and when your ship captain or autopilot performs an impossible 90 degree direction change at jump gates and accelerators.  On rare (combat related) occasions this can feel unfair, but it balances out once you learn the quirks in AI behavior and/or are commanding your own fleets of AI controlled ships.
There's a lot going on in this game and it runs amazingly well on my potato of a computer. It obviously uses shortcuts to reduce processing of everything ""Out Of Sector"" (OOS) as well as In Sector ships beyond render distance and low priority things within render distance like station traffic. It's not a perfectly polished and totally immersive experience, but it's not totally game breaking either.

When you click ""New Game"" you get a choice of various ""game starts""; 3 Tutorials, 4 ""Foundations"" story lines, and 2 additional story lines for each expansion you own. Each of these has a pre-generated protagonist, you don't get to make your own character. Tides of Avarice allows a little more flexibility allowing players to choose between a male or female character for both of its game starts.
Game starts determine your character species, gender, appearance, starting ship, starting location, and starting money. A few unlockable gamestarts allow players to skip a set of tutorial missions that grant ownership of a ""free"" station once the quests have been completed at least once.

There are also ""Custom Game Editor"" gamestarts that allow a budgeted or creative starting point, though ""budgeted"" is only available to un-modded clients. These allow players to choose a character appearance from a pre-generated set that includes all the Foundations and expansion gamestarts characters except for the Tides of Avarice pirate/smuggler characters. Hopefully they will add these in the future (or someone may figure out how to add them a mod).

Once you start and know how to work the controls you can pretty much go where you want and do whatever you want.  Set your own goals. Look up tutorials if you want more in-depth guidance from other players or just discover as you go.  The universe can be yours.

I don't want the multiplayer exprience they are working on and that Elite was built around, but the ability to get out of your ship and explore, repair and walk around is fantastic. The scale of it all is fantastic and the mods just make this game endlessly fun. All the things that make this game great I've always thought were missing on Elite dangerous, and so I'm converted. I've spent hours on this game already. Its got a fairly steep learning curve, but no more so that Elite and frankly you learn as you go. The graphics are fine, not as good as Elite, neither are the flight dynamics or physics, but to be able to get behind the wheel of a 18km long battleship and command a fleet of ships to do your bidding has its own rewards.

You get to decide how some major events play out to shape the galaxy you play in.  Some things with the ai leave for much to be desired, but it's ai and i think the game creators want you to be doing it more than just letting them do it.  The functions on the ai are not very complex, even through the commands you can give them and the default orders you can set to them.

You can own and fly any ship in the game, with the exception of the Xenon and Kha'ak ships.  So everything from fighters, to freighters, to carriers and battleships.  And there are many to choose from, from the multiple races in the game.  On top of this you can own and build space stations of varying types.

I suppose you could can easily look all of that up for yourself.  There's a ton of info out there and videos.

With X4 I found that they also created it to run natively in Linux.  As well as they have made use of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR).  Basically this allows you to get better than native image quality and much higher framerates, even with older video cards.  Very nice on both counts.

The game isn't without it's bugs.  The AI can be a bit finicky sometimes.  In some cases it's better to do certain jobs yourself, in others it better to get out of a sector and allow your ships to do their thing.  When you are out of sector the physics of things in that sector do not apply.  Ships don't need a lot of time to line up for docking and such, they just dock, or fly through a gate or whatever when they get close.  And when fighting, there's no friendly fire when you are out of the sector.  But some things are a bit odd.  Like battleships being able to turn 180 instantly, or zip around in travel mode almost endlessly during a fight.  Or just buggering off from a fight for no reason at all.  But....it's not that bad.

Gameplay:

The game has a lot of variety and looks great. You can go as deep as you want, follow the story, or go solo and just figure out what you want to do it's completely up to you. This is both an achievement but also a curse. It is way to easy to get confused in X4 and be at a complete loss on what to do next.. The common mantra is that if you're lost do something else for a while but from a game-play perspective that just isn't acceptable.

Much of this confusion is in part to the terrible GUI and interfaces that EGOSOFT has largely ignored since release. This is a shame because poor user interface keeps potential players away from ever trying. This is a common criticism, many say it has a 'steep' learning curve but that should be reserved to direct elements like flying ships not getting around a menu.

Art and Style:

The artistic style is no where near as stylish as X Rebirth and is very inconsistent in some places but not bad. NPC characters need some serious love as they are very poor quality in par with PS3 character models. From stiff animation, asset loading issues, and poor voice over the NPC characters very quickly disconnects the player from their immersion.

Ship design is amazing and is a credit to those who design and model the ships however, they are more look that feature. Show the player their cargo, let the player interact with features. The new Yacht ship for example has a bed, desks, bars, etc. but it's purely visual with zero engagement. Understanding this is new territory for Egosoft but would be something worth investing in.

Stations are very generic when compared to the stylised stations of X Rebirth, XR had a cyberpunk brutalist look to it that just worked so well but in X4 everything looks to be designed by Apple. Give us gritty and dirty space.",1637873222,1655195354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing this series since X2, and apart from X:Rebirth this is by far the most disappointing of them, and probably the iteration in the worst state after a few years. Unfortunately Egosoft have repeatedly shown that they're more interested in churning out DLC after DLC in a cash grab rather than fixing basic, fundamental issues with the game.

Performance is terrible, and hasn't seen much if any of an improvement since the initial release. There's no real multithreading optimisation to take advantage of modern CPUs and simply rendering a ship in the custom start menus pushes my 3070 Ti to the point where it's a viable replacement for central heating in winter.

User experience is just as bad, it's as if they sat down and had long, involved meetings about how they could make the worst, most needlessly frustrating interface and user experience possible. It's a micromanagement clickfest hell, not helped by AI that's still substandard years and several major patches after launch. Mods can help ameliorate this but they shouldn't be needed for such a basic thing. As with performance, Egosoft seem to be more interested in developing new content than fixing.

Station design now has it's own interface, but it's clunky, frustrating and filled with baffling interface decisions so bad that they again make you wonder if they actually made a deliberate effort to create the worst user experience possible. 

Where they have spent significant time and effort is on the utterly pointless gimmick of allowing players to walk around stations and large ships. There's no actual gameplay or risk involved in the walkarounds, it's incredibly janky, the models and animations are terrible and there's nothing that couldn't be done via menus with less player time wasted. It's a pointless indulgence that seems to have consumed far too much of the budget, as well as requiring the removal of an entire species because they couldn't manage the water effects necessary for an aquatic race. To re-emphasise, this ""feature"" adds absolutely no gameplay at all, forces the player to waste time walking about poorly designed interiors that wouldn't be out of place in a 2010 FPS and has actually resulted in the removal of content from previous games.

But if you do persevere through all these issues, what do you get? A thoroughly average space combat game where you'll find your AI controlled fleet to be as much of a hindrance as a help, an economic simulation that for all its performance impact doesn't even match the depth and complexity of The Patrician 4, an open world with few rewards for exploration and a dynamic strategy layer that frequently breaks the game due to overpowered enemy factions destroying the poorly balanced economy before the player is in a state to prevent them doing so.

Ambitious? Yes. So was Daikatana, and it managed about the same level of quality as this still unpolished turd.",1654273231,1654973672,False,4,2,0.539726972579956055,0,True,False,False

5.00 version is broken like we haven't seen before. The game became load screen watching simulator. Seriously, I go cook dinner while the game is loading (from SSD). Moreover, every 30 minutes or so you have to reload because of random bugs or just usual Ego bullsнit (glitching into walls, fps drops to 1 until you restart the game, etc).

Global AI is even worse. At 15 hours into the game I see Xenon-I casually going on safari, clearing entire sectors and ending up in Teladi core space, and nothing can even scratch it. Fun thing, I even can't buy an L ship because I've just earned +20 rank and the damn I-branch is sitting near the only shipyard that can build it for me. Meanwhile, the faction I'm in war with by plot, sends destroyers to annoy me in the most backyard sectors of the universe while I'm trying to do some simple missions.

Wing Commander: Privateer, Freelancer and Rebel Galaxy give you that action space flight sim experience that lets you get a taste of what it's like to be in the boots of Han Solo.  Elite Dangerous does the same thing from a pure simulation experience.  No Man's Sky kind of delivers there, but tends to lean heavily into the Stanley Kubrick Space Odyssey quasi-MMO territory.  X goes approaches the character of Han Solo from the point of view from a Wall Street trader - X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude certainly felt like that with the amount of spreadsheets you had to navigate on top of the emphasis on economic market forces.  As first impressions go, the X3 series took a bit of getting used to and eventually opened up into one of the best space trading experiences.  X Rebirth tried to take the franchise in a interesting direction by returning you to an actual cockpit, but you could only ever actively control the Albion Skunk as opposed to swapping between the ships within your own fleet.  After playing X4...  You're not just trying to become the next self-made galactic emperor (eg ""Space"" Trump, Musk, Branson, Besos, etc.), this is Grand Theft Auto in space (especially when you venture out into making a dishonest living) - Just don't leave your prized ship unattended on public dock overnight...  Some thieving mongrel stole mine when I tried that!
Everything I loved about the X3 series is more or less back (and then some) here in X4 learning from the mistake of Rebirth by perfecting everything that worked!  All that makes for an incredibly immersive space trader simulation experience.  But DAMN!  As technical as landing your ships is, it's an intuitive enough process you can master and actually enjoy after nailing that perfect touchdown!  Space combat?  Big guns that blow $%@# up!!!  But seriously, I thought I was going to be setting up my CH 3-Piece (Fighterstick, Pro Throttle & Pro Pedals) HOTAS suite and flying high in XPlane or Elite Dangerous...  To my surprise, X4 is proving to be that one game that supports my setup and gets the most action with my HOTAS!
If you have a beefy rig that is capable of supporting Raytracing (or something similar) and/or VR comfortably, X4 is definitely the ticket for anyone looking for a space trading combat simulator that lets you build your own private galactic empire!",1654669750,1654669750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But unlike X3 this is something with far less of a setting, far less of a meaningful universe and significantly more emphasis on emergent gameplay, sandbox freeroam and self-set goals.

The whole thing is incredibly player-centric and universe blatantly exists solely for you. Not my style at all - tried to like it  but unless your idea of fun is to grind for weeks to get an an enormous fleet and eradicate a random faction whose demise does not even get acknowledged in the game, seriously steer clear. This is an attempt to make a singleplayer EVE while failing to implement story arcs but doubling up on the spreadsheets. Nvm UI has gone backwards from X3 and plays like something from early 90s B-list.

X4 is WAY better than Rebirth and i love the drive of the company and I support this company and its continued development.  X2 had a great story, and mysterious enemies.  The ships were easily classified and it was easy to tell what each ships role was and its specifications.  There needs to be better menu optimization that makes ship building, ship targeting,  or ship choices more informative in a more passive way where the player doesn't have to rely on stopping what they are doing to become a research specialist and keep print outs  handy of ship specs and go to sites and encyclopedias to figure this out.   X4 is hard as hell to learn and can easily be fixed with some assets they SHOULD be utilizing for an informative and immersive experience such as the information/data screen in the cockpit which if used correctly and had some interactivity to it cold be a better option than having the player lost in pop up menus  as i have to alt tab from the game to go to Egosofts website to look at those ships specs before I make a choice.  The UI needs some work so I don't have to research ships and I can gather stats about them from the HUD.  Why is the data screen on the cockpit HUD still barren, 90% of it is always unused?  This is the most useless screen in the cockpit.  I think if this screen actually had more info on it that can passively tell the player what their target ships armaments are, such as turrets, personnel, weakened structural points, reputation, cargo scan options, and just general stuff the player SHOULD be informed about verses the bare basic hull integrity and location.  Why not put buttons in the cockpits for ""get up"" ""autopilot""  ""trade"" and ""scanner functions""  on the that screen?

For starters, the environment were pretty dangerous if you got intercepted by hostile fighter especially at the starting game, resource chain and economy system were pretty complex. There's a lot of ships to choose, along with the variation of parts that can be installed on the ships, including ship modifications, there's also many ways to progress, as a trader, pirates, or just by doing a freelance mission hunting, and finally a community-made mods which is the most important for me.

The reason that cause me to not recommend this game is when I reach the ""end game"" stage where I finish all available story and having multiple decent self sufficient wharf / shipyard. It would hit my performance hard due to the amount of modules rendered on screen also the amount of traders/miners going around to do their stuff.
I have Ryzen 5 5600x overclocked, but it seems this game demand more powerful CPU than mine as this game were CPU intense with no multi-threading. I'm not a game designer so I don't know if it was on purpose. Every npc station i've passed by or within a medium combat struck my fps down to around 40-25 fps, and down to 7-11 fps when on my fully self sufficient shipyard. This last part was the main reason for me to stop playing it.

Plot management, I can't make it smaller, and also when I start with custom game with my saved station added, the plot size were unmatched with the visual representation of the plot itself on the map. There's a workaround for this tho by starting a plot with 10x10x10 and then iirc only expand the + (x+, y+, z+) while keeping the width (probably the y direction and only expand to the top and rear) at 10.

The game main story mostly focused on S size ship and rarely M size, so any destroyers and up were less preferable, I can't flex my XL ship from 5.0 updates + DLC story wise.
The spacesuit would got stuck inside environment if I go and slam in too fast, and I can't do much if you haven't unlock teleportation, load game is one of the solution for this.
Commanding XL ship and having destroyers as escort never works, except on autopilot or commanded by AI, so in large combat, using maps mostly preferable way to utilize multiple L / XL ship fleets.

The AI, they seems doesn't really cares if you were on any size of ships or fleets, a small weak s ship trying to destroy my XL size ship with fleets, that capable to wipe xenon, and also for my S size ship seems doesn't care if they were fighting with well equipped hostile L-XL ships / stations. There's also way to many problems with the AI, I don't want to write it here, it just, so bad.

Reputation system, why only me who had to work hard to raise it and keeping it at good level? when i have multiple useful factories don't they should consider my faction as important since I can supply their station with stuff?

There's a lot of other problems that need be fixed, but for now, I don't recommend this game, except if: you do have better CPU than mine, and don't really care about everything else that I've mentioned above.",1654087818,1654087878,False,3,1,0.538369297981262207,0,True,False,False

It is supposed to be accessed via a link from online features to the egosoft forums. The problem is content people paid for, which was the very incentive made to get people to buy in befoee it was released, is in fact linked to this feature which is down at time of writing, which is also a time where game is currently supported and updated by the offending developer.  Egosoft essentially locked content paid for behind a dead feature, and despite release of a dlc in this time frame, and multiple updates, they have yet to in any way fix the issue. As far as i know, the developer cares more for money from customers than actually supporting the purchases made by said customers. If/when they fix this, i would whole heartedly approve and promote this game, as it is, at its core, a unique and fun product. i just cannot endorse this product's developer, due to such anti supporter practices. 

And let me be perfectly clear. The game is great, and i have loved egosoft for years, despite their history of releasing broken games, since they have proven to fix and support said games over time, which many devs will not or cannot do, but at this time, which is the time of writing, i have not seen such be done for this product, or its supporters from before it was out, hence my great sorrow in not supporting this game. I truely want to support the devs, but i also really want their support. They got my money.

I tired again after about a year. I still see black screens, but for the most part the game restores the screen after a minute or so. Extremely laggy in fights on a 16-core computer, SSD, 64G memory, and 1080Ti video cards. Game frequently pauses, I slam into a capital ship and bounce off damaged. I cannot throw any more hardware at the game.

AI is primitive. Allies are of little use and will actually fly through hazards and loose ships. They also shoot worse than storm troopers. Enemies all target the player, and ignore any allies.

Controls are unwieldy. Context menus in flight? Seriously? Controls are sluggish, but that could be the latency. Targeting is just plain silly. Too much time cycling through targets to look for the one that is actually shooting at me.

Buggy. Signals spawn inside stations. You can get stuck inside asteroids and stations. Sometimes quests bug out and you cannot complete them.

Game is a grind. Sandbox is nice, but it is a slow grind to get anywhere without mods. X4 is not challenging, it is frustrating from the bugs and the slow grind.

Load times are ridiculous. It takes several minutes to load.

I say pass on this one. Good idea, poorly executed.


Original:

I finally got the game to work, but it is glitchy. Black screens, missing menus, and crashes. I have not seen any pattern to the crashes.

The game is very heavily centralized around AI with most of the gameplay not really involving the player at all which would be nice if it weren't for how terrible the AI is. For example I have a trading ship flying around trading and I set two AI fighters to follow and protect the trader ship. The issue lies in how they approach this protecting command. They stay miles away from the ship they're protecting and when the main ship gets attacked, they take years to get to it and by the time they get there the ship is already destroyed. The ai also seem to hate using travel mode to any extent and will often times end up going a ridiculously slow speed when they're still miles off of their target location causing everything to take forever to get accomplished. On top of this, there is no way to make up for your stations accidentally hitting a civilian that got caught in the crossfire of your defense systems.

You can build fleets, fleets fight in space etc etc.

Problems begin when you actually get into the game. Unless you posses a rocket for a PC it will take a long time to load. I have an SSD and it still takes almost 2 minutes to load a save file.
Game lags insanely bad. And i have no idea how they did it. Its a space sim game. 90% of the time there is NOTHING to render yet game staggers 30-55 (very unstable) fps. I did fiddle around with the settings but nothing changed.
Inside space stations (on foot) i get stable 24-32 fps. WHY? the game does not look like anything special. There are no really innovative effects or textures. TBH it looks dated. Especially when you look at character models.

Then comes the controls. Jesus... They couldn't have made it less intuitive. If that's how future will look like then nobody will know how to fucking fly these piece of junks. 
Default keyboard controls are almost always combinations of keys.
shift 1 for whatever the inner system drive name is there
shift 2 for close range scanners
shift 3 long range scanners
shift SPACE for mouse yaw/pitch etc movement.
For some reason acceleration and deceleration are on Z and X. Who tf thought of these?
Enter is for character menu... and Yes you can accept and decline shit with enter as well so GL missclicking in early game and being frustrated cause you by accident abandoned the quest or some other shit. 

I was honestly hoping for Elite Dangerous with actual things to do game but iI got some unoptimized trash with horrible controls.

Maybe it works better with some 600$ joystick that has quantilion of additionall buttons. Keyboard and mouse? fucking painful.

To everybody crying that game takes time to get used to and stuff - player is supposed to have fun from the start of the game cause first hours are the most important moments when first impressions are made. If the game fails at that then the game is fucked up.

Dont get me wrong. People do enjoy the game. I will definitely wait for optimization updates and maybe some custom controls mods cause for now? I just want to kill myself for playing longer then I wanted and cant refund this anymore.

Hours Clocked: 89.7

X4: Foundations is a lovely space sandbox that scratches the itch that some of the other games can't seem to scratch. I play and enjoy them all, but X4 just has a certain charm I cannot get elsewhere. Maybe it is the management of my own space empire. Maybe it is because I can shift from mining to combat to trading to suit my whims. Perhaps, it is just the simple fact that I can do what I want in a world that actually reacts to my actions and the other NPCs.

I've a ship and I can do what I want, go where I wish and scratch whatever itch I have. At first, that doesn't really make it stand out from a few other games that I play and enjoy. Of those, at first glance it is probably around middle of the road for complexity, being deeper in some parts and shallower in others. That really wasn't what hooked me though.

You see, in all those other games while you can have a lot of ships, you can fly one. No escorts, no autonomy, and so they collect space dust while you are off doing whatever it is you want to be doing. in X4, that mining ship you hopped out of can still mine, sell the ore and make you money. Maybe it is out collecting ore for your production chains making you money. Even mining the materials for the production chain to make you even more ships.

Decide to become a space trucker? That miner is still going. Want to go pew pew against a faction you've decided annoys you? That miner is still going. Maybe you want to go back to breaking space rocks. That trade ship can still keep trading and your warship can still pew pew reds. Making money while still making money sounds like a pretty sweet gig in a game where ships can cost millions of credits and you needs lots of those ships to fight wars, be it the trade or military sort.

If this sounds pretty great, it is. However, the game is not without its flaws. The AI has moments of absurdity. Giving orders usually works just fine but sometimes they are so single minded it can get frustrating. Of course, you can set toggles and such to react to various situations which is well and good, if it weren't for another source of frustration.

The UI at times is great at presenting a lot of information and a lot of options. The problem is, the UI has moments where it is showing entirely too much, not enough, or lacks enough context. It is still quite usable and even without watching a fair number of YouTube videos. I rather like having a lot of information on hand and spending time learning how to do stuff, but sometimes found I had to go outside the game for info. This wasn't because it was too complicated, rather it was not explained very well, if at all.

Despite that, I've already got a good number of hours in with roughly 90 hours so far on my first start. My empire is still pretty small as I learn how to do stuff, but the more I learn the more I want to play. The ships don't just look different, they play different and with the ability to customize parts and even tweak those parts, you can make a ship suit your needs.

No spoilers, but I am enjoying the main stories. I'll likely not pay as much attention to them a second time through, but so far they've been entertaining enough to want to see how it plays out. Being able to watch the world react to my actions, as well as the other factions reacting to one another is also enjoyable.

Overall my recommendation of X4: Foundations is Recommended.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
    [*]World is interesting and reacts to your actions and one another. Use war and trade to fit your needs.
    [*]Customize your ships, your stations and your empire to suit your style.
    [*]Want a cool ship you saw? Save for a few exceptions, you can find it, buy it, build it, or steal it.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
    [*]The AI isn't the brightest and sometimes is a little to single minded. Certainly not horrible, but far from perfect.
    [*]While I liked the open ended approach, sometimes finding a specific mission requirement is convoluted. Example, getting asked to scan something down without ever explaining how to scan in the first place.
[/list]

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
[list]
    [*]With so many systems, you'll either be reading and experimenting a lot in game to learn it all. That or reading and watching a lot of guides, wikis, etc. I personally liked it, but it will turn some people away.

Cant do missing cause shit weapons, and cant carry cargo because I get pounded right when I leave the station. I am actually kinda unsure what the hell your supposed to do to make cash to start off with..... I wish I could refund this game but seeing as I have already played 7 hours, and to be honest just to learn enough to play takes about that long. 
Anyway look for something else to play or look for them to release a patch for the broken AI

X is one of those games you can play another 3000 hours on after you warn literally everyone to not buy it unless it goes on sale (and perhaps not even then.)

Egosoft, as an outfit, is absolutely unprofessional with a toxic userbase, which is usually the case with outfits that produce sub-par shovel-ware.  Much like their game, it's probably best to just pass on by.

The game doesn't have a ""select next enemy button.""  For that reason alone, I wouldn't recommend it.  Previous iterations of X had ""select next enemy"" and ""select previous enemy"" before, so they know it exists, I'm not sure why it's missing now, but as of now, you can only select ""closest"" enemy and that MAY not be the thing you want to be aiming at.

The collisions suck, so it's possible for you to fly into and end up inside of a ship or station shooting at it from the inside.  Also scanning a station requires you to get WAY too close to the station.  There is no collision avoidance in the gates so sometimes you'll get knocked so far off course that the game no longer registers your distance from the sectors.

If you dock your ship with a crew you will randomly NOT be able to return to the bridge of your ship.  You'll have to go to your dock, exit your ship in your space suit, and crawl back in from the outside, and that will handily plop you right back into your bridge.  Only seems to effect capital ships.

I have a ship in my fleet right now that does not belong to me.  I cannot disband the fleet, because I don't own all the ships in the fleet.  I'm not sure how I got a ship I do not own in a fleet.  Maybe I tried to sell the ship while it was in my fleet, maybe it was a failed boarding attempt, maybe I got boarded.  I sincerely do not know.  What I do know is now I have a permanent fleet with a ship I don't own.

Combat is wonky.  Aim assist is a necessity.  Most of it is you viciously swiping your mouse like crazy trying to shoot the tiny little zippy ship that doesn't have even a remote chance of killing you.

Drones are pointless and will get your ships killed.  It makes your ships get constantly stuck on ""Recalling Subordinates"" and there is no way to cancel that or simply abandon your drones, making a 10k hunk of metal disable a 100m ship.

""Warning:  Auto-pilot has failed spectacularly.""  At least they admit it now.

There is no clear delineation between your personal inventory and your ships cargo, other than that they are delineated and not transposable.  Both have wares, legal and illegal.  The problem is when the police scans your ship's cargo for illegal wares they find the illegal wares in your personal inventory and treats it as though your ship is carrying illegal cargo.  As far as I can tell there is no way to hide this illegal inventory other than to drop it off or simply not pilot your own ship.  Also, I am still not entirely sure what happens when your other ships collect objects that go into your personal inventory from across the universe.  Does it go to your personal inventory?  Do the pilots have their own personal inventory?  Do they vanish into ether?

The thing is the game is the quintessential 4x game.  You discover a universe, build up a fleet of ships, build up your own space stations, become friends with some, enemies with others, establish trade routes or loot everything, it's got absolutely everything a sandbox space game needs to absolutely set the standard in the 4x genre.

And yet...it remains a blistering eye-sore of exactly why everyone hates the 4x genre.

And the thing is, it doesn't NEED to actually do anything that isn't already there, just fix the stuff that IS there so that it works properly.

At the start it is quite good, you get your stuff together but at the point where it should shine the most, the late game sandbox it just ****. Don't get me wrong, you can build up to big scale and even manage it but you will get so frustrated.
Ship fights if you are nearby or even involved lead to lost ships as there are no hotkeys to order your squad around and the ai orders just suck...yes you can order your ships IF you hit pause and switch to the map, setup orders for the ships and unpause do some fighting ... pause again for some orders ... hell ""alot"" fun.
Having fights out of your current sector are quite the better option but still lack so much, ships that got hit badly don't retreat to safety/their carrier, they just keep fighting until they get killed, so if you don't want to rebuild, you have to set em to flee by hand.
Patrol order just sucks, cause the patrol only work with their own radar range...ignoring that most of the sector is shown by a satellite network and you can't even order to patrol multiple sectors.
Global orders are way to general to work, setup presets for different shiptypes arn't possible and no, i don't want to set all my small civil ships to ""flee"" when attacked by hand or the other way around, all militarys to ""judgement""...same problem with blacklists, there is no option to blacklist sectors with enemys or blacklist single stations, the only way to solve that is to setup own alerts for enemys and blacklist sectors by hand ... 

And that's just some of the annoyance you will face. Sure, you can build big and defend it, but you are stuck at babysitting every little task and reinforce stuff, so you can't enjoy playing.

The game need some more options to handle stuff later on, hell i got my own sectors but still no damn manager that just replaces lost ships?I have no special fight squad that reacts to attacks against my civil ships on their own? If i assign fight ships to my stations, they arn't used as escorts for the station traders?

Well, at least they could add a ""casualties/attacks"" logbook subsection

Game is unplayable as vanilla.


The most popular mod in the Workshop is ""Cheat Menu."" I didn't use it. Maybe I should have, and I'd still have a thumbs up on this.
Link to Cheat Menu: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2046100040&searchtext=


Vanilla beam weapons are like water, a quick google of ""X4 beam weapons"" will make you quickly realize some things aren't ok. Soon I realized that quest interruptions can permanently bug your save file if you don't catch it and reload.
- Buggy quests not completing
- Difficulty spikes in quests that require many reloads
- Reloads that take several minutes (huge files, that are compressed and uncompressed every time you save/load)


The only saving grace is a mod you can easily get from the workshop called Variety and Rebalance Overhaul [VRO]. 
Link to VRO: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1696862840&searchtext=
It balances everything in the game, completely changes the way it feels. Devs should make this the new vanilla.
But the VRO mod requires that you buy 3 extensions:
- Cradle of Humanity
- Split Vendetta
- Tides of Avarice

When I purchased X4, VRO only required 2 mods. I guess the workshop dev decided to drag all subscribers along in his personal purchase journey.

The good: 
- EVERYTHING is simulated, start trading wares, that will have an effect on the faction's economy, which can in turn have an effect on how well they do in wars, it's that detailed
- Tonnes to do, from combat to missions and trading, there's a lot to do. Most players will however follow a similar route of making as much dosh as possible so they can have fleets of ships at their disposal to wage war
- Every game will be different due to how everything is modelled. A faction may dominate in one save and do poorly in another.
- Standing in the hangar of your carrier, watching all the fighters leave to engage the enemy, or maybe standing on the bridge of a destroyer watching your fleet attack a station. Being able to order ships to act and watch them follow your orders fills me with a great satisfaction
- The universe is split into sectors but it still feels huge
- Great soundtrack

The meh:
- Combat isn't particularly engaging or detailed, the game could definitely do with some more mechanics in combat
- Lack of interior diversity, the interiors are a minor thing in the game, they are nice and add immersion, but more interiors would be good to see, though they have added some in the recent update
- Voice acting ranges between 'okay' and 'awful' but I don't really care
- Character models don't look great
- Graphics could be better 

The bad:
- The AI is what most people criticise with the game, especially with fleet combat. The AI will often bounce into asteroids or stations, this has been improved in updates. The fleet AI however I think is less an 'AI' issue and more of an interface and mechanics one, I won't go into details here but managing large fleets can be a real pain and Egosoft really need to add more ways for the player to control ships. For example setting them to engage some targets and not others, or adding distances to engage, these things would improve fleet combat.
- The performance is dreadful, from what I hear it's CPU-bound and only runs on a single thread, expect the FPS to tank in places with many ships. Fortunately it's a slow paced game and doesn't suffer from low fps however it still isn't good.

After adding to my collection and playing thousands of hours in games such as Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, No Man's Sky, and many others including small inde-develloper projects such as Avorion, and Void Destroyer 2 i was expecting a similar experience to the industry but with respect to the flavor this project could bring. However though the videos suggest that you will get to play as your own character pilot your own ship and travel throughout a living galaxy which i was aware was a solo but well crafted experience. THIS IS NOT THE TRUTH! you need to pay for each of those features! want to be Human? want to create a character and forge a destiny as you play reacting to events as you embark on adventure? NO you cant do this. each part of the game is locked into a module which you need to pay for. Choose Male or Female? NO! instead, be a male alien with a voice from the witness protection program locked into the respective module according to the package you purchased. Want to investigate the goings on in a civil war? NO! That is a different module and they dont carry over between them so even if after the main purchase of the game... you think maybe adding this other module will also include the features from the base game + the module... NO! they are their own games which use the base game as an engine. think of it like a single quest chain in WoW. WoW itself is a huge world with things going on. but unlike WoW, in this game, each quest chain is its own purchase... its own module... and each one comes with a scripted character you suddenly have to adjust to playing as.",1651885003,1651885003,False,7,2,0.487780600786209106,2,True,False,False

There has always been a solid and passionate modding community that has grown alongside the series.
This series is not without it's downsides however. Each major game release is usually very bug ridden and launches feeling incomplete. The game is then slowly fixed over the following 2 to 3 years with patches, expansions and mods.
The main reason for this isn't because the devs are lazy, greedy or rubbish at what they do. It's because the game that they are trying to make is immensely complex. There is a massive amount of under-the-hood calculations going on in real time. The game is attempting to simulate a vast area of solar systems with a dynamic economy and huge numbers of ships, factions and events. All effecting one another, all at once. It's not just the player's actions that effects the game universe, the AI can drastically change the landscape of the game too.
You could sit back and just observe the whole thing like a giant ant colony if you really wanted to (I have actually done that before).

When an X game works, it is incredible. But when it doesn't it can be very frustrating.

The devs are passionate about their baby and have been for decades. They aren't a super massive company. I love that they went down the road of indie developer (self published). This has afforded them the freedom to make the game THEY want to make.
There are also novels that cover back story and lore too. Sure it's a bit cheesy and uses classic sci-fi tropes but it works and is done well enough to draw you into the world if you want to immerse yourself in something with rich and intriguing background.

Summary: This game is deep, It can be overwhelming to learn at first, many people walk away after half a dozen hours claiming that the game is unplayable or broken, It's not broken, it just doesn't hold your hand. You are pretty much dumped into the world with a basic ""off you go then"" (and some of us really like that in games). But if you do bother to learn the game it can be an amazing experience that really does pull you right in. If you can live with the odd bug here and there then go for it. Take your time to learn the game, read the forums and watch the handful of YouTubers that cover the game.

Really wish the price was better as this seems abit like that X-rebirth dogshit and not worth £39.99 perhaps £10 might be a more accurate price and I would not mind it being so shit for that price at least.

Pressing ESC twice may correct the issue. Also you can try opening and closing the map or getting up and then sitting back in the command chair as these sometime help.""

First off, these ""fixes"" didn't work for me (even temporarily), but lets pretend they did. That's still not a fix. ""MAY correct the issue""? ""These SOMETIMES help""? I spent $50 dollars on a game where the keys you NEED to play it don't even register, and the best thing they can come up with is a fix that ""may sometimes work"" (again, did not even work at all when I tried it.)

So why are they releasing a bunch of Paid DLC and asking for more of my money, when something as simple as ""buttons doing things"" is a ""maybe""? That is beyond insulting. I am getting a refund.

Also you are able to run your own corp, buy your own fleet of ships as you progress, all the way up to taking over an entire sector of space for your self slowly building up to a large faction much like the rest.
The missions in the game are pretty good and will help get you new ships and extra credits as you go alone. The option to take a break from the main missions is there so you can stop and do your own thing which can be nice some times to build wealth.

The games feels like its taken a pretty good turn for the better.

Pros:
- Big and alive universe sandbox
- Walk around every station and every ship
- Play as Mercenary, Trader, Miner, Pirate, Industrialist, Galaxy Overlord
- Beautiful space atmosphere
- Cool ships with big variety and customization
- Mod support

Cons:
- Character models are very ugly
- Performance in very late game
- Ship ai is dumb at times
- Very bad game explanations
 
The X series was always one of a kind. It is very important to know that the sandbox factor is very big in this series. There are some random and some story missions. But overall you can do whatever you want in this universe. You can dock on any station and freely walk around the station by foot. You can also dock every ship with docks that is bigger than yours and also walk freely around. You can fly around in your spacesuit or control cruisers that are as big as stations yourself.

You start in one of a few different scenarios with your first ship. You do some trading or some random missions to earn your first credits in a completely simulated economy.

After some time you saved enough for your first mining ship. You can either let the ship mine and sell automatically or you can completely do the mining yourself. After some time you can buy another mining ship. Soon you will have enough money for your first station. You can build the station any way you want. There are no strict stations. You can build a station that only produces one type of product in masses or you can build a station factory that can just build anything. Soon you will need bigger ships for the mining, trading and especially fighting. Although you can not land on planets, you can terraform them later.

The world of X4 consists of ""sectors"". Each sector has some stations, ships and portals to other sectors. These sectors are owned by factions that can have even war with each other. Terraforming a planet for a faction helps expanding that faction for example. There is also a faction called the ""Xenons"", a self building robotic race, which are hostile to everybody. Over time they will try to expand in other sectors with their stations and ships. They can theoretically wipe out the galaxy but usually meet a lot of defense from the factions. Still the Xenons must be activelly fought in the late game. You can also declare war to any other faction anytime you want. You can destroy EVERY single station and ship in this game if you feel like it.

The fighting is later usually done by commanding your units around the galaxy on the map screen. Although you will learn to teleport to any of your ships and take control of it later in the game, you will probably sit in only one ship most of the time, using the SETA, a 4x fast-forward time device that you can craft. 

You can sink hundreds of hours into this game. But if you do so you will have no other choice but to stay in a small ship far away from stations or other ships because the performance will drastically drop the bigger the universe gets. Most of the time you will stare at blank space or a planet, because on the map screen the game runs only in 8 fps in SETA mode for me after 200 hours (50fps in non-SETA). And i have a i9-9900k and an RTX2080 Super. Not the even the newest CPU can fully handle this game. Like in Stellaris the performance will drop after time as the civilizations expand.

Another big problem is learning this game. I would say it is as complex as stellaris or even more. But way worse explained. There are some tutorials that teach you basic controls and mechanics. But after you complete them you are still just ""thrown"" into the big sandy sandbox. 
You start with your ship on a station and thats it. No Questmarker, no first steps missions, no real intro of who you are or what your motivation is. You are just suddenly ""there"" in this world. So expect a lot of tutorial watching/reading in the first 10 hours at least. 

There are also some unnecessary hard gamemechanics. You can type in a ware in the upper right corner to filter the map for it. But you need to type it EXACTLY like it is written in the game-encyclopedia. If a item is written like ""Shieldcomp."", then you have EXACTLY to type ""Shieldcomp."". There is no drop-down list when you type ""Shield"" for example that suggests every item that has ""Shield"" in it. This is something i just learned after 50 hours but what would have helped me a lot in the beginning to find certain goods.

The UI is not THAT bad as people write. I think the only problem is that the UI gets harder to use with low fps, e.g. in SETA mode.

The beginning of this game requires some work to learn it. But if you put this work into it you will be rewarded with a one of a kind universe sandbox and space sim.

As of Today I have something over 200 Hours in this game, not a huge amount by game standards, but enough I think to offer a reasonably informed review

If I may start with a short list of Pros and Cons

The space flight simulator is awesome. The ships, especially the Small, and Medium Single Seaters are both great space art and a joy to fly. And there is a large selection of small craft, explore and joyride around the universe. This is far and away the best part of the game.

Combat is fast paced, and can be quite intense, and very enjoyable.

The game is highly Moddable, and has a very active modding community whose efforts do a great deal to improve the overall game.

A helpful, knowledgeable, and engaged forums community.

The Environments, are very well executed, flying through 2nd Contact you get one experience flying away from the sun; and quite another flying towards the sun, against an amazing background of backlite asteroids.

Cons
X4 quickly evolves into an management simulation where-in the player coordinates the activities of their ""Empire"" on a stylized 2D map screen, while your npc pilots are flying though that beautifully rendered enviroment.  Personally I think the game might have been better named, X4: Zaibatsu, as the players ""Empire"" is to me deeply reminiscent of the great Horizontal/Vertical monopolies in William Gibson's early work.

Character art is dated, and Ugly. Almost any user of Blender or DAZ studio would be ashamed to present to their viewers such crude characters. This aspect of the game badly needs to be overhauled.

Your NPC Managers, Allied Factions, what have you, are all idiots. This is on purpose to shove responsibility for the game economy on the player, to push responsibility for keeping the Xenons (think Cylons) at bay on the player.

You are the only intelligent life form in this universe. A quick canvass of  the forums, or reddit; will reveal a large number of threads bemoaning why are my managers so stupid, or my Allies so hapless; this is not a bug, it is a feature. Fortunately there are mods that help address some of the most frustrating aspects of the AI's stupidity; but it ultimately remains rock stupid.

Just one example AI fleets could easily handle Xenon capitol ships because Faction Missile Boats have a very real range advantage over the Xenons, but the AI will consistently run in to ""Hug"" the Xenon, and get obliterated by the waiting phalanx of short range plasma cannons. This includes Player ships you are not directly commanding, so don't be surprised when your Torpedo boat charges a Xenon capital ship to bring its shortest range cannon to bare on this massive killing machine. Well you can harvest the scrap later. That's something.

The new scrap rules mean the game environment, soon becomes littered with wrecks, polluting the environment and spoiling the game art. I absolutely hate this new ""Feature"".
--------------
The game opens with the player in the cockpit of a small craft, and I have to say the flight simulator element of the game is the most fun I've had in any game in years. The flight is fluid the craft are responsive, and the environments are beautiful and elegantly executed. It's a great hook and draws you quickly into the game; unfortunately it has very little to do with long term Arc of the Game.

If the thought of spending hundreds of hours micromanaging a vast virtual industrial enterprise, for  virtual credits appeals to you; then this might be your game. A great many players love it, and the online community is one of the best and most positive I have ever encountered in over 10 Years of Online Gaming.

X4 bills itself as a Sandbox:""Where you fit in with this universe is generally up to you. Become an honest working explorer and mine for goods, build up an empire, or just stick to illegal trades and thievery, whatever you’d like to do with your protagonist is up to you. A good portion of this game is also based around ships whether it’s making upgrades, building up space stations, or just flying around in your favorite cruiser."" and I so wish the above were true, but While X4 is very much an Open World,  X4 absolutely is not a Sandbox.

""A sandbox game is a video game with a gameplay element that provides the player a great degree of creativity to interact with, usually without any predetermined goal, or alternatively with a goal that the player sets for themselves. Such games may lack any objective, and are sometimes referred to as non-games or software toys. More often, sandbox games result from these creative elements being incorporated into other genres and allowing for emergent gameplay. Sandbox games are often associated with an open world concept which gives the player freedom of movement and progression in the game's world.""

While X4 is not as rigidly scripted as Tomb Raider or Assassin's creed, the player does have some ability to improv with-in the script; the endgame is pretty much always the same. The Evolution from Pilot to Bean Counter is basically inevitable.

In the very early game the player will be encouraged to purchase a mining vessel to get some passive income going; soon he will find the refinery is full up because while the refinery is asking say 270cr for a ton of refined metal, the Hull Parts Factory is only bidding 250cr; thus a vital link of the game economy is frozen; ah but the player can build a refinery meet the Factories Bid and make much more money. Problem solved... for the moment; soon the Factory's warehouse is full, Once again the Factory is asking say 1500cr for Hull Parts and the Ship Yard is Bidding 1400cr; another opportunity for the player to step in and resolve the problem ... and in this way the player is led like a bull with a ring in his nose to piece by piece build up his Zaibatsu; in a futile attempt to mend the games broken economy.

It takes a moments reflection to realize that economy is broken on purpose. That this is a hook to drag the player step by step along a predetermined path the Devs want the player to walk. This is fine for Assassin's Creed or Tomb Raider; but this is the exact opposite of what advertising a game as a Sandbox implies.

Now the dev's speak with great enthusiasm of the great ""Sandbox"" they have created in their online promotions, which is only to say I do not believe the Devs are being disingenuous when they call X4 a Sandbox. Only that they have completely redefined sandbox in their own minds; and that definition has nothing to do with the common usage of that term in gaming circles. So while the Dev's are sincere in referring to X4 as a Sandbox; they are also quite sincerely being very misleading. I'm sorry if I seem to be harping on this point; but as the Dev's go to great lengths to promise the prospective player a great space sandbox in their promotions. I feel some obligation to the reader to point out that this is a false promise.

To sum up, The Early game is excellent, while the Middle/End game is about as exciting as an excel spread sheet and might as well be played on one. If you ever dreamed of being a fighter pilot; the early game is for you. If you dreamed of being an accountant, you will love the late game; but has any ever dreamed of being an accountant? Sadly as each hour passes you will be pushed more and more towards that, stylized 2D map to manage your virtual ""Empire"" and have ever less time to enjoy that beautifully rendered 3D space sim.  It's hard to give this game a simple yes or no. If you like shooters, first person action, No. If you like management sims, definitely yes.  Nuff Said. BB. 

X4 should have been a great game, sadly to my mind the Devs have got their priorities here exactly backwards; and that is a terrible shame",1647713298,1651092651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This one came out with quite low reviews, so I didn't actually purchase it until version 4.0. was out. I don't think this game is perfect, but I have been playing now for about 270h (still the first game) and if you like both 4X games, and space combat (""à la"" Star-Wars, with dogfights), you will enjoy every bit of this game.

There are also a few very good mods which will improve your gaming experience, in particular the ones that add new ships to the game, and the one about ""station mules"" (more intelligent freighters for stations).

Another thing that I like, is that the challenges in the game continue to keep at pace with your level. I mean: it is a sandbox game with a few storylines that add a bit of quests, but the base is a big sanbox. At the beginning, you start with a small fighter and your challenges are : 
- stay alive
- grasp a bit here and there to purchase some upgrades
- make ""taxi/delivery"" missions
Once you start to have a better ship, maybe a few traders/miners that provide some continous credits, your challenges are:
- pirates
- xenons/kah'aks (the ""bad aliens"")
which destroy your profitssss
and then you start to have fleets and your challenges are
- conquest sectors for yourself
- liberate a friendly sector from xenons so that your fleet of traders can safely pass
- blockade some sectors to force the prices to grow and then make a bunch of credits selling a lot of stuff for an insane price
- etc, the sky is the limit.

No really: this game is brilliant. 

Now for the cons, I have mainly a few regrets with respect to the UI and ergonomcis in general:
- after you start to have a lot of ships, it becomes more and more difficult to find yourself, or a given ship.
- the UI is a bit confusing, you can easily find yourself with a few popups on the screen that might cover your point of interest, but with some transparency, so it is not always clear on what you are clicking
- Also, I wish that there were more ""in depth""  tools for financial analysis (again, there are mods, but I would have liked to have them in vanilla game).

Had to get some youtube help to speed up my learning curve. Still don't fully understand some things and I am still learning. Once you get a steady income flow going things rapidly improve. Meanwhile in my game the universe is spinning on its own. I'm pretty sure a war or two has broken out. Pretty sure a key ally's economy has been crippled. I will need more and heavier warships very soon to protect my economic interests. Trying to stay neutral will probably be impossible soon.

The game itself is a mix of flight sim and economic sim and later strategy sim. Getting the strength to stand alone will take a very long time. Good mix of weapons and each faction has a blend of weapons, fighters and capitol ship that make them different. Combat varies. So far I have only driven off many small raiding fighters and an occasional frigate. Sank one unescorted destroyer with a swarm of fighters. No casualties but i have also avoided any pitched engagements. There is allot to do and allot of avenues to explore. I so far have put off truely exploring in favor of focusing on building my economic viability. You can be anything from a peaceful trader to a pirate raider. a choose your own adventure kind of game, though there are story missions depending on your starting choice. 

This game will require to to build up and invest your time, plain and simple. Some people don't like that kind of gameplay I totally understand that. But for me it has been fun as the ball got rolling. Getting a new shiny ship with big shiny guns is always rewarding, espeically when you get to use them on the enemy. 


UPDATED REVIEW: Figuring out how to make your economy work in the larger economy is a trick, but figuring it out is a sure way to profit. War is hell, but damn good for business. Personal command of fleet action matters, and strategic deployment of your forces to act as a buffer for your allies buys them time, credit with them, and the loot of the corpses of your foes leaves your dedicated ""vultures"" to pick up. the supply chain can be a bitch to set up but once you figure it out (on your own or through help) things get even better. The only thing now is to purchase the last few things to fabricate my own ships (All praises to the mighty $$$$$) and then I will be a truly unstopable force.

Some faction doesn't like you? tried to repair relations and get on their good side and they still won't come to the table? To the abyss with you! Your capital ships make fine trophies in my fleet; new centerpeices of force projection armadas! Your fighters make great practice for my novice pilots! Your trade vessels are but mere prey to my raiding parties! And your bountiful sectors now feed MY industrial complex!

God awful mess, persistent bugs & performance issues nearly two years and two DLCs after launch. Disgusting UI and stripped of almost all of what little lore and fluff the previous titles in the series had.

Even though it is a little dated, I would still advise X3:Terran Conflict as a stronger starting point in the franchise.

I've been fan of the X series since the release of the first X game which I bought on CD from a long now closed media outlet store. As X games go this is still a good game, quite addictive, rich in features and in some ways realistic in terms of landing ships, trading etc. 

So whats wrong with it? a lot unfortunately. Despite its rich features, variety of play options and styles it still to me feels almost Beta'ish and very unpolished. This is most noticeable when it comes to the game AI, as many others have said, it's awful. You never quite know what its going to do and you'll find yourself having to constantly micromanage to the n'th degree to get things to happen how you want them to happen, which is really draining and takes away a lot of the fun of it being a game. The AI is the main major flaw in this game, and given the time it's been around I can't quite believe this is still a major issue that's not been fixed. The previous game, X3, had very good AI, and while I understand you can't just lift and shift that code or logic in to this game, still, it really does need a complete AI re-work/fix.

So what else is wrong with it, quite a few things but, they are more of an annoyance rather than a show stopper like the AI.  For example, bugs where there are ships you can't kill, losing reputation and being attacked for accidentally shooting a station while trying to shoot something else, the battle calculations in the map view are grossly inaccurate compared to real time battles, even if you're not involved and only observing. The latter quite often works in your favour as your ships that would other wise be destroyed if you were there watching often survive but, this doesn't make it a good thing. The mysterious removal of the best race in the lore of the previous games, the Boron. Whilst I understand that their physiology, at first glance may make them feel difficult to integrate into the game, this is just down to a lack of imagination of how it can be done without requiring a significant re-codding and re-working. For instance, they could have them walking around and living in water filled space suites so they can be placed into the game as normal NPC's without any significant re-work. Every now and then you will also find yourself stuck inside the skin of an asteroid or station or a larger ship, this is just annoying and shouldn't really be a thing in modern games. The graphics have been scaled back in favour of a more feature rich game, it's not the best looking game but, it's playable enough, despite looking like a game from a much older generation of games. 

Overall, the good slightly outweighs the bad but, there is a lot of scope for improvement, let's just hope the dev's actually fix the issues instead of just churning out more DLC to make more $$. Not hopeful on this one though as the AI issues have not been addressed since its release over 2 years ago. I've been waiting for almost all of that time to buy the game after this has been fixed but, I got it in the end as it looks like it will never happen.

My advice, don't pay full price, wait for a sale, the AI issues don't make the game worth the full price but, at sale prices of around 50% off, it just about makes up for it.

EDIT: After running into a game limiting bug that I can't seem to find a fix for I have to reverse my recommendation to a NO.

[u]Update (Mo-07-Jan-2019)[/u]
At the current version (1.50), things are vastly improved over release from a basic stability perspective but there are still bugs that make the game barely playable. If you can ignore these issues the game can still be enjoyed but I still can not recommend the game at this time due to the general state of the game as a whole. Egosoft still need to address a number of issues.

[u]Update (Fr-27-Nov-2020)[/u]
Things have moved along a bit since I last updated my review (now at 4.00 Public Beta1 HF1) and the state of the game is improving. Bugs in capital ship pathing seems to be in the process of being addressed and performance seems to be slightly improved. The Beta is still very much a work in progress so it is a case of watch this space until the formal release and I will look to review my recommendation state at point of formal  release of V4.0. It looks promising thus far though.

[u]Update (Th-21-Apr-2022)[/u]
As of version 5.10, I have one simple phrase to sum up this game for any keen large complex builders - avoid this game like the plague!

Performance during building large complexes is unworkable with response times sometimes being in excess of 5 minutes per change (on a new gaming rig - i9-3900F/RTX 3080 Ti)! Also the module position snapping mechanics is still as quirky and irrational as it ever has been. Finally, the module rotation consistency and reliability is completely non-intuitive and IMO broken with module rotations changing wildly depending on what module they happen to be snapping to.

The latest expansion adds some interesting features and a unique battleship (Erlking) which can be fun to play with if you chose to acquire it - especially after adding speed mods to it.

However, my recommendation status for this game must stay a solid NO at this time.",1543685124,1650568396,False,2,0,0.458452731370925903,0,True,False,False

Where to even begin... This game fully simulates a ""galactic scale"" economy. So you will need a hell of a PC if you want even acceptable framerates. Although it's backwards from most games in that you need a HELL of a cpu, and only a good gpu. This game is mostly cpu limited due to full scale simulation of tens of thousands of npcs all doing things across a galaxy sized map. The game does this by reducing the accuracy of the simulation in sectors your not inside currently.

The game has a really weak story, there is one there, but it takes a WAY back seat to the giant sandbox the game presents you with. So your going to have to create most of the story yourself.

You can land on every station, and most ships and walk around on them. You can fly every ship yourself, or become a fleet admiral simply giving orders and allowing your commanders and captains/pilots handle things. Build an empire, fight in fleet battles so massive and amazing that it will bring a 12900k and rtx3090 to it's freaking knees. Acquire wealth untold, or wipe out every living thing in the entire game till you are all that remains.

The level of customization at your fingertips from ships, to mods, to fleet compositions, order trees, character traits, etc is incredible. But on the flip side the menus within menus within menus WILL be overwhelming at first. And the game only explains the absolute most basic of actions.

If you want a sandbox of all galactic sandboxes, THIS is IT. Just be warned, you will have to sink hundreds of hours into this.

The game has its little quirks here and there, just like any previous X game. I can say that, after playing X3AP for so many hours, I felt at home getting started on X4, similar principles, better handling and UI, it gives all I need and that I feel that I was missing on previous titles. Trading feels more comfortable, commanding my fleets also feels comfortable. I only miss some clic and drag for ship selection, but the fleet system mostly covers that anyway, just need to select the ships from an organized list instead.

AI might not be very smart in flight and combat at times, but that is not something new to the series, good point is, on this one, you can pause the action for a moment, open the map, and give your wingmen and fleets a little bit of micro to try and lead them to the right targets. If anything, ships no longer die by ramming each other, or stations like in X3 so, even if it is not perfect, it is also an improvement.

Base building is definitely a notable improvement from X3. The feel production-chain wise isi very similar to complexes, but the station/complex works as a single entity, and looks nice. No more spaghetti complicating navigation for NPCs.

You have the possibility of creating an entire armed force, or trading empire.
it comes with creating/owning stations, sectors, fleets, traders... you name it...

But every sector got law's right?
well thats where egosoft gone wrong...

we have no option to add broad variety of laws.
Yes you can ban some trading options with certain factions...

Laws only occurs to the given sector.

I want to see law's that tweaks the safety and possibility's for your police force, patrollers, armed forces.
Like for example: 

Prohibited to arm weapons in or near stations.
rule to prevent other factions war to happen within your sector.

Police forces or armed forces will intervere automatically in case of law breaking events.

This above is just a small example of what i'd like to see.

Another example is creating law's that allow other faction's to use lethal forces in case of piracy or criminal offence.
Or non lethal if prefered by some players.

Breaking law and use lethal force agains that individual should not affect faction relationships.
Perhaps given that we can add police patrol and add military forces in every ships.
Perhaps instead of military forces, we should also have the option to add police enforcers.

to add cherry on the cake, station build prison. for the likes of non lethal punishment.

It takes a long while to get infrastructure up and build the stations of your dreams, time I used to resent. But now there are plenty of things to do along the way. There are multiple plots to advance, satellites to fix, mines to remove, patrols to perform, ships to capture, and so on while I wait for miners to mine and for that Hull factory to get built and show a profit. The universe feels much more alive than it once did, although it's a little more stable too. Neither the Teladi nor the Split nor Hatikvah seem to knuckle under to a Xenon advance - this is a little saddening. If the Xenon were more of a threat, it'd give me a lot more to do in late game. 

And the late game still feels weak, weighed down by the shortfalls in resupply, patrol capability, and fleet combat more generally, After mid-game has passed and I'm gathering too much money to make auto-generate missions worthwhile any longer, I typically want to build a few shipyards, find a way to cut down trader and miner losses, and take the fight to the Xenon. But fleet combat is mostly a matter of waiting for hours while commanders gather subordinates and crawl one gate at a time toward their destination. It's possible to cancel the gather command and let ships waddle in at their own pace - until they get close to the destination and being scattered constitutes suicide.  After getting trounced a few times in battles by the Vigor Syndicate, I learned how important this is - and how good missiles are. Of course, to use missiles, I need automatic resupply to work. It almost does. With small fleets, it performs acceptably, but after one large battle I waited 24 hours or more for a Nomad to figure out how to repair the ships in the fleet (during which time the fleet itself was useless). It never did manage it. Station attacks are dicey too: my destroyers sat for several minutes getting shot at while they failed to find a path to the remaining module - a problem I was able to resolve by teleporting out of the system. But fleet combats mostly work, once I get to the stage where I'm swimming in money.

Reducing miner and trader losses doesn't work quite as well. If I name my ships carefully enough, I can usually figure out which trader decided to take on and lose against a Xenon K or which escort decided to waltz through the hazardous zone in the Void (putting the sector on the blacklist doesn't quite seem viable for Antigone station traders). But preventing them from dying is another challenge entirely. I do like that ships now use boost to pursue (before which, all escape attempts were successful). However, smaller and faster ships usually do get away, and fleeing from pirates is still a pretty safe option.

But when it comes to general attacks, there are only 3 bad global options:
1. Always attack when attacked (generally suicidal)
2. Always run away - makes escorts, fleets, and patrols pretty useless (at least in previous builds, haven't tried it lately)
3. Use judgment. This sometimes works. Usually traders feel pretty capable of taking on small fighters, no matter hos outnumbered they are.

To help my ships, I tried a few strategies:
1. Assign escorts. Since KHK raiders seem to be able to kill miners that are defend by less than half a dozen ships, this could work in theory, but is grossly cost inefficient. Plus, a defense that can stand up to KHK attacks will generally still suffer total losses against Xenons unless manually rescued.
2. Zone defense. Blockade against Xenons and station rescue fleets. I had some success by telling a couple of corvettes to ""protect position"" where my miners tended to cluster. But this takes constant tuning: miners will travel half the galaxy to find high-yield mining opportunities in dangerous sectors. And the area you can protect is pretty small.
3. Send ships to patrol dangerous sectors. This offers the worst of all possible worlds. Ships on patrol just wander around randomly and attack enemies they see - they do not respond to friendlies being attacked in the sector. Additionally, they will eventually find and suicide themselves against KHK stations (which are invulnerable)
4. Pay attention! Station a flotilla of corvettes and fighters in dangerous sectors and manually tell them to attack when my traders are threatened (especially by KHK which warp in from nowhere). Keep an eye on where fights and Xenon incursions are going on and avoid those. This works. It also becomes quite tedious.

But despite my gripes, being able to fly around in your own ships and walk the hall of your own stations is gratifying, as is building an empire from nothing. The content that's been added and the pruning of impossible and nonsensical missions has helped the game enormously. But late game quality of life issues are still a royal pain: don't play too long.

I do recommend this game, but only for certain gamer types.  The primary thing you need to know is that this game does not hold your hand at all in how to play the game.  You will have to figure a lot out on your own.  In the beginning this was particularly difficult as there wasn't many guides out when  the game was released.  There are more out there now so you should be able to find direction from other players now.

For reference, my introduction to the series was X Rebirth.  I have since picked up all the X games.

This game feels a lot more like the Pre- X Rebirth games.   The universe is huge, and from what I can tell, different in subtle ways on different playthroughs.  There is a lot to do and you can decide what you feel like doing for the most part in this sandbox of a game.  There is plenty to explore, I don't think I have fully explored any map on a given playthrough.  I currently have multiple saves going, 1 strictly trade and exploration, and another for a more combat oriented playthrough.

Subordinate AI is actually pretty good.   In  vanilla X-Rebirth, most of your other ships were useless unless you were in sight of them, a capital ship would commonly die to a small raiding party if you were not in the area, but would instantly kill them if you were near.  This is not a problem in X4.  The AI is able to handle itself within reason(A trading ship won't last long on its own, but a well equiped combat ship can hold its own just fine).  Also there are a lot of options for instructing your other ships what to do.  Setting up auto trading/mining is easy with lots of options.  You can also setup ships to explore sectors for you and report any major finds to you.  You can set what formation a group of ships flies in.  The list goes on and on. 

Also, whatever ship you can purchase, you can fly.  Each ship has it's own cockpit look, and handles differently.  After certain events in a game(not going to spoil it) you will also have a quick way to switch between ships.  This allows for easy management of your empire and a way to switch up playstyles.  Want to explore, hop into one of your scout ships and see what secrets you can find.  Just want to travel around and enjoy the sights? take over one of your cargo ships and execute some trades.  Want to get into a brawl? Go over to Xenon space and harass some ships, or start a war with a faction.  The game truly offers a wide range of playstyles.

The economy is dynamic, this is both a pro and a con.  Sometimes getting ships built can take a long time as some stations will run out of the necessary materials, and it can take a while for NPC trade ships to remedy the stations problems.  So it is a good idea to at least have some trade ability regardless of how you are playing, if nothing else to speed up station supply recovery when you need it.

Since X-Rebirth was known for a rocky, buggy start, I'll just say this.  X4 did not have any serious game breaking bugs since I started playing it from the day it was released.  The game wasn't perfect and there were bugs, but nothing that ruined the game for me.  Just occasionally had to restart the game to clear a bug(most common was every now and then I couldn't dock at a station, but saving, and restarting the game fixed it).  The developers are active and fixing lots of bugs in a timely manner as well as adding quality of life additions.

Overall I am impressed with the game, and the developers efforts in fixing whatever issues do come up.

If you are looking for a game where you can choose your own adventures, whether it being a market tycoon, station builder, or ace combat pilot, and don't mind figuring out/learning stuff on your own.  Look no further than X4.

**DLC Update**
I have continued playing the game and have all the DLC (current DLC owned Split Vendetta, Cradle of Humanity, and Avarice)

Split Vendetta offers a new factions, ships, and new pirates and a fun storyline with multiple path endings which will shape the politics of the new factions.  This also adds some of the hardest, in my opinion, game starts(one literally starts you in you space suit, running out of oxygen in a battlefield).  The ships added are some of the most 'glass cannon' ships in the game, incredible speed/maneuverability and weapon power at the cost of survivability, great ships for dog fighting.

Cradle of Humanity Lots of new systems, factions, ships, and multiple storylines to do. And you can see Earth.  The advanced original earth humans with advanced ships to boot.  and the storylines will affect not just the new systems, you can sway the politics that will affect the core systems as well as the new systems. Multiple ways to end the storylines so worth a few playthroughs to see how each choice affects the universe.

Tides of Avarice- New systems(not as many as the other factions, but beautifully crafted systems) new factions and storylines.  There are a few new ships, but not as many as other expansions.  Added with this update to the base game is the ability to salvage ship wrecks, so now you can profit off of destroyed ships. Expansion adds the ability to salvage capital and station wrecks.  Storylines in this expansion do a great job of teaching mechanics that aren't covered much in base game or other DLC(piracy actions like attacking trade ships to steal their cargo, boarding, smuggling etc)  

Overall the game has been getting better and better with each DLC and the Modding community is very active so you can mod the game to your liking and really customize your game to various styles of play.",1546021929,1649949332,True,8,0,0.561323404312133789,0,True,False,False

The upsides:
- Sandbox trading, with the ability to set up trade routes or just let them do it for you
- Complete autonomy, you're allowed to do whatever you choose. You want to pirate? Take ships, take loot, do whatever. You want to wage war? Get your fleets ready. You want to be a multibillion credit tycoon? There's plenty of ventures. The game has almost no hidden walls preventing you from making your own choices. Only exceptions really are just progression walls that require you to unlock certain modules and ships through research and story.
- Player faction support, there's the ability to take over the entire galaxy if you know what you're doing, with the ability to police your own sectors and provide your own industry without the reliance of outside traders or factions.
- Multiple stories and even more underlying routes. You're free to link up with almost any faction you desire as a soldier and fight to make them the supreme faction, receiving bonuses and better titles along the way, and there's multiple different storylines outside of the wars and politics that allow you to get a feel for the lore, which brings me to my last point.
- Plenty of lore. There's data vaults hidden around the sectors and little leaks you can scan that allow you to learn more about the world and its history prior to you joining into the vast frontier. There's a plethora of knowledge for you to learn and it ties directly with the storyline you can choose to follow, which makes it feel just a little bit more real.

Now, here's the downsides. I'll hide the spoilers for anyone who wants a fresh run.
- The AI is... very lacking. The dog fighting between the two feels a bit more like a slap fight, and the trading system is atrocious. In fact, it's usually more profitable to directly tell your traders where to go and what to buy or sell than it is to set up trade routes or have them figure it out. The faction AI has some issues when it comes to actually defending their own territory, and all too often they let another faction completely wipe them out simply because they just HAD to send all of their resources to a different area for a different war instead of diving their attention and resources. [spoiler] The Xenon, the largest enemy faction, is able to take over the Zyarth Patriarchy sectors almost too easily as they're surrounded by them and have basically no clue on how to defend themselves while the Xenon are basically tactical geniuses compared to them. [/spoiler]
- The clipping in some of the models are very very broken. I've all too often found myself clipping into an asteroid with my ship and having to pray to the RNGesus to get me back out, or found myself inside of one of the stations because somehow my ship was able to phase through a wall. It's extremely easy to essentially break the game. [spoiler] especially if you haven't unlocked teleportation [/spoiler]
- The leveling of characters is extremely slow, and the rewards aren't exactly the best for doing so even if the characters are technically valued at a lot more. [spoiler] There's no way to train marines without essentially making them risk their lives boarding a ship which is already a difficult task for anyone who doesn't know how to cheese it. [/spoiler]
- The ways you can make money are almost too difficult, with you having to basically spend more money just to gain a small percentage back. They've nerfed quite a few ways to make money without combat and the AI is too dumb for stations to make much compared to the cost of setting it up in the first place. You have to spend enormous amounts of hard earned money on blueprints, only to earn another enormous amount just to build the station, and then another enormous amount to supply it before it actually brings any money back in. [spoiler] Until you get the HQ, which allows research into hacking blueprints for free but my point still stands about spending to build and spending to supply. [/spoiler]
- Loading and saving a game takes forever because the devs have the savesystem built around a single threaded process, which means it uses a single processor core to save and load the game file as opposed to how most games are, using all of your processor cores. This leads to a huge bottleneck in saving and loading, and sometimes can feel like you're spending more time loading a game than actually playing it.
- The station building interface is extremely difficult to navigate and can frustrate anyone who hasn't gotten a hold of it. Especially new players. Sometimes things turn on the wrong axis, snap in a weird way, or just delete altogether for no apparent reason.

All in all, despite the downsides I do actually like this game. I'm able to overlook even some of the worst downsides because I want a space sandbox. If the downsides were fixed, which is possible, then this game would be one of the best games I've ever played simply out of the fact that it offers so much opportunity and room to explore and create. For those who have ADHD and want an outlet to let out their excitement and put their minds to work, this game is great. It lets you micromanage, but doesn't require it if you just want a fun game where you fly around and shoot pirates or aliens.

Basically the game is a smaller scale EVE Online. From what I remember of EVE 5+ years ago the graphics in EVE are much better. However this game does take some aspects of EVE to a new level..of frustration! If you like games where you need a note book of all the controls/ shortcut keys this game is for you because basically every action can be done 3 different ways, and in the tutorial they think you'll remember it after rapid firing like 30 commands at you for 3 simple actions. Also this like many other space games suffers from menu bloat... It 2022 make your controls less complicated and rely less on menus to get things done.

Its par for the course for these types of space games who intentionally make every small action 100% more complicated than it has to be... This isn't a flight sim at least is isn't advertised as one. That along with the fact I spent 20 minutes trying to find the hatch back into my ship in the tutorial is why I refunded it....So I didn't even get to the empire building part...

This game was never worth the price tag.  It could be, but it never becomes worth the price tag.  I thought, I'll wait 6 months for the community to add scripts and ships and cool features.  but they were too little, too late.  Nearly 4 years after release, I get stuck on the escalator.

I hate, hate, hate writing this negative review.  Every time I reinstall the game, I end up uninstalling it a few days later.  I truly believe X2 was better than X3 and X3 was better than X4.

Conceptually, the game has a good bit going for it, and gameplay-wise I have enjoyed it, but there are significant issues that turn this from a decent game to a mediocre experience:

- For a game that relies on trial and error to figure things out, saving and loading takes an uncomfortable amount of time to keep with pacing. It's usually over 2 minutes with a modern M.2 drive, so if you are playing with a standard HDD instead I can imagine it taking an unacceptable amount of time.
- In busy areas, group firefights, or in asteroid-dense regions, performance becomes very poor, making combat/navigation incredibly difficult, as turrets fail to track targets accurately, and input for is heavily delayed.
- At the management level, ship commands don't work as expected (nor do they have much in the way of explanation as to how they behave) and the AI can be atrocious at times. Formations won't stay close to one another, ships told to defend another will instead fly way ahead or behind their target, and oftentimes traders will 'flee' combat by turning around and flying straight into the densest group of enemies.
- Control bindings are very fickle. Some actions can't even be bound, you can't use a modifier key for a single action, and most of the time anything that does use a modifier key will prevent any other controls from working while holding it (for example, you can't hold shift and press a button to fire your weapons, the modifier interferes with it).
- The UI could use work. There is a lot of information to track, but a lot of it kind of just gets in the way at times. Much of this would be more quality-of-life than anything else, like being able to hide some information or rearrange sections. However, here are also a lot of times where a context menu is opened in a bad place, requiring closing it, moving other elements around, and reopening it (because panels can't be dragged around), or making changes in another menu, needing to move the map, and having the menu close simply because I clicked somewhere else, losing all of my changes.

Much of the vanilla game is very awesome, so much of it infact i really don't know where to start, that said it's bugs without the mods will wreck it.. You were warned. (strongly advise going mod heavy)

This game is what star citizen and Eve online wanted to be, save that X4 is not multiplayer or even co-op.
However it makes up for this with an engaging universe that has multiple storylines, which you are free to pursue or to not. You can do anything from being the Hero, the Universe's Evil Destroyer, the Renegade Pirate, Be your Own CEO or and here is a big one.. Create Your own Faction, become your own Government with you as it's despot. (democracy isn't a thing in this, but that's a good thing since it's a game.) 
Custom Build your own Space Stations, factory lines, and with enough effort, build your own ships instead of buying them from other factions.. (be prepared to put in alot of effort for that..)

While this game is definitely more time efficient than something like EVE online that takes literally years just to learn to fly your own ship, X4 is a time consuming game and you should be prepared for this to take weeks if you want to build your own stuff.

Alternately for a faster paced game, you can rely on purchasing ships from other factions, though fair warning, you will need a mod to fix the economy in game, as one of the QOL issues with vanilla is that the factions start out with a severe shortage of 'Hull parts' and almost no where in the universe making them...  ( It's actually not a bug, it's story related... The problem does eventually get solved by the AI, but it takes along time. Think 5-7 days of real life game time.. yea that bad..so like 168 hours of playing and trying to survive,

Good graphics too. Easily worth the price of entry for Vanilla. I got the Split DLC too and the ships look rad. Didn't get the other DLC.

However there are real problems:
- The combat AI on your owned ships is terrible. Bad AI is probably my most common complaint with games in general, so I temper my expectations and often don't bother remarking on bad AI. The AI here is *awful*. This is Egosoft's 4th game that does basically the same thing! Clearly they are not investing in that part of the product and likely never will. My capital ships with long range weaponry bumrush short range turrets and get annihilated. My fighters b-line straight at enemy anti-capital turrets that they could easily evade, but don't. Squadrons of ships in formation... don't move in formation. In fact they get slaughtered in ones and twos as they arrive unless I babysit them.

Vast improvements.

I can't even begin to list everything that has improved. Tons of quality of life updates. Managing your empire is much easier and smoother than it was before. (Check your player menu; managing personnel, finances, etc., has never been better.) Things feel more balanced as well, especially with the economy.

Both new and improved commands for you ships and fleets, improved organization for fleets. 

The map now has more context with regards to colors indicating your standing with factions, tons of new sectors as well. Visiting the Sol system, coming through the Jump Gate, and seeing the Moon and Earth from my ship was pretty cool.

I started this play through on the Terran Expansion, the missions and story were pretty fun. The missions in general are more varied and enjoyable. Highly recommend all DLC. Added factions, sectors, ships, etc.

Improved character models and more variation.

The only gripe I would have is with a certain sector or two that won't allow your ship shields to recharge, and if your shield falls your hull takes constant damage. It just seems unnecessarily difficult, especially when a lot of the main story missions I've been picking up want me to go in there. But there are about 50 other sectors to do things in, so I'm really just nitpicking at this point.

***AI Piloting of your Destroyers is FUCKING ATROCIOUS. Massive problem, but you can work around it.

Overall, just a much better experience. It feels like a complete game now, especially with the DLC factored in. Highly recommend 10/10.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review as of X4 2.0.

Overall, I would recommend this game. If you're a space game junkie, a management junkie, or just a pilot junkie, this is for you, even in it's current state. At release it was frustrating at best, but playable if you didn't mind. Since all the updates, now at 2.0, it's much better. I think there's a lot of great things they're doing.

Station building and corporation management is probably the strongest part right now. Building stations is wicked fun and rewarding. They just added shipyards, which I haven't had the money to build yet because they're ungodly expensive. But, overall, this whole part of the game is pretty solid. (They're still hammering out some of the finer details with regards to AI behavior on mining and trading.)

Combat is.... Ok. When you're the pilot, everything is pretty solid. Blasting ships or stations in your Destroyer or dogfighting in your Fighter is pretty damn fun. Managing large fleets, however, is cumbersome at best. The AI isn't great, and it currently requires a lot of micromanagement, edit: and AI is very buggy. It is improving, however.

The economy is pretty sound, with a few bugs here and there that just kinda don't make any sense. Nividium, for example, is a resource you can mine. And obviously, you can sell it for a profit. But there's currently no use for Nividium in the game. So stations will buy it from you until they're full, and eventually the economy loses the need, and therefore the ability, to buy Nividium. So there are a few things here and there that will probably need addressed with regards to economy, but overall it's pretty decent.

Soundtrack is nice.

Edit: Missions are kinda boring, except the short ""main quest."" I don't factor this in really, because it's a sandbox, and I don't need to be told how to make a sandcastle.

Every single system in this game utterly fails to live up to even a fraction of what is advertised in any of the trailers or promotional material. Most of them involve more waiting than actual gameplay.

The gameworld is disappointingly small, with only a few dozen systems, only a handful of which are actually friendly and available to explore (except in the endgame, maybe? idk, definitely will never spend the likely hundreds of hours of waiting required to get there). But the distances between the individual stations can be large sometimes, so the game helpfully offers... nothing, forcing you to sit and watch for VAST stretches of time as you wait for your ship to reach the endpoint of some journey, touch a station, and leave. Just to watch the journey back. As far as I can tell there are only three or four stations where you can actually buy and sell ships, and there are a depressingly tiny number of ship and upgrade options, mostly boiling down to ""exactly the same but better stats"".

Missions are oppressively boring, typically being to either deliver goods of a particular type, with the reward often being essentially ""break-even"" or very close to the cost of acquiring the goods. So for these, you get to navigate the horrendous UI to try to purchase goods and break them to a certain place, in order to receive an extremely marginal reward.

Another type of mission is to ""patrol space"". This mission type consists of going to a portion of empty space and waiting around for TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE while nothing happens. And if something does happen, you have no way of knowing what it is, so if you can't handle it, you will just have to reload and cancel the mission.

There are also combat missions, but combat in this game is totally undynamic. Boosting (the only way to have any speed at all) depletes your shields, and getting hit immediately kills most of your velocity, as if space were made of molasses instead of... space. So the battles mostly come down to which side has the most guns or the greater numbers, and moment-to-moment tactical decisions do not exist. But if you DO want to retry, you'll have to reload the game.

And reloading this game can take literally 10 minutes or more. If you retry an encounter several times which takes only a few minutes to shake out, you can easily spend 70% of your time in a play session just looking at the loading screen. Developers and fans alike crow about how the game has to save ""such a huge amount of data"", but frankly this gameworld is small. As a programmer, this does not hold water for me.

And all of this takes place against a backdrop of bugs *everywhere*. UI glitches, collision glitches, broken AI, every system you can imagine being broken, probably has some enormous glaring set of bugs which players are still complaining about after years on the forums. You have to babysit the autopilot, because it very frequently goes VERY far off-course, sometimes into hostile territory. I suspect the developers had to disable collision damage because almost every automatic piloting system in the game is unable to avoid smashing directly into solid objects, often getting stuck inside them. Allies often forget how to utilise the travel mode, so the only reliable way to have allies available for a fight is to stop nearby and sit and wait, likely for five, ten minutes, or more, for them to finally get to you, even if you have just travelled in a straight line. I tried to use a spacesuit bomb once and it got stuck hanging in space nearby my ship, following along with it. I couldn't get rid of it without it exploding and killing me and destroying the ship. It even stayed hanging in empty space as the ship docked and undocked. I had to sell the ship to get rid of it.

I tried several different methods to get rid of that spacesuit bomb btw. Every attempt took maybe thirty seconds or a minute. But the reload between every attempt took easily ten times as long. 50 minutes of watching a load screen, 10 minutes of troubleshooting an obvious bug, 0 minutes of gameplay in that particular play session. Wonderful stuff.

One game is the empire builder, where you sort out your economy, build units, expand, and send icons to go stomp on other icons.  This generally works quite well.

The other game is the flight sim, where you fly from place to place, try to dogfight, and otherwise live life in the cockpit.

The first game is actually pretty good.  It's a vibrant, dynamic stellar environment.  The second game has many, many flaws.  Not graphics, although framerates will bottom out sometimes; no, the problem is the combat.

As others have said, the combat AI in this game is *breathtakingly* stupid.  Egosoft coded exactly one combat method: Fly at the enemy, shooting guns.  It doesn't take into account whether the enemy is moving, whether it will mean flying straight into the enemy's guns, or even whether or not the AI even HAS forward-facing guns!  You WILL scream at your ships essentially committing suicide, and sometimes apparently sabotaging you.  The game has been out for years and Egosoft has done nothing to improve this.  And oddly enough, every NPC is a sharpshooter... no matter how stupid the attack algorithm, you won't enjoy being on the receiving end of it as enemies nail you with every shot during the ""joust"".

Combined with the UI jank, bad collision detection (watch your ship do a ridiculous little dance before you die while trying to hull-hug an enemy capital) and other small but *glaring* flaws, and you end up with a game that feels all the worse because of how great it could have been.

The Good: 
This single player game simulates a galaxy. Players will find themselves thrust into an enormous sandbox, and can choose to ally with various factions, complete interesting and diverse story plots, or just declare war on everything. This game really makes you feel small in the face of an entire galaxy. Over one hundred hours in, and I haven't found our own solar system yet! 

Large, Expansive, completely moddable, with likable character arcs (mostly).  I love this game!

Egosoft is a really small company compared to, say, Naughty Dog, or even Bethesda Game Studios, but I am amazed that they have put out such a grand project, and I am excited for more. 

The Bad:
Bugs. Lots and Lots of Bugs. like nothing game breaking, usually; but I cannot tell you how many times my autopilot got stuck into a wall or rammed a space station and ricocheted off of it like a tennis ball, spinning faster than a top.  

Enough bugs exist that you are going to want to turn on the regular interval autosave feature. I did after I lost two hours after being blown up by a Xenon Carrier. (Vengeance shall be mine!)

The Ugly:
The game's graphics are absolutely beautiful -- the vast planets, stellar nebulae, bright explosions and vast space stations are gorgeous!  All is great... except for the NPCs. The NPCS do not just cross into uncanny valley, they hit you hard like a baseball bat.  (Although Dal Busta, the Split race and the Paranid race look fine.)  This is further noticeable by the lack of variety in the NPC faces and hairs. 

FEEDBACK FOR EGOSOFT -- what I would like to see. 
Egosoft, if you ever read this, I commend you for your ambition and dedication to this game. You have my respect, and I am excited for what direction you will take this game further. 

For X5, or in the next few updates, please implement a character creator, or something. You can look to Skyrim or Fallout 4 for an example. Because Bethesda's character framework operated on modules and sliders, they had almost infinite variety within their NPCs. Prebaked NPCs can only get you so far before people take notice. 

I would also like space stations or even large class ships to have more rooms, room functionality, and NPCs within those rooms. For example, In Subnautica, if your submarine was damaged, scanners would break functionality, fires would erupt, leaks in the ship would occur. You had to stop piloting the craft and address these problems, or you were in for a watery grave. 

I am really amazed at what you have done, and I am excited for your future.  

Here’s an idea: What if, you made a X game that was a MMO? Then you would blow EVE online or whoever the competition is out of the water!!

The Verdict:
If you like a massive game with plenty to do, factions to explore, asteroids to mine, ships to steal, and wars to be waged, then this is the game for you. I must warn you though, this game will take a lot of time out of your day to get stuff done.

my little gameplay experience so far:
i started playing as a nobody. one poor ship. one poor and unexperienced pilot. tried some fights and died - game over. tried again and this time tried to be more careful. tried to only take fights where i thought i could win. died again and tried again. tried to learn how to better fly my ship. started to buy a new ship. started to hire a captain so he can fly the ship for me when i don't want to. bought another ship and let it do some trading for me. bought a mining ship and crew to do some mining for me. realized that mining and trading are not only good for passive income but also good for getting better reputation with other factions. so i started to expand my mining and trading fleet. explored more systems and encountered my factions. started trading with them. finally started building my own station for producing some goods. after learning more about station building started to build more stations (trading stations, storage stations, producing stations, military stations, wharfs and more) ... now that i was in control of a ton of industrial ships and my reputation with the factions is pretty good. i thought about expanding my military fleet. thought the xenon are weak and so i installed a xenon buff mod from the workshop. big mistake. game over after a few hours because the xenon with this mod took over half the galaxy and all my industrial empire fell apart. tried again this time without the xenon mod enabled. started to build a bigger military fleet and started to protect factions against the xenon. won my first battle against a xenon destroyer and felt pretty good about it. now i am going to build my own fleets instead of buying those ships from factions. can't wait to get into those really juicy carriers and destroyers and then if i feel like i am able to defeat the xenon in vanilla, i will maybe try again to enable this xenon mod to unleash hell upon the galaxy because i hope i will be ready to defeat the xenon this time... well and if not then maybe i am going to try another career next time.. what about a pirate life instead of industrial mogul? or what about joining a faction's war against another faction. there are so many options ... well this game is easily 10/10 after you suffered through the first few hours of gameplay and after you got to know how to use the UI and controls. i already spent more than 140 hours into this game and it just feels like i am getting started..

Game is playable, but expect bethesda level of bugs. (clipping, buggy Ai, Z-fighting)
This still has that sandbox feel where you dont feel entirely alone. NPCs seem to do their own thing and will react to changes you or other npcs make. This is still the one major thing the x-series has over most other games. However, the AI needs alot of work when it comes to combat. Mosts cases it feels like AI under the players command are intentionally dumb just to buff the enemy. (Trade ships not fleeing, Combat ships ignoring enemy attack, Cap ships not adjusting position for combat, drones not launching, ect...)

The forums... I feel like it should be noted that unless you plan on using ego's actual forum, expect to receive more sarcasm then answers. Some posts don't make it past the mod approval stage.

The cancer has been cured but this will make the 2nd or 3rd time.
Due to most of the new content being DLC I cant give a proper review for the base game. 

review: 6/5/21
This game has cancer. Not even joking. There's a bugged faction that uncontrollable builds stations untill the game lags and freezes or the in game economy breaks because all resources are being funneled to these stations.

old review:
I still don't recommend this game, due to the excessive bugs, missing functions, terrible guides, and also the 1-2min load and save times that lockup my computer. This game should be Early access or at least Beta 0.3.0. 

Don't get me wrong, I am having some fun playing and it has come a long way. The real issues I'm having are with the AI/Player interactions and the lack of proper information on the controls. The first hours of the game are pretty straightforward but once you start getting into fleet management and Stations everything becomes guesswork, frustration, and disappointment. 

TRADE, FIGHT, BUILD and THINK.

TRADE; 
Space trucking is kinda fun like trying to find profitable trades, racing against other pilots to the deals, upgrading your ship, or trying new ones.
Managing a fleet of traders is where the frustration starts. Setting up blacklists does not work properly. There's a lot of micro-managing which isn't a problem for me its just the UI is very clunky. Lots of information I don't need all over the map and overlapping symbols for starters.

FIGHT; 
combat isn't the worst but far from great. AI issues make combat repetitive or just plain unfair and unfun. There's too much in this area to review so here's a small list.
+The battles fleet Vs fleet battles looks great! when they happen... 
-Most enemies use the swarm tactic. Ships are not using their superior range and just charging in getting wrecked. 
-Turrets causing all sorts of friendly fire issues as they should, but why are they shooting their own repair drones or another part of its own ship? 
-Drones and turrets cannot be directly controlled, only AI does and their skill is determined by the service crew. Repair drones cant even be commanded when to launch or withdraw.
+There's a mod that lets you still enjoy flying a flimsy fighter in a massive battle without risking game over. 
-Turrets have issues shooting moving targets while on a moving ship. My maxed out service crew miss 90% of its shots even with its beam weapons.
- The Split are Extremely unbalanced- 2x more Hull, 10+ more weapon slots, OP race-specific weapons.
-AI piloting the same ship can move in impossible ways and sometimes clip through objects.
-new ship models with old ship names suck, I miss my old Nova and Kestral. should have just gave them all new names and not ruin the classic design.
- Boarding is complicated and buggy... the new planing part is good but needs work when it comes to execution.

BUILD-
The concept is far superior to previous X games, the customization options and the AI stations randomness are the best. However, poor camera controls make it hard to construct big complexes. The manual does little to explain the controls. The menu itself needs work, but a mod can probably fix that. 

THINK- 
*Some missions are still a little buggy, many others are just boring and repetitive. this game is very sandboxy and in my few playthroughs there's not much of a story or main goal unless you plan on restarting and playing all the game starts.
*Pirating I believe will be fun eventually but as of now there not much to do with them. Pirates bases don't have much to offer other than illegal wares but the prices suck and have very few places to sell. I haven't seen any pirate shipyards nor truly unique ships to any of their factions.
*You can claim sectors now but I'm still experimenting with the benefits.
 
I'll be updating this review as the development progress, but I still cannot recommend the game in its current state. This is mostly due to the unfinished feeling X: Rebirth gave me and required my ""Mod- Dependent"" tag to be a worthwhile investment. 

Majority of my fun comes from fighting Xenon swarms with my fleets, and I love piloting the fighters and corvettes. There are no drones that you can directly control so its kind of dumb that you can't effectively be a fighter pilot in fights like that w/o being killed quickly. Being on an L or XL ship is kinda just drive and watch and gets boring quickly.

Idc what anyone says, this game is early access. More then a few missions don't work properly and cant be finished. Argon Cargo ships basically copy and pasted with slight stat tweaks. Can't unbind mouse buttons so shooting is annoying to say the least, and no shoot isnt one of the mouse buttons by default. Game is way too buggy and Needs alot of work but ill consider rewriting this reveiw/rant once they start fixing things.

If you can imagine a game that combined Eve, Elite Dangerous, City Skylines, and Factorio, then you have an idea what X4 is. It's one of the most complex games I have ever played. In the simplest of descriptions you are building an empire through network relations, market dominance and sheer military might. You are assisted by your AI fleet of traders, miners and military personnel/ships as you travel with your own ship to shake hands with the neighbors, complete missions and explore. I spend most of my time on the map barking orders to units and optimizing the supply chain. Taking the wheel of my ship when it's time to fight. I find myself getting overwhelmed sometimes by the never ending ""to do"" list.

It's a single person game (which I prefer) so you can pause and save before trying anything risky just in case. X4 has done a fantastic job at making the galaxy feel alive. There is so much going on; from other factions conducting mundane trade shipments to faction wars happening in other sectors. Even a few hostile factions that just don't like you for no reason other than existing. Your ships have crews and these crews all gain experience and grow more useful as the game goes on. You might even remember some of the captain's names that have been with you the longest. Or you might want to promote that service crew guy/gal to captain of their own ship. The captain of my ship is being groomed to command my capital ship when I can afford one. Anyway, you will be the most insignificant thing on the map when you start.

Everything affects the economy. That faction that lost that war is going to rebuild their fleet, sounds like a good time to trade ship parts. If you flood the market with something, you can bet the price will fall. You can find shortages of items and pivot your production to fill those shortages or have your trade ships start buying and selling to them. Or, you can do the bare minimum of the economy game and just fly around and do missions or cause trouble as a pirate or gun for hire. How you play it is up to you. 

What X4 does not do well is hold your hand and tell you what to do next. I have spent dozens of hours watching YouTube ""how to's"" and reading forums.",1648696942,1648697193,True,13,0,0.654803693294525146,0,True,False,False

* The UI might look more modern but it's incomprehensible as to how to get anything to work.
* This games 'tutorials' as such are useless as it just tells you how to fly AND NOTHING ELSE. Flying is a very minor part of this game.. Why is there no proper tutorials for a game as complex as this?
* Simple missions are hidden behind some sorta brain dead minigame.. WHY!?!? It's a waste of time.. Just admit it's a shit design and show us all the missions in range like in X3.
* Random stuff in space hidden behind a minigame also. Can't we just have proper scanners on the ship instead of having to use that long range scan mode? Or at the very least 1 scan shows us where stuff is..

I can't even comment on the actual important gameplay parts such as AI or reactive world as after I don't know how many hours of bashing my head against this game and tutorial videos on Youtube I still can't even grasp the basics. Like how to make enough money to get some sorta passive income chain started. It feels like this game was intentionally designed to waste your time in the guise of being complicated and giving you a lot to do. While in reality it gives you a ton of frustrating chores.

Sure the ships look nice and in theory you could have a big carrier task force.. I wonder if it would work? I wish I knew.. I wanted to build one.. But I can't even get close to that because the games systems make no sense!!

Bottom line is that this game is frustrating and unintuitive. I can figure out most ( even complex ) games I play WITHOUT a tutorial because the UI makes sense. So that Egosoft somehow made a game that needs a PhD to play and DIDN'T include a competent tutorial or hint system is a crime against anyone who buys this game. I don't have a 100 hours to waste trying to guess how to play this game by trial and error.

I pray that Steam will give me a refund as I feel Egosoft really don't deserve my money on this one.

Edit: Also forgot to add. This game is optimized like ass. I installed it on a M.2 SSD and it STILL takes 3-4 minutes to load.. WHAT?!?

Edit #2: So as I couldn't get a refund I went and got myself a destroyer and tried to goof about with that. Turns out Egosofts incompetent coding is on full display as usual. It got stuck in an endless ""Recalling Subordinates"" loop with no way to end it. Meaning only way to fly it was manually. Which is fine if you're on the ship.. Not fine if you plan to have multiple ships or a carrier task force. Every time it looks like modders need to fix their games because they fail at basic QA..

It definitely seems like a very detailed and immersive game that would be right up my alley. The concept is amazing. You have the ability to manage a space empire, on a scale from 1 ship to a fleet, with great automation ideas and realistic economy. I still think it looks great and the depth is impressive. I love complex games with a long learning curve, so I'm very sad this game isn't for me. 


Unfortunately, the game is unbelievably buggy. I don't normally mind bugs if I can find an explanation or workaround, but the bugs here are so gamebreaking or weird that it's beyond frustrating. Here's a small list from my 4 hours of gameplay so far. 


I spent ages figuring out how to scan data leaks. Actually scanning them is easy, just move close, but in order to accept the quest, you have to press a key within a couple seconds of the scan. All you get is a small indicator in the bottom right. If you miss this window, the data leak bugs out and cannot be scanned or communicated with again. However, it stays visible forever. In addition, if you do manage to hit 7 and talk to the person, if you misclick or press the wrong key and close the window, it counts it as you terminating the connection, so guess what? Absolutely no way to contact the person again, and you lose the data leak. Great. Oh, and you can easily get stuck inside the station when scanning these data links. I slowly approached the station, bumped up against it, and found myself teleported into the station, unable to escape. I could fly around inside the station shell but couldn't leave. Apparently this is a common bug, fixed by turning on autopilot with a pilot. I had no pilot, so I had to restart my game. Time to start over, again...


Finally I get the first objectives, bought another ship that will be used to explore an anomaly and be sacrificed. It said any ship, so I buy a cheap miner and fly to the station I need to buy these items from. For some reason, I cannot buy the 3 items from the station. After much googling and head scratching, I find out that miners are just bugged and can't buy those items. I'm unsure whether this is just those items at the station or all items, but there is absolutely no warning or explanation why I can't buy solid cargo when I clearly have cargo space on my ship. No error message either, just all the items are greyed out and not able to be bought. Very clear and easy to understand! I wouldn't expect mining ships to be able to buy cargo lmao. Silly me!


I don't mind occasional bugs, if there is some form of workaround or explanation. But 2 game-breaking bugs and 2 horrible design ideas, all of which prompted a restart from me, is just too much. I also somehow managed to get an achievement for building a station part, when I have never done anything related to stations. Maybe glitching into that station triggered it somehow?

It's a shame, it seems like a game that has a vast amount of depth, and maybe it does but I won't ever know. I took my first mission, found the superhighway, transfered to another sector, scanned the medical facility, went to locate the superhighway to get back and after 15 to 20 min. later figured out most of my confusion of getting lost that time was due to the selected waypoint NOT showing up in your hud, yet bases do -- even other ships! But the one thing that allows you to transfer between sectors, superhighways don't. Yeah, makes a lot of sense... Something that significant doesn't show up on the HUD but hey at least tiny little things like other ships do (lol). Ok fine, I manage to make my way to it and transfer back. I re-dock at the station (which when selected the on-board computer tells me it's the Argon equipment dock -- that's important to remember in just a second). Just when I thought the experience couldn't get worse. Of f**k'ing course it did...

I use my newly acquired credits to purchase a shield upgrade, and some on-board system software. Wha? Wait. What?! The game treats upgrades as I'm buying a completely new ship (but I'm sort of like trading in my old ship to get the exact same ship with just a few items modified? I believe this is the case because the verbiage in the game states something along the lines of ""this edited ship has not been purchased yet"". What the actual f**k?! I mean, it's fine because it's still only charging me the cost of the components I purchased, but what a bizarre idea. That's like going to a muffler shop and telling them you want the exhaust fixed, and they tell you ""Ok sir, we'll go ahead and fix that for you. We're going to basically give you a clone of your car but with the new muffler. The cost will be the (cost of the clone + the exhaust) - the cost of your car. Uh... Couldn't you just not bother cloning the car and just take off the old exhaust and replace it? Wouldn't that be less wasteful?    Nope. That's not how we do things around here.""   lol.    Fine. Whatever.

I then go back to the maintenance bay where my ship is parked (not technically docked since it's not physically connected to a port of the station, it's sitting on its landing gears in a ""parking space"") then the interface tells me there is an active queue item for upgrading the ship. Ok so what do I do now? It's active but the ETA is just ""--""   Great. That's super helpful! Thanks! ... Where is the ""Go. Do it."" button?! ""Engage?"" What do you want from my life game?!?!   I eventually come to believe I'm supposed to proceed to the equipment dock to pick up my parts (which is VERY tiny print as a tooltip buried pretty far in one of the million menu screens of the maintenance bay interface). Wait. I'm not already at the equipment dock? Funny because earlier when I selected the damn base the on-board computer told me: ""Argon Equipment Dock"".  Ok game, you're just screwing with me now aren't ya? Surely, I must be at the proper place. Check the map, and... wait. huh?! the waypoint is on the other side of the base? *heavy sigh* fine. I'll get in the damn ship and fly there.

I hop in the ship, sit in the chair ready to undock and see a message that the ship is due for modification ""Yeah, NO S**T Sherlock!"" So I get back out of the ship and start trying to wander my character over to the PoI on the full-screen map. Another 20 min. later ""HOW THE F**K do I even get there? I've walked all around this stupid base and neither the teleporter locations nor the airport standing conveyor belts take me there! That's funny. The map looks like you can go from where I am to where the PoI is yet I've explored the extremities of the walkable areas and all ways lead to either teleporters that allow teleporting to the exact same spots I've already been that are nowhere near the PoI on the fullscreen map or solid walls. Oh. And with an instinct to hold down shift to run (you can jump afterall), hitting the D key to strafe right while running, yeah, it instantly ports you back into the ship. I eventually figured out it's because the game thinks you hit the dock combination. So I'm not even in the damn ship and the game thinks I'm issuing some kind of dock / undock command and resets my player position every time I accidentally do that. Good. I need that. The experience hasn't sucked enough yet.

Starting to really lose it at this point, I decide: Ok, I will get in the damn ship and just try flying there. So I get back in my ship via this new found nugget of information (that hitting shift-d while outside of your ship running around instantly ports you back to the inside of your ship), sit back down in the damn chair and ignore the warning about a upgrade task scheduled and start flying there.

I get to the general area where the PoI is and expecting to find some sort of area with large lights or activity indicating it's where I should be. Yet, there is NOWHERE to fly into. Roughly 12 min. later I find this REALLY tiny slit in a wall that is open and there's writing next to it that says approach slowly. Great. So this place was designed like some super-creepy not-public facing mechanic service entrance for a car. Cool. Good job. So I fly in ever so slowly, and it starts getting darker and darker. Uh. Ok, where do I go?! I can't see a damn thing now! Let me try manuevering backwards a little... Whoops banged into the wall because I increased throttle intuitively using the ""x"" key, knowing ""w"" and ""s"" is up and down. Ok let me fly forward a little to bring myself off the wall a ... ""SON OF A F**K'ING B**CH!"" I hit the ""w"" key now instead of hitting the ""z"" key, and now I'm in some bizarre state where the frontfaces of the dock polygons are invisible and the backfaces aren't, but the game is still treating my ship as if I'm inside the dock. Absolutely brilliant! At this point I literally exit the game to desktop. Nope. nope nope nope. Nope. nope. Just no   pe... No. Not playing this. No. Please no more.

Lots of trading and macro management. Lots of things can be automated but some just have to be checked on. An example would be such as your ships if they are being scanned (illegal cargo) or if they are being attacked. You'll get a message most of the time but its important to react fast enough to send a fleet or two to attack the enemy ships while telling the attacked ship to flee. Sure you could have 8 frigate gunships protecting your ore miner but its a bit over kill. A patrol fleet will be good enough in the sector.



TD:LR Its like Civ but not turn based. Both first person and 3rd person. Ship and Player. You can even just hire a pilot and board any of your ship(s) and be taxied around or just stay on your station and command everything or just fly yourself. 

Lots of options and very interesting mechanics.

Again it is a sandbox but still has missions and enemy factions.

You can be a pirate, a good guy. or on no ones side. You'll still need the factions to buy schematics for your station(s) so don't declare war right off the bat lol. A single faction doesn't have all the schematics you may want.

Game runs good. Some bugs but not game breaking.

an example would be your ship gets stuck inside a station wall or something crazy after auto-piloting but it turns out that you can still fly through the wall eventually and escape. This doesn't happen all the time.

The scale feels great. On your first station just go out and just go look at it. Man its cool. Feels alive.

X4 foundations, having a major graphic and interface overhaul from previous X series games. X4 has a much lower bar of entry than other X games as its mechanics are far more simplified and intuitive. Essentially X4 grew up to be a first person dog fight space opera with a Built in RTS genre. That part i think is really incredible, getting two kinds of games in one, and not being pigeon holed into one or both to feel successful. 

If you are a fan of previous X series games, such as X3-reunion or Terran conflict, ect. you will find X4 really pretty but SUPER small by comparison. the first person NPC interactions are still quite flat, out side of plot missions they have quite literally nothing interesting to say or do. NPC models are also lacking in verity. This makes the universe feel very bland and since the major antagonists are in fact AI robots bent on annihilating everything, this kind of makes you sympathize with them a little bit. Without the expansions, you will have i believe just the human faction of Argonians and the space lizard teladi. signifigantly fewer races previous installments sported, however the expansions so far have re-introduced all the alien races with the exception of the borons, which definitely goes a long way in making the universe feel more alive. 

Outside of the actual gameplay, the lore is cleverly written to explain why several expansions were needed to very slowly get back to the feel of older X games. Overall I personally feel the game is well done given its massive scale for a single player game.

Just my honest personal opinion.

I've been playing this game for 3 hours now, which is barely enough to get to anything. Also, it's sadly too much to have it refunded. I feel like I'm playing an early access title.
Sure, the game looks good and the music is nice. But everything else is horrible.

1) The controls
In every other game you can use the LMB to fire your primary weapon. Not in this game though. LMB is to target stuff. Can't remap it.
You accelerate/decelerate using the mouse wheel. Of course you can change that, but basically you can only fly using cruise control. I'd like to have some more direct control for maneuvering in tight areas.
This becomes even worse when you're in your space suit, where you have no flight assist and are bound to a newtonian flight model. For me it felt totally uncontrollable. I could make do by using boost instead of throttle, and remapping the dead stop button so I wouldn't have constantly switch hand positions.

2) The bugs
Like I said, early access. This game is riddled with bugs. Here's a few examples:
When I started the game and landed on the station I was put on top of, I spoke with an NPC. After that it would not deselect this NPC and I could no longer interact with anything. BTW, pressing F2 and F1 solves that.
When I did the scanner tutorial, it would get stuck at ""Close the menu by pressing DEL"". I did but that didn't work.
Many NPCs greet me with ""He-hello"", because the audio file stutters.
When in the space suit, bumping against a wall a LITTLE too hard will cause you to glitch right through.
There's a door you need to open during the basic flight tutorial. I could pass through the closed door.

3) The missions
Or lack thereof. I started the game as ""untested explorer"". It put me in front of a big shipyard. I spoke with every NPC I could find. Most are just crewmembers for hire. None of the other NPCs had a mission. There seems to be no mission board. The only mission I have is ""find a captain for your ship"". A captain. For my one-man starter ship. I only just started and already the game wants me to, what, settle?
So... what to do? Maybe I happened to pick the free-play career that doesn't have missions, I don't know.
By the way, this huge shipyard? It sells one ship. One.
In similar games, there's at least a mission BBS for generic missions like trading runs. I don't even understand how to make any money in this game.

4) The menus
Too many of them. It seems one is spending most of the time navigating menus. Not only when you're docked, but in space as well. And you're constantly searching where the thing is that you need.

In the end, the game forces you to do a lot of tutorials, and it forces you to google. Both is not indicative of good design. For space simulations, I think there's better and more intuitive games out there.",1647804015,1647817973,False,5,0,0.516211748123168945,0,True,False,False

There are few, if any, loading screens once the game is running. You can get up out of your cockpit and walk around on stations, even catching rides on other ships, and letting the AI pilots fight battles while you watch from the bridge, or shop on a station concourse with lasers and missiles flying directly overhead. The economy is fully realised, with all materials physically moving through space and supply bottlenecks being a real threat for all factions other than the Xenon. Do you want to be a lone pilot? A fleet commander? A trader, miner, pirate? Sure, do it. It won't be easy, it will take time. Sometimes it will be frustrating. But you can do it.

 Does it get everything it tries to do right? No. While the ships and stations, and indeed everything in space is gorgeous, the character models are mostly just bad, in particular the humans, and their animations are uncanny and immersion breaking. AI is spotty in places too, and there are some balance issues. Mods address most (but not all) of these problems. I would absolutely pay money for a DLC that significantly upgrades the character models and animations. The voice acting is also variable.

When [i]X Rebirth[/i] was first released. I shared the same frustrations as many other players - the ability to only fly one ship, the lack of (meaningful) ability to customize ships and stations you own (you can't customize any of the modules or weapons, you can only choose to not fully populate all the weapon and module slots... but why would you?) and of course, the worst part, many game-breaking bugs that prevented me from even progressing in the main storyline.

I ended up putting XR down for about 2 or 3 years after buying it at release, and returned to it afterwards, and can say I genuinely enjoyed what it had to offer. It wasn't perfect, but it was engaging, cinematic, and narratively satisfying.

My experience with [i]X4 Foundations[/i] was similar to XR at the onset - the game felt buggy, unfinished, and the biggest disappointment at the time was a seeming lack of story content after acquiring the player HQ (I like the sandbox nature of X games, but I still need some sort of story to feel engaged with the game world).

So, as I did with XR, I put X4 down for about 3 years now, and only just returned to it a few weeks ago. Here are my thoughts:

[b]STORY[/b] - Generally positive:
-
* The story content has been greatly improved, especially if you purchased any of the DLC's, the story missions are actually quite engaging. I am having fun in that regard.

* The content delivery can be a bit inconsistent across game starts. And I do somewhat miss the more ""epic"" central storyline in titles like [i]X3 Reunion[/i] and [i]X Rebirth[/i]. 


[b]GAMEPLAY[/b] - Somewhat mixed:

* On one hand, a lot of the more annoying game mechanics from XR are gone (station scans, drone hacking minigame, dialogue minigame), and I think that's a plus because I just didn't find them very engaging in a meaningful way, but...

* A lot of good things from XR were also lost (e.g. mission variety, sector variety & sense of scale/immensity). I actually miss things introduced in XR like highway travel and capital ship jumping ability.

* X4 seems to mostly have aimed to deliver a X3-like experience with bits of XR thrown in (like the station and ship construction mechanic, crew hiring, etc.) but in some ways the gameplay feels less dynamic and more monotonous compared to XR, and the step back in main story content doesn't help.

* On the plus side, station/fleet management and menus are generally improved over the previous games. Not perfect, but certainly more intuitive for the most part.
[/list]

[b]GRAPHICS/VISUALS/COMBAT/SHIP DESIGN[/b] - Mostly negative:

* Okay, I have a lot to say about this... I feel X4 actually took a major step back from XR (and even X3) in this regard. Ship designs actually look worse overall compared to XR - with much less detailed models, animation, and even textures. This is very strange as X4 obviously borrowed some assets from XR, but seems to have reduced their quality (I can only assume for performance reasons). Some examples:

  * Xenon K's engines used to have animated blades on the exhaust nozzle. Now it's just a flat disc with a very elementary glow texture in the middle.

  * Engine exhaust in general looks terrible across all engine types - in fact the animation on them sometimes so bad it makes me think of games from the early 2000's (e.g. [url=https://youtu.be/TPdmFsT1pxo?t=154]look at the Chimera exhaust here[/url]. I remember XR looking better than this.)

  * Paranid ship models... I don't know who worked on these, but what the hell? It seriously looks like some high school student did these, with flat and poorly mapped textures and lumpy shapes.. I've made ships in [i]Spore[/i] more detailed than this. Look at [url=https://cdn.wikiwiki.jp/to/w/x4fs/Wiki%E7%94%A8%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F%E4%BF%9D%E7%AE%A1%E5%BA%AB/::ref/x4ship_201211_v33_l_par_odysseus.jpg]X4's Odysseus[/url] vs [url=https://x3tc.net/x3_img_ship/327232f0af84sc.jpg]X3's Odysseus[/url].

  * Both Teladi and Argon ship models took a step back compared to XR; much less detailed models and very bland design.

Thid is a real shame, because even though XR was hampered by ability to customize ships in a meaningful way, it had some very beautiful and cool ship designs (remember the first moment you arrive in Omicron Lyrae in XR? that sense of awe at all the massive Omicron ships? yeah, so far haven't had a similar moment in X4. Even the Terran Asgards felt very uninspiring - nothing like when you first encounter the Tyr in X3.

* Combat likewise felt underwhelming, despite the ability to customize ships with different loadouts:

* In general, weapons feel way too weak, particularly turrets. May be this was designed so S and M class ships don't pop within seconds in combat against a capital ship., but may be they should? I find capital ships generally very gimpy compared to X3 and even XR - the pulse laser turrets in XR were likewise gimpy but I think everyone remembers the awe-inspiring sound of a beam turret charging up before one-shotting small fighters. Every fleet battle in X4 feels like a drawn out exchange between bullet sponges, it's almost boring to watch (I actually enjoyed sitting back and watching fleet battles in X3 and XR).

* Many primary weapons are so ineffective, they essentially are a non-choice (hint: slap Tau Accelerator on everything). In player hands some of them have useful applications, sure - the Muon Charger can be effective in player control for example. But the terrible fire control AI has in X4 means any weapon with projectile speed below 2000m/s won't hit a damn thing.

Overall, I am still having fun with the game, but I do think the issue with graphics/ship models and weapon balance should be priority improvements that will be most impactful to the gameplay experience, followed by improved main story.

Oh well, may be as a wishlist for X5. ;)

P.S. - I was a modder for XR, wrote a popular cheat menu mod for that title... a lot's changed in the past 6 years, namely I am now a software development engineer for Amazon. My interest in this career was thanks in no small part to my work on that mod for XR, so... thanks Egosoft! :P I am thinking about returning onto the modding scene soon.",1647639482,1647639482,True,7,0,0.618880867958068848,0,True,False,False

X series games are always a little  confusing at first, but you will be amazed once you figure this one out. Its almost GTA like with the freedom and ability to walk around ships and space stations. 
Where it becomes incredable is the ability to own and fly anything in the game.  The interface with your owned ships and stations has been simpilified and streamlined from previus X games. It is much easier to staff and get your trade ships trading, and your miners minning while you can fly around doing your thing. If you like open world space sims, this is the best I have seen so far. 
There is something cool about being able to walk around the bridge of your capital ship, then head down to the dock and hop in a fighter and take off.

This game is best described as being like one of those thick shelled nuts that take ages to crack. It has a tough learning curve - the tutorial is great, but there's a ton of things that the game doesn't really help you out with, like giving orders to AI captains for automatic control of ships, or the importance of things like satellites for keeping prices up to date. The UI is a little vague in areas, and the game could do with some tweaks and tools here and there to make it easier to get fleets and ships to do what you want them to do.

But when you crack that shell, when you really understand what you're doing and what the game is about, you've got an experience of a kind that is rare outside this genre - you have a game where the player doesn't matter. That might read strangely, but that's true. In X4, the setting doesn't revolve around the player. You look around and you see freighters happily making their way from station to station, mining ships bringing in the latest haul, stations churning out finished goods and combat ships dueling with one another in battles that can range over a few hundred meters to gargantuan capital ship gun battles. All this happens, and all of it can happen without the player doing anything. The game is, for a lack of better words, alive in how the market functions on its own. 

But for all that the world does on its own, there's so much that the player themselves can do. You can trade, moving goods through ravaged warzones to get to the most profitable markets, or you can hunt the freighters doing so and starve the trade lanes out for your own benefit. You can wage battles from the command deck of vast warships or within the cockpit of the tiniest fighter. You can explore space and wander the asteroid belts and gas clouds, build or destroy starbases, run the galaxy into the ground and let its civilizations be trampled underfoot by pirates, aliens and rogue machines, or you can drag it out of the gutter.

They've gotten bad about overpriced dlc's like Paradox and Foundations remains full of gimmicks like walking around stations often times barren of npc's, or poorly implemented features. The controls and flight is significantly worse since the Terran Conflict days, but at least they finally made the map useable in Foundations. The UI as a whole is pretty bad and theres far fewer ship types. The long range scan system makes exploration extremely painful compared to TC as well since instead of buying upgrades that increase your vision range you have to use this extra mode designed to waste time. Manually docking is another time-wasting nuisance and autopilot doesn't handle docking anymore which are steps back for the series. You could in TC just order the ship you're flying to autopilot straight to a known station and have it land there. I tried that with a pilot on my own ship while standing behind him, either it didn't work or I don't understand the new orders system with how complicated it is. Stations are heavily spaced out from my experience, it makes it more tedious than the TC days of stations being clustered more.

There are things that are improved since TC like mining turrets but then that is overshadowed by the horrible UI making it a lot more difficult to order your ships around. On top of that actions being locked behind crew and pilot levels is horrifying. Gone are the days of TC where every ship was ready to go with the right software. Software was annoying since you had to buy it on every ship and not every faction had the same upgrades, but it was easier to find than high level pilots that are needed for these basic tasks in Foundations.

A good number of the weapons are just weird. Not bad, they just control weirdly. I'm sure someone would like them. A positive change IMO is that wharfs and shipyards now make the equipment themselves from raw materials, I find the addition of Wharfs being used only for small ships and shipyards only used for big ships to be weird but wharfs seem to make shipyards as a whole more common now in Foundations.

Another small disappointment, ships had a lot more charm in Terran Conflict but they feel blockier and uglier now. IMO that's kind of fitting now story-wise with how much the galaxy is in conflict they don't have time to make things look nice.

TLDR: They saw Elite Dangerous and thought X4 should be that instead of an X game, since thats how most of the game feels now. Terran Conflict was the peak game and we just needed that improved and streamlined.",1647611433,1647616215,False,7,0,0.493790179491043091,0,True,False,False

Overall a very impressive game for a smaller studio with some great visuals tranquil atmosphere and a memorable soundtrack, its a shame the x series doesnt get more attention than some more high profile space sims it may not have a-list voice actors or an infinite budget buts its a first person single player 4X space sim trading simulation role playing dynamic empire building fleet commanding dope smoking galactic war crimes simulator with a fully playable and mostly finished sandbox to get lost in",1647570650,1647570650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But after 3 hours of trying to find something enjoyable to do that wasnt ruined by bugs broken quests and downright tedious design choices i was so bored i fell asleep on my keyboard. Im not going to write this game off yet however the ship models are gorgeous the music and character models are greatly improved and i do believe this is make or break time for egosoft as a company if they fail here they will all be looking for a new job by next christmas i will keep you updated. Im giving this a WAIT recommendation.
Day 2 i played a lot more today encountered only broken mission bugs today.
in no time at all i had fully upgraded my ship and got allied status with the Argons for those of you who used to love the old x games like myself you should already be feeling sick.
i really hope i am wrong but after today this is what i think.This is no true x game its a dumbed down version of rebirth massively consolised and lacking any real depth or charm i truly pray i am wrong for if i am correct then Egosoft are dead to me..............
ok folks i have got a long way into the game completed the main story quest if you can call it that done all the reserch got hero of the federation rank bough almost every ship in the game blah blah blah firstly this game isnt finished secondly there is TONS i really like abut this game but EGOSOFT ARE BUNCH OF FUCKING LIARS WHO HAVE DEFRAUDED THEIR CUSTOMERS! There i said it and it needed to be said this is NOT x4 this is rebirth 2 and it is disgraceful to release an unfinnished game you faulsly advertised and lied about at FULL AAA price to a public desperate for the game you promised not the disgusting mess you delivered.The game can be fixed it may in time become my favourite game of all time but EGOSOFTS REPUTATION CAN NEVER BE FIXED NOW!
Final Report the ships are Gorgeous in this game far far better IMO than most of the star citizen ships you pay 500 pounds for i know because i am a star citizen backer The station building mechanic is obtuse slow and arduous but master it and you are rewarded with building you own gorgeous cities in space i have built 7 so far. Making money is easy too easy IMO
Space highways are a disaster and an idiotic concept IMO as is the long range teleportation mechanic which is an absurdity in a space flight space combat game.
Which brings me to the worst disaster of all COMBAT where are the enemy ships? Answer nowhere i have killed twenty enemy ships so far i have every ship in the game i have explored as far as i can tell every accessable space sector there is no one to fight.
So if you want to build beautiful space cities and park gorgeous ships on your luxury docking pads and touch yourself i highly recomend this game otherwise for gods sake dont buy this TURD.

UPDATE 02082020
Egosoft have had 2 years to work on this game so what is it like now?
THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY
1 THE GOOD the split vendetta DLC is good in particular the Music which is a huge improvement some of the new ships are also very very good
2THE BAD forget your old saves they are obsolite now you have to start a new game
3THE UGLY there has been no effort made at all to improve the worthless UI its hard to use hard to see and hard to put up with they need a real proffessional to totally redo this whole aspect of the game.The autopilot is still shit collision physics are a joke. Fleet commands are hard to issue the controls are hopeless for this and there are certain essentail commands that egosoft have not bothered to include its embarressing idiotic at best lazy at worst. Capital ships are lacking enough firepower and they move way too slowly this isnt a fun game mechanic its just shit.After a while stations stop building ships so if you need more ships tough shit it seems Egosoft have made the faction AI as incompetant as Egosoft it would be funny if i didnt want this game to be good. 
Final report ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A DIEHARD EGOSOFT FANBOY or you have the patience of a saint.
Its all very sad the game has greatness buried under an ocean of shit the last straw for me was the bugs the crashes the horrible npcs i love the music the split music DLC i would recommend anyone to buy its amazing and beautiful the game however is one for the bin they aint ever gonna fix this its way too fucked up such a shame

HOWEVER. . . for those of you out there that wanna put time into a game that has a realistic time to build mine and travel at times (you need to get the components to build a SETA you do not get it right off the bat unless you have a modded start). then this game is for you! resources and materials are not easy to get a hold of on your own so you are gonna need to get some serious credits before the game really gets good. (i like the fact that the game rewards and punishes you for every action taken) you can end up starting your own faction here too but be warned about starting hell in a sector you need, cause most likely if you take over a sector that once was owned that faction is gonna want it back!  and will hit you with everything they can muster to get it back.  if you want you could take over the entire galaxy if you chose to. i never was able to mind you but doesn't mean there are others that can't, and still you are gonna need hundreds of hours to even get to that point, and it can still be taken away at anytime cause everything is destructible (save planets).  so make sure you have the ships/stations and such well covered from raiders you will need to this game isn't forgiving nor is it meant to be.  if you are still reading this that means your thinking about the pros and cons to the ones who do want this game though do know that it's extremely mod friendly and there is even a script editor in it.

I still find stuff to do in this game, it's amazing. That and new features and DLC coming out.
The game is now version 5.00 beta 6 (I play betas but that is optional).
The capital ship combat has been improved and is now more satisfying. The AI is still perfectible but that is a never ending job I guess.
There is more hints on commands, behaviour or what is not working for a specific ship or station, there is also more help text when you hover over buttons.
I expect that if you are new to the game but take the time to read those hints, it will greatly improve your experience as this game can be quite complex.

Edit after ~1000 hours, using version 4.00:
Still liking the game. There is a few things that annoyed me but I believe they will be fixed eventually.
Defence squads are not always effective due to not always staying close to the ship they protect (traders/miners). Boarding an enemy ship, you can't ask NPC police/patrol ships to stand down and eventually destroying the boarded ship with your marines on it.
Both can be seen as additional challenges but can be frustrating at times.
The new terraforming quests offer an interesting and somewhat new way to play the game (strategy and economy wise)

Initial review:
X4 is definitely a great step up from X Rebirth.
The UI keeps shining, this is especially noticeable when comparing with older games.
I also enjoyed the 3 new game starts with basic navigation, advanced scenarios and a cool intro to fighting. Definitely something I didn't think I would enjoy after so many hours.
The AI fighting seems better but close quarter capital ship fighting still looks cumbersome.

Edit after 100 hours, using version 2.60:
This game is a massive improvement compared to X-rebirth, I would personally say it's a lot better than the X3 games which I played for (too) many hours.
The interface, especially around the map is a big step up and the interactive tutorials are helpful.
The only issue I have seen so far is some odd AI flight (not really fighting back) and autopilot decisions but it doesn't break the game most of the time.

This game is probably more demanding in term of hours and understanding than the average. But if you actually take your time to play, you will probably enjoy your time in the X universe.

I personally really like the data vault feature as it gives more reason to explore and think in the X-universe.

I would say the game seems easier than the previous, partly due to better rewards for jobs and partly because of the automation you can get early in the game.

I bought X4 when it first released and have watched it grow and evolve into what it is today. By leaving a review I hope to persuade others to try this game. I believe Egosoft deserves praise for supporting their games with patches and listening to player feedback.
I have been playing X games since X3 Reunion.

X4: Foundations is for me the ultimate space sandbox.
You can choose between a few game starts which give you some background information about your character if you wish to roleplay. It is important to note however that you are always free to do whatever you want and however you want, hence the ""sandbox"" part. These gamestarts merely decide with what ship you start, where in the universe and your diplomatic relations with the races.

Once you start it is easy to get overwelmed by the mere options on what to do and how to do it. I suggest to simply do the tutorials. The game does a decent job of introducing basic mechanics to you. I however still feel it is necessary to search up additional guides and information. 
Some useful sources for guidance:
- Egosoft youtube tutorial ""What is X4: Foundations?"" & other youtubers
- Egosoft website forum - very helpful community and Egosoft staff actively answer and follow forums.
- X4 wiki
- Steam guides

You startout with one ship and slowly amass your wealth and grow your empire however you see fit.
Do different kinds of missions for the various factions, building reputation with different races gives you access to their ships and techology. 
Every single ship in X4 has a different interior/cockpit and it has to be said; seamlessly landing your ship and walking around on a spacestation without a single loading screen is simply awesome. From the smallest scout to the biggest capital ship, you can walk around in every single one of them. Once you get some credits you can start buying miners and traders and eventually build your own custom space stations.

You can build your own space stations as you buy blueprints and modules from the different races. These allow you the produce your own wares which in turn supply the dynamic economy in the universe. 
Example; Factions are at war and suffer losses, this causes the faction to build many ships and in turn cause a shortage of hull parts (required to build ships and stations). You're free to shape your stations however you want, you're given the tools and pieces to use as you see fit. You're also able to import designs from other players.

The expansions add more races and sectors to explore.
Mod support! Egosoft is a huge supporter of mods and there are alot of them! Steam workshop makes it very easy to look up and activate mods. There is something for everyone.
Manage your space empire and take over the universe.
I recommend looking up X universe lore! What happened in the older X games all connects to X4 Foundations.

I've merely scratched the surface here and there is so much more to talk about. If you feel curious, do look up gameplay and see if it is something for you. I hope i've given some people incentive to try X4, i'm not very good at writing reviews and English is not my native language, sorry for any spelling errors!

Graphics corruption/weirdness, ctd's, lockups, bsod's.. but it's not online so it doesn't take the top spot.
Speaking of online this is the first in the series I've been like, yeah multiplayer could work and would be pretty fun.

Anyway as for the game it's gotten decent now. Sadly the dlc's are required to flesh it out, unfortunate they went down that path. Would like to get tides but the nearly $100 buck purchase from pre-order only included the first two so maybe on sale in the future. Also music is still outstanding.

The core game has the classic X feel but vastly different interactions helping newer players yet force older vets to relearn things. It's not bad, just small stuff ya gotta get used to. Especially right click being king. Otherwise many of the menu layers have been streamlined. More economy points would be nice too since everything eventually comes down to making and outfitting ships.

No small turrets is odd and overall they could use a buff. No built in missile launchers makes them far less used. Weapons being hard points removes part of the fun of collecting and trying random weapons out plus carrying them around like a ship-rpg to swap for different reasons.
The increased speed highway ring should be multiple-multi-stage projects at the start of the game. It makes the smaller map feel very smol. Also travel drives would be great to be removed from most small ships and even some mediums (with a cheapish medium ship carrier introduced to help). Oh don't mind me I'm just your worst enemy whooshing past argon prime.

On the topic of the dlc's they are more like buying power.
Both the split ships and terran tech drastically change things, not to mention the Asgard. A single Asgard could mostly clear the other factions. They do tend to whittle away the Xenon over time too, though it seems like it's lacking a set of turrets or something. Free dlc to give the Xenon some teeth? Maybe add the Q back as a large ship.

Oh factions.
A change to see more independent stations and traders would be nice instead of ""it's all one faction lol"" also rip your MIN rep. Maybe a trader decides to sell their ship/station due to debt or retirement. Maybe some fighters want to get hired for escort. They could have politics and such. So much more than the faction knowing you blew up a single ship in the middle of nowhere. Core faction retaining infinite credits is fine and primary ownership in their central sectors but further out being more 'lawless' and rough could be neat. Also why am I punished for my ships defending themselves, maybe sub-factions would help with that. Go back to the rep being too low with the main faction to enter core sectors.

Ships, stations, and character models look fine (or great and amazing on better rigs).
They've fallen in to some of the same traps that X2+other games do with characters tho. Clones everywhere, limited/no customisation, etc.

More nothing would be great.
Think some of this will come in with 5.0 but as of this writing...
There's a bar on the station. When there needs to be. Why not rng creates a central bar where higher end faction missions could be found or chatted with. And another bar on the outskirts for those standard jorbs but interesting rumours and a shady visitor sometimes. And of'c your Yarrbarr with standard scum and villainy but also people just trying to get by.

Maybe it's getting out of scope to suggest a regional story teller ai/script making small things and drama that play out to shape the local area and change things over time.

Overall it's worth it. This is the start of the next progressive X series.

Game has a lot of bugs which during game progression are more and more annoying.
Developers don't want to fix it, rather concentrating on developing next simple  DLC with candy battleship with which you don't have anything to do.
When you start playing the game, it seems to be amazing game at start  but from middle of game to the end game problems grows.
Retarded AI kills all fun from making battle, it takes a lot I repeat a lot of micromanagement.
No GUI to proper control of your fleet.
No real diffirence beetwen ships, fleet, races, turrest, fighters at the end of game, it no matters what you take,  the terran battleship alone can  kill all Xenon without your attention. 
You have fleet without any purpose, when you at least have money to build all carriers, battleships is the moment when you realise that you don't have anything to do with them.
You don't have any enemy to fight with whom. Xenon are to weak and without help of player become extincted species very soom.
The next DLC Tides of Avarice won't fix anything form Think/Fight aspect of the game it only gives two faction, new aspect of economy and no enemy to use new battleship. 
If you want to spent few hours in game just for flying one fighter and make phew phew, yes you can buy the game, if you dream about battle of fleet no, don't buy the game.

You will have to search for answers online and spend a bunch of your time looking on how to do things. That being said, the game is fun. Once you get a basic idea of how everything works you will be able to play it and enjoy it.

But I still wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it. The game has a lot of issues, from dumb AI, to performance issues. When I started playing this game I was getting 90 fps average(2k High res), after 80 hours playing it, I was getting 25fps average(1080p low res). And the sad part of all is that my CPU, GPU and RAM usage never went above 50%. 

They focus on DLC when the base game can't even be played after progressing it.

Update: After 199 Hours(About half was just from leaving the game running) 
Most of the initial review is still true, this game is really buggy and lacks user experience. You can have fun with it, but most of the time the game will behave in unpredictable ways that will leave you mad searching online for answers.
With that said, I played this game again for a long time only because of mods. Mods for this game are a must have. They improve so many aspects of the game including the performance issues I had on my first playthrough. You can decrease the building times, be able to just use a small number of satellites per sector, more ship designs, improved economy, improved scanning, etc. Like I said the MODS are a necessity in this game.
In conclusion: I don't recommend the game as it is but if you install mods to improve it, it can be really fun just know that mods will not fix everything and there are a lot of cut corners when it comes to user experience and game design.",1614447840,1647125805,False,8,0,0.452394574880599976,0,True,False,False

Yes some things still don't work quite right but considering the massive scale of the game problems like that will happen. All of these things can be worked around as you get used to the game. Also, as I mentioned before they work diligently to correct these issues. Dog-fighting is fun and but as with fighting AI in any game it can get repetitive.

Be aware going in that X4 is not just a flight sim - it can be played as one, but if that's what you're looking for I'd recommend looking at the competitors like Elite: Dangerous and seeing if one of those matches your interest better. If managing a merchant empire sounds fun to you, X4 is right up your alley. With mods to enable emergency teleporting to prevent deaths in fights, X4 can also be an excellent large scale fleet battle sim if you're willing to put in the effort to get a large fleet built.

The developers commitment to continuously updating the game have brought renewed life, while being able to convince me that purchase was worth it after waiting a period of time for the game to be smoothed out. I saw the trash fire that was X Rebirth so I am glad I did not really jump into these games until this one. I am not a hardcore or life-long fan of the X Series of games. I watched from afar through videos or talking with others about it. I honestly put less than 10 hours into Terran Conflict; finding the game to be quiet difficult at the time for me to play or enjoy. This is truly the first X game I have jumped into head first and now have more than 150 hours at the time of this review. 

Building your own fleets, exploring vast systems, creating stations, mining, combat, flying, etc. is pretty incredible experience for a single-player only game. If you are new to the X series and like these Sandbox, open-world space games, I think you will enjoy this. Though I think long-time X series fans might desire something more depending on what they have experienced in the previous well-received titles, such as Terran Conflict. I only have heard great things about Terran Conflict so I imagine its quiet a good game. I cannot accurately compare that title and Foundations, but always a word of caution for long-time fans of any series; you might be disappointed. 

Outside of comparing, the game runs well, though my rig is quiet an expensive set-up though. For those with low to medium end rigs, will have performance issues guaranteed depending where you are in-game. This I have seen in quiet a few forum posts and reviews. Those with high to very high end rigs will have good to excellent performance depending on settings & resolution. The new update, 5.00, will have some-sort of AMD tech that being added that will help with those who own newer AMD hardware to get better performance. The graphics are pretty decent for what it is but its nothing that is jaw-dropping or impressive. Its good enough and I play it for the incredible amounts of gameplay content. 

Bug wise, I have not encountered too many. Sometimes a station will get stuck building a module or one of my ships won't properly follow information as examples. Though I could be misinterpreting a gameplay mechanic - which I think happens often. But any of these misunderstandings or ""bugs"" are not always a constant and are more of minor annoyences than anything. I have not had any major hard-crashes ever that I can recall. It's wise though to always save often with a game that has such a dynamically change universe; one minute you can have your fleet, the next its gone. You can set-up different auto-save intervals depending how far you are along with the game or how much you care about not losing any progress. A big reason I think for different save intervals is the long-save times which can take 20-30 seconds even with my m.2. It can be disruptive if you are right in the middle of a battle or other important in-game task. 

The game is expensive yes; but the content you will get out of it is easily 1000+ hours worth of gameplay. The additional DLCs helps too and the Steam Workshop is a god send. I use a few mods that help fix certain mechanics or add additional features. Examples being additional targeting of subsystems on ships mod, to having a better way for your scouts to auto-explore new sectors. You can easily import tons of new content to keep your current campaign going for even longer or to create a new campaign be longer than the previous one. Be aware though of that distinction; not all mods can be added into a current campaign or be removed after once added. Read the item's workshop description carefully. 

Music is pretty good, worth the buy separately from the game itself. Its fairly memorable with providing a tone that really helps with immersion.",1646523526,1646778233,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Yeah it's a bit janky, but buy if you're an old man who's earliest game memories we're trying to get WC3 to run on a 486 and installing Privateer on 6 floppies. We want the next step in space games, this is it.

Now then. I'd been holding off buying this game for some time because of the bugs and oddities being reported. Those exist, but don't distract from the overall experience. I'll give you highlights of my first three days of play to let you decide if this is for you:

I begin a standard campaign in friendly space. Watch a few YouTube videos because I know this is a complex beast and head out to do some missions. One jump gateway later I see the locals involved in a fleet battle with a huge bunch of red destroyers. There's flak, laser and missiles flying everywhere. My wife is wondering why I'm grinning. The enemy made a mistake apparently, they only bought destroyers. I chip in carefully and they get ripped apart (my contribution was minor). I learn later that battles don't always go this way.

I do missions, destroy easy targets, die a few times and buy a few ships of my own. More YouTube'ing and I'm standing on my own space station watching my own ships go out on mining, trading and exploration missions. I teleport onboard said ships after some research and stand on the bridge, staring out at would be pirates, trade traffic and stations go by as the crew exchange orders. It's important to note that the scale is really well done, whether on stations or ships everything is in the same scale and in the same environment.

A couple of days later I've got almost 10 ships mining and trading for me, one of my close allies is getting pumelled by an enemy so I get involved. I drop later towers and pick off some easy kills near one of the main battles (there's a couple). It's a stalemate though, they've controlled a jumpgate but can't kill the trading station. I really need some middle class frigates and more laser towers to win this war. Even a destroyer....",1646737010,1646769797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Egosoft released a bugged mess yet again. AAA price for a beta placeholder that may or may not be great a year from now. If you are looking to buy a galaxy space and economy simulator buy X3TC/AP, that game is far superior to this despite being a decade and a half old. 

There is no conflict in the game, the missions are luckluster at best and work half the time, trading and mining is borked but it is being patched, turrets on ships do not function correctly or at all and on top of it all the AI will sometimes sit there and receive your weapons fire happily, just standing there or the captured ships you own will warp to location and try to kill you!

They baited us, I fell for it hook, line and sinker. Lesson learned.

                  It is true that the patches are rolling in and a week later some of the issues have been resolved, somewhat. But still the game is far from being what it should be considering the price tag, so I cannot recommend this still. 
                  If you are swimming in $$$ and have the patience you can give it a shot and see for yourselves. The only upside is the community and especially the modding community in Egosoft games is epic and they are more likely to fix their game than they are.

The experience plays like building the back-story surrounding an epic sci-fi adventure.  

The universe is fleshed-out just enough that it provides a great playground, while leaving enough to your own imagination that you really feel like you're crafting your own story.

Whether that's the story of a free trader striving for profits, a mercenary putting his life on the line for the highest bidder, or perhaps a rogue risking it all for a quick take, it's your choice.

X4 drops you in the commander's chair and points you towards the stars.  The rest is up to you .

And there's a lot to do out there.   

Full disclosure; I've played other games in the X - Series.  This one seems to be doing everything right.
 - Full cockpits in every ship (I haven't seen them all yet).  You can even get up from your chair and walk around the cabin.  
 - Combat at every scale from single ship to enormous fleet operations with dozens of capital ships.
 - Deep trading & economy, with commodities and craftable items.  You can even ignore the combat and just trade if you want a chill path to becoming an interstellar mogul, though you'll  have to run from the occasional pirate bent on hijacking your cargo.
  - Mine & sell ore, gases, and liquids from asteroid debris fields
  - Start small and stay small, or grow to command hundreds of ships and hire thousands of crew members to run them, including marines for boarding other ships, each individual has its own independent skills and experience.
  - Feels like a living universe; the other ships out there are actually going places, on missions, doing things.  They didn't just spawn in to provide the player with fodder.  
  - Easily move your viewpoint between first and third person, or attach your camera to other ships and view them from any angle as they make a suicidal attack run at one of your well defended stations.
  - Deploy satellite communication networks,  deploy stationary laser defense platforms, deploy minefields!   All permanent unless taken out by a rogue-element!
  - Incredible customization of every ship you purchase, customize hard-points, engines, thrusters, shields, all of which can effect the look of the ship, with a visual preview and cost breakdown before purchase!
  - Purchase entire space stations, with customizable design, and compete in an interstellar economy while defending your production and logistics lines from pirates, aliens, and *the competition*.

PROs
-A massive simulated galaxy with many sectors and star systems, each owned and dominated by one of the main factions or unclaimed. 
-A dynamic in-game economy that does not stop running the moment you load into your game. Sectors on the other side of the map will continue to run even if you never go there. The NPC factions will continue to build factories, ships and stations, or stage assaults against enemy factions.
-Beautiful visuals backed up by the insane ability to walk around the interior of your own ship as well as stations. It really makes you feel like a spacefarer when you jump in your ship and take off.
-Indepth ship builder using a modular components system. However in order to buy all ships and modules from a certain faction, you need to have a high rep which can only be achieved by doing missions for them. There's also different ship types catering to different playstyles. From massive dreadnoughts to mining and courier ships. 
-Management system is unique and quite interesting to manage (once you learn its intricacies.) As someone in the reviews pointed out, this game is very much Mount & Blade: Warband in Space. 
-A long winding and interesting story which can be unlocked by finding Data Stations and repairing them to receive goodies and a slice of the lore from a particular part of history. 

CONS
-UI suffers from a serious case of Eurojank. Lots of menus to navigate, buttons to press and sliders to slide. Sometimes buttons are grayed out with no explanation at all and forces you to investigate without explaining why. There is a lot going on, and it's amazing to see how the UI offers absolutely no assistance when something goes wrong. 
-Frustrating AI that really pushed me to my wit's end. There is nothing worse than seeing my dedicated security fleets sucking eggs trying to chase down Kha'ak invaders while my mining ships are obliterated. Reaction Force mod helps a bit, but it drives me mental seeing my security ships stop their jump halfway costing them crucial time to protect my ships. I've lost many mining ships to this and it is beyond ridiculous to have to micro-manage everything and everyone. Every Commander and Manager in this game is an incompetent piece of ####. Otherwise, sometimes ships you give instructions to will not do as you have asked. Others (especially when it comes to trading and transferring wares) will get stuck and will have their ship icon flicker violently on the map. Autopilot will also have you fly into other ships, asteroids and stations. 
-Bugs and glitches galore. Ships will get stuck. I somehow got my Captain wedged in between the pilot chair and forward console, rendering it impossible to fly that ship cause he was obscuring my view. Firing him didn't help but he did help serve in giving me directions to a system for a quest...
-Graphics intensive. The game runs very smoothly most times on my RTX 2080 Super. However big battles with lots of ships and projectiles will bring everything grinding to a halt. 
-The base game and DLCs are a must (in order to unlock all systems, factions and ships) but are very pricey for what you are getting. I would look at sales.
-Some of the ""funkier"" missions can be absolute hell and a chore to complete. (I'm looking at you, Torus Eternal wreckage.)  
-Loading and saving times take a while.
-The ship designs are somewhat uninspired.",1624147554,1645332531,True,3,0,0.522421836853027344,0,True,False,False

So based on the description on the store and some screenshots a few of you may have the wrong idea about the game. So I will highlight a few missing features the game needs that players might assume the game already has. 1 You do get to own a lot of ships from fighters to massive carriers, however one should know the larger ships are literally just a bridge, launch pad, and exit ramp. There are no interiors to any of these ships. Same for stations. 2 At no point in the game does the player ever actually get a ""Home"" there are no rooms for you on ships, stations, or the player HQ. Customization is limited to the player kit-bashing station exteriors and applying paint to ships.  3 While there is a ton of content and story to explore the game lacks any form of quality of life (Eating, drinking, sleeping, minigames, hanging with npcs, any form of ground combat, Etc.). There is no romance or friendship of any kind in fact you kinda just exist in this universe not really a part of it outside of quest and missions.

If you enjoy dog-fighting, space combat (without ground engagement), ""Empire"" management, trading, economy simulation, and fleet combat (Tactical overlay or active participation) Then X4 is for you.

========================

Now after about 800 hours, I think it's fair to update my review with a few additional notes. 

Firstly, again egosoft has really improved the game post launch, like they do, with countless improvements and two DLC's, with the third DLC right around the corner.

= PERFORMANCE & GRAPHICS =
Both has been improved alot, so you can get pretty good frame rates if you have a good gaming rig. They also recently added support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, however I get better results using NVIDIA DSR at 2.25x DL, addressing the games flirr-issues around station edges at certain distances. Overall I am now pretty happy with the FPS and the graphics quality, even if Aliasing/Flirr around station edges is still not completly gone and their recently added fog (with god-ray effects) is a real FPS killer. In general graphics were improved with better shaders and effects, as well as screen space reflections. 

= SHIP DESIGNS = 
With the two DLC's many new ships were added and they do indeed look MUCH better than some of their initial ones. Also they have gone back and redone some of ugly original designs with new options that look way better. It is very nice to see that they are going back and revisiting the existing bad designed ships instead of only added new ones. Very good decision!

= SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE =
Again, due to the two DLC's, the universe expanded quite a bit, propably about double the initial size, maybe even a bit more. I would say it feels pretty good but still a bit limiting. There are some mods that expand the game to 256 sectors and I couldnt notice a performance hit - so in that regard I believe there is still room for more sectors/systems. When it comes to space games, yes - bigger IS better.

= STORY / MISSIONS =
The launch version had very bare-bone story and mostly generic randomized missions. During the last years however egosoft has added lots of new written mission/story content. The writing is gernally pretty good and interesting, however the missions themselves are often a bit frustrating because the events are difficult to predict. E.g. the mission designers keep ""suprising"" you with stuff that you just cannot know beforehand when you begin the mission, and as such you might not be prepared for them (for example you are in a wrong type of ship). Therefore, If you do the story missions make sure to SAVE ALL THE TIME and use different save slots. Unfortunately the loading times are extremly long and so doing these missions can get a bit annoying for these reasons. I would hope they use the mission briefing interfade better when they design missions in the future to give you more details about what you can expect and also hopefully they will improve upon the loading times..

= ALL THE OTHER STUFF / QOL =
There have been just countless additions, bug fixes and improvements to the game since its original launch, far too many to list here. Its great to see the game come along like this.

If you didnt get the game yet, I think now is a great time to try it! 

ORIGINAL REVIEW
========================
This is my review after 100 hours in the game.

X4 is a great space simulation game and a worthy successor of X3. For an X series game, the launch has been pretty smooth with no real game breaking bugs. This game marks the beginning of a new era for the X games and as such it there is still room for improvement and extension. But before we go there, here is what I consider some of the strong points of this entry in the series:

- The game projects a great atmosphere, very similar to X2/X3 and which was lacking much in X:R
- The universe layout is much better than the one from X:R and it's perceived size is bigger.
- Materials/textures look much more believable now, since they actually have reflections again!
- New map UI is a brilliant piece of work and definitely now the center point for managing your empire
- Ship upgrades are more fun. This time, when you change the outfit of your ship it actually changes the visual appearance.
- There are some new ambient sound effects, when you fly by stations and ships that really add to the atmosphere.
- Station building is much improved. You can place each module freely. No more build plans, no more ugly tubes.

If you are a fan of this type of game, there is really no reason to wait. You can already greatly enjoy the game in its current state - but- off course there are some things that could still use some work:

- The in-game encyclopedia is missing a lot of details. 
- Encyclopedia entries sadly are no longer voiced and the developer stated they have no plans to add it back in later.
- Most of the ship models (hulls, not textures) look abysmal compared to ship designs from earlier games
- Split and Boron races are missing and will only be added in later as part of DLCs.
- While the universe is definitely much bigger than X:R, and despite the developer claiming you cannot compare sizes with earlier installments of the series as the sectors are much bigger in themselves, I still feel the map must grow substantially for long term motivation. Probably about double the amount of systems that are currently there.
-  It still needs some optimization. You need a pretty potent rig to play this game with an enjoyable framerate, and even if you have a very top notch computer the framerate can still sometimes tank. From my opinion, the developers have a hard time really utilizing the available hardware efficiently.

Some of these issues, I am sure, will be addressed with future updates, some I will have to live with. Nonetheless, as already stated above, X4 is a fantastic game already even with these issues and I am very excited to see where it will go from here.",1544885747,1644881807,True,6,0,0.520178377628326416,0,True,False,False

X4 is a universe simulation with a variety of interesting aspects to it's game play.  First, it has a pretty good space flight-sim mode where you can fly around in any of the ships, engage in combat, trading, or whatever you like.  Secondly, the entire economy of the game's NPC factions is entirely simulated, from mining, to moving materials around, to producing various components to build new ships and stations.  NPC factions also build new stations, lose stations to hostile action, etc.  Third, the game allows you to build up your own faction, allowing you build stations, ships, and field fleets of ships.

While the flight sim is pretty good, and the economic simulation going on is really good too, the gameplay falls apart when you start playing it like the grand strategy it's trying to be.  The game steers you into playing it more and more like a RTS game, using the map and fleet lists to guide your faction.  But this is where this game comes up very very short.  It's hands-down the worst RTS game I've ever played.  It has none of the refinements RTS games have enjoyed for the past 2 decades.  No hotkey squad assignments, no shortcuts for actions on selected ships, no box-draw selecting, no bookmarking map locations for quick return to that spot of the universe.  The UI is atrociously bad through out the game and makes guiding your faction a hair-pullingly frustrating endeavor.  Add on top of that just about the stupidest AI I've had the displeasure of working with.

Then we have hostile developers that seem to ignore bug reports, and then having the audacity to start work on a new paid DLC while years-old bugs remain unresolved is what earns my thumbs down.  While there is no other game on the market that reaches the depth this game does, with beautiful graphics, I still cannot recommend this game.  Lastly, this game has severe performance issues.  It runs pretty terrible on high-end hardware.  With all settings maxxed out, I'm getting at best 30FPS at 1080p with AMD 3900X + AMD 6800 XT.  Backing off some of the settings boosts performance, fortunately.

At least they acknowledge that they can't fix it so they add a ""unstuck"" button for us. 

I am not sure what the developers plans are but it seems they are already moving forward with new DLC and I am not sure if they plan on focusing on fixing all the glitches in the game

The reason why i decided to not play it again UNTIL they fix it was after an hour of flying and following the quest mission I docked at the station that the mission had me go to and for some odd reason my ship got thrown around when i was just slowly descending to dock.

Ok, 170 hours in and am now playing the Split DLC and the short version is this: Game is good, lots of depth, terrible UI, a bunch of silly bugs and silly design decisions, but overall the graphics/sound/gameplay are pretty good.

Ok, so I decided to give the 4.0 update a try and rebuy the game (wouldn't work when I bought on launch so got a refund) and here is my 20+ hour mini-update-review (will flesh this out after I have completed all there is to do).

So far I can see the game still has a bunch of bugs (AI sucks as usual, pretty much just drives through anything it comes across, asteroids, buildings etc and has a habit of getting stuck inside buildings and bouncing around inside), though the game actually works this time and has not crashed for me at all (which is good), though I did have a close game hang, but no biggie. Graphics are good at high settings (tried ultra but a step too far), fps has a few moments but mainly stable (RTX 2060) and there is a fair bit of pop in on busy scenes. Overall though graphically it holds up ok.

Gameplay wise is where it is at with the X games and to be fair this game has a load of QoL upgrades that were not there at launch that are greatly appreciated (if you have ever played the prior games you know what I mean (QoL was not a thing in old X games)). X4 does seem to push the boat out and improve on what was really a tech demo in X3:Rebirth, pulling a lot from the older X games and merging them (reasonably well) with the newer functionality in X3:Rebirth (thank the gods they didn't bring that awful highway minigame to X4!!). Lots of depth here, but not as much as some of the older X games (more scope in some aspects of x$ than the older games, then less in other areas), but I do think they have found a good compromise between the deep and shallow gameplay loops has been reached for the things you can do in the game.

Story is, well, it is an X game so they are more dressed up tutorials to be honest, but they serve to function well for progression and are more of the same that players of the old X games will know all too well (nothing special, but move the game along). For new players, some may come away thinking ""what the hell was that all about???"", but the missions and story aren't totally terrible when you look some of the older X games.

So, the million dollar question is...... Do I change my review of this game to up vote.....
[/b]

Yes. Up Vote (only took over a year!)

Final analysis
===========[/b]
I love the X games (bias acknowledged) and predictably they did exactly the same as they do every time and release a pile of barely playable garbage on launch, then slowly fix and update the game until it is actually what was advertised (doing a 'no mans sky'). Do I like this business practice?? Not on your life, but it is what it is and I will play this game until completion and give my final thoughts on the game before I get the DLC. (I hate DLC, but I have been there myself so I know the score).

[i]
Downvote: At this time.... (Old review, launch bought, didn't work, refunded)
Usual EgoSoft release. Read into that what you will, but you know it will be a solid game and playable within a few months...IE: It doesn't work on release. ;)

Addendum: I love the X games, always have. But if you have been playing their games as long as I have, you get to know that on release the game will suck hard, but eventually it will be a great game that you will put 100's of hours into.

- Cockpits vary by ship, but usually somewhere between lazily-drawn and literally nonexistent, except on capital ships where you get to walk around in a tiny version of a Star Trek-style bridge.

- Hilariously terrible voice acting even by video game standards - this game might actually be using AI generated voice lines rather than real people, it's honestly hard to tell.

- UI/UX that actually does everything in its power to make you struggle with performing simple tasks, as is X tradition.

- Bugs, bugs, bugs, and then some more bugs.

PS: Forgot the most hilarious part - installing upgrades on your ship takes real time.

Complex economy, vast universe, seamless transition between inside staions and the vastness of space wide variety of ships and modules the ability to not just buy and sell, but to built up your own economy. Your own stations and production chains you will take dozens of hours when you are new to the game but it will be great to do so.

Maybe you even decide to take one of the unclaimed sectors and make it your own. Seeing how comerce rises and traders from different races and empires start frequenting this previously abandoned area of space, due to the wares that you produce while simontaniously filling your coffers is an amazing side to behold.

Youll have to deal with the pirates there but that can be handled by a few patrol craft, but than the small pirate ships start getting bigger and your small patrolcraft arent able to deal with it anymore not a big deal, we have made enough money built enough reputation, we can get the big guns out.

So we get an destroyer to deal with the bigger pirates but the small craft still have their use cause we still encouter the small pesky craft and midium sized ones. To hard for the destroyer to catch up.
We just tell our little craft to ignore the big ones so that they dont get instantly wiped out and...oh no...where is the option for that?
I swear i saw it before the ability to target big capital ships or smaller fighters. Yes there it is. Oh it just applies to turrets?

So i can tell my turrets not to engage a big capital ship but the medium sized corvette itself will still fly into the main battereis of the big giant ship get deleted!? And the little fighters will do the same?

Ok i can deal with that, its not too frequent and the losses can be replaced. 

But now not only the pirates are showing the Xenon after a few dozend hours are seemingly getting very strong, they even overran a few sectors of my allies. Well, we will have to do something about that.

We will set up a fleet and attack their station to drive them back. My capital ships shall be armed with missiles and long range guns so that the enemy cant reach my fleet wile ill shall pound them with impunity. 
We will take even a carrier with smaller craft cause even if not too much of a threat, enough of the little fighters will overwhelm even the mightiest battle ship.
And there is an intercept command for fleet wings i read in forums that those fighters will exclusively target small and medium ships but not bigger targets. Great thats what i need!

So we attack the station with a coordinated attack the button even says so. Great! Great my fighters engage the drones while my Capitals advance. But hell why are my fighters engaging the station? Oh they are drawn to attack the station because they are hit by point defence and want to retaliate. Just set them to ignore enemy attacks in global should fix it. No it doesnt....
But my battleships will still deal with the staion.....
No they dont...
They will with utter stubborness engage the drones...with their main guns although the turrets set to ignore small craft and fire happily at the station with missiles and Plasma the forsaken destroyer hunts drones with his main gun gets drawn into the station defences and gets blown up in seconds than the second than the third.
....
Ok cordinated attack doesnt work

So attack directly on the stations then. Hey they use their main guns to actually engage the station, ok the S ships die all the same as before, but now at least the big guns work...
No they dont...

They dont stop and happily advance into the range of the enemy defences and get blow up like before.

Sometimes you are lucky but dont count on it. When you not constantly fight the urge of your fleet to commit suicide y9ou will have ungodly losses not because of the enemies strenght but because fleet management is non existend what is there is an illusion. You will have to micromanage every step of the way.

You will realise it when you get there.

I bought it because i wanted epic space battles, im utterly disappointed. No fleet cohesion, no ability set specific roles that actually have an effect and not simply devolve into a cluster.... of stupidity.

If you dont want to bother with the fleet, great but you will come to the point, where life get harsh without one.

And it might drive you insane enough to write an review as longwinded as this one, to at least get rid of some of the frustration.
I tried for the last 30 hours to get it to work but it simply isnt possible in vanilla. Either you do it all by yourself, controlling every ship, or you loose half of your fleet against a solarpower station. Over and over again. And reloading takes ages.

Maybe the next update allows at least capital ships to stop and shoot. Just that would help alot, when a damn ship would just STOP and shoot.",1643624248,1643624248,False,207,23,0.870119392871856689,17,True,False,False

Not recommended.

You bought a car from a manufacturer which produced 2 of your favorite cars ( X2 and X3 ). 

But this one has square wheels that sometimes work but most of the time they just fall off. 

The steering wheel turns them in the right direction 30% of the time, 30% of the time the direction is reversed, 20% of the time acts as a gas pedal and 20% of the time it starts the window wipers.

It's also slow and uglier than the previous models which you loved ( ship design ). 

The manufacturer relies on the buyers to solve all the above problems while developing decals and spoilers which also work as intended 50% of the time.

Details

The Good:

The modular system for ships is a great addition.

The station build editor is probably the greatest addition to this game. Good job guys !

Simulated economy is pretty nice.

Building, flying and commanding your own ships regardless of class ( rebirth was an abomination which should've never existed )

The bad:

The AI is stupid by any standard and it's the thing that made me not play this game anymore, even after giving it more than enough chances.

I'm not even talking about fighters which apart from jousting are incapable of doing anything else. Oh no, i'm talking about capital ships which should be one of the easiest things to implement, especially since they went all fancy and made them modular.

Capital ships are not even capable of maintaining the maximum distance at which their guns can fire but instead charge into the range of ( i'm guessing ) their lowest range weapons even though those are set to attack fighters and you told it to attack a space station ( PROgramming at its finest ).

Ships are incapable of staying in formation, unable to move at the same speed while in a formation and basically a s**t show to look at.

Egosoft in its own flawed logic decided to add an experience ""mechanic"" to pilots and station managers which takes forever to level up. This further worsens the AI problem since a low level station manager has worse performance and affects its subordinates. Fun thing is, even at their max level, you will see cargo ships running around at 10% occupied cargo space so this mechanic is useless and it's only there to bring frustration.

The ship designs are terrible compared to previous titles. My personal guess is that initially they hired a box designer to act as ship designer, then a mushroom enthusiast ( teladi ) and finally after they got some money from their initial launch they managed to hire a junior graphics designer to make the terran and split ship design serviceable ( sorry to however designed them, your work is hard to appreciate while being lost among the other floating trash cans ).

The game runs at about 60-80 fps ( max i've seen was 100-120 in a system which only had a skybox and some rocks ) at 2k using an RTX 3080 with a Ryzen 5900x and 32 gigs of ram.

Their explanation on the forums ( to someone using a similar setup ) was that even the best CPU's throttle under the weight of their pocket Universe simulation which is just hilarious.

Conclusion:

This is the biggest collection of (mostly) good ideas, none of them polished even by 50% which are held together by spit, glue and some dead flies.",1642872440,1643475990,False,160,27,0.768982231616973877,13,True,False,False

The game focuses on trading and station building,
but due to the terrible Ai and mechanics is it impossible without frustation to play it.

If you have multiple stations you can't set AI to share the ressources between those stations.
No instead the have to SELL it to the other station. Your own ressources.
Also is this AI so clever that (in trading mode for station) that it likes to buy from foreign stations. 
Miner AI under control of AI Station goes mining stuff and don't empty their hole storage. 
No the cargo isn't full and demand is high. 

Statistic fights (not rendered fights) are bad. My defend station armed to the teeth normally vaporize enemies if I'm present. On the map my station is acting like a idiot and gets hammered by 6 Xeno ships.

If you have a builder that is constructing something you can't retreat it from the battle if it gets ambushed.
Boarding with the AI is the terrible, stupid af and likes to jumps around the target.

Enemies have no tactical behaviour. If an enemy ship crosses your fleet, it will mindless attack your fleet no matter if this fleet is 2 or 20 ships strong.

Ship AI is so stupid that they will retreat towards the enemy..

I waited 3 years to buy this with the hope to get a functional fun game.
Instead I got a buggy game with huge AI and logic flaws, plus known graphical issue 
that they don't bother to fix (hull and shield hud problem)

Insane micro management, you can't leave the AI alone in a battle, manually ajust their attack angle, they jumping around like idiots out of range of their target, going suicidal etc.

Thank god there are modders who make it a bit more acceptable.

Yeah, spend another 3 days to reach the end game. Have 6 Asgards, bunch of raptors with bombers and fighters, Rattlesnakes, etc.
The game looks gorgeous in space battles when they work. Seeing an Asgard firing every weapon is a sigh to behold. Even flying next to one. So so beautiful.

The bad:
- XL ships start slow in travel mode (which is fine, IF!) but they stop to often. 90% of the cases you won't figure it out in what (asteroid, fighter) or why they stopped. You just have to wait 30 seconds so it can cancel again in 10. Its a waiting game. It is broken, it is unusable when you're in the sector
- some Asgards and L ships do not fire their full arsenal of weapons on stations.
- XL ships and L ships will turn away from stations to reposition for a fighter that is attacking them
- Carrier logic of docking (when to dock, why to dock, how to dock) needs to be rebuild from the bottom up. 
- The whole supply thing is .... demented. Whoever tought about this has implemented in the worst way possible. You need to supply manually each and every Monitor (XL fleet supply ship), each carrier unless you want to wait 30 min for them to chase around for their supplies. Buying from you station where everything is in one place and do it automaticaly is a big NO from Egosoft (why would you want it to be easy?).
- When you have over 1k ships and want to engage with the fleet + other tasks (like building, etc) you also need to care for each individual ship and tell them to:
a) drop tower laser when they are attacked (the whole operation is at least 5 seconds per tower and sometimes the menu dissapears and you have to redo it)
b) drop mines
c) tell them where and when to repair
- there are instances where ships will dock with your XL supply ship and do not move for 10 minutes. Go into sector, no movement, go out of sector, no movement. Check if trading drones are there, check for the cargo bay not full, check for supply item for the XL supply ship.

And many many many many more that do not make sense in late game or simply do not work. This game is menial, diabolical and made in hell.

26 JAN 2022 - Update 5.0

Improvements galore, finally. This is the state that the game was supposed to be released. Still thumbs down:
- massive massive issues with fleet commands. They get stuck. You often need to cancel the command and simply run it again or give another command. It usually says ""Cannot get there"".
- the empire management thing is as usual, unecesary complicated. Let me give you an example: now, you can finally update a couple of ships at once. Lets say you have a fleet of the same type but one of them is damaged. Tuff luck bud, because one of them is damaged you will not be able to repair that one with the whole fleet and you have to run it separately, and because you cannot queue upgrades, you need to watch it and wait. The whole game is wait, watch, micromanage, just like Bernard likes it. 
- mimic commander behaviour is not working for me (with repeat orders)

I run vanilla, no mods. Improvements but not there yet.

After almost 2 years after the release.

Pros:
- gorgeous & overly detailed in many ways. Sense of vastness.
- nothing beats the feeling of standing on the platform and seeing a ship landing, loading and unloading. 
- music 
- the battles, when they work (you can hover a bigger ship like a carrier and such and simply watch it dueling another ship, its absolutely INSANE to be carried away by another ship and just cruising around. It feels fantastic, they've nailed this)

Cons:
- overly KoMpLikATed for no reason (eh, germans)
- bugs, oh the bugs. 
- what the game wants to be and what it is are worlds apart
- non existant fleet management (they stop, they stutter, they take 15 min to jump through a gate if you are in the system and so on)
- no understanding how the player thinks vs how they've build the game.

Feedback:
- make an engine around a fight 1000 vs 1000 ships (10 carriers with 100 fighters each). When you have that under control as management, movement, fps and responsiveness then you build an engine around that. Your engine it doesn't feel build for fights. Make it so.

- everything is a chore. As an example I don't want to worry how to transfer my captains between ships. That is silly. I know you fixed this in the latest update, let me give you another one: If my station is producing X material and I need that material for building an expansion for that station the game doesn't transfer the material itself, not through drones, not through traders, not through anything. If it does, through a miracle, it is not reliable. I don't understand it, it should work, I shouldn't worry about such a thing. It is again, overly KoMpLikATed for no reason.

- I don't have a problem with waiting for the game to do something as long as I know 100% it is not bugged and I am waiting for a process. Your games are bugged. Your combat is bugged, your economy is bugged, your fleet management is bugged.

- your fleet management is nonexistent. You need to manage 10 carriers with 100 fighters on the fly in battle. Supply should be handled automatically.  I need to set up the supply ship once and that's it (and it needs to work, 100% of the time). There is no point of micromanaging it, I want to press on a carrier and just press Rebuild fleet and the carrier takes care of it's fighters with the help of my Factories and whatnot. Same with supply.

- I don't want to chase captains and ask about their skills. Period.

- I don't want to use the elevator.

- I want to TP between the stations without having a ship there. Imagine the blasphemy of that... making it logic and easy.

- I want a 2 bil complex that can fit in a box, and just have render the box and not the complex. The ""box"" can be a mega station with ""factories"" inside for the lore sake. I don't understand why you as devs haven't thought about it. Elegant solution, this is a elegant solution. I will take my 40 extra FPS any day of the week against any other thing.
- make the game playable in fights, that should be your goal

- Carriers should able to dock and undock ALL their fighters in maximum 1 min or less with me in the sector. No bugs, no hiccups, no moving platforms, no tricks, no nothing. Needs to be fast and easy. 
1) their role is to carry fighters. They fail and docking and undocking their fighters with me in sector. That's why I said, you build an engine that can handle 1000 vs 1000 and you start from there.

- your goal is to move items in the game, or at least the ships in the game should move as fast as possible in choke points. One of your problems is the gates because what you imagined and what is possible are again 2 different things. Make the gates as in Mass Effect with teleportation. Do not make them go through the gate. I don't want to wait 20 min for my fleet to become unstuck and move 1 by 1 (spool the engines for 1 min, move, stop because object blocking the path, spool the engine, wait at the game).

- with the problem above, spooling the engines doesn't help. Big ships is fine if they feel sluggish or slow but you need to implement your ships in your engine with 1000 ships in the sector. They need to ... move, incredible I know. Spooling is fine in theory but there's is no point in practice since there's so many things that will go wrong and that adds time on top of those things.

- things just need to happen. Building need to happen with your own material without bugs. Combat needs to happen. Movement needs to happen, specially as a fleet. Re-supplying needs to happen quick and easy. Docking and undocking 100 ships needs to happen. Gate jumping as a fleet needs to happen.

- a trick or two could be learn from the guy that makes X3 Mayhem, if you as devs are not aware of him your making a big mistake. He ""fixed"" the SETA problem by having fleet maintenance and many more.

I refunded it. Absolutely unplayable due to bugs.

So I thought 'Surely they must have fixed it by now' and bought it again.
Well…..they fixed some of the errors....joysticks kind of work now.

But it's still packed with bugs. You'll find a new one every time you play it. Silly things like: suddenly mouse pointer starts to drift to one side. But only in map mode, so not a HW or OS issue. Or menus appearing without buttons. The game needs restart to fix those. Even essential game concepts like collision detection and path finding does not work. If you assign a group of large ships to attack a target, it’s like watching bumper cars. They’ll constantly crash into each other and the target.
It’s also clear that Egosoft has given up trying to fix this as they have disabled collision damage. So you can now slam into an asteroid at 9000 m/s with no damage..just drains your shields. And large ships will just fly through them. That is just sloppy. And that’s also the word for all the ’new features’ they are adding. It’s just half-baked ideas poorly implemented to make it look like they’re doing something.

And the bugs are not even the worst part. It's all the 'This is just stupid' things that gets to you. Like: I'm attacked by a lasertower in a sector. If I return fire I get a criminal record...even though the sector owners own forces are attacking the thing. That’s stupid. And during this a very generic 'alien talking' video starts to play...in your target info window where you really don’t want it during a fight. More stupid. And the voice is saying ’reporting an attack against this station’…...what station ??
Simple things, easily fixed but they can’t be bothered.

Or crazy game logic for factories like ’it’s better to travel far to get resources than to pick it up locally where it’s abundant’. You’ll then have to make custom blacklist rules to fix this.

Weapon turrets missing every shot because they fire at the model center.
Main weapons can’t lock onto stations because….they are too big ?
Main map only working well in 2D…..in a 3D game.
And the list goes on and on….

Then there’s price. If you buy the base game you only get about 1/5 of the full game. You have to buy the rest as DLC’s. So buying the full game at full price will end up at over 100 euros. That is way too expensive for a game of this poor quality.
And I guess this is also an indication of Egosoft’s strategy now. Ignore all the errors and just pump out DLC’s for money.

I tried to make it work. Added mods to fix some issues and even used cheats to get rid of ’cant be bothered to deal with this again’ (like Kha’ak and cheesy Zenon)
But it’s no use. It just gets more and more frustrating.

What is does best is giving you ability to shape the game play between those elements, giving you tons of things to do and explore. I'm at 298h into the game writing this - I am probably beginning mid-game now. I spent 800+h on X3 and still had quite a bit left to do. This one probably has around 1000h in it for me.

Some hints: use google, forums etc.; at least start your primary quest line (those I did gave a free extra ship or some resources); read requirements closely - game is heavily using CPU - it really works bad on weak machines; don't skip DLCs - get a good offer and get them; adding them in game will likely break what you worked for (your safe station might land in a warzone, e.g.) - probably better start with all of them.

It's like a mash of the best parts of X3 and the. . . redeemable parts. . . of X Rebirth. If you've never heard of the X series before, basically, this series is the best series of space-based 4X games, where you can play it like a first-person space dogfighter, a strategic resource management game as you grow and expand your empire, or anything in-between.

There's a lot that can go wrong with this approach, and believe me, it does -- but you can always as the player fix the economy if it crashes, or support certain factions through your production.

This is not a perfect game. Far from it. There are bugs, it's rough around the edges, and it's not complete.

The economic simulation has come so far over the years that it is enjoyable to work with. Shortages of materials mean a shortage of production.  No hull parts = no hulls built. The same can be said of all other components they affect construction or trade and commerce. No money flowing is as bad as no parts flowing  and recovery can take a long time.

It's a very nice game if you're able to persist through the A.I. and some ""features"" that seem like an attempt to get rid of the players. It's a farily decently sized universe for the game style, and lot of interesting things to do. It will waste your time in a very disturbing way though. Sadly, I don't even mean that you could be doing something other than gaming...

The game is fun, but it seems like the devs focused on wasting the player's time. The latest updates made saving and loading faster... now it only takes about 45 seconds to save/load (if you're using SSD). That's about 43 seconds longer than it should based on file size. 

The early game can be extremely frustrating, since you'll have a pretty good chance of being jumped by multiple enemies against your small, slow ship with imaginary shield / weapons and toiler-paper-tough hull. 

More often than not, the autopilot will be navigating at about 10% of your max speed because it chose to dive into an asteroid field instead of flying above or below. It will also often go into an infinite loop around the universe at the highways just for the lols. Unfortunately, that's not even the sad part about the A.I.

This game also has a feature inspired by Satan that allows your ship to go into internal storage at stations and devour up to 30 minutes trying to retrieve it because f you. There's also a good chance that it will trigger the locked cockpit bug which can be very painful to fix if you don't have teleport tech when it happens.

Other than that, the game is quite fun. I just wish it didn't throw away 40% of the play time with bizarre features and bugs.",1642094677,1642094677,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Beautiful world. The galaxy is littered with beautiful planets, rings, structures, and cool ships.
+ Excellent level of immersion in a star-pilot role. Buy/build ships, run missions, hire crew, buy upgrades, all draw you into the world.
+ Controls for mouse and keyboard are good. I tried to use my Steam Controller to play, but could not get the ship turning settings to work correctly and eventually gave up on using the controller.
+ Decent modding community has added some nice Quality of Life things and changes some game dynamics.

Cons:
- Frequent bugs, not usually game-breaking: Collision with stations or asteroids has a good chance of trapping you inside them. With effort I was always able to bump my way out, but it's still fucking annoying. Sometimes when I dock all the NPC's on a station have vanished. Saving and reloading usually brings them back. Trying to go through a jump gate will sometimes stick/bounce you back. Flying away and re-entering worked. Coming into a docking area quickly might not trigger the docking area slow field. How is it the game has been out for years with several DLC's and the collisions haven't been sorted out?
- Whatever monster designed the menus for this game should be banned from the games industry. Why are all the buttons super long and thin? Why can't missions have its own tab in the map menu? Why does assigning orders to a ship require digging through nested sub-menus and dropdown choices? Has nobody seen radio buttons? This should be like 3 clicks (Fleet -> Ship -> Order) instead of 15.
- Grabbing missions from stations requires shoving your ship's nose into randomly placed ""signal leaks"" around the outside of the station. Apparently Bulletin Board technology has been lost in the spacefaring future. Also, the player ship can scan the cosmos, but you have to get within inches of the signal source to pick up the mission transmission.",1642043234,1642043234,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sometimes, people ask the discussion forum whether this game is fit to play yet.  But the answer is still no.  It has so many small and large problems that it's hard to keep track of them.  

The AI wears its pants on it's head.  
Core elements of the UI are inconsistent, obtuse, obfuscated, buried, and just generally janky.  
It's difficult to figure out how to do core parts of the game.  You spend huge amount of time alt-tabbed out, searching out answers online.  
It eats up all your memory, leaks, and the performance tanks after a bit of time.  
By late game, saving and loading take 5 minutes with an SSD.
You have to figure out subtle nuances of the simulation in order to figure out whether you should be present at a fight, or if you should stay on the other side of the galaxy in order to impact how the AI and simulation behave.
The end game is still half-baked, even for a sandbox, with little purpose to taking over space.
Different ships, weapons, and systems have no tooltips.  Getting information for basic comparisons is typically clunky, time-consuming, and barely supported.
Many mechanics have very little description, requiring the community to measure, catalogue, troubleshoot and piece together basic behaviors themselves.  
Some mechanics exist specifically to make things function worse, to sabotage you, without transparently describing how.

And the devs don't speak on any of this stuff.  They just hype the next expansion.

People will constantly defend the developers, since they're a small group, and they're attempting a difficult system.  But too much of the game is still at beta-testing quality, years after release.  It was always up to these developers to limit the scope of their work in order to make a good, polished product.  So it's not a problem of gamer expectations; the poor quality across the board is on them.

The menu system is the biggest improvement, but it's basically a clunky trading sim at that point. The combat is trash, enemies are overpowered, AI is worthless, and you never pilot a ship that feels sufficiently powerful.

The trading is bad too. It doesn't feel like the market is based on real supply and demand. It feels like stations get resources spawned in them rather than producing them from trade. I only have 1 freighter and 3 transporters, but I've already saturated the market for the most profitable resources. So I guess just let the game play itself at this point since manual intervention won't improve my profitability.

The AI is worthless. I haven't seen a single meaningful battle. You'll see an enemy station pop-up in an allied territory just for it to instantly be destroyed. Allies don't even seem to actually care about Xenons. They don't ever push into each other's territory. The whole universe feels fake; like nothing actually matters and the AI won't even react to what you do.

The combat is rough. Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't lock on to enemies. If they fly past me I have to manually re-target them. That is a giant pain. The game also seems to rely heavily on terrible auto-aim that misses more than hits. The whole fiasco feels like an exercise in frustration.

There's pointless crafting for items you'll never use except the SETA drive which should be free since it makes the game bearable to even play. Doesn't seem like there are jump drives either. Another bad move. I guess Egosoft was worried their puddle-shallow experience would be laughable without artificially lengthening the game. You'll have to constantly jettison illegal goods, and I'd rather they didn't even exist since they aren't even sell-able.

My massive starship isn't massive. You just teleport everywhere. Want to walk around your hard-earned frigate? NOPE you can only teleport between the bridge, dock, and exit. Why even let people pilot ANY ships then.

Enemy ships seem to spawn out of nowhere. Rather than being built and flying from a station, you'll just see squads of fighters pop out of space and start taking you apart. Even with a Frigate you can only take on about 3 Xenon fighters before they will start absolutely wrecking you.

Everything works better when it's not rendered. Ships AI is terrible if you are traveling in/with them. Better to not render the world for trading ships, or else they will bug out constantly.

I started X on X3 with all DLC. I liked Rebirth even though it was really limited in scope. X4 promises a LOT but only pays lip-service to what it promises.

If you just want to be a terrible trading sim, then get rid of the overhead of a 3D universe and just be a browser game already.

btw, i'm not giving Egosoft any more money. I'm tired of being nickle and dimed for games that get worse and worse while demanding more and more money.",1641621050,1641622223,False,12,0,0.504603445529937744,0,True,False,False

It's a slow paced game that can reward you for working smartly and efficiently.

If you can forgive all that - it's one of my favorite space-sim sandboxes. It's extremely complex and highly customizable with the opportunity to micromanage everything to setting up the AI and letting it handle things. Though I don't recommend it, it's not uncommon for players to AFK for a few hours while their investments make money - then blow all that cash on ill-advised fights or spaceweed. I highly recommend spending a few hundred hours exploring, trading, upgrading, and building an empire (trading, war, or both).",1640727255,1641603451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is nothing else on the market like X4: Foundations.  It is a game where the outcomes are determined by you; your decisions, your contributions, your choices, and even your biases - you matter.

X4 outdoes every previous iteration in the series in one massive way - your presence in the gate network truly is important.  Without completing a single story mission, you have the ability to transform the game world based on the trades you make, the stations you destroy, sectors you clear, and supplies you take.  You can starve an entire faction to death by flooding or draining the markets essential resources, uplift the most hated faction to the most powerful by feeding them what they need, or make it your mission to sabotage everyone you can so that the 'Xenon,' a hostile race of corrupt AI, finish them off sector by sector.  Using cross-galaxy trades that leach from your rivals, or even by creating your own shipyards, manufacturing vast fleets for yourself or others, and letting ""war"" happen, the only real enemy is peace itself.

[b]The best thing?  For everything you have in-game, you 'earn it.'[/b]

Nothing in X4: Foundations is simply handed to you.  Rather, you work hard to accumulate your wealth, to build your empire, and to manage your systems in the most efficient way possible.  Every ship you buy, capture, build, or win - it 'matters.'  That's what I love about this game, and why this game in particular outdoes everything that came before it.

Storylines in this game offer you a more 'linear' approach to shape the world to your liking.  You can deepen the divide between certain rivals, or you can bring them together to create even more powerful super-factions.  You can pit one species against the other, fuel the war industry and see the assets you give be utilized by your friends and foes, and best of all, you can mod the game to your liking.  It's all supported.

Here are some great examples of what the fantastic modders in this community are capable of if it's your first playthrough and you're looking for a few more ships:

[b]There is one downside, however, which must be acknowledged.[/b]  This game is not going to feel 'complete' without the two main DLC; [i]Cradle of Humanity and Split Vendetta[/i].  You're going to realize the limitations of your universe with the standard version.  You're going to see inactive jump gates as a barrier to your enjoyment, and you're going to realize pieces of the puzzle are simply not there.

The two DLC add a lot of content to the game, and the artwork they provide is absolutely beautiful.  You are getting what you pay for, and if you get them on sale, you'll also be getting a good deal on it.  I have a feeling Egosoft was afraid to price this as an $89.99 game, which I don't blame them for really.  People are used to a moderate price for the base game, and can excuse spending money on DLC when quality and quantity is actually there.  What matters most is that they did the best they could on each faction and its associated sectors, story lines and architecture to justify the added expense.  Truly talented artists work for this studio.

Best of all, if you buy the standard edition, you don't even have to start a new game to 'unlock' sectors created within the DLC down the road.  The jump gates leading to them simply ""open"" allowing you to continue on.  Egosoft has a tendency to, at all costs, avoid breaking saves - I think this holds them back, personally, but I can see why.  People that build entire empires with dozens of stations and hundreds of ships work very, very hard for that.

Overall?  I highly recommend this game for the people that have the time to learn its many, intricate functions and are into  the mixture of strategy and active involvement in the gameworld.",1641591009,1641591009,True,7,0,0.525691986083984375,0,True,False,False

Being stuck with this game in my library i tried really hard to like it, to get used to the issues. because the idea of the game, what its trying to be is amazing,  its just got a horrific amount of bugs and poor quality code that kinda ruins it.

The AI: the ""ai"" is beyond dumb, hands down the worst ""ai"" i have seen in any game ever. 
Trade ships will work for a while but then get stuck while there are clearly profitable trades in sector. also auto-trade only works in sector as the ai is to dumb.
for combat roles you can choose defend with or attack with. if you select defend, they wont help you fire at enemy ships, if you select attack they wont defend themselves or allied ships that they are next to. 
fleets don't stick together, the fastest ships will zoom of ahead and get destroyed on there own, 
auto restock does not work, no option to repair ships in fleet even if you have repair drones on other craft, 
miners don't use tractor beam meaning they work at about 2% of what you do if you pilot it yourself. 

there is a encyclopedia buit into the game, almost every entry is blank, like they forgot to make the content.
each item has a description, many of which are blank. this seems like such an easy fix for the devs.

i forgot about path finding, also the worse in any game ever, ships regularly fly into asteroids or fixed stations,, the solution the devs made seem to be turning off collision damage to the extent that if you collide with asteroid at 12km/s you take 0 damage. they take this on the chin, by including the voice ""autopilot epicly failed"" might possibly be funny one but the flawed path finding and dumb as **** ""ai"" get tiring pretty quickly meaning you have to micromanage EVERYTHING to make things work as you would expect.

this is not a game where building an empire is a optional possibility, its a hard requirement, the xenon massively overpower the other empires and the player is the only thing that could prevent galactic takeover, for that you will need a fleet and a large income to replenish your lost ships. that requires Time(which you don't have) and EASY management of a large number of miners/traders/stations.

If this game were in early access i would say watch this game it will be epic when they fix the major flaws with:
Path-finding, AI, Management & Balance

The issue with squadrons and wings (not sure if that is proper terminology as i have not played the game in quite a while.) not sticking together when you are controlling them in the map is extremely frustrating, you make a wing of ships so that they will stick together and engage together and they never fly close enough to support one another when engaged. which makes it mostly pointless to even  have them in a wing in atleast most of the instances i have done it. after countless instances of setting up a wing of 2 to 4 fighters and hoping that they have a chance in hell of attacking a wing of similar size at the same time or even within enough time so that its not a 1 v 4 scenario i got so frustrated with trying to work out if i was doing something wrong that i googled the situation and it appears it has been an ongoing issue. i realize after watching many videos that there are work arounds or different ways to play to make this less bothersome but most are a bit tedious.

[list]
[*]Lot of ppl talking here about friendly AI and they are fkin right so hard: it looks like AI algorithm just random  choosing who to smash with hull, not anything else any conditions
[*] performance and [strike]optimisation[/strike] [b]missing optimisation[/b]: tried to play on my old i7-7700HK + GTX 1070 mobile - had amazing bad performance.... But after setting new rig with ryzen 5800x + 3080Ti literally changed NOTHING!!! Still was good if I had stable 40 FPS with always 1% and 0.1% low about 1-2 fps, deep freezes, long asset loads, amazing bad textures ( I guess for game made in 2018 and later having such visuals is just a shitting on clients face for SUCH a price). Any visuals configs (which are presented by 6 or 7 options) are doing literally nothing, no option to speed up game, which is using like 5% of cpu and 10% of gpu ( guess so much even for wqhd render).  U may say ""and what's the problem?""... And the problem is that game CAN'T utilise ur pc resources and for a biig fleets/stations fights u have old good turned-based strategy game real-time with good-to-have 5-10 FPS
[*] turrets still broken. Some may shoot 2x over it's capabilities, some can't use 20% of it. Still it doesn't give a shit about changing targeting config. Still good to have much more extended way to config targeting orders (like class lists, type lists etc)
[*] AI capital ships and stations are sometimes amazing (i'd say broken) good with it's real DPS, range and accuracy, while having such ships/modules by ur own side making it 2-6 times weaker. Nuff said. 
[*] Modules and rig balance has never visited that game. 
[*] very poor collision mechanics, often broken: u can ""stick"" or ""stuck"" in other object or just go deep into it ( few times managed to be ""swallowed"" by station while was driving capital ship ) 
[*] superways and rings makes ur fps dive deep AF every time. No matter of any conditions. Just look at them.
[*] reputation broken up: often u can't get shits after buying licensed - u need to save/load to make modules/recipes/hulls available. Sometimes even that reecipe not working and u need to load earlier game and buy licenses so many times as it's needed them to start working. Also farming rep is a fking korean style grinding. And loosing it just one sec after  shooting down random ""enemy"" ship. Taking bad standing to neutral or higher - is a very hard story, pretending to be a miracle.
[*] autopilot (path finding) is slow and buggy as a century-ago dead turtle. What does it mean for u? All AI controlled ships movements are far-far away from optimal and sometimes they are managing to stuck in objects or just avoid starting moving for reason being too close to massive objects. 
[*] mods... I love mods, but enabling it for X4 was one of most painful things I've ever done: restarting game like 40 times just to make it FIND AND LOAD workshop installed mods.... Well, played without it...
[/list]

In total... Game pretending to be something, but after 3+ years of post-release development it doesn't go much better, still like alpha/beta stage for full price without any alert of it. DLC pricing upsets too, as quality of contend is kinda same: shitloads of bugs and glitches.
I loved X series before i got X4. X3 is much better, u don't even need to remind urself like ""well, it's good for 14 y.o. game"". No, it's still MUCH MUCH BETTER as it WORKS how u EXPECT IT TO WORK. Without fighting bugs, configs, ghosts, developers vision and etc. 

Shall u buy it? NO. Only if u see 75%+ sale offer. It doesn't cost its price even for 50% sale. U don't have to endorse shit quality and low development standards.",1543611867,1641370514,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

It has some of the best space sim features of any game of its kind such as building stations that can directly effect the economy, command massive fleets and order them to fight in large battles, explore different systems and much more. It has a lot to offer if you take the time to learn the game and not to mention a good modding community.

Where this game fails at is its AI. if you order a wing of fighters to dock at a carrier that you are flying or that is rendered in for you then chances are 2 or 3 will get stuck in said carrier's collision box. Fleet battles seem to never go how you would think because you will generally lose a few ships due to the AI either not firing, firing at the wrong thing, positioning itself so that its capital weapons are facing away from the target and a lot more. The only way for the AI to function fairly well is to leave the system so that your ships can complete their tasks and actually engage targets although that means that you miss out on the action and it changes the way that the fight plays out for instance you have a capital ship fight another capital ship and yours has better weaponry and should easily win but instead the fight turns into a dps vs dps and your ship takes much more damage than is necessary. It is most prevalent in fighters as your fighter is normally the one to die. You either sacrifice your ships to watch the fight or you leave the system and watch it unfold on the map.

This game does have a good modding community though and has some mods to try and help/fix some of the AI issues but only so much can be done. Their truly isnt any game that compares and while it is not perfect, it can be fun for player looking to spend the time. It is a very slow game and can take days to build up a large fleet. It can be overwhelming at first glance but it is very deep and can feel very rewarding when you conquer your first system or build your first fleet. This game is action packed but it really makes you feel like you are just another ship since you can be killed as easily as you can kill so it makes direct player conflicts challenging even for very experienced pilots.

Also it has a star wars mod on Nexus that turns every ship into star wars ships.

You can
Space walk, fly a warship in any size, cargo ship in any size. Do you get weapons, yes. Do you use them? I have no clue. Someone stated on the forums that really you just watch a video of it going down, and the Marines handle it all. There is no ""you joining in it with your Laser Gun Finally"" with a good old fire fight game play. You might as well play X-Rebirth and be on the skunk listening to it just the same, right? Not really much of a improvement. You can walk off ships and onto station, but you can not really walk around, not like in X-Rebirth. Your big spot IS the landing platform. So in the video you see a inside hall way to the door? That is you BIG space station interior. A hallway to a door. Enjoy. Even on the Capital Ships it is like that. The ""Capital Ship Bridge"" mod on steam for X-Rebirth makes the X4 bridge room size cheap generic.Matter in fact come to think of it, even the Albion Skunk has more detail for a bridge by default, and the ""Capital Ship bridge"" mod has more places you can go to making this stuff in X4 look generic. It is really sad, a modder out done in X-Rebirth what the developer attempted and failed at or too lazy to do in X4...

You just click on the map and they do it. Were in X-Rebirth, it was more so communication. Say good by to that. You can click on other ships, and get worthless info. Nothing useful such as, ""this trader TRADING with MY station that I OWN, what is the CARGO, MY station is getting or sending with? It is your base right? Heads up, this is where Egosoft is going to go with this as a new X series thing. In my opinion, A failed idea. But the bright side is you can fly any war ship of any size, and you can walk in a hug location on any space station, as long as it is docking bay, You can create your own game like a free play mode, there two types, and you can make your own station blue prints(smiles). That is what I got for over $60.00. I also got 2 DLC's. So do I recommend this? NO... It will be a YOU choice to decide if you get it or not.
EDITED: 2021/12/30
Apparently they listen. You can now assign trade ships and mining ships to stations. My position however still stands. I am not a map manger player, so I do not live in a box...

Unlike many similar games, you can play a micro or macro game and once you've made your first few million credits, the game becomes much more strategic, designing and building stations, building fleets to extend your empire. 

At the heart of it all is the economy, The universe keeps on going, even if you're not looking, so things change, the universe starts running out of products creating opportunities to build yet more stations in order to fill that need - thereby amassing more credits. 

Once you get fully established, your next move is to build wharves and shipyards to build your your war effort, paid for by your highly productive stations, or you can just avoid the war element and concentrate on economic domination. 

X4 combines many of the features  from the disappointing previous X-Rebirth but implemented much better. You can pilot any ship from a small fighter to a massive carrier. In the end, the choice is yours. 

One thing. Although there are missions, they are not organised campaigns and slot into your own game. You can do the missions or not. That doesn't always work for some gamers who like a more linear or guided experience. Nor is it as repetitive as Elite Dangerous and there's definitely not as much grinding. Finally, if your game gets boring or repetitive, you can start again.

In my opinion, the X series may be the best single-player 3d space games out there. All of them have a large mostly-hand-made area to explore (if you want pure exploration, I suggest Elite: dangerous or No Man's Sky, which are infinite - but also procedural, while X has always had the areas hand-made, though the buildings aren't), a vast economy to trade with and eventually shape, and a huge array of ships and equipment to choose from. And X4 lives up to that in spades, adding the ability to change the political landscape of the universe by supporting and opposing the various factions (including your own, eventually), ship and equipment mods, and more customization of buildings.

And X4 is really good at letting you do your thing. Want to be a fighter, killing the various threats in the universe? Xenon, Kha'ak, and several pirate factions are there - plus the enemies of whichever faction(s) you choose to ally with. Want to be a trader, making money in the shifting economy of space? There's tools for that, building up from one ship to a merchant fleet. Want to be a leader, forming your own power base to compete for the universe on your own? Can do, including building and outfitting your own fleet to defend space you've taken and attack for more.

But despite all of that, I can't recommend the game.

Because there's too many bugs. Go too fast at the wrong time, and you'll clip yourself into a building - and most of the recommendations of how to unclip involve getting out of your ship, into another ship, and leave the sector. Mission guidance usually works - but sometimes it fails, and I don't know why. For a few weeks, there was a bug involving Overwolf (which I use as a Minecraft launcher) that crashed the game. And then some times the game just quits - or worse, crashes my computer.

I've got 140+ hours on the game (which makes me relatively new, by some standards); but I don't remember the last time I've gotten to play for a full day (and the game is served by longer play sessions) without having to restart the game at least once - usually once every 2-3 hours.

Everything looks complicated at first, but once you learn the basics, it starts to make sense and it feels good.

However, there is one single thing that make that whole game crumbles. The AI. 
For basics things like trading, it actually is doing a good job. However, for combat, I have to say it is not pretty. In a few words: the AI is comically useless. 
Fleet formation ? Nah, there is no point in following the commander into battle. Let's just slowboat our way there and hope for the best.
Combat tactics ? I'm a fighter so i'll just go straight in front of the capital ship or station and just wait there shooting until I die. I'm a capital ship ? I'll just stay 20 km away doing donuts in space because it's fun !

I did try the game in its earlier version 2 years ago with a cracked version (I was broke at the time). I bought it now because of the Winter sales and to be perfectly honest with you, the AI is still the same crap as before and I kinda regret buying the game even on sale. For god sake make the devs play Avorion and get a grasp of what a somewhat not mediocre AI can do (it's not perfect, I get it, but its certainly better than X4's AI).

It killed all my joy to play the game. I'll play it again and change my review once they either:
- Improve drastically the AI

The game has serious problems with optimization and other points on which it positions itself. I honestly played, agonized though I sometimes enjoyed it and didn't want to write a review, but today I bought a new CPU, and after the test, I was down and out. 
But first things first:
The game really crappy use your CPU power, after 160 hours of one save on my Ryzen 5 2600 gave out 13 fps at best and I do not know why. And I still don't have hundreds of ships and dozens of stations.
I only have four stations and 30 ships... Before that, it was about 25-30. I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X today and how much frame gain do you think it was ?.... At 10 fps... 
I got an extra 10 fps ! In total I can now play at 23-25 fps. That's great. The video card is average - RX 580 8GB. RAM 32. Although I do play with low graphics settings (has almost no effect on anything) and by shutting down everything you can. I even have mods to disable fog and only big asteroids. Without these mods it was terrible. Also my mistake was that as soon as I bought the game I went straight to training and not the campaign.
Since these training scenarios have only one system and almost no ai, the fps was off the charts and I loved it. Then I went to fully play and it got worse, and the game counter had already gone over 2 hours for a refund... 
The saddest thing about this story is that it looks like the developers aren't going to do anything about it. If they haven't done or come up with anything in 4 years, I guess that's the way it's going to stay. Except for the new DLC of course.
I know they announced FSR technology in version 5.0, but that won't change anything. The game doesn't need a video card much, it totally needs a processor. Although it does not use the full power of the processor.
That is, I have not monitored, but once I opened the overlay, I saw that the game loads the processor by 20%. It's a total asshole and FSR won't save it...
And now I would like to express on the points of the game which the game and the developers put it in the plus and uniqueness:
1. Trade! 
The universe really is unique here, supply and demand. Probably the only thing that still keeps me in the game. Everything runs like clockwork. Sort of.
Although many say that the universe is alive, but without the Dead Air mod to change the relationship between the faction. It feels half alive. In the original, there are scripted wars that the player by ""story"" can start. Well, there's also xenons. That's it.
And with this mod, at least the races periodically howl, measure, etc. That's when the universe at least feels alive. 
2. Fight!
Fight at 13-20 Fps. It's physically painful and impossible. If on large and slow ships it is somehow acceptable, then on fast fighters and interceptors it is simply unreal. 
And in X3 the battles felt somehow more pleasant, tactful and driving. I won't go into the gameplay designer details, just a personal observation. And the AI in this game... You know that dumb AI i сan't remember in no game in my live. In a word, AI here are suicide bombers. This doesn't just apply to combat operations. Mineral miners and traders... If you want them to work at all, just don't look at them. No, seriously.
If you're in the same system as these guys, they act on a newborn level. So just don't look at them. This is how the scripts work here, without the player being present, they are not affected by collision and so on. So it works like that in a magical way.
In this case, they work... But not always...
3. Build! 
Here I'll just tell you the story of how I tried to add a dock to my base... Ten minutes of camera scrolling and it's done. When building there are no shortcuts to rotate parts (as in almost all games having construction).
That is, the player must rotate the camera and depending on the angle of your view, the parts will rotate to one side or the other. More uncomfortable construction is hard to imagine. Although since the players don't often complaining about it, you could probably get used to it. I never made it in 160 hours. Although there is a random module attachment feature here. Which I use a lot. Thank you for that at least. 

These are not all the problems of the game, there are quite a few, but I'm getting tired of writing this review. So I'll skip a few problems. 
Conclusion !
Don't buy this game. I mean it. I have strange and conflicting feelings about the game. She's limping and asking to be shot. I'm still gonna keep playing it because I spent my money on it, and because that she really is unique. I'm not sure how long, though. If there were some very similar games, I'd love to switch to them, but there aren't any unfortunately. Also, this game made me realize that I won't be buying the next Egosoft games. At least until i won't see in some review ""The developers fixed AI in this game and it makes full use of computer resources"".
I understand that the studio has only 20 developers, but the game feels like it's in early access. And they're selling it as ready-made. Which is absolutely not the case. 
I also forgot about the UI to add... It's a complete *****. It's more comfortable than the X3, of course, but the orders...

And I can best describe it as an X game at heart, with some nice touches that I first saw in freelancer. Like a cruise mode, Trade lanes/space highways, as well as a great map system that also allows you to create nav points that make it much clearer where you want to go. Further more the space scenery, asteroid fields and nebulae feel much better then in previous X titles and the universe feels like it's much more mysterious, with things to be discovered as well as alive and busy. The atmosphere and feel of the game also reflects this and pulls you in further. I would describe this as the deepest X game and maybe even space sim game I have ever played. 

The only cons, a bit of a clunky UI and control scheme. But once you figure it out and adjust a bit. It works fine. And fighter combat isnt as fun as it was in X3, some old school fans may prefer the more X2 like combat, but I am not one of them. As well as a very simplified gear and loadout system compared to previous titles of the X series.

Fans will have no issues with these but, for new comers there is a bit of a learning curve and this X game, like others, deals with management, as well as fairly dense content and customizations.

Most games your AI and the Enemy AI are terrible, clumsy and slow. It can be funny to even sad as you breeze through beating a game. Not X4, oh no! X4 the Xenon are smart, responsive and swarm you to deal out pain and merciless AI death. I love it!!! It feels like the Xenon of the origin story with Nathan R Gunn from the start of X Beyond the Frontier. However, your AI has a STAR leveling system to it. You want a good AI pilot/Captain, better level them stars up. Except, that doesn't fix  much of anything. 
Even a 5 star Captain has the AI of games 20 years old or more. I tell a Captain to patrol a sector and they do, even with ruthless setting on global and telling captain to use that new global setting. That captain will still patrol as a massive red enemy wave swarms from a gate halfway across the sector. I would understand my captains inaction from something so far away if I didn't already have Advanced Satellites at the gate entrances to reveal those parts of the map. 
What is the point of advanced satellites if, when enemies spawn into the sector and the sats show it on screen, my captain doesn't care until the Xenon actually are close to the ship? Aren't satellites supposed to help let the patrol ships see further? Then why do my ships never react till the enemy is much much closer? Why is X4 combat and fleet system commands years behind X3's? I cant babysit 10 sectors and tell the ships who they should attack individually when enemies pop in from the opposite side AND still be expected to play ANY part of the game. I have searched online and tried several suggestions to try to get this games version of a ""kill all enemies/ kill all enemies in sector"" combat feature, which was a simple command in X3 that needed just a few clicks to activate by the way, but it seems the biggest issue is that the devs did not add in the right features. Where is the DEFEND SECTOR from X3 which gives my ship the ability to see the whole sector and actually defend? The defend position icon is a joke, ships fly too fast through gates to even bother with that feature half the time. Furthermore, the ""Patrol"" feature is lackluster when in X3 you could patrol not one but MANY sectors at once. This game if I patrol one sector, even when there are no enemies, it wont go to the next order I gave it which is patrol a new sector. It just sits patrolling the safe sector. As I said I cant babysit 10 different destroyers and move them manually sector to sector, set up multiple commands to attack individual targets and I am not hundreds and hundreds of hours in where I can afford to have ships in every sector. 
It feels like this dev team is all new and never even played or worked on X3. I want to love this game, since I have played all the X games. However, aside from the DLC punch to the face where we got only half the races and the rest were removed to release later for more money, there are so many missing features that unless you never played the other series games, this is painful.
I do love how the Xenon is brutal in this game if you dont constantly go after them. Throughout the X series the Xenon just felt boring and easy, glad they now dish out the beatings.
I do still recommend this game, but only when it is on sale or maybe another year or 2 more when hopefully more features and the remaining STARTING RACES from the previous games are added back to this game.",1639293404,1639293404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1 Year later; decided to try again. A lot of things seem to have changed. Flying still cumbersome, but much easier, A+.
Just for that improvement by developers, will thumbs up the game, 
but now for consumer advice.

(First off; Playing accelerated start due to mod with plenty of credits. How you can play by grinding for money? I'd probably die before that.) 

Don't get me wrong, it still provides fun (with Mod); BUT the travelling is way too long. Waiting for a ship to arrive at base, etc. Make a cup of tea. Leave the game on, while watching a movie so things can get built/done C-. 
I get that they want you to feel the vastness of space; but when I am piloting, it really needs something to speed up long distance travel - highways should be the constant Travel Mode speed.



Glad I bought it on so-called discount. Have signed up at NASA for training. Probably easier than this.

FIXED
Point 1: 3 different ways to fly a ship; (Mouse steering, keyboard; etc.) with key mashing left/right/up/down hoping to get the ship where you want it. Yes a controller might be better, but why should it be a necessity in a PC game.

GETTING THERE
Point 2: UI after UI after UI. It's like using a software program. LEFT click here; then RIGHT click there, then OOPs, what menu am I in.


STILL NEED INTERNET ASSISTANCE
A PC game should be at least playable before you have to go on a course to play it. I know that some people will say that there is a manual; YOUtube videos; guides.
But REALLY - all of that just to get out of a Dock and hope you push the right key.

WHAT IS IT: Essentially, it's a 4X (no pun intended) strategy game set in space, except you physically exist in the world rather than being some disembodied overseer.

IS IT FUN: If you like empire building and space battles, then yes, it's extremely fun.

WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE: There are many other first-person space combat games and many other space strategy games, but few if any other examples of games that are both these things at once.

HOW DOES PILOTING THE SHIPS FEEL: I'm no flight-sim junkie, but compared to games like No Man's Sky and Elite, I was very pleased with how smooth the controls felt and how many options they gave me.

HOW COMPLEX IS THE STRATEGIC LAYER: Very. The game has a dynamic economy (all the ships are built out of components manufactured somewhere on the map) and factions are constantly fighting their own wars, which you can influence in many ways.

HOW STEEP IS THE LEARNING CURVE: I'll be honest, it's not immediately the most approachable game. However, it has very fun and helpful tutorials, and I'm told that the Terran start (from the Cradle of Humanity DLC) is beginner-friendly.

HOW IS THE UI: When flying, it's pretty good. Most info is communicated through your ships HUD without unnecessary clutter. However, you'll also be spending a lot of time issuing commands from the map screen, which can sometimes feel a bit like Microsoft Excel with a map. Some will like it, some won't, but it's easy enough to adapt to if you give it a little time.

ARE THE DLCS WORTH IT: Absolutely. They significantly expand the map, and add excellent new factions, ships, and questlines.

WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT: An interconnected galaxy open to seamless (ie. no load screens) exploration, hundreds of unique and beautiful ships to fly, amazing dogfights and fleet battles, and a complex strategic layer offering hundreds of hours of emergent gameplay.

WHAT'S MISSING: Ship interiors other than cockpits and docking bays, and planetary surfaces (planets are basically just pretty background objects in space).",1638554871,1638554871,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Graphics are in terrible need of optimization. An RTX 3080 should not frequently drop below 50 fps for a game this old.

Because the reviews of this game were pretty bad, I buyed X3:AP instead. This game got me hooked to the series, just because there is no other game on the market that comes near to the gameplay of the X-Titles. It is basically ""Mount and Blade in Space"". (Even though the X-Series is older than M&B)

Elite Dangerous has better flying simulation and a far bigger world, but lacks the ""Creating your own empire"" thing of X. In EVE Online you could create your own empire, but just if you belong to a big clan and if you put a lot of time into the game. Star Citizen, for my taste, also focuses on MP too much. (Also I am not sure if it will become a ""real"" game to me ever.. :) )

In X you can play at your own pace, without any other players that can destroy the work of dozens or maybe hundreds of hours. You can conquer the whole ""world"", become an industry giant or play the plots of the different factions. Even when you sometimes have to search for the start points of the plots..
Behind the game sits a small german team, that dedicates to this single series for their players. Instead of a big company that just wants to satisfy its shareholders.

I hardly recommend to buy the DLC's. They expand the game with factions, sectors and storys. But the game itself without DLC is also absolutely good.

I can recommend the game to all who love space sims and games like mount and blade.

- The game itself is okay to decent at providing A LOT of different things to do but does not particularly master any particular area

Pros:
- Nice space sim experience and fantastic concept
- Good variety of ships and weapons load-outs to find and explore
- Interesting variety of story
- Great sandbox for single player RPing, Lots of options and depth

Cons
- High learning curve - takes time to get use to controls menu and orders
- As of 4.1 still has game systems that should be fleshed out bugs still affecting aspects of the game-play
- DLC affects the overall game experience
- Needs AI improvements in combat and station building

I can now fully recommend this game (after the Cradle of Humanity expansion). 

+ The foundation is still solid and excellent for sandbox gaming
+ Many storylines has been added, lots of plots to be discuvered
+ Lots of new systems and sectors to be discovered with stunning visuals
+ New ships and station designs - still missing some awesome X:R models (can be added via mod
+ Excellent modability
+ It's a single player game - no 12 year old kid is telling me what he will do with my mother ;)
+ You really can change the face of the known universe by building ships, fleets, stations, even conquering sectors.
+ Economy seems to work better and better with every new version
+ Easy start money (aka Crystals) have been nerfed

There are cons as well, but I find them not too bad for me - solo mining is not viable for instance ... or memory hungry endgame, or sometimes a bit too complicated UI (It works when you know where to find the info or button, but sometimes it seems very well hidden :) - also some PPL find it a hassle to train the crews and captains (it's happening very slowly) - but on the other hand I find it natural that the noob you hire on the platform does not instantly turn out to be an expert galaxy wide trader ...

I relly like this game, I like the complexity, the sandbox + the storylines - I would sometimes like to have a better UI, but I am also not an UI designer so I cannot tell you exactly what would make it better :)

So happy they continue to work on updates to the game

Old Review: 

My first impressions so far (Tutorial + watching streams)

Pro:
- awesome graphic
- fantastic music
- space feels more alive than in X:R
- Observed little to no bugs so far (sure I will find some)
- First Patch was already out a couple of hours after release - really responsive Devs.
- Fantastic flight feeling.
- Tutorials
- Playing in 4k
- Awesome Station interieur
- Windowed/FS modes for multi-monitor setups

Cons
- a bit slow framerate in stations (I mean it's okay i play in 4k)
- Screens get teared inside stations although vsync is on
- Slower framerate windowed

Overall excited about a new world to discover - asolid release by Egosoft.

To all complainers about ""It's bad because I get thrown into the world"" - Guys it's a sandbox game what did you expect?

Fleet mechanics are still frustrating with large capital ships not standing off and using main weapons at a distance which I find frustrating. I mostly avoid fleets though so this is not so much of an issue for me but is a big issue for some. The new co-ordinated attack option works well for me but still suffers from the above option. Still getting some amazingly enjoyable experiences. Clearing out Tharka's Cascade of Xenon stations in my new Asgard when a K appeared over the top of one of the asteroid stations in the style of the martian tripod appearing over the hill in the 2005 film. One burst of the Asgards' main weapon though and it was toast, atmospheric and fun. Some things are annoying such as the nerf to crystal mining and mining in general which has ruined some playstyles. As its a single player game it doesn't make much sense to me to make these kind of changes and what with the modding it should be difficult to mod yourself a fortune if that's your desire so it just feels like game devs fiddling with their toy for their own gratification. Looking forward to the next DLC with wreckage salvage, but still the lack of Boron, who aren't coming to X4 which is still a surprise and shame given the continued development and DLC ships with aquatic internals doesn't feel to me much different to the vacuum of space so could be used with your already existing space suit (maybe with some additions you could purchase at the trader as you can with the thrusters and bomd launcher) and of stations with non-Boron interiors and Boron interiors, maybe a whole story line, a non-combative one, where you have to help Boso-Ta research the new non-Boron station modules for the Boron so they can reintegrate back into the commonwealth after the gate shutdown. Sounds like a great DLC to me but I'm not holding my breath. 

Edit: Two years on, a total of 913 hours played, version 4.0 in beta and I like this game more than ever. It's not to the liking of some and its got plenty of quirks, a few bugs, performance issues even on powerful PCs in some areas and a steep learning curve to anyone new to the X series but I love it all the same.

I have been thoroughly enjoying this game despite my inital reservations, I feel its a worthy successor to the X3 games. I struggled with the stability until I got a new graphics card that had Vulcan API support but since then it has been running really well. 

Although there are few sectors they are large and seemingly boundless so it feels like a large game, not X3 large but hopefully additional releases will expand the universe. The 1.5 patch added ""Betty"" back in which was for me a great improvement.

The more I play the more the X universe comes alive. When I arrived in Hatikvahs Choice III a Xenon K destroyer was flying around attacking a station, it was destroyed but was soon followed by another and several waves of smaller fighers. X4 started to feel more alive. Shortly after this I flew to Antigone Memorial and spent a few minutes shooting the valuable crystal off asteroids and there was no enemy activity at all. 

There are a few bugged missions which is frustrating but these will all get resolved in time. The economy is difficult to grasp but I think thats my fault more than anything else. The ship icons and classes are confusing but I was used to the old X3 classifications. Groups or wings of fighers have, what looks to me like a meteor shower icon which seemed odd at first. Weapons seem a little bland, and the choice of engines and shields seem very similar between factions. Mods are an interesting idea but I've only been able to make a few of the small type due to lack of materials. I think some of the items are too difficult to find (I think I read that some have been removed due to balancing? This seems an odd decision).

I loved X3, X3:TC and X3:AP and really didn't like X-Rebirth at all at first and later it still didn't really work for me but now I have played X4:F for around 100 hours I'm really starting to feel like this is going to be as enjoyable for me as the X3 games and it feels like ""X4"". I'm looking forward to 2.0 in the New Year which will no doubt make it even better.",1546086342,1638275487,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The limiting factor in this game will be your CPU, not your GPU, so if you see concerns about low frame rates from people mentioning their super high end graphics cards, be aware that they probably have subpar CPUs, and are refusing to listen to the community when they are constantly reminded that the game is VERY complex and requires more processing power than the *GPU* specs would otherwise suggest.

That said, if you absolutely cannot tolerate a game that dips below 60fps ever, and you want to throw your diapers at the screen whenever that happens, give X4 a pass.

Gameplay:    Mining, trading, corporation building. I think the options in all these areas are bad. Mining is tedious (maybe as it should be), trading is repetetive (maybe as it should be) and the corporation building... well I am not sure if it is the GUI or something else, but I think it is to... narrow. To few options to design and tailor your corp, to few choice to do business. The only thing that works is the automatization of NPPC workers you hire... and that is basically ""Hire -> go work at sector x and repeat... make me money"".
The combat is also nothing special, and running around in stations... well you have it elsewhere.

Graphics is meh.

Lore/story... well is plain and simple

Navigation is just wierd. Highways in space? The distance and sizing of planets are off (visit Earth and you understand) and the sector stuff is just confusing.

- Space
- Enormous sense of scale with ships and stations
- Building an empire & commanding fleets
- Flying your own ships
- A wide variety of ships
- Station building

The main space game I played prior to X4 was Elite Dangerous, as I'm sure many others did. I went into X4 not sure if I'd enjoy the management aspect, however it immediately clicked and I can safely say X4 is one of the most enjoyable space experiences I've had so far. The sense of scale when you get your first medium (yes, medium) ship is insane, let alone when you get large and XL ships.

X4 does have it's fair share of problems:
- The AI is not great, especially in combat.
- Performance isn't amazing, however with a 2070 super and 2700x I can play while maintaining a perfectly reasonable framerate most of the time.
- Saving and loading is quite slow (20-30s)

If you're coming to this from X3TC, a lot has changed. This is an evolution of X:R into something that leans back towards the kinds of things X series fans loved. X:R felt oddly constricting and disconnected, even as it brought new ideas to the series. If you avoided X:R like the plague, it's time to try X4 out. There are some things here that are just amazing like station building and getting out of your ship is a great way to feel the scale of these ships like you've never experienced before. You also get things like sector ownership that can change, arguably better fleet organization and management (especially with recent updates), and a universe closer to the original with the recent Split and Terran expansions. 

If you're coming to this from X:R, you should be good to go. You can finally switch between ships, space is a lot less murky (though still at times very empty), and most of the changes in X4 really just build upon what you had in X:R. Oh, and you don't have to wander around on foot just to get basic things done.

And, if you've never played an X series game, well, this game is going to seem SUPER intimidating at first. You can do just about anything: run around hunting pirates (or being a pirate), build a trade empire, go to war with factions or just do missions to build your rep and find your place in the universe. That said, I would say it's less intimidating than Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen, less clique-ish and trolly as EVE Online (cause no MP...), and not as limiting as most story-based space shooters. 

You get several starts that put you into a ship with some money or cargo and the universe at your disposal. You can build stations that produce goods that can be consumed by NPC factions' stations or you can vertically integrate and make everything needed to produce whatever you need: ships, weapons, etc. Ships fall into classes (fighters, bombers, corvettes, etc.) and have hardpoints you can add weapons and shield generators to. A number of ships have turrets as well. Most ships have cargo space but obviously transports have the most. 

Combat is pretty solid and varied depending on your style. Ships have stats that vary as expected but are strictly defined by the ship. You can modify these a bit with different classes of thrusters and engines but ultimately, you're either fast flying forward, fast turning, or fast boosting, often at the cost of shielding and hull. You can also run with more tanky ships that let you survive more hits as you dole out more damage. So, you have options. 

There are a ridiculous number of items to trade and the economy is largely simulated without too much obvious cheating by the AI. No two games will really be the same since once the simulation starts, anything can happen. There can be a chip shortage and you can make bank with a chip plant pumping out chips. Eventually, the factions will build stations to meet that demand but, well, if you don't like those factions and you have the firepower, you can always deprive them of that. :)

Station building is pretty amazing (and a bit expensive but you aren't going to be building big stations day 1). You get some basic parts/modules but can earn/learn other parts by increasing your rep with the various factions and eventually buying blueprints OR you can steal them by scanning data leaks on existing stations (data leaks you yourself can create though you'll get into hot water when you do). Each faction has common parts but dressed up in their respective styles. Split have cool angular style parts with sharp edges while the Paranid have more bulbous/rounded parts. The parts have various connection points and can just be added anywhere (you're not wiring up direct connections like an assembly line or anything). Just buy a plot (or don't pay for it if you want to start something) and build away.

For anyone who needs some direction to go, there are several plotlines affecting the universe and related to specific factions as well as a large number of standalone missions you can do for credits and rep. You can clear mines, deliver needed goods, or assassinate NPCs. Some major plotlines can change your universe substantially. I won't go into them to avoid spoiling things but it can lead to some interesting changes.

Multiplayer is non-existent right now. Egosoft is trying to figure this one out and I get it. It's a complex thing to simulate especially now that parts of the economy aren't faked like they used to be. 

There are still some issues from time to time. Egosoft's done a great job of rolling out updates and addressing a lot of issues even changing the functionality of the game for the better in many cases. And even with a great rig, at ultra settings you might struggle to get anything north of 30 fps in places. But honestly, even with lower settings, everything looks great and works. In some ways, I feel like this game is like Skyrim in that you'll get some goofy behavior at times because the simulation just is complex and there will be bugs. But you still get a living breathing universe to explore and the vast majority of things just work. 

I definitely recommend trying it out. I've put in loads of hours (though I know there are those who have put in substantially more). You can get lost in the game just managing your empire, hunting down threats, boarding ships, taking over sectors. I love games like this because you can do so much so it can scratch all kinds of itches in a single purchase.",1636696991,1637780286,True,76,1,0.861900568008422852,23,True,False,False

It does have its frustrations for me but ALL of the basics are down and layed and as it stands it is a more than passable game.
The best part for me is that they're still developing this, and if they give it even half as much love and attention as they did X3 it will end up a great game, befitting of an X game successor or perhaps next generation.

I'll tell you now, don't come to this game expecting a deep or overly interesting storyline. The ""story"" of this game is mostly a backdrop to the open-ended money-making simulator that the rest of the game is about. The choices you get in the story mostly serve to change how the main factions outside of yours interact with each other. That includes combining some factions, creating new factions, sending existing factions to war, and a few other things. Some of these storyline missions also require tremendous amounts of resources, resources you'd only be acquiring if you stop working on the story to start focusing on making money.

So, if not the story, what is this game actually about? Generally speaking, that would be up to you, the player. You can make it your goal to make money, to conquer sectors, to clear out certain factions, to create an empire, or to conquer everything.

Goods in this game are produce in factories. Each factory has a chance to generate various missions when you get close enough in space. Accept those missions for cash and reputation to get started. Once you build up some money, go to a shipyard and buy a mining ship and a captain. Tell it to mine resources and sell them to local factories. The pilot becomes your slave and never needs payment, so once that ship mines enough to pay for itself, it'll be pure profits from there. Repeat that process until you have enough for a factory.

Each faction in this game has infinite money, but finite resources. That means they can create as many ships as they have resources for. This means there will always be resource bottlenecks. That's your entrance into the market. Scan shipyards to learn what they're missing and build factories nearby to fill the gaps. Earn hella cash.

Use that money to buy more ships and build more factories. Repeat until you have enough cash to think about building your own shipyard. Find an abandoned sector, claim it, and put a shipyard there. Let that be the foundation for your empire. Work with factions or eliminate them.

Yes Khaak

They attack without remorse or relent, they are always attacking.

The person that thought this would be a good idea to implement into a game needs to be sanctioned.  I do NOT want to constantly worry about an impending Khaak attack, at any moment playing this game.

I have played all the x games so far, never have i experienced a game mechanic that is so lacking than that of the implementation of the khaak.  This is a cheap time wasting mechanic that is designed to divert the player attention from what is supposed to be enjoyable.  

From personal experience i always liked X games because of the ability to hide from the major events of the game.  I could build a base far from the centre of the action, i could go about my business in a quite manner and not interfere until my presence was required or an incident needed to be dealt with,

With the khaak, i am no longer able to remain independent nor silent.  I am forced to deal with them constantly, as they will find and attack me, no matter how far i venture of the beaten path.

This is a broken implementation of a race that was already destined to be removed from the game already.

I will give this game a negative review until such time as i can operate without harassment from this race.

Fix this, for the love of god, fix this.

Update:

I know i started my review negatively, however there are rare moments that game intelligence does grace this game.  I will not call it artificial intelligence because in x4, there is no such thing.  The supposed intelligence in this game is designed by a person, that has a desire to create good content that when coded, comes out as an invalid finality of the desired result.  There are rare moments of potential good game play.  As an example, i was tasked by the yaki to wipe out the xenon from their sectors.  I reached the final sector called savage spur 1 and found that when i would just hover my attack fleet of five rattlesnakes over one of their bases they would divert their destination and come to attack.  I was interrupted 5 times by xenon k destroyers that forced me to assume a defensive stance and even break off my attack till i dealt with them (really fun stuff).  Then i realised something new about the khaak that enraged me even more.  I could be in any random sector with my bouncing headquarters and find that the khaak will not even recognise the sector who owns it, instead they will detect that my ships are in the sector and attack relentlessly.  This makes any M class ships useless as they can not defend themselves and leaves the only rational option of using L class miners that mine slower and can continue mining without bother of the khaak presence.  This still sucks though because a miner with 7 khaak M class attackers prevents usage of the travel drive and slows down mining considerably.  None of this is a problem, but the fact that all i need do is increase the number of L miners to do what is needed to supply my station.  This is awful design, this is a cheap and nasty hinderance to a basic function that must be done (with the exception of buying mined resources from other factions).

I think to sum this game up in totality, There are definitely good ( and fun) game elements present, however the sheer lack of intelligence in the games ability to do even the most basic things is unacceptable.  

To top it off, they have added an annoyance (khaak) that is just not fun.  I is simply annoying in an attempt to cover the huge flaws that his game has.",1636025562,1636798776,False,6,2,0.540387451648712158,0,True,False,False

A) A game where the focus is on the player flying around and interacting with the universe directly.  You can allow the player to have a squadron of ships with them, but do not increase the scope of the game to having the player build and control an empire.  Focus on the graphical models of the ships, the stations, quests, etc.  Make local (in-system) AI a priority.

B) A game where the focus is on managing a space empire from the ground up.  Focus entirely on AI and high level management of 100s if not 1000s of ships / stations.  Forget about the concept of being a person flying in a ship directly.  If you wanted the first person experience, you could model some kind of HQ that you walk through, and you can interact with the empire through various consoles and view screens.

What they have right now is passable, but a bit too frustrating for me.  The game is very slow, and I had to use several mods just to get to where I ended up quitting out of frustration.  If you do not use mods to unlock SETA & faster crew leveling, you can expect to sink countless hours just waiting for mundane activities.  The game has a lot to offer, but can also be a bit bland and generic.

What broke the game for me, even w/ the mods, was the poor AI of your fleet.  Escort ships that are assigned to defend a miner or trader are often very distant from their target.  Enemy ships will suddenly appear and attack the vulnerable miner, and the escort ships would be too far away and too slow to engage the enemy.  Again, I think that the developers cast too wide of a net, and have many features but they are mediocre at best.

I've spent roughly 25 out of the 31 hours I've played basically ""grinding"" for credits.  If you have a lot of time to spend on just one game, then you might be more interested in this.  But you should expect to take more direct control over your empire, and you should try to keep your empire lean (in my opinion).",1636686703,1636686703,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Vorsicht für Spieler, die keine absoluten Gameplayer und Flugprofis sind!

Denn dieses Spiel ist ein wahrer Hohn - zumindest für alle PC-Tastaturspieler.
Das Schlimmste: Alle Gegenstände, Asteroiden, Raumschiffe, Container etc. rotieren ständig über 3 Achsen. Soweit, so gut.
Um diese Rotation allerdings auszugleichen, braucht man so seine 1-3 Tasten. Dazu kommt die Geschwindigkeitsannäherung, Bremsen, näher rankommen - weitere 2-3 Tasten; gleichzeitig natürlich.
Selbstverständlich muss man auch immer wieder mal schießen, egal ob auf Schlösser, Angreifer oder Kristalle...
Das besorgen dann die Finger 5-7; ebenfalls gleichzeitig mit der Flugsteuerung. Anatomisch ungünstig auch, dass die Taste zum absoluten Geschwindigkeitsstillstand auf der extrem anderen Seite der Tastatur liegt.
Wehe dem, der zwischendurch noch die Waffensysteme umswitchen muss (z.B. auf Lenkraketen), 
dem gehen nämlich langsam die Finger aus. Und eine Hand muss die Maus bedienen...
Also: Reguliert näherkommen, Abstand angleichen, Rotation ausgleichen, schießen + ggfs. Sachen aufsammeln (Taste 'O') - alles so schnell wie möglich - viel Spaß beim Fluchen und Tastatur an die Wand werfen.

25 Stunden (inkl. Tutorial und das  Tutorial für das Tutorial!) mit Anspielzeit in den Sand gesetzt - dazu noch die mindestens nochmal 10 Stunden für die ganzen Guides aus dem Internet, die ZWINGEND NOTWENDIG sind, um überhaupt etwas zu kapieren... - man muss wissen, dass im Spiel selber praktisch nichts erklärt wird. M.E. geht EGOSOFT schlichtweg davon aus, dass jeder Käufer schon jede Menge an Flugsimulationen gespielt hat. Also, liebe Anfänger: FINGER WEG!

Zu den Tutorials (und ja, ich habe selbst die Tutorials für die Tutorials gemacht!): Da kommen Ansagen wie: ""Sammel Container ein.""
Aber WO und WIE? Tja, das muss man selbst herausfinden, zum Glück gibts den 'Autopiloten'. Soll der doch sehen, wie er dahin kommt, wo das Zeug sein soll.
Oder: ""Nehmen Sie jetzt den Reparaturlaser."" Würde ich ja gerne, aber ich weiß nicht, wo sich der befindet. Und als ich ihn durch Herumklicken durch die schier endlose Anzahl der Menüs endlich gefunden hatte, wusste ich nicht, wie man ihn aktiviert. Dann kam doch noch die tolle 'Erklärung': ""Im Rechteck ändert man die Zuordnung"". Super, nur, da sind 32 Rechtecke, welches in welcher Spalte darf es denn sein?
Und zum Höhepunkt dann das Landen im Raumdock – ach du meine Güte, dagegen war ja das Uralt „Elite“ mit der über 3 Achsen rotierenden Space-Station noch ein Kindergarten. So ein SCHWACHSINN!!!

Also, ganz ehrlich, Leute, warum setzt Ihr nicht einen blutigen Anfänger an die Tastatur und lasst Euch mal zeigen, wie der sich schwertut mit dem Spiel. Allein das Wiedereinsteigen mit dem Raumanzug nach ‚freiem Allspaziergang‘ im Raumschiff; übel, übel, Leute. Und das dauernde ‚Durch-die-Wände-stürzen‘ in Weltraumwracks. Da ist die Orientierung endgültig futsch. Peinlich, peinlich, das haben inzwischen ja sogar die NMS-Macher in den Griff bekommen (fast jedenfalls). Lasst Euch mal von einem ‚echten‘ Neueinsteiger vorhalten, wo es tatsächlich noch überall klemmt. Nicht jeder weiß z.B., was ein 'HUD' ist - nur, um mal einen Punkt herauszustreichen. Nicht jeder ist ein Space-Flight-Commander! Es macht keinen Sinn, wenn fortgeschrittene Programmierer mal eben durch die Tutorials huschen!

Das Ende vom Lied: Ich gebe auf => Viel Spaß mit diesem Unsinn!
Schade, schade, schade, denn Eines muss man EGOSOFT lassen: Die Grafik ist absolute Extraklasse. Sahnehäubchen mit Kirsche, ehrlich! - Wenn man jetzt noch halbwegs vernünftig fliegen könnte... da hilft nicht einmal die eingebaute 'Automatische Steuerungshilfe'. Selbst die 'adaptive Steuerung' versagt (ja, wirklich, sie haben 3 Steuerungsmöglichkeiten eingebaut - leider ist keine davon praktikabel! Mir wäre eine einzige - sinnvolle und leicht erlernbare - Steuerungsmöglichkeit lieber gewesen. Ich will nämlich keine Knoten in die Finger bekommen und ständig am PC herumschimpfen. Ich möchte SPIELEN!

Mir reichts jedenfalls, ich werde für meinen Teil das Spiel frustriert zurückgeben.

After about 15 hours in the game, its so busy and so many npc's are fighting/trading/living that the game really starts to make your cpu fans hit power levels over 9000.

Lots of the station functions are still janky and don't actually work the way you would expect leaving you to do some strange things to make it kinda work..?

On the other hand the feeling they give you starting out small and building your empire is truly a masterpiece. I feel the FUK out it. I just wish they would figure out a way to maybe not render the entire game and simulate it all at the same time so it could remain playable.

The first person walking part of the game isnt bad... but it feels old and out of place. No real reason to do it, I think saved time and resources into making it more of menu based thing would have been fine. But its here and its super meh.

Capital ships are pretty epic but sadly they work differently if your not in system with them good and bad...
Examples: Minning ships suck balls if you near them. Leave and they make you $$$$
Capitals die if you not there to micromanage them but fighters die more if you are present...? Capitals will get too close to stations and get blasted to bits but as long as you are willing to micro them with complex controls for a fleet you can kite them with large guns.

Over all I really love this game so much and I hope they have not given up.. Updates feel very slow and don't really address big ticket problems. If your willing to work with the problems for some extreamly rewarding game play this is a must buy.

[b]Pros:[/b]

[b]-[/b] Full sandbox game inside of a MASSIVE living galaxy.
[b]-[/b] Can choose a start with lots of different questline options to shape your role.
[b]-[/b] Tons of varied quest options options that will give you access to new ships and equipment.
[b]-[/b] Beautiful. The stars, planets, and space environments are breathtaking. The ships look incredible.
[b]-[/b] Rising up in the galaxy and becoming successful and making credits is incredibly fun. Building your first fleet, your first capital ship and seeing it in action is pretty great.
[b]-[/b] Fleet battles are amazing to watch and be a part of. Destroying huge space stations is a white-knuckle gaming experience.



[b]Cons (most cons don't show up until you enter the mid and late game):[/b]

[b]-[/b] Literally nothing is intuitive. Information online is scarce, buried in forum posts and can be out-dated. The in-game information is either intentionally vague or just incomplete. I feel like a lot of this game is left intentionally vague.
[b]-[/b] The galaxy is massive, but mostly empty, and filled with exactly the same stuff. Very little to no surprises, exploration is pretty unrewarding and just a tedious thing you have to do to find all of the systems.
[b]-[/b] Ship design is very straightforward. Some kind of balance between guns, shields and speed. The ship equipment is unimaginative. The only real customization is locked behind rare and expensive module gambling where you're fishing for high rolls. I don't understand why this customization doesn't exist as a standard portion of the game. With that said even the modules look like someone just slammed the ideas out in a weekend. There are also a handful of overpowered ships that you just automatically use as soon as you get access to them.
[b]-[/b] Logic bugs. Trying to manage an empire of stations becomes it's own micro-management mini-game. Your station managers are assigning ships to do things that are not possible. Buy things that are not within their range, or that those items that are within range. Overall the system works really well and gives you a lot of control, but scanning for errors when something isn't working right and finding out that you have to manually reset their orders, because it's stuck in some kind of logic loop, is not rewarding gaming.
[b]-[/b] Very little information available to know well how each miner, trader or station is functioning. You can infer a lot from the few graphs you're given, but I find it really strange that you don't get more detailed information. This can turn into a serious galaxy wide spreadsheet trading game, why isn't there more information on anything?
[b]-[/b] Some quality of life commands exist to make certain actions easier, but some pretty common ones are incredibly tedious to do and could be streamlined. Ex: Realizing your build order of 120 fighters was built wrong requires you to cancel each ship individually. You can give orders to multiple ships, but you cannot give ongoing orders to groups of ships. If you want 50 ships to repeat a specific task, or group of tasks, you have to go into a menu for every ship and give it those orders. When you have hundreds of ships the only way to keep track of which ones are doing what is to adopt some kind of naming system, listing their job and location, but there is no copy/paste function for text???
[b]-[/b] The world functions, it has ships and fleets flying around, but it doesn't feel alive. I feel like this is a huge shortcoming. Interiors are empty. NPCs are cookie-cutter. Everything looks the same. Very very very few unique interactions. No NPC development. No character building outside of who you choose to align with, and you can just align with everyone if you want. There is very little interaction outside of doing missions and choosing who to fight. You can trade wherever you want, trading in illegal goods isn't as fun as it sounds, and the penalties are easily avoidable. You can mine anything anywhere; nobody gets mad I'm just mining all of the most valuable ore out of their sectors???
[b]-[/b] No end game focus. You reach a point in the mid-game where the game starts to become a little tedious, but you push on to reach the end game. You reach a point where you continue doing what you were doing in the mid-game, but just on a larger scale, and that is the end game. There is no benefit to taking over a system other than access to resources or maybe it can be a strategic foothold. These are inherent benefits, literally no thought has been put into crafting an empire. No diplomacy, no benefits, no new strategies, just more of the same. Literally every aspect of the game lacks depth.

Overall I don't think this game knows what it is. They laid out a great foundation for a game and have no idea what to do with it. Most of the ideas that exist in the game feel half-baked and unfinished. The storyline missions are pretty interesting but they stall out. Fleet battling is cool, but essentially pointless. There is no benefit to continue playing once you've achieved a healthy income. There is a working in-game economy, but it's not very easy to manipulate, and there really is no reason to. Nobody goes hungry, stations don't shut down, or go out of business. Setting up a huge trading empire can be really cool, but credits become pointless, and it's missing systems to help you do that, and the systems in place don't always work as expected.  It's listed as a full sandbox game, but there is little to no support or end benefit for playing through the obvious options the game presents.

There's also a very loud part of the community can be incredibly defensive when you suggest that there should be more depth, or things should work logically. If you ask any questions about why the game is basically just frustrating they'll tell you that the mechanics work that way for game balance or whatever. This game has multiple DLCs and has been in development for years. How does it not succeed at what it is advertised as by now?

I don't think this game is tedium by design, but by a lack of focus on what makes gaming fun, and that gets interpreted as difficulty or game balance. In the end the game isn't hard. It just takes time, and It's honestly really easy to progress once you understand how everything works. The biggest hurdle is finding the information.

In this game, you can walk around your ship, although it's not quite as impressive as it sounds, since you can't go and walk into literally every area of the ship; just the cockpit and a few other rooms if you're lucky.

The gameplay is as complex as you want it to be although it certainly took me a good few hours to get my head around it. Even after 35 hours, I'd still have to re-wrap my head around a few mechanics, but it's nothing impossible.

The best thing about this game, in my opinion, is the freedom. You can create whatever sort of operation you want, be it mining, trading, etc, or you can just be a pirate. Or you could do none of that and just explore. 

Exploration isn't the best. In fact, it's probably one of the worst aspects of this game along with the combat, which, while it's not terrible, isn't the most exciting part of the game. I got a lot more enjoyment out of saving up for a massive mining ship and thinking about and planning all of the things I was going to do to make money. The idea of having a massive fleet at my command was exciting, and if you've always wanted to send out an army of spaceships to do your combat for you while you sit in a truly gigantic capital ship watching events unfold around you, then this will definitely scratch that itch.

This game would be great fun with CO-OP. Working with or against your friends would make this game very fun, but I would not expect that to ever come to the game.

But this game is a different bear entirely. While the foundation is largely the same, the UI and parsing of the previously X Universe into DLCs changes the way that veterans of the series will view the game. I'll get into the good stuff first. [b]The Verdict/TLDR:[/b] If you're a veteran, don't buy the game unless you get all of the current DLCs or you'll be disappointed. If you're new and interested, check the core game first and find a guide.

[hr][/hr]
The visuals for the game are great and stunning. Especially when you take into account the massive scale of things. 

The UI is mostly a ton better. Issuing commands and automating fleets and multiple ships is pretty phenomenally simple (once you know what you need to know). I really love how previously modded/scripted capabilities became core aspects of the gameplay.

The station building is not only satisfactory, but amazingly so. In the old games, they provided the design for factories and it was janky. You can make truly gloriously fabulous stations that allow you to choose (at any point) between self-sufficient megaplexes to modular networks.

Even if you don't have specifically targeted data on the NPC stations, you can get a strong overview of each sector's (and system's) economy through the Encyclopedia. This allows one to make smart decisions early and iteratively about a sector (and it's neighbors) as the game progresses.

The game encourages and rewards exploration. In fact, it's pretty much necessary to progress into end-game development. This is true regardless of how many times you restart the game.

Replayability is one of the strongest aspects of the game. There are multiple game starts introducing different aspects of the game at different points. Even from the same game start, the universe can be wildly different. As a for instance, one sector rich in minerals might have many NPC refineries at start to begin a mining operation, or it might have nearly none requiring you to build them yourself.

The soundtrack is very immersive and sets the tone, right from the get-go.

The modding community is mostly devoted to improving the experience. After you've played the core game, there are many mods to tweak the entire experience. 

[h2]The Not-So-Good[/h2]
As a veteran, some staples of the series are actually separated into DLCs. I personally don't appreciate having to buy a DLC to experience the Split or the Terrans. Even if there's a story reason, it makes the game feel much smaller than the previous entries until you get the DLC.

Combat is generally very satisfying, but [u]only[/u] once you know what each weapons non-statistical nuances are. While this strongly encourages experimentation, this experimentation is required and the game provides no guidance via encyclopedic or shop descriptions.

The game's difficulty starts really high, but after you have an engine for passive income becomes way to easy way too quickly. The AI can not scale nearly as quickly as you can. It's expected that you should be able to overcome the enemy, but really, they should maintain the ability to compete (to some degree) for most of the way until endgame.

While UI makes one able to setup most tasks relatively easily, that's provided that you can actually find all of the places that house the information you need to make these decisions. It so densely packed with menus and tabbed pages that it can be a little cumbersome and overwhelming, at first.

Exploration, while initially rewarding begins to feel shallow compared to previous installments in the series. Not only are most stations initially on a plane, but there is often little reason (except in specific sectors) to explore beyond the initial bounds provided by the in-game map. There is little hidden, and often little to no resources. And the AIs seem to know where you are no matter where you go, even for your stations without trades. Sadly, once you have explored the sectors base ranges for each playthrough, it won't get much better after that.

I wish I could go into more, but this review is already large enough. In short, if you're a fan already, it's worth the complete game + dlc package. If you're not, then you'll want to start with the core game and look online for tutorials or a guide.",1635709065,1635709065,True,3,0,0.510146975517272949,0,True,False,False

Then I bought the Terran DLC and used the Terran Cadet start, and the game was immediately more interesting and it better allowed me to gradually learn the mechanics.

I use X4 to fill the Elite-shaped hole in my life.  What this game has over Elite:

[list]
[*] Less grind (the bar is low and X4 clears that bar by miles)
[*] Time compression (""SETA"", and you do have to craft it unfortunately)
[*] More story (the bar is low)
[*] Actually works (see: Elite's Odyssey DLC)
[*] Mods
[*] The player can actually impact the universe
[*] Economy
[*] Ship interiors (bar is so low that you may be stepping on it)
[*] Building and owning ships and stations
[/list]

What Elite does better:

[list]
[*] VR: X4 has none and the devs are pretty anti-VR from what I've seen
[*] Scale: X4 is limited to a few dozen ""sectors"", Elite is basically the whole Milky Way
[*] Flight (though only a little better, really)
[*] Small-time space life simulator (AKA ""Elite is a better Elite"")
[*] Landing on planets (completely absent from X4 AFAIK)
[/list]

To that very last point, what I mean is that X4 pretty quickly turns into 80% RTS where you're commanding fleets and building stations to produce, buy, and sell goods.  After maybe 30 hours of X4 you can have dozens of ships and you can teleport onto any of them.  You give ships orders and manage crew a lot of the time.  Right now I have about eight trading vessels with captains skilled enough that they pretty much fly around the galaxy and make me money while I'm writing this review.

Contrast with Elite: Dangerous, where you can have a bunch of ships, but you can only ever fly one at a time.  The rest collect dust.

You can also contrast with Elite that, after about 50 hours in X4 I have something like twenty or thirty ships working for me.  After about 500 hours in Elite I think I have about 15 ships.

If you're worried about the flight, or even combat experiences in X4, maybe don't worry that much.  Elite players, you have ""FA off"" here (meaning semi-kinda-Newtonian flight).  The combat is fun enough in my experience.  Of course, unlike Elite, you're going to be facing off with NPCs, not humans.  On the other hand, given how Elite's player base has dropped after Odyssey, and the sheer scale of Elite... maybe you're also facing NPCs there.

X4 also gives you the opportunity for fleet battles, if that's your thing.

If you've heard the game is super-buggy, here in late 2021 I will tell you that I have encountered relatively few bugs.  I have gotten stuck in the odd object.  I've had to restart the game a couple times.  Overall, though, the experience for me as a new player on 4.1 has been a game that basically works.  (It is annoying that saves take like forty-five seconds.)

And best of all, the game has tons of mods, so if it's too easy or too hard for your liking, you can probably change that with mods.

Overall I find X4 lots of fun.  Want to do missions, experience some amount of story?  You can.  Want to just run a trade empire?  I think you can.  (I am currently, ask me in another hundred hours.)  Want to fight stuff?  You definitely can.

If you're done with Elite and want a game that's both deeper and more respectful of your time, look no further.

With X3 Terran Conflict 1703 hours and X3 Albion Prelude 667 hours and now X4 already at 922 hours play time, you can call me fan of the X-series...

I have seen X4 Foundations develop into a really good game. The graphics on planets, asteroid fields, stations and ships  are very good. Sometimes it took long time to load a planet in the background. See it appear by the time you pass through the system on the space highway. So I bought a better graphics card and it all runs much better now.

In the early versions, making money was relative easy. Few versions later it became more difficult because my pilots didn't progress into 3 stars, needed for Auto trade. Bugged? You could send your fresh 1 star pilots into combat and hope they gain a little bit experience...I depended on nividium mining in my early game and suddenly the miners where not collecting much and fewer places to sell. At this point I stopped with my previous game.

Now at v4.10 you can get higher level pilot training by doing missions. Maybe it was already available in earlier versions and I didn't notice before. This made my start over and play the game again. The money is coming in with a nice number of M class Auto traders. A hand full of slow big L traders which I control myself so they do not need a high star captain. Added some sector miners, some advanced and some expert.

Find the blueprints by using EMP bombs in your single person space suite, instead of buying them. Save money.
You can start building your space stations and even more money will come in. Then build your own warf and shipyard

Build your destroyer group that work as Xenon station demolition team. Maybe place some bombs on the station turrets first, it helps. Lots of defence drones? See a Rattlesnake in action with Argon Flaks. Take control of a sector after Xenons gone.

I really love the station building tool and the option to save a station-design for later use. 
Not sure about the rotation option on the buildings and station parts...but once you get use to it, a station does not need many connection elements. Placement is better, connecting together by rotating 90 or 180 or in an angle of your choice. 
Not like the spiderweb stations as in X3.

My 8 year old son loves the aliens walking around and especially Boso Ta. He can fly space ships, not only on autopilot and even shoot on rotating lockboxes with few locks on it. He asks what the lady in the station anouncement says: ""Keep children away from the airlocks"" and ""Loose animals will be vaporized"". I just like to add one: ""Egosoft, thank you for developing this product"".

It has come a long way since it's original release, but still desperately needs more variety (which currently is mostly delivered by the modding-community - and as of now there aren't too many active modders who actually add unique and original stuff, since modding this game is a royal pain); it's as barren as X3: Reunion was at first.

I thoroughly enjoy it every time I play though, because there's always something one can do. 
Build a crazy station, bolster your fleets, make friends or enemies, do random missions, try out mods you're curious about, set up a custom gamestart with a huge fleet (or just your spacesuit) in hostile territory, randomly glitch into an asteroid while travelling and figure that now would be a good time to finally start using that research-system to unlock teleporting in order to get out...

One aspect that falls flat to me is the in-development expeditions, which are basically a soft invasion of other players online. The idea in itself isn't bad at all, but it's locked out by playing with mods, which IMO have always been an essential part of X-games ever since X2. Vanilla is okay to an extent, but at some point in time there have always been must-have-mods for each X-game. 
The Top Gun Mod for X2, Roguey's Mod or XTended for X3:Reunion, XRM for TC and AP. The lead dev explained that they will mitigate this with signed mods (signed previously just meant that a script or mod is officially approved and eventually offered to download by ES), but some of the mods I like will probably not be valid candidates.

- you can handle clunky gameplay/UI-elements/stuff that may take time and patience to get used to
- you like bugs or know how to co-exist with them, because you like 'The Fly'
- you liked the X-games previously, or generally like niche sci-fi-titles that simulate as many aspects as possible
- you don't get a heart-attack or feel the urge to combine a fork with your eyes once you see the ingame-charactermodels and their animations (Egosoft got better at this though!)
- you can handle story-dialogue that is voice-acted like someone just randomly got handed a cliff-note with lines of dialogue (out of context) to read aloud - or you disable game-sound to listen to music by default; in that case you'll miss out on a gorgeous OST though!

x4 have lots of things to know\learn but when you know.. you have good ui to preform it.

you can do main mission(story),guild mission(change the world faction) or normal mission(specific charecter send you to help them)

you can board ships, hack stations, research new technology, build station, find lootboxs(cool mechanic)

every faction have its own ships with pros / cons
economy is big part of the game and can set for automation orders.

as player thta play lots of space games(moo,galciv,es,stellaris,sots,elite,everspace,gimini abd more) i can say that x4 is one of the best.. dev team did and doing great job..

because lots of things can run automated i didnt close my pc for 3 days :)

the problem with the game that you need to learn a lot of mechnics and from start you can feel lost.. 
you start with 10K credits and you find something to sell to earn more.. 
you get 100 :)... 
you go and look how much cost the cheepest ship to upgrade your existing..
you see it cost 130K and empty.. hh armed 1.5mil... and that is the cheep small one..
that when you understand you need money..
- you can do missions, by time you will get bigger rewareds
- you can board(pirate) and get ships you want(only L-XL size can boarded M-S pilots can escape and you claim the ship)
-you can sell wares that you find in looxboxs,droped cargos,destorying xnons,khaks to shop

currently my run after 160~ hours...
got 200mil cash
4 full working stations(earn 10 mil per hour)

- The ships are cool looking. The graphics are quite good.
- The idea is ambitious. The universe feels large. The economy is real.
- I believe the devs are doing their best with their hearts in the right place

- The AI is frustratingly bad. You cannot trust the ships under your command. I am worth maybe 5 of the same ship, and I suck.

I have immersion complaints, which are important to me:

- Feedback when your ship is under attack is a weapon-hitting-hull sound (the same one, over and over) and your ""health bar"" getting smaller. It's pretty easy to be surprised when you poof out of existence and get a game over screen. Elite Dangerous does this much better (shaking, alarms, smoke, cracked window). Very anti-climatic here. 
- Ship movement is weird. Fighters seem to exhibit infinite acceleration with their manoeuvring thrusters, but with a maximum speed. Independence War and several other titles nail this. 
- The sound could use some work. I don't want accuracy, I want ""feel"". Large engines are loud as hell with a repetitive, largely unchanging sound. Elite Dangerous nails this so well. Engines purr and roar when appropriate in ED. There's a mod that makes those engines quieter, but we could do better than that!
- The missions don't feel important. Example: war missions where you destroy turrets on an enemy station. Text says they will move in after you, but they don't (if they do - it should be more obvious). You kinda have to bring your own imagination to make it seem worthwhile. If some ships actually did move in and thank me and then blow it up, I'd feel pretty good about it. I want to believe that I am participating in something when doing these missions.

If the main-focus of this game is empire building, then the AI needs to be trustworthy. If it's ""here's a universe, have fun"" it needs better immersion. 

I don't compare to other games to say those are perfect. No game can be expected to be. I'm still trying to like X4, but I'm not having fun just yet. On paper I should love it, so I'm driven to try. 

I did enjoy just flying around with a fun ship, but the aforementioned immersion problems cut that pretty short.

X series were always ""true shallow sandbox"" where you have to create fun for yourself. But current X4 state is not even there. 

Even with major Update 3.0 the game feels extremely unpolished and raw. It feels like multiple developers were assigned different tasks, did not speak to each other for months, and then just merged every piece into one game - and no one ever check how does it look like in the end. 

Tons of bugs there as well too. Most of them are annoying, some are rare gamebrakers (and by saying 'tons' - I mean it, u can get multiple of them even before you finish the tutorial).

[b]Positives[/b]
[list]
[*] Pretty after a fashion - a riot of colour and madness
[*] It's busy - space is full of activity. Wander around stations and see ships constantly flying in and out
[*] Mission discovery is an exciting version of quest-giving
[*] Lots of familiar notes from earlier X games but given a new spin
[*] Risky business - it's pretty easy to die, makes you nervous of hostile encounters
[*] Faction feuds are much more dramatic than they've ever been in previous games. You will frequently find Xenon capital ships making incursions into border sectors and they go on to remove a lot profittttsssss.
[*] Captain Collins has now produced lots of Youtube content to help with the learning process
[/list]
[b]Negatives[/b]
[list]
[*] My God, the interface. Unintuitive doesn't do it justice. The ship menu is a good idea, but the context menus are barely useful, the information page is like tracking your annual accounts with sticky notes. What's my hull condition at glance? No idea. Map overlays in each others' way are an issue, and it's terribly easy to get jumped by something very dangerous while you fiddle around.
[*] ~~Crazy collision behaviour if you poke too closely around stations~~ I think this is better now
[*] Very detached sense of occasion in combat. Are you taking hits? Are they big ones?
[*] Missiles - the unstoppable instakill homing menace. You can dodge them, but for how long? My first wingman impressively exploded as she flew straight into one fired at her. Much more impressive than the pathetic feedback you receive when you get hit by one. I imagine bigger ships can take the hits, but not anything you start with. [i] not found as much of an issue lately, might be my play choices and larger ship class[/i]
[*] ~~Stability - saving is quite slow and painful, even with an SSD. Should you save? Too late, it crashed.~~
[*] Wingman control - nice try, no cigar
[*] Station populace - hilarious, like a bunch of headless space chickens - Egosoft obviously did as little as possible here, station interiors are pretty but almost completely devoid of purpose. [i]Slightly more interesting in later patches, but not much.[/i]
[*] Ventures functionality seems pretty dull, so much so they canned it in favour of a newer scheme. It's gated on quite a lot of wealth anyway, so I haven't explored it.
[*] Ship boarding, great idea, awful execution.

Hopefully you can see that I like what they've made, but it definitely needs work I don't think they're prepared to do.

The only thing about this game that is better is the graphics, but, given how much newer this game is than TC, even they aren't that impressive. I might stick with it a bit longer, but the game is just really tedious. The lack of jump drive REALLY slows this game down and in the early game there is often nothing to do while travelling. It's not like I have ships or stations to manage whilst I'm being chauffeured around so a significant portion of my playtime has literally just been me sitting at my desktop scrolling on my phone or using my laptop while I wait for my ship to get to its destination.I really like the highway system and it's genuinely a blast to get onto it and just zoom away, but the game desperately needs a jump drive. The narrative is hardly compelling and never has been in the X games. It's always been about the gameplay and the lack of jump drive makes the gameplay tedious, monotonous and a significant waste of time.
I am also not sold on the UI. It's quite clunky and not user friendly. I found the ones for the X3 games to be much more intuitive and I could generally issue orders very quickly and interact with both ships and stations more efficiently. Also, I am baffled as to why walking around on stations was ever introduced into the X series and it is something that was literally never needed and I don't understand why anyone would ever want it or why they would waste significant resources on it. Walking around ships? Sure. But stations? Bland, vapid stations with NPCs just wandering around aimlessly or standing and waiting for you to come and talk to them? Nope. 
All in all, the game is ALMOST there, but it's just too flawed and too much of a step back from X3: TC to be recommendable. I got it on a serious sale so I don't feel too ripped off, but unless they introduced major quality of life improvements (which I doubt) then I'd give this a pass unless you want a game which you can play whilst doing other stuff like watching YouTube or Uni stuff/work etc on another device. I sometimes enjoy games like that, but it's not what I wanted out of an X game.
As a last point, this game has garbage tutorials and is generally not super accessible. I have significant experience in the X3 games and, although it's been a number of years since I played them, I was often scratching my head on how to actually do things in X4 (or if I even could do them) and I would have to Google questions and read forums filled with posts of similarly puzzled individuals. I appreciate the YouTube videos one of the developers did and also the training modules they have added in, but it's not enough.

This game will get better with time..  its a little rough early on, but once you get over the learning curve it grows on you.

[Updated Review]

I was wrong.. I was thinking this game would get massively better with time, but it is no X3.. not even close.  

The major things I see:

1)  The AI is absolutely useless..  its terrible. 
2) The engine optimization is poor..  there seems to be some major concurrency issues in the coding. The GUI is constantly freezing though the resource utilizations are all low.  In Borderless Windowed - if you swap to a background task the game hangs for several minutes. 
3) Autosave - This is the longest autosave ever.. the game hangs and you wait..  
4) Economy - What Economy?  The late game economy is stagnant at best. 
5) Overall Gameloop -  The loop is 'ok' - its not great and ends up being alot of 'waiting' doing nothing.  It would be great if some of the activities were actually fun.. but they're not.  Lockboxes are cute the first time, but get old quick.  There's really just not enough fun content and the battles are not that rewarding. 

This one seems to have lost the luster that was contained in X3..  it feels cheap, poorly coded and empty.",1566440577,1633357301,False,0,0,0.498040854930877686,0,True,False,False

It is all pretty in the beginning. as soon as you want to play an empire, it falls straight on to its (inter)face.
the gui turns fleet management into a chore; the concept of every subordinate or economic instance beeing an individual trader as well just bloats up the hole rule- and policy- and stationmangement and whatnotpart unnecessarily. in my humble opinion.

you want to lead a war on multiple fronts? in map view?
info about hull and shields behind one button, turret behaviour - another button, formations and orders - one more button. in between you get alerts from who knows where. maybe it is crucial, so you go into the log via another two buttons while loosing all overview over your fleets. unfortunately you have to micro your fleets since low tier pilots are so braindead and useless that fleet automation gurantees suicide. (unless you find joy in leveling up these grunts for days)

how hard can it be to supply your first station with raw materials with the help of a subordinate miner assigned to that station?
you can read it up and do it right.  the problem is: you have to. the most basic basics of any economic simulation.

complex games can be fun and became pretty rare. but this is all just.. frustrating.

This game isn't as large and expansive in terms of sectors as X3:Reunion/TC/AP but the sectors it does have are varied, interesting, and large. 

This is a space sandbox with a few plotlines for factions but otherwise it's mostly space capitalist tycoon. You make a trading/mining/military empire as the goal or all three at once. Though you can play totally solo without building an empire but it kind of negates most of the features of the title. X4 is quite literally a 4X game.

X4 has arguably the best economic simulation of the series and allows factions to capture sectors. This means that conflicts have actual stakes and cost actual resources. It also means you can attack supply lines to the forward defence platforms being built by enemy factions to slow down their advance. 

The combat is well balanced, but suffers the problem as other games in the genre. The ships have more form over function in a lot of cases and firing arcs are easily exploited - especially rear. Allowing you to immobilize anything with relative ease. It's not nearly as egregious as Starpoint Gemini 2. But turret coverage is very poor on most large ships. This is largely negated on ships from the XR ships mod which adds ships from X:Rebirth that have much better turret coverage.

The storylines are functional but not AAA or even AA game material outside of maybe the starts for Terrans and Split. 

You can even waste hours on a space dock watching ships come and go or watching you (or factions) building ships in shipyards. The game is very beautiful and has become at least slightly more optimized over time and patches. 

It does not have scaling mission difficulty and payments like X3 had. This is a both a curse and a blessing. You don't get 5mil for taxi missions anymore. But if you're making 21mil an hour, you don't need the 50k you would get so you'll just start ignoring missions unless you really want some side action.

For best experience with ship variety and sectors: get the expansions. 

Opinion: If you want big ship variety, huge amount of sectors, static combats, scaling mission rewards but a more basic economic simulation get any or all of the X3 games.

If you want a deeply polished economic simulation and the ability to take over the galaxy with static mission rewards and fewer but more detailed ships, get X4 foundations.",1632841392,1632841392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is huge, atmospheric, and you have complete freedom over your destiny. You can buy additional ships, outfit them to whatever spec you'd like, install a crew, and then automate them; this comes in very handy, especially for generating revenue.

For all of the good qualities, the game is somewhat buggy. For example: the autopilot function will often fly you into objects, and it will often disable itself for no apparent reason. However, the game does state in its tutorial that the autopilot is far from perfect and that it requires manual intervention occasionally. 

Other times you'll  buy a new ship and then find yourself completely unable to interact with anything in its cockpit, including the NPC captain. 

But what you'll notice most is how bizarrely the NPC ships behave. They will fly into docking areas backwards, or fly into docking areas whilst rapidly spinning around on the horizontal axis, or they'll clip through the docking structure repeatedly. Your own ships (ones captained by NPCs) will sometimes completely ignore your order that they dock at your current location. Plus many more!

Overall, I'm still enjoying it after 30 hours of play and it satisfies the itch that the other 3D space game, y'know... the one that originated on the BBC Micro, has no interest in scratching for Linux users.

Game is every enjoyment and fun for those who forced on combat and station builder, but might not every enjoyment for non combat trader personal, as X3 is better for personal traders, autotrader and fleet manager while X4 is better for auto miner/gas, station builder, small fighter had chance to beat bigger but bigger ship in x3 is better. Weapons is not same as X3. 

Fleet manage is remain more of similar but had other type issues. 

X3 is great for slow ship, thankful to jumpdrive, but X4 do not had jumpdrive, it's not good for slow ship to be in, because once you under fire of enemies, you are unable to flee it.

X4 flavor of speed, speed is petty much had as you can flee or control battle whatever you think or feel best, but X3 don't care about slow ship, due jumpdrive, you can jumpdrive to save ship and yourself from game over screen. 

Game is Fun and worth to buy, but X3 and X4 game is not same, just similar but difference gameplay due economics, way ship's speed (x4)/jumpdrive(x3) importance change and auto trader is great in x3 but you can't had that (I'm not sure they removed it or nerfed by need high level star pilot to do that in x4 but auto miner replaced auto trader from x3 to x4, x3 had mining station endless, depend output to keep up, but x4 don't had any mining station endless . Raw resource could ran out and it's take some time to regen in sector in x4. 

So x3 is little slow while x4 is more faster, but both are still same, it's take a while to make credit to build or buy ship, so go on, couple real day at least to start up for station, it's lot of credit and time to set up station and making profit that way.

12hrs play time at time of review...err no....more like 2hrs and then the rest of it has been spent with the game paused while i look online to find that the reason I cannot do something isn't because I'm dumb, but entirely because of the bugs. Remember Elite 3 that came out in the 90's and was unplayable coz of the bugs? If you do you'll know to run from this game - if you don't then imagine playing a game where every single aspect of it is impossible to do because of the bugs and you still wont be close to just how bad this game is.
Training missions are bugged to hell and back so better off not bothering and just looking online (as that is what you are going to have to do anyway coz the in game explanations are incomplete).
I have ""played"" this for 8 hrs today - and have not advanced one single step. 8 hrs of trying to do the first mission and it bugging out - first the rift bounces me all around the sectors - except the one I want to go to, then I buy a second ship (as your told to do) and managed to get the space station to appear (a total of 6 hrs to get to this stage) then the builder wont build the dock, just sits there...online says you need storage, but you cannot build storage until you have a dock....so an entire day of doing and redoing the same bloody mission (roughly 9 times in total) and I still haven't managed to complete it - and then to top it all off some raider comes and wipes out my heavy fighter with a single burst.....putting me all the way back to the beginning again.
NOT worth the £40 steam are charging - I brought it at 50% discount and still feel cheated! - It wouldn't be worth getting even if it was free.
School kids can write games with less bugs than this and would fail their exam if they submitted something as poorly written. 
This is a prime example of a software house not caring about the game or those who buy it, and only caring about the money they can make ripping off the fanbase the previous releases generated.

Not an evolution over previous game, but an attempt to copy the idea with none of the finesse.
Main issue with X4 IMO is that it's extremely slow - my latest experience is starting after the latest patch, with the HQ start, taking a research mission that requires me to fly 2 sectors away and come back, enabling autopilot and waiting ~10 minutes, talking to a guy, and waiting for another 10 minutes on the way back. The only highlight of the trip was that autopilot drove my ship into an asteroid on the way.
So 20 minutes in I did one mission, that required me to basically press CTRL+A and wait 20 minutes - not a great use of my time.

The ships are pretty decent overall. Some of the ships are magnificent works of art! And some are really, meh. There's a nice balance IMO. However, a few things annoy me. The cut an paste parts make certain ships feel like they were lazily designed and many appear like cookie cutter carbon copies across the races. Landing pads on ships? I like when my ship penetrates a mothership and sits comfortably inside. Several of the newer carriers do allow you to actually ""dock"" inside the ship. I'd like to see more customization, ship variations and weapons options as well. Most ships have 2 varients. I'd love to see a few more. You can reskin your ships and that's wonderful! But, I am playing for the pew pew of it. 

Missions are enjoyable, but there are a few mission types that are lacking. Bounty hunting was my favorite thing to do in X3. They opted to not have this in X4 and I hope they remedy this in the next expansion or update. 

Trade is lacking due to the fact that all ship components/weapons/shields, must be made and used at the time of ship assembly. You can't run guns in this game and that's a damn shame. The upside to trade is, you can make a killing because none of the NPC's know how to make a station that's self sufficient. Downside to that is, when you're building a ship, sometimes you have to provide all your own resources to the shipyard or you're going to wait weeks for it to build. NPC traders are terrible at finding and patching supply holes. 

That's just a couple things that irritate me. This being said, I absolutely love this game and have had a BLAST playing it over the years. I can't wait to see what comes in the future.",1631130428,1631669328,True,1,0,0.507321536540985107,1,True,False,False

I've long been a massive fan of X3: Terran Conflict and believed it to the best until my most recent playing of X4. It seems like the concepts of X:Rebirth were expanded upon while adding the depth of previous X titles. While the game is still missing the depth of X3: TC it is well on its way to becoming my favorite of the series. 

The first person interactions with ships, crew, and stations adds immersion and gives a feeling the X universe is alive. I love the increase in the variety of missions and the custom station editor is a massive improvement over the complexes of the past games. The AI is decent but can still use improvement as certain actions bug out depending on if you are present in the system or not.

For me, finding a game that keeps my interest long enough and is engaging to the point I have to come back time and time again is rare.  I first encountered the X-series with X2:The Threat.  It was one of the few games in my library that I actually ""completed"" (as in the main story line).  When X4 was initially released, I purchased it hoping it would bring me back to the good old days that I enjoyed about the X series.  With this earlier version of X4, it was close, very close to being that ""one"" game; even after buying DLC ""Split Vendetta"".  There were a few things that just didn't seem like the game was quite ""done"" and needed to go back into the oven.   I uninstalled and waited.  After purchasing ""Cradle of Humanity"" and installing the latest beta version (v.10) with over 50 hours into this most recent version,  I do believe that I found my perfect game of all times.

The story arcs are much more engaging now and the overall feel seems much more ""done"".  All within and without these multiple story arcs is a game I can make up on my own in my own timing.  I can go in and out of story missions as I see fit or pick up odds and ends if I wish, or work on building my empire.  The options are endless and I can come and go as I please.  It's one of the most relaxing games I have.  I like the fact I can avoid trouble and run away; or if I feel snarky, I can engage and find out if my quick save was a good thing or not.  There is a nice balance between tension and relaxation.  I can get out of the blender by quickly docking at a near base and take a breather.  I can tell there is a ton more game and I just scratched the surface.  The uncovering of some secret keeps me going.

The quality of the gameplay is what is really worth it here and as mentioned before the voice acting is pretty bad (i wish theey would add a skip voiceline function to dialogue) but all in all there is nothing else like the X series and if space interests you this is a MUST HAVE game.

10/04/2020: I bought this game when it first came out but was semi disappointed due to the amount bugs and the absolutely horrible voice acting that just ruins parts of the game.

Over a year later and its good to see that a lot of the bugs are gone which really helps this game shine. There is a lot to offer in this game that was simply obscured and destroyed by the severe amount of bugs in the release and there really isn't anything else like it so its well worth experiencing. 

Unfortunately there are some negatives still, even with the latest expansion the games voice acting hasn't improved at all but more importantly there are simple aspects of polish both in terms of quality control and game mechanics that haven't been addressed as well as function you'd think the AI would have but simply don't. Want to use a massive carrier as a way to launch an armada of fighters upon the commencement of battle? have fun doing that all manually. Want to have a fleet of miners that all work together or are at least organised into groups so you know who does what and where? not possible to create groups of them that do this and the only way to organise them is really to just rename them.

These things stop the game from being the best that it can be and although I may not have played as many hours of the X series as some fans I feel as though this is what stops the series from being as ""big"" as it could be.

As it stands I think the game is worth the price of $70 and if you can get it cheaper than bargain!

2. Refineries are rare from my experience and when you do find one it does on occasion disappear from the map

3. The game takes forever to load and that's without mods.  with mods is even worse.

There is a bug in the game that enables your ship to become stuck inside the geometry of object, mainly space stations. In some cases it is possible to wiggle yourself out, but for the most part, once you're stuck you're stuck for good. This has cost me too many hours of progress for me to really give this the shining review it deserves.

If you don't  mind saving pretty much any time you approach a station, which takes an extremely long time, then this might be tolerable. For me, it's a deal-breaker, especially since there is no mechanic for getting unstuck from geometry at this time.

A lot of customization which is cool, but the game feels like it's mostly menus (Like solo EVE-online) and clunky/confusing piloting controls. Have been trying to give this game a genuine try, but I half my play hours are searching through online forums trying to discern what is a bug, and what is a setting that can be toggled. T-drive randomly shutting off? Maybe it's because of the T-Drive shut off setting. Toggled off? Well have you tried rapidly pressing the X and Y keys? 

I'm really interested in the corporation and empire management, but it's very challenging to get there, and I have just barely made it to 20 ships, half of which is production and a quarter is trade. While I don't mind having to adapt my trade and production ships to changing market conditions (a genuinely cool feature of the game IMO) it's annoying that there isn't much of a notification when a Gas or Mineral stops generating credits unless.... I camp the menus. 

Early on, it feels like I have to excessively micro-manage low tier pilots, and a lot of the behaviors and custom settings that I'm advised to toggle take a lot of troubleshooting and feels like scavenger hunt at first, which just means I'm spending more time in menus and google. 

Game certainly is neat, I think it will be a more enjoyable experience once the custom start is available, but my first play through has been excessively frustrating. As of this writing, I have close to 30 hours put into the game, but my save file has about 16hrs, and I've probably only' truly spent 18 hours in-game including re-loads from Game Over deaths. The other 14 hours feel like they're spent on Google, sifting through forums having people explain and/or speculate on what a particular function within the games many menus do, and watching YouTube videos that may or may not answer my question. There are a lot of features like the customization I alluded to above that isn't explained at all or very well in the tutorial missions, and the game progression pace takes a lot of figuring out. 

I'm very much on the fence with my recommendation but as it stands now, the game has felt like it has a massive learning curve and much of my active game play is spent in the map menu looking at my ships as blips on a screen. People more familiar with the X series seem to like it, as a brand new player to the series though, I feel like this game has had the steepest learning curve second. I plan on playing more to at least see how station and sector management feel and large fleet commanding works. Hopefully by then I can change my recommendation and leave more insight for prospective gamers. 

If you're on the fence about buying this, take more time to check out videos and guides to ensure the game is right for you. I definitely don't recommend trying  2 hours on Steam with the refund in-mind, as you will certainly not get a remotely good gauge on the game in 2 hours if you're new to the series like I am. The game is certainly fun and interesting enough at times for me to continue playing for the time being, but I feel as though I've hit a pretty massive wall, and reading through forum posts or watching 15-20 minute YouTube videos more than actually playing the game is getting pretty frustrating.

Edit: so Have about 80 hours into the game. I still cannot recommend this game. 

I feel as though the game is praise-worthy because it goes wide and does a lot of things you'd want in an immersive, first person space empire building game. It's just that... a lot of the application of these wide gameplay features is incredibly frustrating. auto trading isn't incredibly inefficient compared to micro-managing the ships yourself, according to the devs this is working as intended... okay... 

Second, the empire management eventually turns into SETA and menu/sub-menu clicking. Not particularly interesting or exciting, and it feels terribly tedious. Not to mention navigating the daunting menus. I'm constantly checking my cargo ships to make sure they're actually supplying stations, carriers or just simply trading, as they have a habit of just doing donuts, flying in a circle, doing fuck all. Cargo drones have a habit of just repeatedly ramming themselves into your larger ships and struggle to dock unless you fidget the capital ship manually. 

Lastly... I just really need to stress that this game for me has been 30% google (which scales down as you learn about the game functionality) and 69% menus and toggling commands for your fleet and stations. The automation in this game is not at all efficient, and unless you do a lot of tedious and confusing toggling of behaviors and placement, which itself requires a lot of trial and error, the automation of ships hardly works at all. Once I have a multitude of stations, the game feels sort of like a cross between an idle game, and a spreadsheet. It's idle if you can tolerate the gross inefficiency and buggy auto trade/supply AI, and a spreadsheet because you'll need to do some manual calculations to figure out why your stations and traders are operating at a negative with  tier 5 managers and pilots. 

I don't think it would be fair to say I don't completely recommend this game... I think there's a particular type of gamer who would really enjoy this type of game. To the credit of the devs, the games scope is massive and wide. I think I'd personally enjoy the game more if it didn't feel as though empire management gameplay wasn't purely menus, and if the flee automation consistently worked rather than ships just doing donuts and me not realizing it until I check the ship logs menu and find out it's never even docked at a station.",1628289270,1630367572,False,4,0,0.514485538005828857,0,True,False,False

There was a bug dating back to 2013 in a previous game that still exists and honestly is just the worst. Alt f4 rage quit levels. Except i don't usually rage quit. Basically using the super highways is a gamble with your save. In my case i somehow went so fast i maxed out my speedometer and ended up over 7k km from the nearest anything. Which is roughly 1-1.5 hours full speed in my current ship. And apparently once it happens in a save itll happen more often if you dont save scum. My last save was over 2 hours before. My recommendation is either dont use super highways or better yet get the mod that removes them entirely. How qa or management allow this over 8 years later blows my mind. And to the devs if you honestly cant fix it after 8 years why not just remove them entirely. And for the record i was afk with auto pilot on when it happened. So it wasn't user error in the sense that i did something by accident. Apparently it happens when you have your map open which i did when i entered the highway. My maintain speed in menues was off but auto pilot may mess with that. Basically there are so many reports of what can cause it and all of them seem pretty common. 

Having map open

Being behind a big vehicle (some vehicles have been able to drag me along with them as they pass while im stationary) as it leaves highway. Basically the catapult/slingshot maneuver on steroids. 

Leaving the highway mid travel 

Apparently auto pilot. But having an npc pilot works just fine. 

To make matter worse this can happen when you are in a space suit if you have auto pilot on when you get pulled through the anomaly early game for humans. I ended up over 100km from my ship and move at 1-2m/s fortunately i had a pilot and could have them come to me. 

Basically avoid auto pilot and maps whenever you are even close to any kind of rapid travel device or anomaly. 

These are 2 of the more commonly used features which is why im baffled its still an issue. 


So you have been warned its otherwise a great game. but you deserve to know about this bug as that could absolutely be deal breaking for some people and it can occur  after steams 2 hour limit for returns.

Update: That said its very rare and hasn't happened since i stopped using map while in auto pilot when using warp points. The mods definately help as well. Its pretty fun and you can do a lot of different things. I like making fleets that do my trading and mining while i do the fighting. The auto save i still havent figured out what prompts it and you should absolutely save regularly lest you lose an hour or 2 of progress because you hit a mine.",1629890575,1630299969,True,0,0,0.590923786163330078,3,True,False,False

AI can be pretty dumb, and the difference between how the AI acts when you are in sector and out of its sector varies quite a bit, making things a bit more challenging. The economic gameplay is also pretty hard to get into, you have to do some market research to figure out what to produce, and sometimes the best thing to produce simply isn't that great. On the grand scale of things, it seems like it varies greatly in terms of what the factions do. My playthrough had the factions seem sluggish and unresponsive, while I have heard of other players say their factions were actually killing each other.
The developers do make regular updates to further polish the game, as this is much better than when it first came out, and I imagine at some point the AI will work much better, there will be less bugs, economy might be easier to get into, etc

This game seems very good. I made it through the tutorial until I came to the realization of one glaring flaw….. not in the game but in me. 

I made a friend by debating a random console gamer in….. The PC Gamer Game of the Year Thread in 2015. Yeah, the year those idiots gave Metal Gear Solid 5, an unfinished game, Game of the Year over Witcher 3, arguably the most technically superior High Fantasy RPG ever. 

I remember him saying he had no problem gaming on a ps4 in 30 fps 1080 or even 720. Meanwhile, I refused to play many games that did not support 5760 x 1080. 

Fast forward to today and I have to admit, I’m a spoiled entitled jerk when it comes to games. I refuse to play an action game that doesn’t implement ultrawide… like Sekiro and Scarlet Nexus (hence back to back returns). So I bought this game with the refund money. I checked the discussion board for ultrawide support and lo and behold it has it! 

Then I played the game. I actually did not realize how much time you spend in the cockpit of this game. Then it hit me: there really is no way I can commit to this game. I simply can not stomach playing any game in a cockpit without VR. I just can not bring myself to do it. I know this is a good game. I know it’s a gem. I know this community is one of those niche communities, so niche in fact that it becomes a fraternity. Like a real frat, not the weird kids with money but no social skills. Unfortunately, I’m a spoiled entitled gamer with limited time and as I watched my spaceship fly in 2d, I realized I would never be able to dedicate the hours this piece of art requires.

This is my first review on Steam.
I have played Elite Dangerous and will be comparing X4 to that game.

Pros
Huge world.
Lots of activities.
MODES :)
Managing fleet of your ships.
Be sure to buy with both DLCs.

Cons:
You have to learn how to play and how to use all the options/capabilities. Because there are a lot of them. And this is great news :)

Comparing to Elite Dangerous:
ED: it's really great when it comes to mechanics, but other than that it just relies on relentless grind.
To David Braben: you did a great game in 1995 ""Frontier: First Encounters"". I mean it. I still remember the mission in which I had to photograph military installations on the planet's surface.

But in 2021 a great idea is not enough. How come you didn't fill up this wonderful universe. It's empty. What went wrong David?

X4: it's deep. Lots of stuff to do. Cool, varied missions. Space probes, resource probes, Nav beacons, space highways, space gates (worm holes), auto mine, auto explore, auto defend (these and many more commands you can give to your ships, which are directed by hired captains).

If you like Sci-Fi, take it.

It feels somewhat alive. Economy is booming. Some attacks appear but nothing major or concerning.
as for patch 4.0 this game is playable. It is still less fun than x3 for me, but a lot of my complains are no more. One thing that i will spoil :

---THANK YOU ARGON FEDERATION FOR PLAYING GAME. ---
YOU SURVIVED 300 HOURS. Your allies weren't better tho...........
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!!!
Also . . . image you have battleship worth 120 mln CR (piloted by 5 star AI) and its attacked by XEN K. I wonder should i be worried??? SHOULD I???????????????......

a SUPER-FLIPPIN-BATTLESHIP will die when attacked by a frigate!!! R U SIRIUS? 
AI is just <f-u-c-k-t-a-r-d stupid>
AI doesnt know how to use its ship. Its not programmed to be competent in anything and its pathfinding is just atrocious. ITS REALLY THAT BAD that it takes 15 minutes to dock L sized ships in my own HQ. I just can't take it......

But the rest is well. 
For my litany of rage about how it begun, read further.

And just for my own frustration - when it comes to engineering a flyABLE things, EGOsoft need to take some engineering classes because 70 % of those designs are just a liability for military purpose. 
AND NO i will not imagine some corrupted ass got bribed to accept those designs. 
-----------initial review----------
 I tried to give thsi game a chance. It did not take it. As a fan of every x series for 15 years i can tell you i have been bamboozeled. Just like X rebirth it is disaster. Full of bugs, not even tutorails work for me. Ocasionally crashes.
It DOES try to be better and deeper than XR but everything is half finished. 

Graphics are DOWNGRADE from X rebirth. Its end of 2018 and game look like X3. Its a joke. Just like fallout 76 its a cashgrab, and we stupid fans got caught in the spiders web of greed and industrial corruption.

I would have suffered it, because devs put some work into new ui and map system which is 1346345245635% better than previous managment. But it does not help when you have nothing to manage.

World is BARREN and empty. After 40 hr into playing fed-ex simulator with 20% bugged missions which you cant even finish, world has build several stations. But that is it. Nothing ever happens in this ""game"". XR had that feeling of living world. This feels more like X2 with empty space and 10 ships per tile.

 Lacks proper commands in the UI interface. Lacks proper tutorials.IT EVEN LACKS ANY MANUAL OR WIKI PAGE. After 40 hr into game and looking into forums I still can't create fleet or even single wing, except for my own personal squad. 

It lacks content(except for extensive station editor). Even more, each station, despite possibility of being unique and beautifull, is absolutely copy-paste. 0 effort whatsoever. It does not have even exact amount of ships form XRebirth. Not to mention X3TC. And from half amount of classes, you get half ships per class for NOT all races. Some races does not simply manufacture ships. For some ridiculous reasons. ORRRRRRRRRRR maybe they don't exist in this part of universe. That's it.
Conctent has been cut like to 10% of previous games. AAAAAAANDDDDDD don't expect any guns. You have 5 types of guns with no variation. Nothing. Not even for CAP ships. Which there is ONLY carrier. No heavy ships. Still it does not matter- because there is nothing going on in this universe - its static.

There is not even a plot in this game. Not even side missions have any plot. Its a scam on par with fallout 76.----

I ordered collectors edition and you know what? We were lied to. I feel cheated. And enraged. This game has NOTHING except for better unit managment. NOTHING ELSE. Its downgrade from previous game in  90 % possible ways. Game deserves the $hit$torm going on. Shame on company. It delivered early acces game and charged us full price. 

DON'T BUY IT UNTILL 2020 WHEN IT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE FIXED. 
just like XR it going to be good after 3 yars of additional work.
It feels like this game was put together in 18 months. With minimum budget. CEO took all the cash and screwed production. Nothing will ever produce anything in space like X series, and i still support poor people working in there. Final product will be worth the money. 

But for now -its a scam. Dont buy it for expensive experience.There won't be any.
 I won't even rate this game. There is nothing to rate.I go back to playing Terran Conflict. Untill they create game instead of selling alpha build. 

-----You can support devs in this titanic quest. But i do not recommend this ""program ""yet

How come that CDPR can create spectacular games with less experience than egosoft, which is present more than double time in gaming industry.

How come they learned nothing from previous disasters and even scandals revolving around other games. I cant understand how you can make alpha build in 5 years or maybe more. Corporate scam in par with behtesda.

If u really want to find out about half broken program, then visit egosoft forums. Steam review does not give justice to its current state.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Post patch 1.3
After patches and additional gameplay i can say that game is in acceptable state. Still lacks content, but jsut exploring possibilities of stations is enough tokeep player in game for now. But still it lacks polish and ""X-ish"" depth. 

DEFINITLY lacks in ship department and combat. I'ts not FREESPACE, but combat seems like tedious chore than actual fun activity.

In previous X series, attacking CAP ship with fighter was absolute doom. Here its a matter of 1 minuite to destroy 30Mln credit worth destroyer with 1 fighter. Its absolutely unballanced.

Also Cap ships seem to TRAGICALLY underperform. Slow, unwieldy, AAAAANDDD abolutely underpowered considering cost of ship compared to fighters. 2 fiighter squad is doom for big ship. They also travel absurdly slow.

My wiev changed from -10 to +3. This game can be grand and awesome, but for now:
it just works..............
--------------------------------------post 1.6
AI still is broken. Still lacks any REAL content. DLC is a species that was inherent in previous game. Devs are implementing new things...  and not fixing existing issues. 
This is a letdown. As i thought - it will be a good and polished game 2 years after release like X REBIRTH. I cannot even bother to write enough what is wrong in this game........ just not enough strenght.....
At this rate it seems like cut content sold to customer as DLC. EA level of screwing player.
I do not know what is wrong with devs. What seems like core of the sandbox space sim is interaction with living universe. In this one there is interaction with broken machine, that cannot be called AI. AAAAAAAND empty, static universe. Nothing happens in this game.

At this rate - its JUST ""meh"" category. Worth maybe 20-30$ and for SPLIT sake, DLC is a shenanigan cashgrab. Industry is just going to hell with ""monetization opportunities"".

I changed my mind from +3 to +5. It lacks soul of X series.",1543942825,1629659747,True,0,0,0.474036693572998047,0,True,False,False

This is a very difficult game for me to review. I truly believe this game has the potential to be the best space game out there, but right now it feels like an early access pipe dream. Sure, it provides Mount and Blade levels of freedom, but the world and Ai feel so dead in comparison. A game that has ships and stations that are larger than houses and cities feels more dead than the world of Kenshi. I think where X4 fails in comparison to Kenshi and Mount and Blade is in regards to its Ai. It's bad. I can live with bad character models, and I can even live with their bad flight paths, but I cant not live with how empty they are. Plus their bad character models add to how lifeless they all feel. I'm not recruiting a captain or an engineer but just a series of stars. This game also has the learning curve of a wall. You will have to watch hours of tutorials and play through the tutorials at least once to be able to function in this game. I can live with that due to the fact that space flight is amazing in this game. What I can not live with is how bad the UI is. If you plan on doing anything other than running a few ships you will spend most of your time managing your fleets through the UI that feels like it was ripped right out of excel. This game also seems to be at war with its sandbox nature. The new DLC's add more ships, but also more quests? Why? The quests in this game are bad and they are not the reason to play. Also, while they're talking about adding the ability to choose your species at the start, why was this not included in the base game? This game has some really awesome features and if you're a hardcore space fanboy, I would recommend giving it a shot, but this is not space Mount and Blade or Kenshi. It's a cool glitchy-sandbox that has the potential to be the best space game on the market, but only if they make some major changes that I'm afraid will never come.

CONS:

- Really bad UI. This game is complex, and you can do a lot. It just doesn't make your life easy in trying to find out how to do it though
- Unoptimized: I have a fairly decent PC but the game runs poorly, with inconsistent FPS. There are guides to increase FPS that I recommend you follow. I've read it's singlethreaded and doesn't take advantage of multi core architecture
- Graphics are meh
- Animations and character models are really poor

- Can fly just about anything
- Highways and super highways are much better implemented than they were in X:Rebirth - still can't build them though.
- Flight model is pretty good if you turn flight assist off allowing for some interesting B5 Starfury maneuvers (but is really bad if you leave flight assist on with absolutely no drift)
- Travel Mode speeds up getting around but without travel mode ships feel slow.
- Space Legs but nothing done with it.

Negatives - 
- Save times. 30 seconds to a minute to save is unacceptable. Even Paradox games that save just as many variables save far quicker and more reliably.
- Pathfinding is still broken with ships getting stuck inside station walls and asteroids.
- Main plotline is better in the new expansions but I found Boso Ta annoying and he still mostly serves as just an introduction to the research system which is also nothing to write home about. Research now requires resources though so it's more than just click and wait.
- Celestial bodies (outside of asteroids) are just part of the skybox and are not interactable. Do people live on these worlds? They don't seem to interact with the economy or the simulation at all outside of the new terraforming tasks.
- Stations feel pretty lifeless and sterile compared to X:Rebirth - Not enough windows and they don't feel lived in. I hate the way to get around the station is that awful teleporting elevator room and any place that may seem interesting is blocked off.
- Walking around stations is pointless with even less utility than the last game. Bars are such a let down when you actually manage to find one.
- Command rooms/cockpits are small even on capships and makes the ships feel tiny (the mod for X:Rebirth is way better if not way too big). Ships don't have other rooms or quarters. NPCs will just warp in from the mini elevator which really sucks.
- NPCs are lifeless and sparce; interactions are limited (they don't speak to each other any more if you even manage to find some standing together). Seriously, they may as well be robots or not exist.
- NPC design seems worse than X:Rebirth. Character models are somehow worse than the last games with people looking like they're made of grease or rubber.
- Stations and skyboxes seem more boring than in X:Rebirth (No inventive or unique sectors like Radiant Heaven, Devoid Clime, or Eclipse Clouds. Omicron Lyrae was just beautiful) - The Split DLC adds some nice stuff but it is still nowhere near as nice as it was in XR. As an aside, why aren't the XR sectors in this game? A wasted opportunity.
- Galaxy feels smaller and more lifeless - Many planets don't seem to rotate on their axis (Earth rotates but it is very slow). I can't actually tell if planets are real objects since ships are too slow to even get around to the other side of a planet. Civilian ships and factions are non existent. As an aside, not being able to build highways, super highways, gates, or accelerators makes me not want to even try to get too far away from everything. Add on the way that the X series uses the sector/gate map and doesn't add on a traditional galaxy map makes me question where and how far apart systems are or even if a sector is in one solar system or a different system.
- Menus! Menus! Menus! (seriously a step backwards compared to the crossbar in X:Rebirth)
- Giving orders is a pain (still a pain in COH) especially batch orders. Seriously, they need to hire a phone app uy or something as a lot of times I felt that doing simple actions required too many clicks that should be done with a simple click drag instead of right select a unit, right click, select an order, right click somewhere else. It's ridiculous.
- Balance seems off in the economy (especially with auto trading and auto mining). Trader mods like Tater Trade help if not completely make it pointless. There needs to be a good balance.
- Finding missions is a still a pain compared to X:Rebirth where missions will only spawn near the player. Seriously, add a sector job board.
- No VR support

Egosoft seems to have given up a lot in order to bring back the functionality that was available in the X3 expansions but it's a barely competent enough space game that lets you build your trade empire in first person and there's not really enough of those even if it does plenty worse than it's much maligned predecessor. I can't recommend this myself at this point when there are now more fleshed out Space games out there. The good news is that Egosoft tends to support their games long after release but they're going to have to do a lot to catch up to the new players in the genre. At this point it's been years since release and it's still slow going. I don't know if they can fix some of these negatives as a lot of the negatives are foundational issues like the xml save system.",1545744345,1629193905,False,0,0,0.406249970197677612,0,True,False,False

I think the Devs want you to discover everything, not just the universe, but what you can do in the game and how to do it.  

Very few hints along the way.  There is a tutorial.  Hints are given now and then.  But learning through play is a fun style for me.

This is more like Galactic Civ 3 than it is Elite Dangerous.  But you get to fly your own ship(s).

I like this game much more than Galactic Civ 3.

If you like ""Space"" empire building, trading, gathering resources, combat, and mission solving, this is a game for you.

Paid full price , have all the dlc, totally worth it.

I reported a bug and it was fix right a way. and i dont need to by a 'Whale' to get tecnigal support it was great.
X4 looks great and runs so well on my Nvidia 980TI. 1080p. ultra quality.
X4 runs relly great after day one patch.
the huge world is so alive and interesting thing happening.
i wish there whore more diversity in beginner missions. after that the games start to open up more.

the massive potential is still there. getting quests, making money, building stations and fleets and now finally being able to include your own corporate logos on your hardware and owning sectors and all the different factions, its a universe of possibility. 

but getting there is pretty much impossible.
i struggled to complete the first couple missions because the directions on doing this is just not clear. i'm supposed to be looking for a research terminal in the HQ which i finally got a docking bay built on. and its just not clearly labelled or a game breaking glitch is preventing me from interacting with it. just figuring out how to build sections on the space station was awful. 

the dev team needs to sit down with a noob who has never played an X game and watch how they cannot get anything done in this, then redesign the UI from the ground up.  and that's coming from a returning player. I didn't refund this title only because i still feel like i'm paying egosoft back for X3 which was excellent. Admittedly X3 also had a tough learning curve but at least the menus and way to accomplish things were consistent. that consistency is gone in this game. 

I'm sure i'll come back to this title again and give it another try and watch online tutorials all the way to figure these things out, but right now there are too many other titles to play which don't give this many headaches. i'd even gone back to skyrim which i also have 1000+ hours in rather than try to figure this stuff out.

Long explanation: 
The controls look like they have been made by someone who never seen other flight sim games. I'm enjoying Elite Dangerous with my HOTAS setup.
But couldn't get HOTAS (In ship) + Gamepad (Walking around) working together after trying for hours to understand all the key mapping. Very frustrating. 
Then I tried HOTAS + Keyboard and the tutorial got stuck at one of the first actions in the ship. 
All the instruction in the tutorial were for the mouse/keyboard rather than the HOTAS. 
Gave up in the end. Maybe I'll try again next year.

X4 is a sandbox space flight and economic sim.  You start with nothing in a crap ship, and then at some huge time sink later you have a fleet of mega destroyers, an entire economy of stations and trade ships and your could stomp any other race out of existence.

It is riddled with flaws and there are so many things you have to work around.  But it is being worked on constantly by there developer.  At time of writing this I am on version 4.1 beta 5 and the game is unrecognisable from launch.

I really wanted to love X4 (old x2/x3 fan). So much so I spent so much time trying to fix it and make it work I can sadly no longer return it...

 I am running an I9-10850K, 32 GB memory, Nvidia 3080, and an NVME drive. Yet still I can hit times where frame rates in the 10-30 range and pauses sometimes up to 30 seconds every time the game saves. And this is regardless of what settings I use or optimizations I make on my system. I have even gone as far is trying mods to remove fog and asteroids.., still I can enter an asteroid field and watch my FPS tank. And Considering how long this game has been out now I can probably assume these issues will not be improved. And yes this is all  after I have updated all the driver and X4 on my end to fix the nvidia bug that was causing the game to cash every 5 minutes on the 3080's.

Top all that off with menus that look they they used an excel spreadsheet for inspiration, the inability remap the left or right mouse button, NPC controlled ships  that fly around bouncing of objects like a moth on a light bulb (unless the game engine just gives up and in that case lets it fly right through the object like its not even there), and the almost non-existent description of how anything works it or even does..., Was really hoping this was going be a huge come back for the x series after the mess that was re-birth but unfortunately just feels like another half baked side project.

Update - 
Because I am a glutton for punishment I have continued to play regardless of the issues. I fully understand this is a CPU bound game and the substantial amount of live objects X tracts. But the reality is my 90% of my 1 year old water cooled I9-10850K is taking a nap while X is running. The 3080 is hardly stressed as well. But If I start a new game and see a drops from 120 to 25-30 in second contact when factions have not had time to deploy the 100's of ships stations that you see later in the game..., Well that's just bad coding and bugs. And Yes My PC is optimized for gaming, un-needed services disabled, minimal running apps, drivers and bios up to date over 20% free on the NVME, correct optimized memory profile applied in bios, yada, yada, yada. 

That being said, joining the 4.1 beta sems to have improved things a bit, but there is still room for improvement. FPS drops are much better, but I still can drop from 120 down into the 40-50's at times. Also does not seem to happen as often.

Wing formations and NPC pilot behavior is still a complete mess. Assuming my 5-star pilots ever actually get in formation when commanded (yes I removed all previous orders). I have found setting a destination in in empty space and using autopilot will almost keep them together as long as you don't move between systems. Even then still a crap shoot and sometimes half the fleet will not engage the travel drives on time or sometimes not at all. If I don't use autopilot it’s almost a guarantee I will show up the fight alone with the rest of the fleet lagging 75 km behind with their travel drives off. That being said watching an Asgard pilot drive that battle ship like a bulldozer though every asteroid in second contact rather than flying 20 km up to go over it.., Or listening to my ship computer constantly tell me autopilot ""epically failed"" (the fact it literally says ""epically failed"" tells you even the dev's know the pathing AI is a joke) as it bounces off an asteroid, another ship, a wing mate, or hell even a giant space station in the middle of open space with almost nothing else around it.., well that never gets old...I have found mods help. In particular one removing the travel drive charge delay. It at lease least allows the half of my fleet that never makes it to the destination because they had to stop for an ""emotional health break"" half way to the destination a better chance to catch up before the fight is over.

Don't get me wrong. I only rant because I know it can be improved and I want to see it improved. Well that yelling my idiot pilots to blow off steam only makes the wife look at me funny.

 I am enjoying X4 at this point even with all the issues. There just should not be so much work involved with enjoying it. Digging though forums and youtube to figure out how unexplained mechanics of the game work, hunting for mods to work around poor AI or design decisions, etc. You can have fun with X4.

They both are so bad so it feels like Egosoft trying to kill X game series. I've played hundreds hours in previuos generation of X series games (X3: Terran Conflict and X3: Albion Prelude) and after I tried X: Rebirth and X4: Foundations I found that each next game in series becames even worse and worse.

X4 advantages compare to X3 games:
+ Station building system is good improvement compare to X3 constructing system
+ Improved economics basics with big diversity of mining ships and goods types is good aswell
+ ...and here's all advantages compare to previous game series

Game disadvantages compare to X3 games:
- Game economic became way more ""flat"" compare to X3 games - when in X3 you has tens of goods types, race-based food and intermediate products and independend manufacturing stations for each high-tech equipment like shields and weapons, in X4 all what you have are few basic resources, medicine that replaced all race-based resources and shipyard that replaced all factories that in X3 produced shields and weapons
- Diversity of weapons looks like a bad joke compare to X3 (even if X3 has around the same number of weapon types - they are just looks way more uniquire compare to X4)
- Diversity of X3 ships that looked great and uniquie turned into bunch of ugly ships that looks like clones. In X4 all races was splitted into 2 sides, where ships of one of them has prefix Vanguard and has slightly better speed and weapon generator and ships of another one has prefix Sentinel and have slighly better defense and cargo space. All ""TLs"" in X4 looks like a clones independend of race that created them
- Continuing the previous paragraph - using capital ships in X4 is just a cringe show - they are so weak and dissapointing so I was unable to force myself to use them. Capital ships fights is just super disgusting show. In X3 capital ships was super dangerous compare to X4. Even if you was able to kill M2+ using M6 in X3, it was way more difficult compare to X4
- And yes, Egosoft failed to keep old ships classification that was very good and practicalin use
- Universe became super small compare to X3 games. That sensation even more improved with weird supermagistrals
- Terrible managment system based on map - super laggy, super uncomfortable compare to old one from X3
- Disgusting system with cockpit modes and cruise speed mode that was introduced in X: Rebirth. ffs, I just want classic X series SETA to return and cockpit modes system to be completely removed and forgotten in future game series (if they will exist after all Egosoft fails with X series)
- Modules improvement system - Egosoft tried to copy system of engineering emprovements from Elite Dangerous, but did it such badly, so I literally felt smell of shit when touched it

Other game disavdantages:
- Weird and completely useless ""space legs"" - seriuosly, it would be way better if Egosoft won't try to bring them into the game and better to focus on thing that was great in X3
- Super ugly NPCs, especially splits and humans. Even X: Rebirth and X3 NPCs looks way better than X4: Foundation NPCs
- After 3 years the game still have huge performance issies even on hardware twice or thrice better than maximum technical requimements

When I saw this and the mods that could be used with it (Star Wars) I thought I would really enjoy, but alas that wasn't the case.

The biggest and most glaring issue is the UI. As others have stated, it is atrocious and incredibly counter-intuitive. Inspired from an Excel document it takes a lot of work to just figure out what you are even looking at let alone where to find the information you need.

If you are using your mouse and keyboard (which it is designed for due to all the shortcuts) you will need to constantly enter commands and shortcuts in order to manage properly. Want to enter travel mode (warp)? Hit enter, use your mouse to select mode, then select travel mode. Oh, but selecting travel mode also disconnected your mouse move, so you need to hit Shift+N again to select mouse move. Want to dock with a ship/station? Left click station/ship, press f, select dock in the massive drop down menu, oh but you can't because you're in mouse move. So exit that menu, hit Shift+N, then do it all over again. Ok, now you have the docking waypoint activated, time to turn to the waypoint, oh right, re-select mouse move with Shift+N and now you can finally start to dock.

After doing the surprisingly confusing flight tutorials you can move into the game. On your HUD you have a ""1 new mission"" icon on your screen. Took me way too long to navigate the various Excel sheets to find where that mission actually is in order to activate it. Surprisingly the mission isn't in your personal information, like your logbook, but it is in your map screen (thank you Google). Also want to check what your ships cargo is? It isn't in the ship information when you hit enter, because cargo under ship information would make sense. It is also in fact in the map screen.

The AI and collision meshes are having some issues as well. My first mission was a patrol mission, came across 4 enemies near 4 different stations. 2 of those enemies panicked upon first shot, understandable, but then flew INTO the station model and were just trapped there bouncing around the inside. 2 of the first 4 enemies already glitched out. The autopilot has also had similar thoughts of self harm. Warping through an asteroid field, it slammed into one, bounced back and then just clipped through it as it attempted to go around.

The spacesuit controls are frustratingly bad. You also can't rebind them either, unlike most other options. Except the mouse, you can't rebind the left mouse to fire weapons, which is infuriating. The spacesuit uses WASD as usual but not as you would expect. A and D are usual, but W is up and S is down where X is forward and Z is reverse. I lost count of how many concussions my pilot had attempting to go forward or how many times I've fired my laser while attempting to go up.

The ship models and graphics are incredible! As is the sound, flying past a hulking ship and hearing the roar of it's engines is amazing! Or hearing the pings of weapons fire ricocheting around really makes you feel the environment. Sadly the UI, AI, glitches and clunky controls really takes away from an overall incredible game. I have almost 4 hours on record but half of that time is spent alt tabbing out watching YouTube tutorials or asking Google where my cargo went after I picked it up. I will be attempting to refund the game and maybe pick it up again if my masochistic side comes out to play or it gets updated/on sale.

The gameplay is very good and addicting, and I've been playing since X2. That being said, this game gets frustrating as soon as it really gets started.

The UX in this game is just a catastrophe, and has not really changed since X2. It is all build to be used with keyboard or controller, and needs to be completely thrown away. After a while you will have dozens of factories, but there is no overview telling you all important information. If you want to check if they have enough resources, you have to click through all of them individually from the galaxy map, three clicks each. If you want to have a fleet patrol a sector its 6 clicks and then three more clicks per ship being added. The list goes on.

Then, the AI is horrible. Trying to attack an enemy installation just results in you losing even if your force is overwhelming, because the AI doesn't automatically attack fighter squadrons being launched after the initial attack order has been given. Ships in a fleet need to be micro managed and don't behave smartly at all. There are mods you can get like mules that behave significantly smarter and better than the build in ones, but then again you have to give hundreds of ships the same order which takes around 18 clicks each. Alternatively, you group them in fleets but since all fleets subordinates orders update at the same frame as the fleet leaders, this grinds your game to a complete halt every couple seconds.

Finally, the bugs. So many bugs. The apologists here saying that Egosoft has always done this therefore its ok are wrong. If someone punches you in the face, you don't suddenly forgive them because they do it with everyone.. A game should be working three years after release, and if your team is only 20 people, then don't bite off more than you can chew.

The game is still so incredibly buggy and non-intuitive that it's confusing that so many people tell you to come back now. It's a mess. Game breaking at times, frustrating at others.

""Why don't you save more often then""? Because that takes very long and the autosaves it does do make zero sense.
Maybe they can improve the game within another year. Doubtful considering the game before this one was also trash.

- the very first tutorial gets completely stuck after 5 minutes, no matter how often you retry
- while buying new weapons, you have to constantly switch back and forth between the shop and the Encyclopaedia to compare the weapon characteristics and prices manually
- there are forward facing weapons which gimbal to help hitting targets, and other weapons don't; neither the shop nor the Encyclopaedia tell you, so you have to try out the weapon to find out whether it gimbals or not
- overall the loading times of savegames and the main menu are awful, worst of all games I own; and sometimes when you die, you need to go back to the main menu before you can load a save
- the story presentation is very weird at times (spoiler: you get an absolutely important mission to spy on another station. Then, through some weird chain of events, you end up owning said station. Neither the original other is bothered by this, nor does your quest-giver any longer care about what was going on on that station...wtf?)

What really bothers me, is that many of this issues could be fixed with minimal effort.

as others have said the interfaces in this game are pretty complicated to navigate, and the keybindings for some of the controls could use some ""gamer optimizations"" but once you figure it out the menus and screens and the what options become available depending on what units you are trying to issue commands to... it gets easier.",1626074838,1626178868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far so good. I do have to say that the ship battles are satisfying enough for me to have fun with it. I was expecting a pretty bad UI as so many players were complaining about it. I am okay with the UI, it's fairly simple, however improvements could definitely be made. But not quite as terrible as some people made it out to be.

I ran into a few bugs that caused me to restart the game several times. 
The first quest given can break if you accept another quest at the same time. So a good hint is to just complete the first quest, in which you are contracted to investigate an anomaly and have to explode a second ship next to a few asteroids, then continue with other missions to make money. Otherwise your points of interests won't be shown to you, or you'll miss vital information if a conversation is being interrupted. 
This is why people seem to be overwhelmed at the start of the game. Trying to learn the controls, functions and learning to pay attention to NPCs. There are a lot of functions X4 won't tell you, however this is imo the strength of the game. (If you really need help go online and search for = X4 ""your problem"" the community is pretty helpful) I think X4 would profit a lot from adding the entire conversations with NPCs into the quest log instead of just having a rough outline, since some vital information is generally hidden within the casual conversation with an NPC, that can't be repeated. 

X4 has a lot of convenience settings which aren't quite obvious at the start. For instance your ship will be automatically set to roll back to a default axis unless you turn it off in the settings. So I advise you to read through the settings carefully as they can make the game a much more enjoyable experience. Also take your time paying attention to what NPCs are telling you, 

NEVER SKIP: X4 is a simulation and if an NPC talks to you they generally mean business and will roast you in a heartbeat. There is not much hand holding. Easily put, it will feel like you have to earn the right to enjoy this game, however this makes it so much more satisfying when you get a grip. This is definitely a title for SPACE NERDS and ECONOMY GEEKS that want to run a space industry with a battle armada and control every sector. However don't be fooled, even after 10 hours of play time you may stooped to a level of humbleness where you'll say, ""Today I got to build a part of my space station, now let's learn how to assign alien boy Peepoo Peep Peep to an aircraft send them to mine a specific mineral in another sector deliver it to my main station, cause to broke to build a factory near the asteroid cluster and all this, without getting raided."" This game is ruthless learn to hit the save button. RIP

Also their map system is not intuitive. I believe they should represent the entire size of each cell instead of having them zoomed in with a fog of war. Fog of war is enough. It took me a little bit to even notice that the zones were actually bigger than I initially thought. I think representing the entire zone without the zoom function would be an improvement.

I can 100% recommend X4 if you got the patience to earn the right to enjoy the game, imagine KENSHI and ELITE DANGEROUS had a baby. This is X4.",1625367614,1626157859,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had great memories of the first two X games and after the disappointment of Rebirth I was hoping this installment would turn out better. It didn't. The game is needlessly confusing in its UX and UI, so much that it was the primary reason I gave up on it. More on my experience below.
If you end up deciding to giving it a try, be prepared to read a lot of forum and reddit posts, watch YT content which may or may not be already outdated. Even after a lot of research on how to do certain things in the game, I was left behind frustrated wondering if its bugged or if I just setup something incorrectly. And you will never know, as the game for sure won't tell you.

My experience:
The game quickly left me to do and pursue whatever I want, which is good if you know what your doing. A few intro missions would have been great to get you started as I felt really lost entering the game even after playing through the tutorials.

I tried to earn my first ship upgrades by hunting pirates, but that was generally not advisable, as the ones I found were way to powerful to handle. So I ended up babysitting stations to see if a low level criminal would come by that one could pick off easily. That quickly became boring as they didn't appear all that often. Mining it is. I read a few posts that this is a good starting point to get some cash and buy the first mining ship that generates some passive income for you. But the mining never worked out for me. I either misunderstood how it was working or my ship didn't handle it well. I never got to pick up a single ore.

Frustrated with the starting experience, I modified my save file to see if the later game would at least be enjoyable. With the cheated funds, I decided to build two mining vessels, build an energy farm and buy a trading vessel. The only thing that actually worked was the energy farm. It works and keeps on generating Energy cells. The two mining ships never mined a single node and just cruised around confused until parking themselves somewhere in the empty space. Same with the trading vessel which I tried to assign to the energy farm to trade off the goods produced. Again I read forum and reddit posts, watched YT videos on how to set it up, but nothing ever worked and there is no feedback on why that it.

It's such a shame as the game clearly has a lot going for it, but the lack of feedback and the straight up terrible UX was just to frustrating. Even after cheating in money to bypass some of the early grind, there was just nothing but frustration. I wanted to like the game, but it just seems foundationally flawed.",1625946087,1625946087,False,2,0,0.496479630470275879,0,True,False,False

I hit the thumbs up as the game is affordable and the steam workshop with access to mods make the overall experience more fun. Are mods cheats you might ask? Well in my humble opinion if you are playing solo then absolutely not. they can add aspects to the base game to make it easier - faster progress - or simply add eye candy. they can make your experience of the game less boring in reducing timegates to get something done and also they offer plenty of variations that can expand the replay value of the game. For example selecting a mod that throws you into a particular starting point as a trader or alter the game for higher difficulty war scenarios piracy etc.
For myself the base game is fine...it is what it is so it is not perfect.
It is in many respects more fun mining for crystals than say the endless torture of mining in Elite Dangerous where you just feel you have wasted hours for next to zero satisfaction. Here at least you can even with your simple starting ship go mine enough crystal to expand your credits level to a point where once you have access to better ships you can buy them. 
As with all the space games they all have something good but all too often a list as long as your arm of things that are just bad.
Overall I think No Mans Sky is still the best there is out there but often the endless storms and the asteroid fields that are so prevalent and dense that you see nothing in front of you are a bit of a distraction. 
Then we have Empyrion Galactic survival which has an unprecedented versatility when it comes to building things as a base and design your own ships etc. Only thing holding you back is your own imagination.
Everspace 2 is also interesting but the grind there is the high cost of everything and the endless grind of missions for limited returns.
So where does X4 Foundations fall into my feeling of Recommended? 
Well I mentioned the steam workshop and using mods so if you are a Purist and want to play the base game as is then it is still a decent experience for not too much expenditure of real cash to have access.
The game overall is fun but the need for constant pausing and searching forums and google to find out how to do many of the basic tasks at the outset are immersion breaking..Please note I do not say GAME BREAKING. 
In a nutshell be prepared to be irritated annoyed and possibly angered by the total lack of clarity in how to do anything. The number of hours needed to get to grips with how menus commands etc work or where to to find a menu to issue a command are so obtuse and often hidden behind layers of menus can be a ball breaker. You will need at least 20 hours of head bashing and web searches before you have the basics under control. That being said the game itself once you have worked out how things operate just exit and start a new game. Then the game comes alive as you can now play it and enjoy a level of immersion that was not possible on the first run.
Anyways...being addicted to sci fi and games of space exploration building and combat X4 seems to be a nice addition at a decent price point.

Started out as a Terran pilot with a wing man but stopped caring about the quest line once I unlocked access to the Terran shipyards. Ordered me a mid tier freighter and a few cheap fighters to guard it. Explored the galaxy looking for deals and eventually buying blueprints.

 See that game has spaceweed and decides hmm seems like a way to make a quick buck.Pick me a spot in neutral space and claimed it as my own and get to work on my growing operation. My slow freighters keep getting stopped when smuggling. Decide would be cheaper to build my own ships to smuggle it with and outrun the patrols so set up a small shipyard operation. Notice that the AI can and does order ships from my shipyards.

 Sees that the ships have a higher profit margin than spaceweed. Ok boys stop production on the drugs we going into a legit business. Invest all my money I have into expanding my shipyard operations. Keep improving my reputation with the factions over time and eventually neutral or better with everyone possible. Keep buying blueprints and licenses. Ship orders are rolling in and I decide might as well go big or go home. Build a shipbuilding all in one stop shop. Shipyards on top of shipyards with more shipyards. 

First orders in it start pouring in the moment I hire a ship trader. Something is wrong I can feel it but I can't put my fingers on it. First ships     start rolling out of the shipyards. Wait why are these ships I just built shooting at each other in my front yard. Oh no I am building ships for factions that hate each other. Oh well not my problem. Wait a minute they are flying back into my docks to repair and they are ordering more ships from my yards. Soon I am having a massive war in my front yard. Another faction starts to order ships that is hostile to the two factions that are already fighting. By this point I'm praying that my station isn't destroyed in the crossfire and there are wrecks of ships surrounding my base and more ships being built to add to the mess. I know I should stop building them but damn the money is pouring in. At this point the Xenon decide hmm lets raid which makes it a 4 way war in my front yard. I'm starting to get scared for my life.

Overall: 10 maniacally laughing Headbutts against a wall out of 4 Burritos - I fucking love this game dude

More Details: I have a love-hate relaionship with this game. I love it because it lets me do whatever the fuck I want and makes it always a living, breathing experience. I hate it because a lot of people say they know X3, X2 and so on and knows Egosoft can do better and I feel that in so many places. But regarding Egosoft, I know the life of a Game Dev is hard as fuck. So I give them props for keeping the Updates coming even though there has been bad reviews and some toxicity. That amount of mental fortitude? You gotta have that before you can even start writing your code. And not just code. Seriously there are some things that do make a lot of sense in this game and while it may be not perfect, it sure as hell doesn't feel like early access and I did play at least a hundred hours of it without even realizing that my time went away.

WITHOUT HOTAS. I mean I broke mine and this game feels amazing without a HOTAS cos you kinda have this EVE like feeling, especially in larger ships and in wee fighters you can SHIFT+Spacebar, grab your mouse and start dogfighting like it's Everspace. I love it. When I farm money, I can ALT+TAB and bingewatch some shit on YouTube or Netflix whilst idling on my ship in some station and generate money whilst my miners are busy mining. This money I then can reinvest in my mining operations or my stations to create even more money out of trade! IT'S INSANE! Or how Spiff would say it ""Completely and utterly balanced!""

Think about it though, when was the last time you had a truly complex game with controls that made you almost Ragequit? EVE? Elite:Dangerous? Seriously this is one step up the ladder and I love it for that. I wouldn't mind if Egosoft would make it easier for casuals but MANO O MANO do I LOOOOOOVE me some tough shit.

Yeah you can tell I took a liking to this one so I think in that case, the only downside that gets me to keep playing it sometimes is the long ass loading times. Look, I know it's a lot of data but optimization is a thing, right? And while we're at the topic, why do I have to wait 5 fucking minutes everytime it Autosaves? There are games with Autosave functions where you can keep playing dude! And I have this thing on an SSD installed, I mean, maybe I need to get an even faster one but holy shit dude!

Still not my favorite in the series due to the really weird decisions they made with ship designs and the weapons in general. While X:R was reviled by most because of the 'locked to one ship' mechanic, I actually prefer its ships to X4.

The Autopillok (autopilot) is still bad, but at least they've acknowledged it with an occasional ""Autopilot: Epicly Failed"" from the onboard computer after it rams you into a huge asteroid that should have been avoided or at least the ship taken out of travel mode.

Biggest complaint is one that could and should have been addressed by now since players have created mods for about every X: game so far except X4 (I think that perhaps the turret scripts can't be modded?) - Once you get into your coveted capital ship, or even a cruiser with a turret for that matter, save often. Because the stupid as shit AI will totally try to shoot a fighter that the turret has 0 chance of hitting because the target is on the other side of a huge, and soon to be very pissed off and no longer allied capital ship.

Those gripes aside, the station building is way better, along with the economy's depth and ways you can influence the wars in the game just by making the right station with the right goods in the right place.

TL;DR at the bottom!

What I like:
The sense of immersion this game gives is incredible. You sit in your captains chair and you can stand up, walk to the ladder to get on and off your ship and exit out onto the landing pad, walk up to the trade center and exhange goods. You can buy a ship and watch it fade into reality as it's being built. It's far better at immersion than other games where you teleport on and off your ship while being less complex than others in the genre with flying. 
You can hire pilots to mine and trade, fight and shuttle supplies around your bases. You can make a giant empire and claim sectors, waging wars. 

What I don't like:
The AI and the bugs. The AI makes all the amazing stuff I mention above tedious and at times impossible. I tried setting up a mining route, I had everything right, even set my mining ship up RIGHT infront of an asteroid for him to mine. He takes control and flies into open space doing nothing. The only answer I can find online is ""sometimes the AI does that.""
I've had ships get stuck inside of structures and asteroids, move extremely slowly for no reason, the AI take 5 minutes to dock when it's a straight on shot... the list goes on.

NOW I know the developers are a small team and what's here is incredibly immersive and so close to the exact game I've wanted for so long, there's so much I don't know and haven't seen yet, but the AI and bugs make the idea of that journey to seeing those cool new things just... not exciting and make me not want to play?

TL;DR I recommend this game to people who can suffer through the few bugs and bad AI. If you want a smooth bug free experience this is not for you. The immersion is here but at the cost of tedium and annoyance.",1625523716,1625523716,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having been originally put off by X3, but falling in love with it in the end, and completely skipping Rebirth because it went out of its way to be a different thing, I really had hope that this was their return and would come into its own, but it hasn't and I have strong doubts it ever will. The intro tutorials are still terrible for both veterans and newcomers. 

The intro mission is still a mess that you can only possibly progress through on accident or watching someone else on youtube, and it's still a coin toss whether or not it sends you straight into an entire fleet of enemy ships who will obliterate you instantaneously (which has absolutely nothing to do with the actual mission)

If you do manage to get through all of that, buy some new ships and hire some crew, you get the privilege of watching the AI not only crash you into asteroids and other ships on a regular basis, but will have to constantly revert to the last save because you clip inside of said asteroid and can't even manage to shoot your way out. 

What really gripes me about all of this is absolutely none of it has been addressed 2 DLC in. More content means nothing if it's still unplayable. I hope to one day be able to proudly say this game is worth playing and change this back to a positive review, but for now when I'm feeling the deep space sandbox itch, X3:AP heavily modded is the way to go. 



Original review:

Come on guys, we all knew what we were getting into. This is an X game. Egosoft is a small company who is dedicated to making this extremely complex series. As such, it's never quite ready at release, and once it's polished, it can still be a huge chore to get the hang of. 

This one's no different, except that it's the most epic X game so far. I have no idea what I'm doing all over again... I spawned in a messed around with a few of the tutorials, which are far more in depth than in previous games, but still a bit flawed, given that the text can be impossible to read at times and there is no voice over. After I got my HOTAS set up and basic flight controls figured out, I gave up on the tutorials and just started winging it. 

I scanned down some static I picked up outside the station I was at and stumbled into my first mission, which sent me to hunt down some sort of wormhole. Now I'm supposed to set up a satellite there but have been diverted by scanning for different stations and outmaneuvering all the pirate fleets roaming around since I can't actually find where to get satellites. I could have sworn the mission giver said they were giving me a waypoint, but I'm not seeing it. This is a fairly typical type of frustrating moment I've gotten used to from the previous games, but once you figure out what you're doing, they aren't quite like anything else. I'm still having a blast exploring the system because it's absolutely HUGE! The stations are also huge, but fairly empty, but I only HAD to walk around on one to pick up an item for that mission I brought up, and the moving sidewalks make it quick to navigate. 

I may update my first impression into a proper review once I really get some time into it, but if you haven't played any of these games before, any extra info probably won't be relevant to you. If you are new to this series, you will be lost, confused, and angry until you either never look back or get so sucked in you wonder where these games were your whole life.",1543622407,1625513753,False,0,0,0.545996010303497314,0,True,False,False

While it is not, and never will be the X3 we all remember, I think I can finally say that in it's own right, for what the game is trying to do and accomplish, that X4 is a good game. It's fun and it works, and design decisions have been reworked where necessary in order to make a game that makes sense. Performance is greatly improved, and a great multitude of bugs have been eliminated. And the devs are still improving and adding on to this game. What started as a raw gemstone has finally been cut and polished. If you are a fan of the space-sim genre, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

X3 has a lot more ships, the ships have identity. The stations have identity. X4 blurred everything into the same-ish spiky category. One-two exceptions of designs I like such as the Nova, but it still makes the rest feel very underwhelming.

Models. I hate what spacelegs did to the space game industry. All stations feel mostly the same inside, all cockpits are the same. Character models feel like they are from X2, honestly visually they are a downgrade from the X3 series. So is the voice acting. Why are aliens all naked!

Clipping. The main highway just has random asteroids clipping through it and you fly through them without an issue, it really kills my immersion. I made sure to buy this game only years after it came out hoping these issues are fixed. I was wrong

Despite being told by many that X4 is an entirely different game than Elite, I decided to grab it on sale. I’m so glad I did! I’m absolutely loving X4, my first real deep-dive into the X Universe.

I’ve been playing X4 very much like I used to play Elite – from the cockpit. I was able to adjust various settings and controls to get my X4 ships to fly very similar to my Elite ships, making it easy for me to transition from one game to the other. In fact, I’m actually finding ship-to-ship combat more enjoyable in X4 as I learn the nuances of the flight model. I fly using a PS4 controller.

Right now my fleet is humble. I’m not trying to take over the universe, but rather I’m just helping my allies. I have a single station (not counting the “gift” station) to help slowly build my credit balance, a single destroyer, a few gunboats, multiple small fighters, and some traders and miners. I’ve set up my base of operation in the sector of Antigone Memorial, but I’ve recently been enforcing a blockade on one of the jump gates in The Void, as the evil Xenons have been recently pushing into allied territory.

While I love flying my own ships, it sure is nice having an NPC crew that can take over and do some of the more mundane work. The NPCs may not be that pretty, but they sure do add to the immersion of the game. The same applies to X4’s “space legs”, which I thoroughly enjoy.

Like Elite, I love customizing ships for specific roles, and I’ve come up with some really nice builds. Some ships are heavy-hitters, designed to take on capital ships, while others are designed to infiltrate behind enemy lines. There are a nice variety of weapon types, each with their own pros and cons, with the ability to mix and match to make for some unique configurations.

Graphics-wise, I’m actually impressed with X4. I changed the settings to dial down the saturation to make X4 look more realistic and less cartoon-like. Granted, X4 is no Star Citizen, but that’s okay because I’m able to maintain 60 fps even during huge battles!

The galaxy in X4 took a little while to get used to. The map is weird – like something out of Wandavision. Once you realize that the hexagon sectors are abstract representations of the space around jump gates located in specific star systems in our galaxy, then it’s a little easier to understand. Space itself does make sense. There is no FTL travel in X4 except via ship-sized “stargates” and mass accelerators, which means space stations and ship traffic will of course be located in proximity to these gates. However, there is nothing stopping you from picking a direction and just flying forever if you want. In fact, you’ll sometimes find stuff “out there” past the borders of the map.

Unlike Elite, X4 is purely a space game, as there is no landing on planets. There are planets, but they are just background props (though they to rotate). Some gates are located further from a planet, others are right above the atmosphere, giving a grand vista of the planet below. Other gates are located in nebula and other beautiful regions of space. While space isn’t as realistic as Elite, it does feel like “real” space, not some No Man’s Sky fantasy version of space.

I also recently discovered that X4 has some decent lore attached to it. There are books like Farnham’s Legend that give a really good background to the X Universe for those like me who haven’t played the previous games. I enjoyed the book, which in turn has helped me better enjoy and understand the game.

As for actual gameplay, it’s basically a sandbox, but there are story-driven “quests” you can partake in, especially if you get the DLC. As a sandbox, there are many ways you can play the game. Right now I’m focusing on building defenses for my beloved home system. While raiders do sometimes stir trouble, it was the incursion of the Xenon in the neighboring sector that really caused the hairs to stand up on my neck. I just happened to be in that sector when I noticed some Xenon activity. This in itself isn’t unusual, as Xenon are always sending in a raider or two, but in this case something was different. I waited around and observed the Xenon assembling an entire fleet! Once their fleet gathered at the gate of their origin, they then started making their way across the system. There were two other gates they could chose from, so it was a 50/50 chance that they would invade my home system. Thankfully they went the other direction, but I knew then it would only be a matter of time before a full-sized Xenon invasion fleet would be knocking on my door!

As for size and scope, I’ve been concentrating my focus on just a few sectors, but there are literally dozens of sectors, each with their own story, economy, government, races, etc. I do like exploring, which is different than a game like Elite, but still very enjoyable. There are wrecks which you can EVA to and explore for engineering components, along with the occasional abandoned functioning ship that you can claim for yourself! There are these data vaults that you can unlock to reveal loot and lore. There are strange and wondrous sights to be seen. There are alliances to be made and new enemies to avoid or infiltrate. I made an alliance with the adorable Teladi, a lizard race obsessed with making profit (like the Ferengi from Star Trek). They have a system bordering Xenon space, and when the Xenon attacked with a massive fleet, I was there to help.

Speaking of massive fleets, this is where X4 just blows me away. In my battle alongside the Teladi, I was in command of a single destroyer along with a couple of support ships. The Teladi had literally dozens of capital ships of their own, but the Xenon had a massive battleship. For part of the battle, I piloted my destroyer, firing the main guns from maximum range, outside of the range of the Xenon’s deadly weapons. When waves of Xenon fighters started swarming my battleship, I literally ran down to the flight deck to board my heavy fighter so I could go toe-to-toe with these toasters. The sense of scale was breathtaking, being on that flight deck with enemy fighters strafing overhead, my own turret cannons filling the sky with tracers, while in the background a multiple capital ships exchanged heavy fire. It was like the opening scene to Revenge Of The Sith. To then climb the ladder of my fighter and join the dogfights taking place amid these capital ships, it was epic! And unlike Elite, everything is destructible in X4 (except the jump gates) – capital ships and even space stations can be destroyed with enough firepower.

Anyway, I think you get the point. Is this game perfect? Far from it! I’ve encountered some bugs, and the UI is not only hard to learn, but even when you master it, it often gets in the way. Thankfully with how I personally play X4, it doesn’t require that I do everything from the map view. If you go into X4 with the intention of playing it like Stellaris, well let’s just say you should read someone else’s review. X4 is also missing some things that would have really added to the strategy side of the game. For example, ships have infinite fuel and power. This removes a huge part of typical warfare – the targeting of supply lines. I guess all ships in X4 run the equivalent of today’s submarine nuclear power plant. This is just one area that could be improved, but I’m running out of words for this review.

All in all, X4 as been amazing fun for me, someone coming from a space game like Elite Dangerous, where I’m the pilot flying my little fleet of ships and making a small but notable difference in the galaxy. If what I’ve described sounds like fun to you, then I highly recommend giving X4 a go!

I guess first off, this game is actually a pretty bare bones RTS. Thats not terribly obvious at first. Flying the ships yourself is cool, but its also mostly a novelty. Most of your time is spent in the map screen. 

The UI is indeed awful. At first, I thought it was ok. But nothing is where you need it. You have to click ships and then click info. Several tabs for info that shouldve been on one tab. The UI never backs out as expected. Have to hit escape twice to leave the map. It might leave a subscreen and go back to the previous one. It might back out to your character, leaving you to open the map, zoom out, and go back to where you were looking. Opening the map gives you a super zoomed in view you never use. If you want to see the resources a sector has, you click the main info tab, But if you were in any type of sub menu, you have to click the main info and then click the sub info tab. Thats so dumb. SO many uncalled for clicks. The more you play, the more you realize its crap. 

You have to be careful of outdated info. A lot of time is spent figuring out things you shouldnt have to figure out. The devs could take a few hours and write up some simple explanations of how things work, but no. I tend to play games blind, and thats a huge mistake with this one as so damn little is explained in game. I have no idea why they didnt. I played an entire hundred hour game without realizing there was a craftable item to accelerate time. And as far as I know, the option to craft it doesnt appear until you loot the parts. Maybe I missed something, If i did, others will too. 

Its overwhelming at first, but its actually a really simple game. Get enough money to get mining ships (or trading), let time pass and get money. Buy blueprints, make factories, sell stuff. Then either sit back and watch the money roll in or dominate the universe. Super bare bones for an RTS. 

The combat is pretty bad in first person. I just let the AI do it. And i typically love space sims. A lot of times handfuls of enemy ships just randomly home in on your miners. Good luck finding where theyre coming from. Sometimes you can, sometimes you cant. There are so many little irritations. You spend most of your time in the map screen, but neither the communication you get when a ship is under attack nor what passes for a log will pop up in the map. And it goes away fast, leaving you to try and click on your owned ships tabs to see the tiny little red marker that also goes away fast. There are some options to somewhat negate this, but its just terrible design. Even in mid game you can be managing dozens of ships. You cant rely on AI of friendly factions to protect their own systems. The AI of this game overall is terrible, especially the friendly. You end up building tons of military ships just to protect even small mining operations, because if youre widespread and unlucky you will constantly be chipped at by handfuls of enemies. And most of the time I could not find where they were coming from no matter how hard I tried. I began to suspect theyre just teleporting in. 

The premise and overall execution isnt that bad. There is charm in walking around the bridge of your ships watching battles and seeing your empire grow. Its not a hard pass, but the awful ui and the refusal by the devs to explain fairly basic concepts in game hurts. Also, it being such a shallow RTS once you figure it all out outweighs the novelty of being able to fly the sips yourself. Just seems like they couldve done so much more with this game.",1625077863,1625079126,False,6,1,0.55189216136932373,1,True,False,False

Unfortunately, there is a steep learning curve, followed by struggling against the AIs of your own ships, followed by meeting massive enemy destroyers and battleships that can turn the largest ships you can buy into slag before your alert goes off. 

The UI is the biggest problem. If I could at least see the game's sectors clearly and play it as if it were a strategy game, I don't feel that I would be as bothered by the massive losses. The UI makes managing the economy an absolute chore. 

That said, I still like flying the ships, shopping for them, using mining fleets, and doing some mission types (although some are borderline impossible for no reason). The problem is, that development effort is being put into expansion packs that don't fix any of the underlying problems of the game. This makes me unwilling to pay for their expansions, as I can't even complete the existing content without losing tens of millions every time a Xenon Battleship blinks. These loses to random attacks are unavoidable, since the various factions in the game get overrun by Xenon quite easily, and once a superhighway node is lost, enemy ships can show up with no warning. 

Maybe it's just me but I don't really want to have to constantly micro every single ship with the game's awful UI. The AI gives me no choice.  

In summary, an improved UI, with slightly better AIs, would easily put this game up with the likes of Elite:Dangerous in sales. That said, it would be best to start from scratch with X5, that could take the existing graphics and ship gameplay, and only focus on improving the strategy game elements by taking cues from successful games like Sins of a Solar Empire, and Paradox's 4X games.

- There is no ending neither.
- Thousands of buttons, options and interfaces here for you with no documentation or manuals. You gonna google, read forums and Reddit a lot to figure out how to make it work.

I was disappointed with the 4.10 patch. I don't know what it is with Egosoft and ugly NPCs. X Rebirth had em, oh boy did they have them. Who could forget the grannies running all over. Thank goodness for the modding community. 
In X Foundations, they have continued their tradition of ugly NPCs. The male NPCs were kinda bad this time.  Try to find any pictures or videos showing the faces of the NPCs.  there's not many because its not something you want to show. Try to find them for yourself and you will see I'm telling the truth. Hard to find. 
Now I will say they have made  improvements with the NPC's, over Rebirth, but when 4.10 beta came along, they ruined the look of the better looking NPCs. So in balance, some, but not much improvement there.
What I like about games such as these are the immersive quality about them. The visuals and such. Otherwise, we would be playing board games, right? 
Now, 4.10  is only a beta patch, and I don't think it would be fair to base my opinion on a beta patch, but something to watch for as they continue developing the game, I hope it comes out much better and the work  done on the NPCs is only placeholder until the final version comes along. 
Gameplay is good though, and they continue making progress there. I love the open ended play. I've played all of the X games to date, and love them. But rebirth was a little disappointing. 
Foundations isn't done, so maybe later Ill be more positive.

The good:
+ The graphics in space are nice.
+ The soundtrack is pretty immersive.
+ Building a huge fleet and setting it loose is as fun as it's always been.
+ Building multiple stations across multiple sectors makes a lot more sense than it used to, which also makes it more immersive. Without universal jump drives and automated universe traders, local economy bubbles are much more important.
+  The story (especially in Cradle of Humanity) is generous with rewards so you can skip a bit of the tedious early game grind. Also, at the end of each story arc, you do something that can change the ingame political situation, which you can use to your economic advantage.
+ Ship controls are better than they used to be. Boost drives on all ships are a welcome addition that really expands what you can achieve with smaller ships.
+ It's nice how you can jump anywhere in the universe and it almost instantly loads in with no intermediate screens.
+ Being able to walk around stations and ship bridges really gives you a sense of scale which is satisfying.

The bad:
- Ship AI is very janky. For example, when I order my capital ships to attack enemy capital ships, there's a high likelihood they won't properly align so that they can fire their main guns. I've also seen fighter squadrons doing pointless loop-arounds while being shot at and not even attempting to shoot back. In this regard, previous games were better. Some ships would get stuck waiting for their 100m/s drones to come to them from other sectors, rendering them useless if a fleet needed them.
- SETA (speeding up time) is no longer available from the game start, but it's compensated for through travel drives. You can't run both travel drives and SETA at the same time, so traveling with your fleet via autopilot will take ages, and you're better off waiting in another ship with SETA while your fleet gets where you want. Painful.
- Out-of-sector combat simulations are, like in previous games, still lackluster. i.e. 30 fighters might take down a capital in real combat, as they can be hard to hit at high speeds, but the simulator seems to distribute damage roughly evenly between the two groups and mark the higher total DPS/HP group as the winner.
- You can clip into asteroids and stations, and it's a real pain to get out.
- Save and load times are extreme. I ran it on an M2 drive and loading would take more than 3 minutes, saving took at least 1 or 2.
- The menus are still as confusing as ever, but they do eventually make sense. Still, daunting to newcomers and could use some quality of life additions.

Other notes:
You might need mods to get the most out of faction interactions. In my first playthrough the Xenon were very passive and almost defeated without me doing anything. I downloaded mods that made factions more aggressive towards each other and increased their building rates, which really added to the whole universe-at-war thing.

Additionally, I highly recommend the VRO mod, which I used for a second playthrough. The endgame combat is a lot more varied and visually impressive using it.

I also recommend getting both Split Vendetta and Crade of Humanity, the extra sectors, story plots and ship variety were welcome additions.

This sandbox is seamless unless I save or the game stops to auto-save (which can be disabled). For example, you can walk into your ship, sit down, and be ready in a second to fly off. Then you can even sit in your ship coasting backwards to watch the people on the platform you just left until they're tiny (they'll still be doing the kinds of things they were doing when you were standing there with them). The detail level is quite high. You can even sit and watch factories working in minute detail. 

My first experience:
Run around the landing platforms. Enjoy that the NPCs aren't glued to the floor, and oh, they even run and oh, even change their pace! Stumble onto and be happily surprised by the moving sidewalk. Then laugh at NPCs looking ridiculous on said sidewalk. Take an elevator down to the big ships. Wow at the ships flying right over your head. Get in your ship. Fly out. Crash into things. Shoot things up and watch the space police and station defenses tear you up. Let's be honest, it's either that or be lost in the menus and tutorials for thirty minutes until the learning curve begins to wear off. I'm just glad I have the freedom to skip the tutorial stage rather than how some games make you wait until a story element is over so that you can finally do something simple like jump.

Post-Tutorial comments:
Cons:
Ship designs are sometimes odd for my tastes and though you can customize ships with different skins. You can earn new paint jobs that are more impressive but it's hard to find good ones and there are lots of bad ones. The voice-acting sounds exactly like it was done in a tin-can sometimes, and when it doesn't, it just sounds mediocre to terrible. Missions are repetitive but there is a lot of variety now. The story missions are nice.

Pros:
SPACESHIP!
-I love that ships have moving parts, like engines or wings that move as the ship does.
-You can change the decal (company logo) on your ship.
-Docking is so much more fun now than even X3.
-Spaceports are busy and interesting. Except when they're not busy. 
-You can get shanghai-ed by friendly ships that you visit. Hitchhiking allowed. Bring towel.
-You can dock on any friendly ship with a docking bay.

Universe:
-It's HUGE. And no loading screens but space zones are hexes connected by gates (like Evochron sorta, except in Evochron you can choose not to use the gates because all space is connected. X4 space is in hexes that do not extend into one another.)!
-The space-highway idea from XR has evolved into a matchbox car race track (and I must say its extremely fun to tour the neighborhood that way, especially at first). 
-Reputation advances through promotions at certain steps and feels like a significant moment and is in character.
-Combat radio chatter is funny. I like it.

[As of 3.0] I'm really enjoying the Split expansion and many quality of life improvements. Fleet controls still need improvements. Loving the visuals and level of detail put into them. The Split ships are a must have add--on. Awesome, Egosoft! I may have to edit this review but I'm busy playing.",1543649263,1623928407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do recommend to those people that are either familiar with Egosoft game development and thus patient, or those that do have patience and want to see how the game will really unfold over the next few years ( yes, years  Egosoft track record is about 5-6 years per X game after release except X:BtF, and X4, I suspect, may be even longer in development)
Those familiar with Egosoft games know it takes a while for their games to ""mature"".  
Those unfamiliar with Egosoft games -- well 4.1 is more like 0.4.1 and Egosoft does game development their own way.  So some issues will get addressed right away, others will linger until they find a fix or totally redesign parts of the game.
I do not recommend it to people with no patience, like to finish games in a short amount of time, or like to say 'I beat it in only XX hours'.  X Series gamers have invested ALLOT of hours/days/years into every one ( or at least most of them) of the titles in series.  The games are really not overly complex ( the economy for example is pretty simple and straight forward).  It gets complex more in the players approach to the game and how you have to change that as you progress.

No, the game does NOT hold your hand, at all.  You're tossed into the deep end of the pool, sink or swim (though the new tutorials are better than the old ones).  Not just in game play either but even setting up your system settings, you have to understand your system well to fine tune the settings.  Just FYI my GPU is only a Radeon RX 460 and I can still get 60FPS with 'most' things maxed out, except in a few conditions of gameplay.  There are some general suggestions all over the internet on settings that do help, google them. 

Mods - don't recommend most of them.  Too many of them are for people that can't play the game as-is (or nearly as-is as possible)  too many cheat mods and if you have to cheat, why even play.  I only use three: Signal Leak Hunter and Crystal Beacons because my old eyes have difficulty seeing them at times and the 3rd is Improved Spacesuit as it adds Mk2 and Mk3 repair laser, hand laser and Suitpack Mk 3 that are scaled well to fit the game performance wise and price.

I stopped playing because I was getting bored but after reading a book series called The Genesis Fleet it reminded me of X4 so I hopped back on and have been playing ever since! 

There are some bugs in the game like not being able to intereact with a character for a mission but that can be overlooked and justified in a role play scenario.

The Egosoft X series has been the standard for the 4x space sim genre for decades and X4:Foundations is a true return to form with a next generation rework. It took a couple of years and the release of X:Rebirth to get back to the golden formula, but this is it. Spend hours fighting pirates to protect your favorite faction? Check. Build massive economy breaking station complexes? Check. Stand on the flight deck of your monster carrier while you launch dozens of fighter to take the battles to the grandest scale? Check. 

If you like space flight sims with the most robust simulation economy on offer, this should not disappoint. However, I have a few caveats:

- This is a flight sim with a heavy economy, don't expect the game to hand you ships as you level up. YOU need to go earn the money and build your fleet. To be honest, one of the biggest flaws is the lack of a road map on how to do this. The game gives you tutorials on flight, outfitting your ships, crews, map usage, etc. but there seems to be a missed opportunity on how to tie this all together. Having played other games in the X series, I fell into the cycle like riding a bike. Newcomers might be a little lost with the massive scope of the game.

- This game is also highly sandbox-centric. There is a story but it must be teased out though data vaults and gaining reputation with the games many factions. Don't expect the story to drive your game play. It is a gigantic galactic sandbox, it lets you play the way you want. Hot shot pilot, Scale Plate Pirate, or Space Trucker, it is up to you, but know that credits are power in this universe. 

- Economy is King, to get far you will either have to claim abandoned ships and sell them or trade your way to the top. There are other paths but for new players these may be the best bet. If you stay in your starter ship, the world will begin to outpace you at some point especially if there is a large war going on in nearby sectors.

It's been a while now since its release, and I've acquired its DLC including the Terran expansion.  Whatever they did, it was a good thing.  Combat and ship AI actually seem rather competent now.  I see my ships flying in formation with me and having ships taxi me around is a lot less painful.  Ships quickly go through jump points and overall make good decisions when plotting courses (there are some exceptions... stay out of hazardous regions!).  Overall, the increase in AI competence has gone a long way to making this game fun again.  With these updates, I feel more excited to explore new systems, try out new ships and forge new alliances... or go to war with my enemies.

I've had some potentially save destroying bugs so far but nothing catastrophic yet. Recommend for those with lots of patience, having an engineering degree could help ;)

--

Okay so the old following review still stands when it comes to the extremely early phases of a player trying to setup HOTAS. This game should be played with a M&K. There's too much clicky clicky to really justify having the rig setup for this anyway and the controller systems (as well as many other portions) seem buggy still.

I will say though to comment on Bernd's comment to my review, the bigger ships sure are weightier and basically the entire game feels better with a M&K. I really think this is how you should play it.

Old review: (Bugs and horrible onboarding really had me tilted writing this.)

TLDR; Incredibly buggy start and gives the feeling of no-clipping through Counter-Strike maps, not flying a ship. If you're an avid flight gamer, you'll know what I mean. No bueno. Oh, and for $60 Canadian LUL.

Out of my 0.9 hrs, 0.6 of those were spent trying to get the menus to stop breaking while I tried to get my HOTAS figured out. That was one of the most infuriating attempt at setting up a game I've ever had, and I play flight sims and Warframe. Still less buggy than this onboarding process. Not to mention when I did finally get in I was getting a very weird purple mesh thing popping up as if the textures of the station were phasing in and out or something.

Sadly, to my absolute dismay, once I finally started flying around it felt weightless and really quite primitive as far as flight games go. Starlink on Switch has weightier flight than this. I'm using a Thrustmaster and Track-IR and really just didn't get the ""oo I'm in a ship"" vibe. It was really like I was no-clipping through space with a HUD plastered on.

It might be a fantastic management game but the incredible amount of bugs on start-up, pretty weak performance (I had to disable shadows completely for a 15fps boost, why no low option??), 3D artifact glitches, weak firing mechanic, and terrible flight immersion, not going to continue with this one.

Also, the targeting system makes no sense, I'd hate to see that in the middle of a huge fight. No crosshair priority when targeting with hotas? I have to use my mouse to target? Dafuq?",1564888951,1623378390,True,0,0,0.454999327659606934,0,True,False,False

I am almost 500 hours into the game, i just BARELY got finished settings up the PHQ
and with a reasonably large industrial power to back it up with materials.
I'm am in the process of building the 3rd main fleet that will consist of Argon only ships.

I haven't bought the CoH DLC yet and i just bought the Split Vendetta, which brought a ton
of new sectors to explore, reputations to build and plots to solve

The devs are constantly working on improving the game, and they pay huge attention
to player feedback on the forums.   I always say that X3TC is the best 4X game ever made,
and i stand by that, but X4 Foundations with or without DLC's is close second.

To wrap it up . Did you answer yes to any of the questions at the start of the review, buy X4.

I have to say I enjoyed the linear mission lines of the early series, and didn't spend too much time with X3. I thought Rebirth was fantastic. and never really understood the negativity. 
I suppose I expected more out of X4; it's graphically disappointing, though still an improvement. Flight control is also poor; it took hours to configure a Warthog Hotas to operate well enough. Flight assist off is good, but for some obscure reason the roll hasn't been included which throws me a bit.

Do you like space, strategy, and action? Building, designing, and managing? Do you want to build a towering commercial empire, or create a fleet to dominate the farthest reaches of the galaxy? With X4 Foundations, you can do it all! 
I love space games, and am a fan of the X series, so this game is right up my alley. But you don't have to be familiar with the series to learn and understand the controls. The universe is just the right size, where days into the game you'll still be finding new things, and you'll still feel at home in the galaxy. The dlcs are totally worth getting as they probably double the size of the galaxy and add a ton of new ships and stations to play with.
 You can fly every ship, save for a select few (Khaak and Xenon) so you never feel limited no matter what you want to fly. Even when you are in charge of a massive company, it's still fun to hop in a small fighter and get your hands dirty. Or don't! Stay in a carrier or destroyer and focus on commanding your fleet to a victory with minimal loss. Even customizing your ships to fit your play style is a satisfying part of this game. Choose the best engines for your ships, the right guns for the job, the strongest shields and so on.

Probably my absolute favorite aspect of this game is station building. It can be expensive to track down the right blueprints, hire builder ships, and amass the right materials, but its so worth it! The possibilities are endless because of the format in which you design and build your stations. Literally, endless customization. You might start with a solar power plant, come back to build on it later, and end up with an entire shipyard. You choose to put what modules where, set up your own defences, and build in your own unique style.

Do you prefer to make money and reputation without fighting? Me too. That's why this game offers such a balanced, simple but in depth trading system. Fly your own merchant ships to transport desirable goods, or have an AI pilot take care of business all on his own. This of course leads me to the only negative part of my review.
The AI pilots can be hard to control, almost seeming like lazy or unfit employees. That being said, for the most part they are great, particularly in combat. But sometimes auto traders and station traders just sit there, not making deals, and missing good trade opportunities. It would be really cool if you could tell traders to keep making simple runs, like: ""pickup energy cells at home station, move them to food station and trade for food, return to home station and deliver food and pickup energy cells. (REPEAT)"" And while you can give them a command list to keep repeating, I find they still sometimes just sit there, doing nothing. It would be better if it was like it was in X3 Reunion, where station merchants could be assigned to sell or buy one specific ware, and travel further to get the best prices. Don't get me wrong though, I love having traders working for me, and most of the time they work really well. Its just that it would be nice if we could give them a little more guidance when necessary.

PROS: 
-Space Mount and Blade - Literally as it sounds, dynamic economy adjustment, large scale battles, building your own empire etc.
-Space combat is pretty decent, mods add plenty of OOMF to this.
-Ok graphics for how complex the game is.
-Huge logistical part to the resource management in-game, everything must be sourced from the enivroment to create stations, ships, ammo, you name it.

CONS:
-Terrible UI; seriously who ever designed this UI needs to take hints from other 4X games/RTS games in general, my god. It's clunky and terrible.
-Default controls are terrible, I recommend looking up popular space flight controls from either ED or Star Citizen and rebinding respectively.
-Performance is kinda wack with save and load times being terrible, hopefully this improves but I can't see how my GPU should be running at 60 to 70C with graphics like these.

I am against all restrictions on free modification. Mods are what keep games alive,
not shitty devs.

The devs have replied, with a falsehood.
In the beginning of X4 there were mods to restore a more realistic racial balance to the human factions. (As of now it seems egosoft is predicting a near complete African takeover of humanity in the future)
This goes against ""wokeness"" even if the intent is not racism, but realism, and so egosoft removed the ability to mod the characters races en masse.

If anyone is interested in what the mod was, I believe it was called ""Galactic diversity"" or something like that. I believe it made all characters white, which is of course a no-go in current year. But for real, Egosoft doesn't at least think Asians will have a huge role in the future? Anyways, point is, doesn't matter.

So yeah, you put a restriction on modding. WHICH I NEVER SUPPORT. If I want to make X4 a game about space Nazis I will damn well do it. It's a huge part of what makes PC gaming great.

So okay. Long time X-game player here. They are developed by a very cerebral German studio lead by the same core team for about 20 years. They have expanded the lore of the universe with every new iteration of a new game. X4 is technically the 7th game in that series. The disclaimer here is that I JUST started my first game tonight. So this review will be for new players.

This one has been out for a few years and has seen massive improvements and major changes to the sandbox universe including some dlcs that add in massive new areas, new skips, new weapons. AT its core the X games are about starting from nothing then rising to become this enterprise capable of going to war with a major military faction. This would be the intended goal: amass a fleet and build massive space cities. However, its just about all unscripted. That means every ship does their own thing, every station's economy is dynamic to the system as a whole and deviations can branch out. My save after 1ooo hours will be dramatically different then yours because everything I do or so not do has impact on this sandbox. Areas I wont go to for 600 hours are still alive and simulated.

There is a main mission based off your starting choice. The game dynamically generates missions to you based off your playstyle and also what you seem to do a lot of. You can trade good between stations for profit like a standard space sim. You can mine. You can fight things, be a pirate, bounty hunter... decide to be a lone wolf and just drive a massive carrier filled with fighters and hunt down pirates or make a major mining fleet lead by a trio of heavily modified ships with some of the best crew. Kinda do whatever you like inside the environment!

Because its so vast, there's a LOT of complexity here. That translates to a crazy amount of information and extreme info. I want to say it like, the game is a mini OS and you need to learn it. Not like Elite Dangerous where you can learn all aspects of the game in about 6 hours then just grind to get bigger ships, I mean there's a crap ton here. This is not a fast game and even after hundreds and hundreds of hours of playing you can still keep on. I am sure you'll experience all the locations and do all the many activities but you still won't have that massive command ship you always wanted to go head to head with that 1 pirate faction that is pillaging your fav sectors.

There's bugs. EgoSoft has not stopped development on this at all, there will be more patches. The learning curve is steep (like a lot of reading to understand this game and watching videos to learn elements and even checking out die hard gamers explaining stuff). Learning the controls is a bit of a challenge. Learning the game is going to be difficult for most... but after this just wow. Again this is NOT casual, this is an actual living offline digital world.

It says V4.0 and there are bugs and stuff that shouldn´t even be in alpha.

The menu is extremley horrible. You basicly have to hit pause for every command you issue because you have to fight trough 20 menues. And if you loose focus of a menu then its gone. Try finding that ship again and go trough it all again.
And you have to do this for everything ! This alone is a thing that sucks so much that i can´t play anymore. The menu in XBFT or X-Tension were much better! Thats 20 years ago! And on top of that the fonts are tiny. I cranked up the zoomlevel of that but you still can´t hit the buttons right...

If you assign a ship to defend something it does all exept that! It lags sectors behind it and just waits for something wich is beyond me. This counts for nearly all commands. mining, defending, trade... exept Goto. This works somewhat reliable.

You can say the tutorial is basicly non existent or bugged.

The encyclopedia isn´t even half filled. There are items wich you want a basic description and not even thats there. You look stuff up and are better of just googling that. Then you google and there isn´t even infomation there exept for basicly the egosoft forums. There are more Early Access games with more info inside the game.

I bought it because i thought they would make a better X-Rebirth. But honestly it is worse than that.
And judging by the version number v4 i guess there won´t be essential updates and bugfixes in a loooong time if any.

I'm normally a fairly eloquent person, but in this case I'm lacking the words to describe how utterly, incomprehensibly, horrendously terrible absolutely every menu and every interaction in X 4 is implemented. Look, I get that this is a very complex game, but that's no excuse for delivering such a borderline unplayable UI. There's a lot of complex games out there that do a supreme job at being (mostly) simple and elegant to control without sacrificing depth. 

As of the time of writing I've spent almost an entire real-life day in this game without getting anything meaningful done. At least half of that time was spent browsing page after page of online guides because the game itself, even with its three tutorials, leaves about 95% of its crucial functions and features not only unexplained but completely unmentioned. I still don't know how to set up even the simplest production chain because I can't get my mining ships to deliver their resources to my factories instead of selling the stuff to some random dudes 15 systems away. I'm amazed at myself about having built a factory at all without dynamiting my rig out of frustration. Seriously, if someone set out to purposely design the worst user interface in gaming history, it couldn't turn out much worse than X 4's. And don't get me started on the mouse/keyboard controls.

It's not all bad of course. The game has amazing graphics, a great soundtrack, definitely the depth to live up to its sandboxy ""build your own space empire"" management game, and a few more perks that I would really love to enjoy more. Unfortunately, this hell-spawned armageddon of a user interface made me rage-quit for the first time in at least 15 years, and it did it so thoroughly that I feel no desire to give it another shot anytime soon. Yes, it's that bad. A shame, really. I had high hopes for the €90 I spent on the complete edition.

One last thing: X 4 is an insane resource hog. I ran it on an RTX3090, a Ryzen 9 3900X, 64GB RAM and SSD drives, but I still couldn't play it on max settings without it turning into a slideshow even indoors. The upper-mid tier settings I eventually settled on then gave every single cooler in my tower intense cardio training; at some point I even smelled some scorched electronics (nothing major so far, it seems, but still). That's a three-year old game almost frying a system that can handle the most demanding current-gen games without breaking a sweat.

I feel that there is a lot more to go for this series and I cant wait to see what else they can do with this. I feel expanding it further and getting more into ship development, stations development, and potentially adding some capabilities of creating your own faction (or adding politics into it a little allowing you to align with multiple people etc.) and Maybe branching into a multiplayer style with a dedicated server setup. Allowing for modded game servers for friends to play with etc. Also expanding the abilities you can do to get into the good graces of factions you have wronged. 

Downside, Consistent bugs with certain menus freezing at random points in the game, and certain functions not working as intended. Also the immediate halt of the economy if there is little commerce going on. AI seem to not make up for this as expected. While thats fine, It may behove them to create some sort of information display to show the overall economy and its current influence in certain regions.

It looks fantastic and will keep you planning stations and moving fleets in the back of your mind while you go about your regular day. While it is a massive time sink, and getting the AI to do anything is frustrating at times, the sheer amount of things that are possible in this game keeps me coming back for many, many hours. 

Things I like:
Lots to do- missions, pirates, building, exploring, fighting, the variety makes sure nothing gets too stale. I will sit down for a lengthy play session with a plan and end up completely off track and just as happy with what I was able to accomplish.
Sense of scale- from scout fighters to carriers and stations, you get to see it all at ""eye level."" It never gets old seeing/participating in fleet battles from all levels or lazily pulling into a trade station onboard one of your mining ships, it really is cool every time.
Economy- the true guts of the game, it feels so good to put all the pieces together and see the benefits flow. For me this is a slow and steady background process that happens while I am out doing other things. I love checking my credits after a couple of stations get put in place and realizing just how much they are making. Seeing the products your stations manufacture flowing into a wharf or shipyard and seeing ships come out is so gratifying.
Combat- very satisfying to me, although I realize most people may see it as simple. I lose hours just diving into hotspots all over the map. Whether it's a fleet battle with my destroyers/carriers or if I just want to mess around in a fighter, it all works really well in my opinion.

Things I don't like:
AI- the derpy things I see my ship captains do is occasionally rage inducing. I get the logic as to what the game code is telling them to do but it doesn't make me feel better after watching my ships get spaced when they really shouldn't.
Interface- the learning curve wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but almost everything I know about making things work in this game was learned by trial and error or a youtube video. After almost 400 hours I am sure there are more than a couple of menus or commands that I still haven't stumbled into yet. While it's great that I can do so many things, it's a LOT of clicking.

As mentioned above, I highly recommend this game. It has all the elements I've wanted in a space game since I was a kid. While there is some jankiness to it, overall the positives far outweigh the small headaches here and there.

The good:
 - The universe feels alive and populated.
 - There is a crazy amount of things you can do: trade, fight, build stations, setup satellites for map awareness, create a self sustaining mega city complex producing tons of goods constantly and lots more.
 - As of now there's an impressive amount of story content in the game. At launch it was very sandboxy with very little in the way of story but now it's packed and it really enriches the sandbox side too by giving you more of a reason to build out your assets.
 - The game is 1 step short of Star Citizen level seamless ship presence. You use ladders to get into the cockpit and if you stand on the hangar you can see outside which can lead to nice views of space battles in progress or just a pretty vista of ships flying overhead. It just needs full ship interiors to complete the package.
 - Visuals are good. Not great but good. Don't expect to be running any meaningful anti aliasing though cause you'll get no frames if you try.
 - Sound is also just good. It's not offensive but it's not satisfying like in Elite Dangerous either.
 - Travel is very refined. They took what they learned from X-Rebirth and really nailed it this time I feel.
 - Combat is fun but has a low skill cap since evasive manoeuvres aren't really a thing unless you're an AI that can aim in 1 direction and move in another.
 - Auto pilot is really good. A bit hard to make it behave sometimes but still.
 - Flying is fun. Feels good. But also sometimes doesn't. Momentum feels too intense and, especially on larger ships, it's a bit tedious.
 - Walking on stations. Not 100% with this one cause the movement controls suck but a net win. Really hoping FPS features are in the next iteration. In X-Rebirth station walking felt a bit tedious but for some reason it feels a lot better in X4 and is quite satisfying.
 - Mission time limits are almost non-existent. It's a very welcome change from previous titles. In my second save I found myself just accepting any station build missions knowing that eventually I'd be able to fulfil them in bulk for some easy buckeroonies.
 - Ship modding system is like Engineers in Elite: Dangerous but with the benefits of easier material gathering and save scumming to help you save on farming materials.

The bad:
 - Mission system is not as smooth as it could be which makes finding and managing missions a bit tedious.
 - Speed boost consumes shields. If you wanna get out of a fight quick then tough. You can't. There is nothing you can do. Especially with slower ships, if you are in combat, you are stuck and you either win or die. I had a particular epic battle in which it was me in a corvette and my capital ship against the entire Xenon armada and although it required many reloads, I eventually won. Felt frustrating at the time but in hind sight it was also the most cinematic experience I've had in a space game ever.
 - This game is fairly janky. I can give many examples. Opening a lockbox in space? It'll randomly explode and kill you. Hopefully you saved recently! Or how the speed gauge randomly stops updating and gets stuck on a particular number. Or how about visiting hostile space for a bit only to leave and then have their entire armada follow you. Still not sure if I brought about the apocalypse. I'll keep you posted. (edit: AI mopped them up eventually)
 - Saving times are so slow that it's a constant toss up of whether you want to be safe in case something goes wrong or you want to avoid the 20 seconds that the game is frozen for. Not an exaggeration.
 - Opening the map requires 1 button press but closing is at least 2. Couple that with the fact that pressing any of the buttons you can use to close the map too many times opens another menu so good luck quickly closing the map in an emergency. In fact, UI in general is still very janky. Better than X-Rebirth but still objectively speaking not user friendly. I suspect the developers know this and just didn't have or didn't make the time to fix it. Stuff like buttons that are really thin but long. Various things not being in the menu you'd expect them to be in.
 - Some bridges/cockpits are too cramped. Especially since the NPC captain/pilot takes over every time you get up and gets in your way constantly.
 - 50% of the time when you collide with something at speed you'll end up inside the mesh and then you have to work hard to get yourself out if it since the same collision bouncy physics applies on both sides. They should be able to fix this easily by not checking collisions from inside a model. Pretty bad issue and happens far too often.

Overall it's a fantastic game but there are issues. I wish the developers would polish it up since I really believe polish is all this game needs to be to take the top spot (and yes I do mean above Elite and Star Citizen).

Hopefully X5 will see the rebooted franchise iron out the gameplay issues and make the game more player friendly and more consistently enjoyable.

X4 is not perfect. There's room for improvement and bugs to be fixed (it's an Egosoft game, after all), but it's a game that grows on you and... one day you wake up and figures it's been at least week since you played anything else.

Nothing else needs to be said.

P.S. Yes... I rage-refunded X4 2 years ago and now I LOVE it. Kudos for Egosoft for fixing it... and for the great game it became.

P.S.2 My HOTAS works perfectly in the game now, but sometimes the mouse and keyboard works better in the quieter moments when you want precision when flying around stations.


*Older Review*
These are my impressions on what changed since the last time I've played it back in 2018. You can read about what the game is in the other reviews.

X4 Foundations is finally coming close to be the game I hoped it to be back at 2018 (old review below). The UI still can use a lot of improvement, but the new tutorials are much better and the game runs smoothly. It's as complex as X3 (or very close to that) now, the ships are as beautiful as the human NPCs are ugly and the flight and battle IA is good enough.  I still wasn't able to configure my HOTAS to work ingame, but the mouse and keyboard controls aren't that bad.

As a final note, since I bought the game again less than a week ago I wasn't able to play anything else. It is THAT good, despite it's flaws.



*Oldest Review*
It's one of the most promising space simulation games around. It's REALLY very promising, and I would love it if I was able to properly play it. But sadly the game is still too unpolished as of now (dec 03 2018, version 1.10). 

There are some good reviews listing the pros and cons of X4. And I believe in both of them. 

So I will simply list the issues that I had with this game, and that led me to refund it (with a heavy heart):

- Wasn't able to configure my Hotas-X to work with the game. It woudn't properly recognize the throttle, and is simply oblivious to the existance of the top directional cap.
- Once the Hotas didn't work, I tried to configure my XBOX360 joypad (c'mon! it's a industry stardard!) to be at least able to fly a ship. But either I couldnt figure out how to do it (which is bad, because I have more than 2k hours experience with space sims, and never had a hard time configuring controls) or, worse still, it's not really possible to do it.
- I tried to fly using the mouse and keyboard, then. And it's not really possible.

Want to just ride a ship you own while the AI flies you somewhere, like a personal taxi (perhaps, all the while managing your empire)? Go ahead. Or wander on to a strangers ship and take a ride to wherever they end up going. Want to fly a carrier able to launch 100 fighters? You can, and then hop off the controls of the carrier, run to the docking bay, hop in a fighter and fly off. Fight every battle yourself, or sit back and play RTS style, or do some of both with relative seamlessness. 

You can build a megafactory that churns out enough warships to blot out stars. Or trade enough to buy all the ships you like. You can capture sectors, police them strictly and name them whatever you like. You can wipe out any faction you like by taking part in wars or economically supporting one side against another. 

Want to have a ship that's better than anything else out there? Great! Get one, kit it out with your weapons, shields and engines of choice, and then modify it to make it faster, tougher or hit harder than anything else. There are so many ship variants that while there are inevitably going to be some ships that are flat out better than others, the balance in the game really shines. Even with mods, a ship can be markedly better without seeming blatantly OP. Some of the most powerful ships at the game take distinct effort to earn, and the most powerful weapons always come with sensible trade-offs (looking at you, main cannon on the Asgard).

Sure, there's reasons to gripe. The X series routinely falls short of its ambition in execution but really, there's nothing you can't work around in the end. The AI can be a little janky, but there are ways to compensate. The UI is complex (which, let's be real, it has to be because of how much you can do) but you can get used to it. Save/load times can get a little long if your universe gets densely populated, but otherwise transitions are nearly seamless (honestly, coming from other games in the X series, this still seems somewhat miraculous how you can teleport all over the place NBD) The VO is sometimes surprisingly off though recent expansions have done a lot better job. There's a lot you can do, and the tutorials don't adequately cover everything, so you've got to be up to figuring some things out or reading through keybindings to know how a few things work.

There's not a lot to be said about the story. Though an overarching story exists, you don't really interact with it. There's no real ""main plot"" to guide your experience, so you have to be willing to come up with your own motivations. There are decided pros and cons to being plunked in with relatively little fanfare or direction. Some may struggle to figure out what to do, though others may appreciate not having to have the game artificially punctuated by an arbitrary set of objectives that will always be smaller than what you can accomplish. The NPCs are mostly just set dressing, and only go a little why toward making the universe feel alive, although on the macro scale the universe feels very alive with stations being built and destroyed and sectors being conquered by NPC factions. 

You may not like it if you cannot tolerate a some jankiness here and there, or if you are not willing to deal with a complex UI (it's nowhere near as extreme as DF, but it might seem equally intimidating to some). But if you don't mind having to figure out how to do what you want, and can work around when things don't go off exactly as you planned, you'll be amazed at what you can create and how quickly the hours will vanish.",1621308322,1621308666,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is definitely a learning curve but I'd encourage first time players to just dive in and experience the universe, fly around and explore, get a feel for things before trying to figure everything out. It's an amazing experience and the universe in X4 is absolutely gorgeous, from ships to stations and space in general. The sense of scale from landing your tiny fighter on a capital ship's docking bay is amazing and large battles look straight out of space operas. 

Then there are the mods which take everything to the next level. Tons more beautiful (and powerful) ships, more aggressive war/economy simulation, they're all worth trying out.

That said, there's definitely a lot of quality of life features missing. Managing larger empires becomes very tedious and laggy. Ordering and creating fleets is clunky and highly micromanaging intensive for the best outcomes. The economy and trading mechanics can do some very strange things, get stuck or not be very efficient. Mods help but this is still an issue. Extremely buggy/repetitive/boring quests, in a game where quests really should be a secondary thing, they are necessary for storyline/HQ, seminars that you need to train your personnel, and mod parts for modding your ships. It's pretty lame to get a quest to build a factory for a faction, only to have them leave important parts out and never build them making it completely non-functional forever, or to deliver a trade ship only to see it start patrolling the sector rather than trading for that faction. I really wish quests fed into the war/economy sim but they seem to be completely disconnected. But these are relatively minor gripes in the scheme of things with a game that has a scope this big.

Overall, this game lays a solid space sim foundation with the mod-ability to tailor it to your taste. I'm equally excited for mod updates as I am about updates for the game, there is so much potential here!",1621012975,1621012975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Guys, it's somehow disappointing to see that almost 73% of negative reviews that claim themselves X series ""fans"" - are just about bugs.

tl:dr - Complaining about bugs in X series? You are not a X series fan. Every, EVERY single huge content game has bugs at early stage after full release. We are talking new generation games, from 2009 to now. 

Now.. the challenge of reading. Keep in mind that I won't go into nerd details that only matter after some 87hs playtime:

WARNING: Probably hard to read text. Continuing with this review you accept all the brain damage you can get and I will not be responsible of that.

I discovered X series from X2: The Threat, the amount of possibilities you can do in that game were absolutely HUGE considering the time when it was released, I just can't explain how many emotions I had when I first flew through a Jump Gate or docked into a station. I absolutely loved the dedication every race's story/ship design/space station design/etc. It felt so damn wholesome to discover every single sector in that game. At that moment, there were no space games with so much things to do, so much details, so much immersion to an actually futuristic first person/3D space simulator. 
That feeling was pretty much like your first Assasin's Creed as Altair or Kerbal Space Program of course, without mods, experience. 
Remember those max 4 turrets on max 4 sides on Mk1 ships? NOW painful controls? Hard to do trading, boring missions, difficult station manager? Try to remember those because I'm going to mention them later. 

As time passes I'd read a rumor that X3 is being developed.. Oh my... That were the worst game waiting time I ever had, was almost literally climbing the walls, I was never so anxious about release of any game (well, now I feel something similar for Cyberpunk but it's not the same because there's no any Cyberpunk series (PC) and I don't have any ""improvement"" expectations, I hope you know what I mean). 
If you can't follow me, here's an example that everyone loves (shame on you if you don't!): have you ever tried sweet cereals with milk? Awesome right? Then you discover that you can eat cereals with CHOCOLATE milk... That mouth orgasm... then you try Chocolate cereals with chocolate milk and melted nutella... right after you are in your way to the hospital but it was SO worth. Same thing I expected to be X3, but... no, it was so disappointing, is.. is that Argon One? Is that a Colosus or Mammoth? What's the difference? That's it? Why they are so plane? Why Nova is so ugly? Why pirate ships are so... normal? Why UI is so lame?
But yeah, the graphics... THE Graphics were a whole new level. 

Still, it was so empty and cold (yeah, the game was worth for me thanks to ""Story Line"" of Julian, if it was released without ""campaign"" I guess I wouldn't even bother on playing it too much). THEN after some time, we got our first ever Terran Conflict DLC, OH MAN THOSE SHIPS THOSE STATIONS OMFG I was happy AF because all those systems, ships, stations were JUSTRIGHT.jpg for ""Earth humans"" faction style, it felt so awesome I didn't even cared about any storyline, same goes for AP that came after 5, FIVE years later, keep this in mind. 

And of course, mods... the amount AND quality of mods that were out there at the moment AP came out were abysmal (remember, NO steam workshop, thanks to our mighty little broken hands and tons of guides we used to install mods). To the time everyone discovered STABLE and full of MODS and FEATURES version of X3, everyone forgot how it begun.........SAME as X Rebirth.
Sorry guys, but X Rebirth today is such immersive and a  whole new game that has so many things, more that X4 at the moment, and you know that it's truth. I don't care that you need to assign some guy to manage the turrets or to be engineer. Just take a look at those damn ship graphics, ship and station modules. The day X Rebirth was released it was worst than No Man's Sky or Windows Vista, I even liked more NMS back then (sorry). But, damn, today It's totally different game today also full of mods and much less gamebreaking bugs. 

So.. if you kept reading until now first, you are breathtaking! Second: As you have noticed, I terribly lack of diversity of words, can't do nothing about that, not sorry. 

My point was that if you are a truly fan of the game, you won't cry about bugs at early stage of the game, you shouldn't even consider them as a negative point, just report them to the devs and keep playing, they will be patched and you know it too. X4 has so much potential, YOU CAN BUILD OUR OWN GOD DAMN SPACE STATION USING MODULES, the trade system IS.SO.DAMN.EASY. Remember X2's trading? Game UI? Controls? Weapon limit?
You won't play X2 for a long time after you have played X4, maybe just as nostalgic 5-10hs but THAT'S IT, you will miss easy ship command from nav. map., universal-trader, station moduling, ship moduling, ship module modifications! There is so many things that are even missing in X3:AP. You simply can't play X3:AP now, even with thousand modded ships and stations. It's just feels so boring to do manually repeated stuff that are already implemented in X4 that was released just SEVEN MONTH ago. 
The game is far from perfect, boring pirates, Xenons, missing race's, story. But the gameplay is so simplified, give it a chance.

Now... why do you even bother to leave a review if it's about 2-4 bugs you had? Forgot how many bugs Mass Effect had at launch? And Oblivion? Skyrim? Fallout 3,4? X3, Rebirth? NMS? Half-Life 2? WoW? Total War: Rome 2? I can do this all day... where are all those games now? On your most important and top memory podium. I will not even bother to say why there was so many hate towards those games until they got patched/DLC'ed and/or modded. Yeah I know that they are not all space sims, but you got the idea.

I used this review for 2 objectives: to try my best at English and to share my opinion with X veterans and newcomers, hope you are okay.

1. Save and load times are way too long, and you will die frequently enough while learning the ropes that those long delays are soul crushing. I lost many hours of gameplay because saving is such a hassle.

2. Something you won't realize until you spend a lot of time googling how to do things, is that the AI is terrible at flying when your player character is around. Most of the time the advice for bad AI is ""be OOS (Out Of Sector) so that the simulated AI can take over for the live action version.  However, one of the things I love about the game is the ability to get that ""command form the bridge"" feeling. That's gone if I have to command remotely, or teleport between all my ships to fly them myself.

3. The UI/UX is awful. I actually put together a pretty good controller scheme with HOTAS and then Xbox controller for when walking around docks, but the trade interfaces and asset management is still extremely difficult and unintuitive, and requires far too much baby sitting.

I think these things could be addressed, and I hope they are. Because this should be my favourite game ever, but for now it's just not quite there

Now with over 1000 hrs in Elite and two accounts ( epic for free) I cannot complain.  I also have Star Citizen which is not great and I won't spend any real money on it. 

X4 has some things over ED. First your ships that your not actually using don't just sit in the hanger doing nothing.  They earn money for you that takes a lot of the grind out of a game like this. X4 is not intuitive or maybe I'm just a bit dense but you got to look things up and figure things out which is not all that bad.  The visuals are good the sound is  ok the AI interactions are better than ED or SC.  The flight model and moving through space is a bit easy and geared to mouse and KB but with some work (and it is work and frustrating until you get it right) you can make a hotas work.  This allows you to turn off some of the helpers for mouse and KB and make the flying a bit more realistic.  The EVA is very good too probably better than the other two.  

I'm still early in the game (yes 40 hrs is very early for this game) but I'm glad I got this I will still use ED waiting on the update but the two can go hand in hand for me with X4 being a bit deeper and interesting.

Finally I could do the tutorials...some how I keep doing things that break the tutorial so that it does not go on to the next step. When I finally managed to have a good enough of an understanding of the controls and flight mechanics I started my game. 
Only because I saw it on a video I knew how to find the story plot start. I did that.

This is the first time I've written a review for a game but I play all sorts from Elder Scrolls through to Elite, NMS, Space Engineers, Empyrion etc etc, 
and I have many 100s of hours of experience in each of those. ( what a wasted life eh? ) 

So to start with an odd statement: I find X4 totally amazing (and addictively so) while also being totally hateful at the same time. 

X4 has something to offer that none of the others in this genre have. That is it's a 3rd person Strategy game where you can become a 1st person player in any one of your strategic game pieces. 
You can remotely control fleets of 100s of ships and at any time jump into any one of those ships and pilot it yourself. 
That to me is almost my dream space game come true. 
The only thing that would make it even better as a concept would be to include surface action on planets but sadly that's still missing.

THE PROS.
X4 is a very addictive game! It's very hard to stop playing sometimes, you'll have a lot of late nights if you get into it!  
X4 has a very well implemented AI and an economic system that feels well balanced.
As mentioned it's a mainly a strategy game but at any time you can jump into any individual game piece in first person mode to affect outcome.
So if you're someone who likes to fight one to one space battles in a huge variety of ships with an equally huge array of weapons it's a great experience.
The flight model for the ships is almost (but not quite) as good as Elite (which I think holds the benchmark for space flight).
The graphics are more than adequate and also well implemented, the game works well on lower power GPUs.
Fairly decent story lines, some are quite deep,  but some are not clear how to proceed beyond a certain point.
Even 200 or 300 hrs into the game you will still feel like it's only just starting, which in my opinion is a really good thing.
The Freedom of movement and lack of constriction makes it very immersive.

So then, it says a lot that even the hateful UI is not enough to put one off playing. 

and on to THE CONS:
About that UI: (I almost resent calling it a ""user"" interface)...
It's really a lack of user interface and probably the worst UI of any currently popular Strategy (or any other) game for that matter. 
It almost feels as if Egosoft hate real life players and would rather the AI just played by itself!
The UI is thouroughly anachronistic it's probably never been changed in what seems to a long and evolved history of the game.
At this point I admit I came in late and started earlier this year when X4 was updated, but I now have more than 600 hours of play in the game so I feel I can comment with some experience behind me.
 
The interface you will struggle with consists entirely of many many many tiny, thin and fiddly right click menus which are awkward, easy to miss and far too slow to use.
In fact the UI is just that, an ugly mess and jumble of text menus with little or no design thought whatsoever put into them. 
It feels obvious to me that over time the menus have just been appended with more and more entries as the game developed.

Vertically aligned buttons in ridiculously wide menus are sometimes so wide that some buttons occupy 1/3rd of screen width just for that one function.
In other areas many options stuffed into menus require a whole line in the menu but only a tiny weeny little square on the side is actually clickable.
(At the very least, the title of a checkbox should be clickable, why force the user to aim at a little tiny square just a few pixels wide).

In other places drop down menus appear to join up with other parts of the UI and it gets quite confusing until you get used to it. 
(But really, why should we have to ""get used to it"" ).

Almost all interaction with the UI requires many multiples of clicks where, with some little thought, only one or two would have done the same job.
No drag and drop anywhere! Nowhere! Not implemented! Hey guys ... it's 2021 not 1990!  

Commanding fleets of ships to move around can sometimes take 100++ clicks. Seriously!!

Serial command queues are used to tell your NPCs what to do but they should be overridable so that immediate commands can be executed before behaviour reverts back to the queue. 
But no, you'll find yourself continually resetting your NPC commands or just avoiding certain situations so that you don't have to break the existing behaviour.

You'll end up with 100s of NPCs under your control, and many space stations but personel/NPC management is a nightmare maze of modal menus and lists that hide the map and don't allow any other action. 
Moving one of your many 100s of NPCs from one place to another should be a simple drag and drop operation but in X4 it can be 1/2 hour in a spreadsheet.

Station managment is a similar nightmare, for example, there's no way to iterate each station while in the modal management pages. Instead you can only manage one station at a time, continually reverting back to a map that doesn't restore you to the same place you left from. 

Leading on to the way the map (which is also a modal view that blocks out the space/pilots view) keeps resetting it's position to that of the player's location when all too often it should not have moved at all. 
Constant zooming in and out of the map becomes a way of life in X4 because previous zooms and locations are never restored correctly.

The Map is also very ugly too btw, it is opaque and should not need to be a model view that blocks out the pilots view. Why not have it pop up as part of the pilots hud where it would be most useful?  

And to top it all, the only official manual is an outdated Wiki. 

Seriously, this is only some of what will have you swearing and cursing at the game quite often. 

But somehow the game itself manages to overcome the indaquacies of the UI.

Overall QOL:
Mainly due to the UI the Quality Of Life in X4 is pretty low, but as mentioned before it somehow still manages to draw you into it.
You just have to finish that station, or even destroy another enemy station, build another ship, explore a bit more, etc there's always something else to do.  
But you will find that you as a player must do all the work because there will be no help at all from the game. 
A lack of a decent manual is a massive hinderance to the learning proccess. You will spend a lot of time searching the web for clues and info. 
There are many hidden but useful features that are only revealed by accident or by web search.
Oh ... and why do you get stuck in doorways? 
Save/Load takes far far too long! (It feels like an age sometimes)
Autosave always happens on takeoff!  Just as you've decided to do something the games autosaves and makes you wait for several minutes.
Controller Mapping should handle multi-button combinations such as  A+Left Arrow, X+RTrigger etc (as in Elite)
These are just random thoughts that came to mind as I write but there are more that you'll encounter yourself as a new player so be prepared to

There is a lot to the game and I keep finding new stuff. The UI is vastly improved and there are lots of little nice to have features throughout. I keep stumbling on things that I really like.

The tutorial is clunky and I've hit a few bugs where I can't progress (thankfully you can abort bits of the tutorial).

I feel a bit lost without an opening story to set the scene - I think a lot of people will, it took an hour to get into it and just start exploring and from then I found stuff to do.

This is definitely an X game and not a ""Rebirth"" game. I'm excited to see what comes once the patches start to flow and of course, this is Egosoft, the patches will come.

- You'll be able to replay this title countless times so the value for money is there.

- Every ship you see, you can fly!

- Space stations can be built however you want (you design them).

- Provides an interesting economic side to a space game.

- You're able to run your own faction.

- Lore is interesting.

- Developers fix bugs pretty quickly.

- Upcoming updates/DLC.

- NPCs could still do with some work to make the game feel more alive.

It's a brilliant concept with tons of detailed things to do. The complexity is what makes this a great game. It's like EVE Online, meets Elite Dangerous, meets Stellaris and so much more. I only wish it had some sort of limited co-op or something and it'd be truly amazing.

They need to focus on AI AI AI and they seem to have given up on improving the AI combat and the AI Faction strategies, which is where the game suffers. They can add more sectors and shinier ships all they want, if I were them my top three priorities would be:

1) Improve combat AI and make simulated combat more in line with actual combat results (for combat that occurs in unobserved sectors)

2) Run more simulations on how Faction AIs operate and interact, especially with massing fleets. The starting fleets in the game never seem to be rebuilt, especially the human factions. If they lose their fleet they tend to send 1 capital ship at a time to its death as it gets built, there is no strategic reinforcement or falling back to regroup or rebuild. This is frustrating because if a player is helping them they often will see their efforts wasted.

3) The simulation on stations could be deepened with more rooms and events. It would be interesting if you could attract NPC dignataries and business merchants to a station as it becomes more prosperous or secure.

The vanilla game's biggest weakness is the combat and generic weapon types, but thankfully we have excellent mods like VRO to return the games weapon and combat feel back to an X3 like behavior. After you have played vanilla for a bit, and understand the core game, I highly recommend checking out the VRO mod, variety and rebalance overhaul mod, it makes the game so much better in the pew pew department.

As far as trading, and overall management of ships, fleets and stations, this is where the game absolutely shines, and egosoft has done a tremendous job of fixing bugs and improving the AI. You can literally play the game through the map while standing on the bridge of one of your capital ships if you wish.

The sheer amount of tedium, repetative individual micromanagement... There is no fun at all to be had in this game after a certain point and I am now doubting there ever will be.

Picked X4 up again after Cradle of Humanity DLC.was added and some patches had been dropped. There has been a lot of changes, offering work-arounds to things that have bothered me immensly in the past - But I can not say for certain if these are included in the vanilla game or requires the CoH DLC - Terraforming plays a BIG part in reducing headaches.


My complaints about the UI being low quality remain, it's a very taxing experience to play this game in the endgame because it makes you jump through so many repetative hoops for things to function.

There's some bugs, but none I've encountered as of yet which can not be worked around - The memory leaking has gotten a bit worse and prolonged sessions has the game behaving wonky, but still nothing to cry wolf about.


The content has gotten yet another faction (I have all the DLC, mind you) and there's plot, lore, missions, new ships and sectors to play around with.

The main point of interest for someone like me who enjoys building and carving out my own corner of the galaxy is that 

1) Terraforming can be used to let you train people so they are recruited with stars. I have yet to enjoy this as terraforming is a huge investment and takes time... but am eager to try it since transferring pilots for hundreds upon hundreds of ships one by one is a non-starter.

2) Fleets are smarter now, including such delights as being able to set a Miner as a leader and having other miners mimic that ones behaviour. Basically permitting players to create vast automated mining fleets with ease. Using trade restrictions, these can be used to supply your own stations.

3) The world is more lively and hostile, it seems, which is welcome. In prior runs, it seemed Xenon lashed out hard and then fell into nothingness overtime as long as the player supplied the factions with ship building supplies. Now there's far, far more pirate, raiding, khaak and xenon activities that poke in. In particular I enjoyed fighting half a dozen rattlesnakes and numerous small fighters all at once in my nemesis.


All in all, the UI remains abysmal at best, taking away a bit of the shine from the generous amounts of content, fun combat and many prospects the game has to offer. It is mostly a problem when you want to build big and wide though, handling hundreds and then thousands of ships. 

I remain hopeful it will be adressed in time myself, but the game still gets a big recommendation from me.



Leaving old reviews below for nostalgia, but they are outdated, from early 2020 and before.



X4: Foundations has some twists, a generally enjoyable experience of flying around and starting from scratch to expand into your own faction. 

There are a fair bit of content, UI and QoL which remains lacking even this long after release. I'm hoping that the DLC releases will improve upon things by a far margin and the game is at least enjoyable in it's own right, thus a thumbs up.


Addenum 12th of April:

After having played a fair bit more, I've been reminded of the real downside of this game. If you come to try and build fleets and enjoy management aspects, this is not the game for you.

The interface is presumably put together by an intern janitor, since it has the astehetic of an old webpage mingled with little to no ease of use. Information is spread out along the branches of trees rather than focal points where the user is expected to spend most of their time.

Crew assesment and arrangments are terrible, requiring massive amounts of spam of comm options with little to no way to track where you are in the process when the comms inevitable bug out and get stuck.

Upgrading ships are done on an individual basis with templates using mixed parts are only useable from player stations since other factions seem to scoff at 'doing what they can' from such.

The combat, economy and 'feeling of life' are decent enough to play in by itself. The other segments of this game though really is like a hopeful generation ship arriving only to see the local star going supernova. 

Play with as few ships as you can to avoid the incompetence of the UI and you'll be far more likely to enjoy yourself. Modders can't salvage Egosofts failure in this instance, sadly.",1583880342,1620165674,True,5,0,0.51661527156829834,0,True,False,False

But with the 2 DLC and lots and lots of patches I finally felt like it's ready to try out. 

Basic impressions:
- The graphics are really great after the 4.0 patch, there are some uglier ship models here and there, but the majority looks great, it's now on par with Elite Dangerous imho. Actually it looks better than on most videos on Youtube, maybe it's a matter of compression or people tone the details down, no idea. 
- The optimization isn't bad. I have an old mid-range gaming computer (i5 7600k and 1060/6) and it's more than playable with frame drops appearing in some busier systems, but still pretty impressive when considering how much the game is calculating at once. If someone isn't expecting the FPS he gets in simple AAA games, but is used to more complex stuff developed by small devs teams he most probably won't care. 
- It's nice that there is a pretty big modding community, but there is still nothing as advanced and all-encompassing as the excellent X-tended mod for X3. 
- Have noticed only one critical bug in one of the non-obligatory side missions, so no problems for me there. 

And some less-basic ones:
- I almost quit after the first hours :) Really, maybe I was just unlucky, but the first 15+ hours, where I only had my starter ship from the vanilla start were a total slog, I only kept going because I remembered from the other games that it gets much more interesting starting from the mid-game, when you start going into the management of your fleets and stations and bigger fights. If you have the DLCs I would definitely recommend to not take the standard starts but the Cradle of Humanity start where there is much more going on from the start and you get a nicer ship that allows you to do more.
- I love that the game is still being updated with lots of content and quality of life features, currently it has in many areas surpassed the heavily modded X3 I had running. It's not only the DLC, but lots of the stuff is free, which is great. 
- I'm playing a lot of very complex and hard to master games but here I needed LOTS of outside help with how stuff is working, so I would totally recommend using the Egosoft Discord for questions while playing, the response time is lightning fast. 
- The walking on stations part... meh... don't like it in any of the space games where it's a thing because there isn't much content and sense in it, but here, it's even fun at places, mostly because it gives you a sense of scale and some added immersion. That saying I wouldn't rate the game lower at all when it wouldn't be there and the development time would be spent on other parts of the game.  

So all-in-all I do think it's a worthy successor to this unique genre of space corporation simulation/space sim game and will be a great experience and highly addicting as long as one remembers not to expect too much from its specific building blocks as it does ""more"" than any other space game out there, so compromises in how stuff works are to be expected.",1620120416,1620121166,True,9,0,0.606299221515655518,0,True,False,False

First of all, there is a massive learning curve here.  Take Eve Online and throw in a spot of Elite with a dash of Stellaris and you'll end up with X4, in some weird sense.  It throws you into this Universe with a handful of tutorial missions that don't even begin to come close to explaining the things you need to know.  I have never watched so many Youtube videos in order to learn how to play a game in my life, but I had to with this one.  No really, I probably singlehandedly put some X4 content creators on the most watched list because I'm too dumb to figure out to do some things on my own.  It was very helpful though, as were the Steam and Egosoft discussion forums.

There are just so many small aspects on how to do things that aren't explained, but once you get the hang of it, it's not that bad.  You will spend alot of time reading and searching for answers though.

Are there some fairly serious AI issues?  Yes.
Is there a very steep learning curve?  Yes.
Is the UI possibly the worst ever coded in a game?  Yes.
(No seriously, it's awesomely bad)
Do missions sometimes break?  Yes.
Will you spend a whole lot of time outside of the game reading up on how to play the game?  Yes.
Is it tedious sometimes?  Yes.
Is it a massive time sink without SETA?  Yes.

Still, even with all of the issues, alot of which can be modded to mitigate, my opinion is the game is fun enough to play - as long as you have the time to put into it.  You'll spend a whole lot of time in the map mode, maybe even most of the time, but regardless, it's still fun for those of us who just can't stay away from space-centric games.

It's actually pretty amazing building your own station or defense platform, teleporting to it as it comes under attack by a Xenon Branch 9 Destroyer I or K, and just looking up into space from your platform while it just wrecks the enemy with hundreds of Plasma bolts. It's one of my favorite things to do, because it takes me out of the cockpit of a ship and puts me on a stationary place where I can watch the battle.

If you're a space game person and have a modicum of patience, along with the intestinal fortitude and dedication required to learn how to play this, it will reward you - but be prepared to go find answers outside of the game on how to do things - it will NOT hold your hand.

It has some of the magic feeling for me that X3 had thanks to the admittedly very pretty universe and improved trade system, but it also has a lot of really frustrating quality of life issues that always make me think, ehhhh this could really be better.

Some AI and physics just plain and simple just do not work when you are watching it in-person and that drives me nuts. I want to watch my empire work in-person like some kind of space Bezos watching his minions box up 40lb bags of cereal marshmallows! But alas, that doesn't always work, and that really ruins some of the magic for me. A specific example that really made me sad was when I saved up enough Terran Bux™ to buy a size L mineral miner. I hopped on the bridge and told the captain ""Mine all the things""! The ship moved into position, and then just.... sat there. My cereal marshmallow dreams had been dashed. Millions of credits wasted on a mining ship that couldn't mine (or so I thought). Once I left the sector though, I noticed it started filling up with ore! Why does this only work when I'm not looking at it?

Autopilot is much less reliable than telling the AI to fly somewhere. It has a tendency to just careen my combat space yacht™ into the nearest rock. One time my ship got stuck inside an asteroid somehow (thanks autopilot). The asteroid had no texture on the inside, so it was like being stuck in an invisible space potato with no way out. The physics' collision detection works on the inside of the space potato too for some reason, so I just had to bite the bullet and sit through the unforgivable 3 minute loading screen that you get when reverting to your last save.

The auto-save is miserable also. Whenever the auto-save timer expires you are met with a very sudden, complete halt of the game while it saves for like HALF A MINUTE.

In X3 there was this fun little thing where you could actually control the turrets on your ship. Can't do that in X4. There have been a number of times where I wished I had that ability when opening lockboxes, which are these containers full of usually valuable loot that people leave around in space for reasons, I guess.

Weird loading issues! Sometimes entire space stations wouldn't appear for me until I exit the whole game and re-launched it! Save+Load did not help. So on more than 1 occasion I rammed my ship into an invisible space station. Also, if you get a call on your Space Phone™ from someone like Dal Busta, sometimes it takes like 15 seconds just to load the image of Dal's face for 1 line of dialogue. This causes weird pacing in many conversations with the NPCs, and sometimes causes important messages (like police scans) to queue up behind this weird loading time.

Although interaction with NPCs is vastly improved from X: Rebirth, the voice acting is still only really 3/10, and interactions feel very much like a first script read.

Overall, I'd say this game is a big step up from X: Rebirth, sure. But the completeness of vision just isn't quite there for me.

I did still have fun, and I'll probably keep playing, but I'm gonna give this a thumbs down I think... I definitely believe a newcomer to the X series would be off-put by how unintuitive many things are (I know I hardly mentioned the menu, but wow, it's not great), and how jarring some of the issues are.

I just spent 10 minutes watching my pilot, given a simple go from one station to another order, fly slowly in a circle close to the superhighway gate it needed to go into. To its credit, at least it understood that it should be going into that gate, and this time my pilot didn't try to go at completely sub-light speeds to get to its target(which would take literal real time days to do), it just couldn't figure out how to go into the gate.

The game is perfectly playable right now as is. So yeah, recommended if you want something new to sratch that X itch.

The game is good. Technical issues are present, but being swiftly adressed. And it's egosoft, it's one of a kind game and it's actually released(looking at you SC).

Most of my time has been spent Googling and searching forums / Reddit for solutions to real simple tasks that straight up don't function in a logical way.

I'd recommend this game once certain issues have been addressed:

1. Mining logic for multiple ore types on a single station, will focus on one type regardless of how many miners you have, totally neglecting the other types regardless of capacity being reached. The ""solution"" is to have stations per resource type, but this exponentially increases required logistics which also brings into our next issue.

2. Repeat orders not having a transfer ware option, only a buy / sell, which then requires each station to hold large portions of your cash, which doesn't even transfer between station / trader in a closed loop setup, I understand It's how the logic works but the solution would be the fore mentioned transfer wares option.

There's more but I can overlook those, when you have to spend literal days setting up and testing things for them to not work, trying to access lacking in game resources for information or the official neglected wiki, it becomes really demoralising, more so when veteran players and even the Devs employ the ""This is the convoluted, specific, not mentioned anywhere else solution that you should know"" answer to things in the most arrogant manner, it truly becomes demoralising.

This game is like a high end damaged motherboard. Looks nice and prety but failed to boot. Stay away. My mistake was to trust some guys on youtube showing some beautiful ships. Some NPS are stuck in buildings and looks realy bad. It is a great idea badly executed. Dont do the same mistake, dont buy it.""

Update:
I continued to play the game and i must say i am surprised it didnt crushed during playing. More then this i enjoy it. May be it was bad luck in the beginning. The game is playable. 

Bugs i encounter are:
1) stucking NPC in obbjects, specially chairs or tables,
2) sometimes i saw some bombers/fighters in docks in strange positions (rare)

Skin of the NPS looks ugly but the game is very good because you have many oportunities, many choices to make. You can build your own mining fleet and make some money to buy new types of ships (S,M,L,XL). You can hire/promote NPC and you can chose what behavior they have. You can send them to mine specific minerals and sell them to a station you want to go. The economy of the game is great and the fractions had their specific tech. You can access specific ships for the particular fraction in the game by gaining reputation and buying licence. Reputation rank increase if you do missions for the fraction. And this is just in 20 hours of playing. I dont know how trading works or how i can build my own station but i saw many good tutorials on youtube about that. You have to give this game a chance.

After 600 hours: I cant give a positive feedback. Everything is broken is this game: economy, commands for ships, AI of the enemy ships (they are big and dumb). At the begining you dont realise that but after you go deeper and deeper into the game you understand that. I dont want to go again and explain any detail because i dont have much time but i bet the developers know very well about this. I dont know what is going on to Egosoft, I dont understand why they keep doing expensions when the game is ...how it is.

es läuft sehr viel besser als vorher, aber da ist noch sooo viel zu tun.

Vieles macht einfach auch keinen Sinn

zum Beispiel die unterschiedlichen Stärken der Flotten wenn man im Sektor oder out of Sektor ist. Oder man eine Fabrik hat die Silikon und Erz benötigt, die Bergbauschiffe, aber nur ein Mineral abladen, obwohl sie von Beidem etwas im Laderaum haben. 

Die Wirtschaft der Terraner ist ein Witz! Warum geht man plötzlich diesen Weg mit nur 4 Grundmaterialien? 

Die alten Schiffsmodelle sollten dringend überarbeitet werden. Die Reichweiten der Waffen sollten dringend erhöht werden. 

Die Performance ist immer noch unterirdisch. Sobald durch den Rechner um die 10 größere Fabriken mit ca. 500+ Schiffen verwaltet werden, kann mans eigentlich knicken.

Ich bleib bei meiner Aussage, die XGames sollte man erst kaufen, wenn Sie fertig produziert sind, also nicht mehr weiter entwickelt werden. Vermutlich hat man dann auch die Rechnergeneration, die dafür geeignet ist.

---------------------------------------

version 3.20 and this game is far from working as it should as a full release version.

but it has over 70% positive reviews you think. yea, only you should know, X has a really hardcore fanbase, that accepts that Egosoft releases everytime bugged unfinished games. there arent really many reviews for x4 when you compare it with other games.

when you start... it looks good and you think it works. but as you dive deeper and deeper in, you detect that too many things are still buggy. the a.i. and fleet behavior is a big mess. the ui is awkward and dont offer you enough tools to manage your empire on an easy efficient way.

its more a beta version and i think its a fraud that Egosoft released it as a full version and abuse us as beta testers. actually this game should be in early access.

so better wait. perhaps version 6.0 or later will it be worth, to be a true 1.0 version. 

and i hope they will make the game much more performant. its not really understandable, why x4 runs mainly on one cpu core.

additional there are still some really stupid features as station scanning and ventures that will perhaps never be removed, because the developers believes these are brilliant features. sry egosoft, but station scanning is the most dumbest time waste and ventures are so unnecessary as a pimple on the butt.

one last thing... the capital ship combat in X4 is really bad and such a backstep from XR. 
you dont believe me? look at this little fight in XR. 

https://youtu.be/WIBcNnOTwto

you will never see such a detailed and cinema like combat in X4... okay perhaps in egosofts promotional and cutted videos. the capital ship combat in X4 is only a big joke.

The claim is that you will be able to fly, fight, explore, trade, etc. in space; and some of which you will be able to do at some capacity, but more often than not you will actually find yourself frustrated with a game which strives to accomplish a lot and pretty much fails them all.

The game AI is an absolute failure where ships almost never do what you would expect inside or outside of battle. Part of this can be attributed to game complexity and limited AI capabilities, but the greater blame would go to the absolute lack of cooperation between individual AI agents; which results in incoherent fleet battles as well as mining and trading ships serving some station failing to work together to maximize effectiveness. The autopilot puts ships into asteroids and stations (literally inside the meshes) or flies through hazardous zones until their ship is lost; just sheer incompetence...

The lack of cooperation in AI is most noticeable and annoying at the faction level. There is no AI controlling any faction, but just like in the case of fleets and stations, the game only hopes that all individuals doing their own thing without cooperation will somehow benefit the faction as a whole; at least within this game it clearly does not. Of course, creating a sound economic and military power through agents only interested in maximizing their individual profit would be any capitalist's wet dream. However, the game simulates a universe where this individualist approach fails to an extend that all factions feel pretty much brain dead. There is not an ounce of strategical depth in any decision whatsoever.

The number of bugs in this game is staggering, and patches often introduce more bugs then they fix. Previous Egosoft games were also buggy, but this time the studio seems to have outdone themselves. Fans of the game sometimes find workarounds for these bugs, but other times it keeps you from playing the game or forces you to restart your save. Even when the bugs are not game-breaking, they are often intolerable to newcomers. After all, avid fans of the series like myself have learnt to tolerate these issues, but the same cannot be expected from the mainstream audience.

All that said, Egosoft is a company known to fix their games and make them playable years after release. It is kind of their development model where users are actually unpaid testers. This format is annoying and immoral as far as I am concerned, but it also means there is a chance that this game might become much better in the future.

I cant imagine the work it would take to add variations of dialog and personality to all the thousands of people running around just so when you step off your ship (pretty much not even a side game) you can't complain that all the people have the same dialogue.

But for real the help files are not super helpful and the game is complicated enough it can be easy to complain.

But the interface has everything you need some of which you don't even know is there. like on the map try filtering a resource you want to trade then select a ship you want to trade it right click on the resource. Top in blue is buyers bottom in yellow(tan?) is sellers and the best deal (that you know of based on visits to stations) is right there slide bar and all to buy and sell. (filtered by zoom level of map)

Feel like your ships are stupid? Probably low skill comanders. I got four 4 star captains in a squad of behemoths (junk by the way) that have killed Xenon I (I thought for sure they were all dead but What Behemoths lack in everything else they do have good range) and lived to tell about it.

I only have three complaints and an ask.
1. AI should measure the military strength in a sector and get really unhappy if you have too much military hardware. As is I can roll in anywhere with multiple carrier groups and no one thinks I got some conquering on my mind. (rebuilding rep after wiping out a sector might be a bit easy too)
2. some may think Xen are too tough but I disagree the Xenon K should run in packs more often (maybe I am seeing that a little more now but before unlocking rep for TER I never seen it and once you know how to come at them they just are not tough enough to be running the gauntlet alone).
3. the enemy spreads out too much. This is great for your inexperianced captains as they get to camp a gate and build exp with out risk but a smart enemy should group up and stay together sometimes. (perhaps based on the military strength of forces on the other side of the gate...)
4. I would love if there was some kind of R&D make it crazy expensive like teleporting your station and give it a % chance to develop the next MK level of equipment. That would be way cool. Maybe AI could be doing it too so you have to keep purchasing the next greatest blueprint or build your own or be left behind.

Anyway I have loved the progression from nothing to an empire. Trading, base building, ship building, mixing matching the best parts/mods.
Brought ZYA back from their last two sectors to owning almost the whole top of the map ( Did this by holding the Xen and Argon back while boosting ZYA trade with my ships and eventually selling them warships through my station). Very cool, At this point I have the resources to feel pretty much invulnerable.  Just letting it run 24x7 holding my borders and watching the factions all fight. Hopfully the Xen and TER will meet in the middle (but I'm in the middle so will have to move). Or eventually will crank out squads of Asgard battleships and wipe the map.

The premise is fantastic: Build a space empire. set in a sprawling and dynamic universe full of opposing factions that you can support, fight against, or completely wipe out. If you're interested in flying a dogfighting single-seat spacecraft, it's got content for you. If you're interested in flying a giant carrier that brings those dogfighters into battle, you're in luck. The two best comparisons I can name are single-player eve online, or single-player star citizen.

The most obvious flaw is that, even after years of patches and updates, this game is incredibly buggy. The AI is shockingly bad, your ship detonates for no reason, UIs are janky, the works. If you've played previous games in this franchise though, you're used to that, and maybe you think that the premise and ideas behind the game are cool enough to be worth slogging through the bugs. I thought so too.

For me though, the fatal flaw -- the thing that made me decide i wasn't going to buy the expansions, the thing that made me quit just as i was getting my empire going -- is that the simulation is significantly dumber whenever you're around.

What do I mean by that? Well, when you're flying a spaceship in-person, you have beautiful graphics, very convincing physics, etc. But understandably, they can't support 100+ sectors full of thousands of ships all with full physics, so if you dig into community posts and such, you'll quickly see a distinction between ""IS"", IE how physics and AI behaves when you're in-sector with them, and ""OOS"", IE how physics and AI behave when you're not around.

And you'll quickly learn that, for whatever reason, pretty much everything in the game is worse when using IS physics. Some sectors have dangerous electric fields that damage spaceships -- but only if you're IS! So you can completely ignore the danger as long as you just never go there - and if you ever do, everything you've created will instantly start taking damage and will eventually be destroyed. Trading ships take half a second to dock OOS, and a minute to dock IS. Mining ships will hum along nicely OOS, but IS, they'll just park in space starting at an asteroid for hours without mining it.

The end result all of this is that you can build an empire, but you can't actually be around to enjoy it -- because as soon as you go anywhere near a space station you've built, or hop on board a trading ship you've hired, their AI grinds to a halt. Instead, you have to watch little triangles move around on a 2D map while you sit in an empty sector. It's extremely deflating, and as soon as I realized it was happening, I couldn't bring myself to keep playing.",1618893130,1618893303,False,524,9,0.936805009841918945,0,True,False,False

There's no multiplayer.
This would otherwise be a deal breaker for me and it is what kept me from pulling the trigger for a long time. There's also no VR support; while forgivable this game would massively benefit from it. Smuggling has some actual effort in it but it's far from polished and there's little to no incentive to being a ""bad guy"". There's some jank and some bugs but otherwise I have nothing but praise from here out.

The (legal) trading system is robust actually one of the best I've seen. Building a station is one of the best sci fi gaming experiences and this game nails it. Creating, owning, and operating a space mega corp is this game's strong suit. This golden offering is the standard I will hold all other sandbox games to. Only Avorion gives this game a run for it's money in these regards but unlike Avorion you can walk around your station and see your customers and employees use your stations.
The highest praise possible for these features.
Small ship combat can be fun, but the real fun comes in the larger ships. This game nails large scale ship combat, an absolute gem. Battleships from the game and the mods make this experience even better.

This game is so close to a masterclass, it is very good and worth your time and investment.

[b] TL:DR [/b] Get 4.0 and DLC on deep discount like 50% or more. The game is shockingly poor in late game stages so around 2 or 4 days of in game time with a save, the economy dies along with wars and sector expansions, hence the need for so many Xenon and AI mods to make the game playable. Xenon are pathetically weak and easily overpowered by other factions early on losing their sectors, the reason for dying economy...coz nobody builds ships as nobody is supplying their own wharf's and shipyards, unless you spam traders to do it for them.

[u] Barely a recommendation: [/u] What i like
+ Building and managing fleets (this is also an issue with AI)
+ Deep with many things to do
+ Sabotaging station production and security to plan differing attacks
+ Ship designs
+ Story
+ Egosoft staff on forums have in the week of middle April 2021 confirmed at least 2 bug fixes for next update that i experienced and commented on, so that is positive.
+ Basic help and tutorial vids, not the best but helps with basics.

- You **NEED** mods to play this game unfortunately, AI, Xenon (cucks), mining, trading improvement mods are critical for longevity of your game save, sure there are those that seem to have a working late game in vanilla, but after multiple saves i keep having the same dead-end economy and peace, nobody fighting!
- The reason for no wars and dying economy is coz faction and xenon AI don't/ can't build ships anymore coz reasons, and you actively have to supply their wharfs/ shipyards to keep them going.
- Late game fleet management (AI) and combat is atrocious especially when you are out of sector, the ships just spin in circles, i see xenon float through sectors getting attacked without retaliating, so many dead xenon ships but very little dead of their enemy. AI is really really bad in general including mining and trading orders.
- Core gameplay issues and QoL improvements still waiting for since original launch.
- Reliance on 3rd party tools and sites for basic info like, encyclopedia info is non-existent and basic af. It shouldn't be called that the proper name for it is, twitter posts.
- UI!!!!!...dayum...the UI is bad...one of the worst, what a click fest to get basic orders or instructions....click...click....click Egosoft you need to prioritise that or get a company that specialises in UI ASAP! Very difficult to focus on what your seeing when you are overloaded with surrounding text.
- Poor optimisation, because you are spamming trade fleets to assist other factions build stuff, whatever reason their own trade ships cant help them selves, the game gets laggy with FPS drops real quick with too many of your own ships.

I hope they sort this out to see continued support for Egosoft, but these issues make me concerned that their history shows a lack of quality game development and features, it might not be the case but it certainly comes across that way for me.

PROS:
* Egosoft has delivered on the promise of returning to X's ""Foundations"", by allowing us to fly any ship and giving us greater control over how we play the game.
* As expected of an X title, it is fun. The incentive to make profitssss and grow your empire is alive and well.
* No more stupid highway mini game, and jump gates are back
* Station-walking feels much less cumbersome and pointless than X:Rebirth.
* Space-suits are back baby! Down and out? Get out and push that old rust bucket with your repair laser. Also there are a decent number of fun things to do that require the use of your space suit, which is now upgradeable.
* The galaxy map is extremely powerful, with the ability to see and make trades across the galaxy (if you have up-to-date info by the usual means).
* It is relatively easy to get into auto-mining and auto-trading quickly

CONS:
* No real main plot, hopefully we see some DLC in the future that includes something like this
* Some parts of the game feel unfinished, particularly the encyclopedia wrt known ware locations and more detailed weapon stats. I expect this to improve with time and patches. With the necromancy that was done to X: Rebirth, surely a more worthy game will get at least the same effort.
* Lots of bugs still. Again, I expect this to improve with time and patches.
* There is a lack of information on how certain game mechanics work. The usability of the game could be greatly improved by adding tool-tips over existing undocumented iconography.",1544451379,1618769417,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Phase 1: Those first 50 hours you are fascinated by whole vastness of the universe. 95% of the time you are doing all the cool stuff yourself - learning the mechanics, flying ships yourself, lots of pew pew, exploring and generally admiring the scenery. Which I will say is pretty damn awesome. For most this caps out at some point like this: you own maybe 20-30 ships, you recently bought that awesome capital ship you dreamed of from the first time you saw one up close. Now you thinking what is next?

Phase 2: The transition hits where you start dabbling in the the empire build. This is where most people are hit with the steep learning curve of building/management/logistics of space empire. This is where the game reverts to 99% micromanagement. You are not flying around anymore. Why? ...when you have [spoiler]teleportation[/spoiler]. You are generally staring at maps screen, station management screen or blank looking out of random room window on one of the stations while AFK from game. This is where most complaints of bad UI and AI are originating.

If you are a player that likes a lot of aspects in Phase 1 and only mildly whats in Phase 2, than I recommend doing one of the Cradle of Humanity DLC game starts. The Terran faction empire building economy is very condensed down from every other game factions and much easier to get into/understand in effort to see games full potential.",1618663619,1618663619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You don't even get the barest indicator of how to find it. Maybe if you get back in your ship you can find it. Quest automatically updates as if you have made a deliberate decision to turn down the free ship. You now have to do the quest without the offered ship. No way to go back. EVERYTHING is like that.

Honestly, watching the trailer of this game is what made me buy it. Sounded promising with all that you can do with the AI in game. 

One thing is for certain...you start slow with little currency and a S/M ship then work your way up to an empire. There are various story lines you can take on (more with the DLCs). Each gives you a specific role and main missions to follow as you progress your way to making a name for yourself. There is a diverse and expansive range of sectors to explore, control, or trade freely in. You will find out that it really does start off slow and working up to that empire takes a lot of time if you play casually...or explore a lot.

**I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying S/M/L mineral mining ships. You will want to set their activity to Auto SectorMine and find a good sector with a lot of Silicon (red hexes).

There are long periods where I will just let the game run and mind it for minimal periods to give orders/set defenses/acquire-requisition ships and then I will jump into the command chair of my newly built fleet to orchestrate and spearhead the offensive or provide support to the push; whatever I think is necessary. Those periods are slower, with several game periods needed to complete (I command those by hand) and absolutely not letting those run overnight or at work. Really a fun and rewarding game.

Visual: I separate my visual experience of this game into 2 parts 
1. Station and ship interiors. Character models are terrible, something is really wrong with lighting.
2. Space, stations and ships. These models are incredibly good. Weapon effects and explosions could have been better.

Sounds: Same as visuals. Terrible voice acting and inside station sounds, good sound design in space. Beautiful soundtracks that fit the game perfectly.

Gameplay is what makes this game so addictive. There are no limits of what you can do. Simple example: if you have just built a Silicon refinery to produce silicon wafers, but your profits are not so great, you can hack station of your competitors to sabotage their production and sell your silicon wafers at better price, or you can hunt down their silicon miners for the same purpose. And there is so much more. This game is like a logical framework. Your imagination is the best gameplay instrument. Simulation is deep, but comes at cost of fps loss in late game. There are still many problems, but devs are doing a great job at patching the game. Whats most important, they listen to community..

I consider this game a BETA at current state. It has a great potential, especially with mods. I don't recommend this game for  players who are new in X universe. The reason is that this game has some problems that can be solved if you are experienced enough, but if you can't solved them, they can be game breaking. For instance, if you build a computronic factory, that requires ore and silicon to run and assign miner ships to the station (thats what a regular player would do), miners will fill ore storage, but won't mine silicon a lot. Solution is to build 3 stations. 1 for gathering silicon, 1 for ore, 1 for production, assign transport ships. Profit! No shortages. This is only one example. There are some more.

If you are patient and ready to learn and post on reddit and x4 forums any problems you have, this game is for you.
If you are looking for a smooth gameplay, then i recommend you to wait for patches.

TLDR; UI is still horrible and learning curve is steep. But wow, well done devs. Best space game ever.

[Awesome] Devs

These guys never give up, never slow down, never gonna turn you around or hurt you. Love you guys.

[Awesome] Story

So cradle of humanity is upon us, 4.0 with a bunch of fixes, changes and new features.

I tried split vendetta but didn't get hooked, I figured give it some time for a new DLC and see how I feel.

So I picked up Terran Cadet story yesterday and having not played so long I felt quite fresh to the game. Instantly this storyline was picking up, taking me in directions and making me explore this vast galaxy.

It hints at espionage, competition, piracy and all sorts. What a great start.

Each mission feels different and takes advantage of the great features the developers have spent so long creating.

[Better] Fixes/management

The fleet management, people management and reporting tools, incl encyclopedia are much better now. Nice work guys.

[Great] Progression

So far progression has felt really slow, exactly what I wanted. The prices of everything seem a lot better balanced, and planning/playing with the economy is starting to really work.

Also inventory based stuff is better now, with caviar netting huge gains.

[Still bad] UI

UI is still a bit iffy but yknow what... So what, the rest is so good now, Spend 200 hours and you'll know the UI and come to have a love-to-hate relationship.

[Awesome] Gameplay and Missions

More varied gameplay and missions, making for a much better game taking advantage of ALL the features of the game.

-------------------Other edits (pre-thumbs up)------------------


I made sure to give it a good play before making my decision here...

The game has what is ""a start"" for a grand empire game, but it falls down too often to recommend. I would not recommend this to my friends right now, so i can't recommend it to anyone.

The game needs a solar systems worth of bug fixes. The game play loop doesn't really exist properly... Where are bounties? Why can't I kill faction leaders? Whats the point in all this money?

3.0 and the dlc may fix its issues but I doubt it to be honest.. The rest of the community is focused on ""economy"" and ""story"" which doesn't really matter.. how about sorting out the game play? It's a mess.

Developers:

- Add bounties [Bounties can be found but don't really matter, they just give cash]

- Add faction leaders that we can kill

- Fix the most terrible UI i've ever used in a game. [Same UI in 3.0 beta with some very welcome additions to managing loadouts/bulk staff/subordinates]

- Treat ai/staff as ""bulk"" not ""single"" entities... And fix them... They have 10million issues. 
[Slightly better in 3.0 beta, some bulk additions but still not quite there. I manually do it all still]

- Put scale pact in as a proper faction you can join

- Make passenger missions require more than 1 passenger

- Make the start of the game more grindy... I feel like my game status hasn't changed in 30 hours. [Still easy in 3.0]

- Finish the encyclopedia.. Like seriously, games been out over a year and the read-me is still incomplete? [Slightly improved in 3.0 beta, still feels incomplete]

- Fix fleets... They're just broken and kind of useless, tell em not to shoot and they shoot, tell em to shoot and they don't shoot. [Slightly better in 3.0 beta but still useless in boarding scenarios]

- Finish research, making the player wait 10 minutes to unlock something, and just repeat that for every item is a bit of a joke and you know it; this should be way more involved with collecting items and such. [Still crap in 3.0 beta, I've re-done the tree 4 times now and it's just a time chore not a game-play thing.]

- Create more opportunities to be a pirate. Piracy seems pointless past getting a ship off a faction. Even that doesn't feel like piracy, I took 5 teladi capital ships and I'm still +11 ally lol. Just get them to -5 as soon as I steal one and work down from there? [I don't even bother being a pirate anymore]

- Add more controls to ships.. Especially capital ships. If i'm carrying a bunch of fighters there should be a UI to manage the fighters, if I have crew in the bridge they should have a purpose, and I should be able to hand pick them. [This has been added to 3.0 beta but doesn't give individual purpose to bridge crew yet.]

- Community wiki, where is it? Every big game especially as complex as this has community driven content to help the players along... Where is it? Everyone is so confused they just don't make it or what?

-edit-

I have been playing the 3.0 Beta with a couple of extra tlc mods since writing this review (at least an extra 70+ hours), and while still standing by the negative rating I have provided some of the definite improvements to game play in the list above.

Once the DLC is out this may be a really decent game, but that horrible UI will still exist unless they overhaul it all, the confusing game play will still exist unless you really spend the time to get to know it.

Trust me now, it 's just so confusing and googling hardly helps, that you will need to spend 50+ hours before even starting to *get it*. It's not about a learning curve, it's about being so badly put together you're fighting against it.

Here is the biggest issue for the game as I can sum it up:

--

Everything works if you absolutely 'down to a T' understand every single little button and setting. 

For example, you don't tell a trader to just trade for a space station. You must ensure *every* little thing is understood fully and setup correctly before it will trade, most of my game time is spent just trying to figure out silly AI like this with trial and error testing.

--

These confusions could all be fixed if there was just some community wiki or some other platform that kept everyone up to date. But it doesn't exist, and that's the biggest failure for this game.

--

TL DR

If you like grand empires or starting with nothing and gaining everything this is a great game. The true challenge is ensuring you remain calm and figure out why something in the game isn't doing what you expect. You can get it to work, but figuring it out will test your patience more than any game you've ever played.

This may become a positive review after the DLC comes out :)

It was negative, but I gave it another try for a couple of months and deleted that review. I am back again to leave another review and I im sorry to say but I am done with this game. The problem with it is that the game is just broken. Here is a perfect example (see screenshot), I have a destroyer running attack targets command. This destroyer is leading a pack of 20 fighters. None of the fighters are attacking the targets and the destroyer is slowly inching towards the target that is supposed to be protecting.

I generally do enjoy the game, it pulls you into the world, has great graphics and a lot of potential. 

So a this point you probably wonder why do give a negative review. The A.I in this game has a way of driving you crazy. It seems the Egosoft tried to make everybody in this game as independent as possible. X4 simply does not do what you tell it to do. I understand a certain amount of randomness can make a game interesting, but this is not what i am talking about.

I talk about giving a M Class Freighter a ""Repeat Order"" to deliver  10000 Energy cells to a station which is has not even 1000 in stock but space alocated for 300000. And what does the freigher do..... delivers 4. 
This happens not just on ocassion, and there seems to be no pattern. I reset the Traders several times. Adjusted the settings on both stations to check all possibilities. Still no change. In the end i just bought several L Class Freighters and delivered manually.

I talk about planning an attack on a station, an ""coordinate attack"".... Ya right. Instead of them start to shoot at the incoming swarm of drones, what are half of my destroyers doing?  --> Hit the Travel drive and fly straight into the station. I have no words. Ok Egosoft says you need to level up your pilots. The question is how, besides installing mods. The same group was fighting for hours basically non stop in front of a gate to a Xenon Sector. Nobody even got 1 star more. 

Ok breathe.... So i reload and decide to attack manually, letting them get closer to the station slowly to get in reach without the station beeing able to hit you. After reaching their destiations half of my destroyers go up down and then start to inch closer and closer to the station until they are in reach of the station defence. What is interesting, then they stop. WHY.

These are just a few of the small but anoying things that make this great game a horror to play. Maybe it would be wiser to let the player set up a few things manually and not try to automate everything. 
Like as an example for the Repeat order command

1. Collect 10000 Energy Cells at Station X  - Wait until full
2. Deliver 10000 Energy Cells at Station Y - Wait until EMPTY

This cannot be too much to ask, or am i wrong. 

I really enjoyed this game for the first 30-40 hours, but  these little anoying details are just piling up and destroy the fun, at least for me.

If you made Eve and Elite have a child, and then made that child single player, you have this game. The game starts focused on you flying your personal ship or ships to do specific tasks, but over time that changes, however.


The game becomes primarily focused on empire and fleet management, with the first stretch of the game being mostly merc jobs for the factions to gain their trust so you can buy military equipment and blueprints. Once you get a station up and running, making money, you can focus more on maxing out profits, slowly grinding out the cash to spend on your next profit gear. A little spreadsheety at time and there's large stretches of time that you spend just micromanaging your stations and trading routes.
All things I personally enjoy. It's not a game for everyone, it's not fast paced and actiony. It's a slow grind sandbox.

The game has a mostly friendly environment to fly around in, with wars largely being made only if the player themself engages them. The hostile factions will for the most part do their own thing but occasionally try and shoot you down, but they are flies to a swatter unless they somehow amass a large fleet in your area, which doesn't really happen all that often.
Even the pirates, who will occasionally harass your traders, will not engage if you just order the trader to flee.
(I would try and get some mods to make the galaxy more hostile if you don't want it to be so heavily focused on grinding profits out, and more about making sure your empire can survive)

Things become a little trivial at a certain point, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just means all that money should be going into generation of a war fleet to take out the hostile races, or starting your own wars so you can secure sectors, or even the whole galaxy for yourself.

Ultimately there's no goal other than do what you want. And if that's what you want, I recommend.",1601871181,1617927449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The scariest ratings are the ones around 75%. They're deceptive. It feels like I'm gambling, because not all games are the issues immediately noticed. This is one of those.

I don't know what Egosoft is doing with this game, but it's bad. I've read quite some negative things about the company, and I wouldn't be surprised if most of it is true. I've dug in about 80 hours so far, which I think is a decent amount, and it took me this long to see enough bugs that I almost don't want to play anymore. 

Just check it, I'll keep it brief:

-> Graphics: Subpar at best, character models are gross, skybox is horrendous. Nothing makes me want to stop and gaze around except for a capital ship. Trailer is like a Tinder profile picture that turns out to be... their pre-COVID self.

-> AI: For a sandbox game, relying on AI, it's pretty bad.

-> Sound: It's fine, the character audio is rough and unpleasant.

-> Mechanics: I like the stations, the complexity of the economy, and the way every ship/station is built from trade and production. Yet there are so many funky restrictions, like I can't repeat an order for a mining ship, or when I buy trade goods it takes the money from me 500,000 meters away, before my ship even gets there. Also I use Auto-Pilot like an actual tool, because it can pull off unimaginable turns, breaks, and flips that my ship could never naturally do.

-> Story: This is the worst part. I don't want to do the story, I dread starting a new game because of it. This game fails so hard to create an environment I care about. If I don't care about any of the characters, factions, or races, why would I ever care about a main story in a sandbox game? Ah, I am forced to do it or lose out on progression. Great. 

-> Bugs: There are not as many bugs as there are poorly implemented features. I often fly into objects like stations or asteroids due to human error or auto pilot, and I have to desperately figure out a way out from inside an asteroid. Also visual bugs of objects replacing the skybox, which is weird.

-> Price: Egosoft is on the right track, AAA price does mean you should release a half baked game. 

I really don't want to type out a college essay of how much this game annoys me, and I'm really trying not to. When it comes down to sandbox games it all equates up to this: was all the effort before me worth it? With Mount and Blade, hell yes. With Factorio, of course! With X4... I don't think so. Is it going to be worth the dozens of hours of slow, tedious progress of grinding blueprints, building an entire self-sustaining production line, and then a mighty military, just to see them act as stupid as the enemy AI. I've read quite a few reviews where people build their ""megastation,"" quit, and just never play again. On paper, the concept sounds great, and one day someone will make the perfect space simulation game. This is not the game. Egosoft is definitely not the company.

Positives:
1) the UI is so much better - easier to navigate and move around.
2) map is better and easier to keep track of things.
3) Station Building is Awesome in comparison - so much easier and actually can be fun.
4) Navigation and moving around is a lot better highways and gates are so much better.
5) Missions are more varied.
BUT there are a LOT of negatives.
1) when in a dog fight enemies no longer eject to escape ( I liked that in X3) claiming an enemy ship.
2) ship selection; there are so little verity of ships here in comparison to X3 - I miss my barracuda (6 forward firing weapon slots).
3) weapon selection they are so poor comapired to the previous X3, only a few forward firing weapon slots. 
4) No integrated launchers - you now need to use a weapon slot for missiles and no great missile selection.

It does indeed seem that the EGO in EGOsoft has gone to their heads.  After some comments I had made on one of their forums, I was immediately banned, even though it was clear that the other party was at fault.

Companies like you go out of business with that attitude sooner or later EGO Soft.  And with your track record of releasing Alpha games as full releases and having people fix the game for you with modding, it can only go so far.

Boycott this company ladies and gentlemen.  Stay away at all costs.  You can better spend your money else where.

The most significant thing amount the X series is that there is nothing else like it, a [i]truly[/i] open, living universe for you to immerse yourself how you like. There are a LOT of options here, trading and fighting are par for the course but mission running is now rather fun, with a good amount of story to follow to give you an objective while you learn the ropes. 

And there are a lot of ropes, managing everything except your own ship can feel overwhelming, the candle burns slow and as the complexity builds up, your knowledge of the systems grows with it. Anything out of your reach is a Google search away and I only found the problems I had were my own lack of brain cells rather than the game.

Naturally, a game of this scope has problems, the method of carrying out your complicated plans are paired by an equally complicated UI, trade ships will get stuck and you won't know what to do until you dig a little deeper into the behaviour menus, stations won't utilise their assigned ships, until you understand why. There are ways to do everything you want however it's not exactly intuitive at times.

I've been a HUGE fan of the X series for years but with that fanboyism comes the knowledge that X games have to get patched and it usually takes up to a year or 2 for them to absolutely shine.

Menus have always been one of the things that have driven X fans mad but this menu system and UI is smooth, responsive and actually really nice to use.

You basically start as a newb in the galaxy and after a thousand hours you're the freaking king of the universe. No jokes. What the X games allow you to do in multiple HUGE galaxies is kick a$$ and take names and watch the credits roll in to buy another destroyer or capital ship.

Is it buggy? Yeah. Far less so now than at launch due to Egosoft's unrelenting and, frankly, unmatched level of continued support post-launch that simply isn't matched in this industry.
Unfortunately, due to the very complex nature of these galaxy simulations, there will almost always be some issues remaining as even if 100 things are fixed, others likely crop up. 
It's to be expected honestly, and if it was between having these games with the complexity and depth they achieve with unfortunate bugs and all, or having yet another dumbed down, oversimplified space sim? I'll take this, easily, any day. 

How X4 isn't as popular and lauded as other sims is beyond me. This game does so much and more than these other games set out to do and still have yet to achieve, even after 9+ years of development, yet most don't even know this series exists. 

It's a shame, because these games (and X4 in particular) should be the standard for future space sims and other developers would do well to mirror the professionals over at Egosoft. We need more games and more devs like this in the gaming industry. 

I cannot wait for what the future holds!

I fell in love with the X series in X3 Reunion, Terran Conflict (TC) and Albion Prelude (AP). My absolute favourite was the XRM mod that was created for TC and AP, and X4 was not a disappointment. Granted it took me a while to get into as I had issues with my X52 Saitek, but I believe that was due to that model being older. Once I got over having to use mouse and keyboard I was once again hooked on this game, with only  a few reservations. I would love to see FPS style mechanics being introduced like Elite Dangerous Odyssey, along with the planetary landing and interaction which isn't in X4. I know there will be many that say ""this is a space sim why do you want FPS, tanks and planetary combat?"" but I think this will add a massive amount to immersion and the overall feel to the game.

 The two games are similar, but I play X4 as it gives you more options, the ability to control a fleet and frankly the grind isn't as crazy. Speaking of grind the mining nerf was a bit much for my liking, extending the early game unnecessarily in my opinion. Would definitely recommend getting the expansions as they add a lot to the game! 

What I really like about X4 over X3 is the fact you don't have the ""I win"" ships which you do have in X3. Capitol ships need fighter cover, and fighters struggle to take out bigger ships without the assistance of the larger craft (for me this is awesome as I love bigger battles). Economy can be weird, and you can definitely exploit openings, which is great but a nightmare during the first 20 hours of the game. as building your first mega complex can be a bit of a grind.

Combat is fun, but their can be a few plateaus which can be tedious (typical sandbox) however I think it's worth it long term. The massive difference that this game has over X3 (even though at the time of writing it was disabled on the Cradle release) is the ability to jump into a friends universe with the Ventures, which is what sealed the deal for me over ED. 

Overall the game is great, there is a lot of room to improve and I can definitely give the dev's a thumbs up for trying and listening to the community on feedback and support!

There are many new inconvenient features (inventory, crafting, research, random jump points) to be ignored, and boring mini-games (loot box, find leaks, fix idk) that thanks to the mods can be forgotten.

But... as all X games are a river of bugs. Every new major release I give a try and still, on version 4.0, many of the released ""features"" just don't work. I was back to play as finally, we would have proper boarding mechanics, what every X player always wants, but is just... broken.

The depth of this game is amazing. At 4.0 it's relatively bug free, just a few issues with crashing into stations at high speed and clipping inside them. Considering this doesn't kill you, I'm OK w/ it.

The UX/UI of this game though, is absolutely horrific. It takes what is an amazingly deep and intricate simulation and makes it completely inaccessible without excessive and repeated googling. 

It has a an encyclopedia, and everything has 'no information available' because after a few years they haven't put basic descriptions in for the simplest components. Want to know the difference between a 'shard launcher' and a 'pulse laser'? There is no description, and no tooltip, just a 'damage output' and 'burst output' which are useless, and by entering the encyclopedia to see the effective ranges etc.. of these weapons you've left the ship builder and need to start over.

The trade UI falls all over itself, clipping into itself and just generally being very obtuse as to what you're looking at. The trade UI constantly forgets what ship you have selected, so you're forced to navigate a drop down menu to find the ship you're trading with amongst dozens.

The station builder is cool, but managing stations is a nightmare. Of course the encyclopedia has 0 information to help you. There is no simple way that I have found to manage your stations economy, buy orders and sell orders are placed in the visualization of the production chain instead of in a unified UI dedicated to trade, making it very difficult to determine what your station will buy and sell.

All of it can be worked through and learned. But this is not a matter of the UI being designed to be highly efficient once you've mastered it. It's clunky, inaccessible, devoid of help and completely relies on google to make up for it's shortcomings. You will spend a lot of time with google, eventually you just stop looking in the game to figure out how to do something, you just immediately google it because the community has built better help and tools than the developers.

It's a great game, but I can't recommend it because I guarantee 50% of the people that try it will be so turned off by the first year university student level UI design that they will refund. Shame.",1617398934,1617398934,False,128,2,0.816669583320617676,0,True,False,False

X4 foundations is more or less Mount and Blade Bannerlord in space.  The game a hybrid simulation space sim and empire management game.  Early in the game you spend alot of time piloting your own ships and doing all the work yourself (fighting, mining, trading, etc) and as you advance further into the game you take a less active role and manage a fledgling  space empire and all its logistics.  I paid about $100 for the game and its DLCs at full price and currently at 101 hours and am probably only hitting the middle part of what the game has to offer, so there is alot of content if you have the patience and willingness to learn mechanics that are not fully explained.

The ship simulation side of the game is pretty tight, its got good mechanics, and is for the most part well done.

The space empire building and management part is very ambitious, however can be very frustrating.  The game requires that you promote NPCs and assign large parts of the micromanaging to them, in order for them to operate large quantites of ships and stations on your behalf.   When everything is working correctly, its a blast, and i actually enjoy it more then getting into a fighter and dog fighting an enemy ship.  But sometimes it bugs out, and its lacking some pretty critical user input options (Good example is rimworld, where you have the advanced number priority system where you can manually toggle the pawn to break his normal routine and instead do another task, you also have the option of right click and forcing them to).  In X4 you assign a miner or trader to a stations manager and its beyond your control, you just have to hope the AI does the job or you'll be stuck micro managing workarounds to keep stations operational

It does have its moments though, where you get into an epic space battle and your totally emersed and loving every second of it, and it does scratch an itch in a genre that basically doesn't exist anymore in the modern gaming scene.  IF you played the older freelancer titles and used the capital ship mods for example, this is a solid buy for you.  It has so many good aspects, its just not as fully polished at you may hope, but i think i still prefer to play something a bit buggy but original, instead of a copy/paste yearly release.",1617311441,1617311441,True,17,0,0.640750586986541748,0,True,False,False

Overall the Game has ALOT of stuff to look at which will daunt most gamers if not helped and explained on what to do, I had to Search through Google and Youtube to get info on how to navigate through the menus of the game, and this is at the start.

So theyve pulled of a bethesda/cdpr/ ...[insert greedy ass studio here].

Well lets get to the point...
I started a brand new save for CoH to rule out any compatibilty issues.
After now 100 hours i can say, i am done with it and i cannot recommend it to anyone.

The good:

- New Terran race with good looking ships and stations (subjective) 
- New sectors
- Adequate gfx for its purpose (subjective) 
- Still flawless 21:9 support (3440x1440)
- Still walkable ship/station interiors


The bad:

- Still MAJOR disconnection betweens IS (in sector) and OOS (out of sector)... e.g. 3x ZYN rattlesnakes attack a xenon station and doing well OOS..... i decide to help them, as soon as i enter the IS range they all get obliterated in 2 min by L graviton turrets.
- Mining nerfs bring A.I economy to its knees. To the point where they break down. (enemy empires become pushovers)
- Still no point in utilizing a fleet (other than conquer all those pushovers).... My fleet repelled large formations of XEN Is and XEN Ks in TER territory.... do they care? NO.... do i get any kind of credit? NO......
- Fleet/wing management still a total mess, with lack of tools to micromanage (engagement range, behaviour control, patrol waypoints, retreat gathering points...nothing)
- Fleet/wing formations breaking and freezing subordinates to a hold 100 km away (especially destroyer formations)
- Destroyer A.I waypoint movement as precise as WW2 ära dumb bombs
- Player as wingleader still has no hotkeys for quick commands
- Player as destroyer wing lead freezes A.I subordinates to a hold.
- Carriers dock/undock fighters with no logic behind it (intercepting 1 target with all of its wings then redock like a morron)
- Carriers no ability/command to leave fighter wings undocked. (no docking on demand......)
- Carrier/Station docking wonky at best... (e.g TER Katana 5 min of glitching trou station interiors to reach its dock)
- A.I still not able to utilize their travel drives leaving formations to crawl in a spread pattern to their destinations (which is laughable as terrans introduced their  powerful TDs)
- A.I still not able to follow basic intercept logic
- Police A.I scanning ships mid fleet XEN attack (also spam scaning my whole fleet [144 ships] and thus breaking formations)
- Station mangers A.I lacks any kind of priority system (which leads to starving productions/ illogical behaviour)
- Pilot xp system is a total mess and lacks any depth
- Complete lack of Interactions with factions (....other than those boring missions)
- Ship balance still a total mess with no direction. (Just add bigger ships to justify DLCs purchases? e.g. raptor/asgard)
- UI is still in a state of 1st semester software engineering ""Hello World"" & ""My first UI""
- Control/button assigment/customization state PRE 2000 area

....the list goes on and on....


I really dont know what kind of software engineering process egosoft is using (if any). But instead of going with best practice and focus to rule out flawed cullprints they keep going in the wrong direction. Not to mention quality control which since X3 and now X4 is non existent.... Egosoft has more than 20 years of experience in their genere but trou their continuing demonstration of incompetence this leads nowhere...

As a verdict, this game is still full of broken and half assed implemented mechanics with lack of any meaningful depth.

COH truly made this shine for me.

Granted, there are some issues still remaining. But there is now an somewhat healthy amount of mods to build on X4, so if there's anything annoying you, it's easily modded away.

Egosoft, for what it's worth, you're back in my good graces again.

My comment at release, unedited for posterity
At present, this game cannot be recommended if you're looking for the X-experience. It's a BETA with strange UI, lacking fleet command and the usual shenanigans from Egosoft regarding design decisions.

I cannot recommend this game anymore as there are so many bugs it's worse than a few months after launch. The problem is the bugs are not consistent with everyone or every save game, as I can load up 2 different save games and might have bugs in one where it doesn't appear in the other in similar status. Recently I restarted as a Terran cadet, and even though the equipment dock has supplies and there's no queue, no matter what I tried it refuses to upgrade ships. Others work fine, other save games where the supply levels are similar (95-100%) work fine. Ships stop using travel mode often (AI controlled) at distances up to 200km and unless you manually give them another command they will continue at that speed until they reach the next zone or order. There's a constant supply of bugs being reported daily that many experience, and there's some that existed since launch like free war mission rewards. The admins and devs constantly give people attitude when they complain about bugs, and will harass you if you argue. I suggest giving this one a miss unless it gets a massive overhaul, or you don't mind giving up certain features in a save game, or starting over to fix it.

*Original Review*

This game got a lot of bad reviews because it wasn't exactly like the long developed X3. So if you didn't play x3, you can ignore 90%+ of those. The game is great if you like space empire builders, I'm personally not a fan of games like stellaris as I feel like the micromanagement is a bit much, but in this game the menu's make things very easy to manage. With the new 4.0 update coming on the 16th it gets a lot of new features that add even more automation and quality of life features. There's unfortunately not a lot of videos out there describing it in great detail, but there are some so I suggest if your considering this game you should check them out. 

The game itself can be a bit overwhelming at first, and you really need to drag your way up from the bottom. If you enjoy games that require patience and reward you for your effort you will probably like this. I've played star citizen, elite dangerous, avorion and others, and I think x4 has the best features. It does have wonky AI, but it slowly gets better, it's way better than launch, and it continues to improve in every big update.",1615797491,1617106474,False,2,0,0.531669914722442627,0,True,False,False

I have played many SciFy & Space titles, and a wide number of 4X & RTS strategy games through the last two decades.  This title quickly become my top choice in strategy and my top Space game go-to. 

I would describe game play as a pleasant mix of Stellaris like ""4X"" strategy, blended with the industrial scope of the EVE universe, and flight aspects to rival Elite Dangerous.  

Is it flawless? No, no game is. It has a steep learning curve often sending me to YouTube for tutorials. While the titles' Exploration and RPG game play is present, but lacking. 

However, if you want to be a tycoon of industry or wage intergalactic conquest: this is the game! it's a great simulator and a fantastic strategy game.

The concept is great, but as of DLC # 2 it's still got SO many massive issues it's nearly unplayable. Most of them are surrounding the AI. For example, while it's tedious and hard to level pilots, for doing so you'll be rewarded by them committing suicide when they gain access to the ""boost"" ability. This just means they now can use their ships boost, which they will proceed to use TERRIBLY, a ship that has shields strong enough to endlessly soak damage from a tiny fighter will instead burn off all of its shields trying to ""boost"" after every pass the tiny ship makes until its shields are gone and it can actually be harmed by the tiny ship.... similarly many anti fighter ""corvettes"" will also  try to boost at every fighter until they can't hit anything and their shields are gone instead of just moving slowly an vaporizing the tiny fighters they're engaged with. It gets worse with miners and traders as they encounter an enemy that's moving towards them and attempt to ""flee"" directly away from it getting rid of their shields, only to turn directly around and head straight back at the enemy they can SEE coming at them, this time with no shields. The worst part is these are your 5 of 5 star pilots... 
Janky AI aside, it feels like the devs don't grasp basic economics. The values of goods have set capped low and high prices and while they do fluctuate +-50% within those caps, there is often no actual demand for many products and ENDLESS demand for others. This feels really sad to, for example, they have crew moral, they have different races that all consume different things, they have pirates, they have DRUGS. However all of these things remain unconnected in isolation, pirates just show up randomly at the edges of sectors spawned in. The only places that will buy your drugs are trade stations and they don't actually consume them, like nvidum they had to make the stations simply erase X amount periodically so you could sell them more........ why not just tie all this together, say each race prefers its own type of drug which are all illegal somewhere, tie that supply of drugs to a boost for ""moral"" or just as the base for ""moral"" entirely, wow now you have stations all over the galaxy consuming the drugs, so there's a reason for them to have a high value, and a reason for the pirates to show up (rather than just randomly spawning them to harass miners) and a reason for smugglers to be taking the risks of getting blown up by the cops to smuggle said drugs into areas they're not legal.",1617055642,1617055642,False,4,0,0.504794478416442871,1,True,False,False

There are some very promising aspects. However, there are very frustrating things that just keep pushing me away.

The AI is probably the worse I can think of in recent game experiences.  Mining ships seem to waste significant amounts of time flying around, rather than mining rocks in their immediate area.  Autopilot will crash head-long into rocks, stations, ships, etc.  It also seems to get confused at times and will disengage travel to turn in odd directions.

The interface is not intuitive and trying to find things consistently are painful.  There are too many icons/options to drill into and things seem scattered.  I've spent more time with the game paused, trying to google how to trade items between ships, how to issue orders, and many other things.  (Yes, I've done and continually reference the tutorials.)

Save / load games are entirely too long.  My PC is fairly top-end and backed by 2xNVME and saves / loads take 16+ secs.  In a game where death = game over and SAVE/LOAD are mandatory, a 16+ sec delay represents even more time I'm ""not playing the game"" ... but trying to play the game.

There are other issues as well, but this review is getting long...

I REALLY want to recommend the game.  I want to give it a thumbs up.  I bought the game, even after reading the negative reviews (which are mostly on point btw), in the hopes of supporting the developer for a better game.  I feel like I have to give it a thumbs down with a ""let the buyer beware"" message.  There seems to be quite a number of people very satisfied with the title.  I've seen some great Twitch streams of it even.  The conflict I have is that you may not find it as tolerable as those people.  Do your research and make sure you are willing to work within the current patch set.

Started the game and the tutorial froze in place. Had to restart to reload;
Flew around a bit and got stuck inside an asteroid. Had to reload to get out;
Walked around a station and got stuck inside the landing pad of a larger ship after it took off; Had to reload. 
The map has a strange bug that causes it to constantly scroll. Spent about an hour trying to figure that out.
NPC's don't render properly; the AI flies like it is drunk; ships get stuck in a docking/undocking loop; enemies spawn in out of no where right in front of you (like in the early Just Cause games) and ""ambush"" your fleets. Enemy ""cheat spawning"" is debatably okay, but this is blatant and immersion breaking. 

Honestly, it would take too long to list all of the bugs. These aren't unique to me either; other folks on the forums are experiencing them. I tried to push through them, but I spent more time troubleshooting than playing.

Also, it is an Egosoft game, so expect a really bad interface. It is better than X3 (a really low bar), but expect to get frustrated with a layout that only makes partial sense, even after you spend hours learning it. It is the antithesis of  intuitive.  

The game is HEAVILY padded, like most other X games. What I mean is things that should be simple and fast take an extremely long time and are needlessly complex, usually by design. Egosoft is also notorious for this, and this game is no exception. This, above all else, is what I believe turns off all but the most hardcore enthusiasts and makes X4 such a niche product.  Just because a task takes a long time to complete and requires a dozen extra button pushes, does not mean its fun, nor does it add to a sense of accomplishment.  It's just busywork.

As a long standing fan of the X series, this feels like it has the potential to be an amazing addition (maybe the best yet), but it just isn't there yet. I would argue its not really even close. It should still be early access with a much lower price tag.

Ship tiers need to be overhauled and turrets improved because swarms of fighters are still stronger than larger class ships with flak cannons. 

The XENON are still a ""threat"" because they jack their ship stats so high it makes them tiresome to play against which translates to the player needs more ships -> money -> time.

There is something profoundly satisfying about getting into your tiny little scout ship, then landing on the pad of your massive Destroyer, getting out and going to take personal command of this capitol ship yourself.

You can build stations of your own, stations that can, with the right investment, produce any of the goods in the game, and even nearly any of the ships. It feels great to have a fleet of mining ships and a horde of transports working to carve your own niche into the Galactic market, a market that is SUPPOSED to actually be driven by real supply and demand.

Supposed to be. But maybe isn't. Plenty of times I've seen whole corners of the galaxy grind to a halt because they need, and cannot find, some niche resource. Factions that can't produce ships, stations that won't finish building, products that just don't get made, because while demand is sky high, there just isn't a supply.

I've seen mining fleets simply refusing to collect the resources necessary to fuel your own stations, flying half way across the galaxy to collect yet more of something you have plenty of while ignoring what is already bottlenecking your production.

And there are a dozen more examples, on top of it. Tasks that are easy, even almost intuitive to assign, but then aren't properly executed, NPC behavior that is just... abysmally bad. The terrible voice acting I could excuse (And it really is hilariously bad almost all the time,) the broken economy I could work around, but the fact that the game simply refuses to DO the things you TELL it to just ultimately breaks the whole experience.

I want to love X4: Foundations. I will probably keep trying to love it, keep trying to play and enjoy it [i]despite[/i] itself. Sadly, this feels like a game that just keeps constantly tripping over itself, and at this point I have no expectation of any real fixes.",1616949260,1616949260,False,6,0,0.539807915687561035,0,True,False,False

Updated Review (Update 3.10 /w Split Expansion): OK so I checked back in on the game. It's made some great progress. In particular the new ship designs and also the new tutorials. The bad news is at the time of this writing there are some issues still holding the game back. Fog of war now ""reappears"" after you have explored an area of a sector. The explore command is still worthless (seriously Egosoft?), and the whole situation with finding pilots that can actually do their job is a nightmare. I feel like the game is moving in the right direction and it just needs some more TLC to be another classic. Here's hoping that Egosoft can pull it together! 

With all of that I am still leaving my review as a ""no recommendation."" If I had a maybe button I would have chose than instead... However, I feel it's getting a lot closer to a yes with a bit more work. 

Updated Review (Update 4.0 / hotfix 1+2 /w all expansions): I am happy to say at this point that I now give this game a thumbs up. A lot of my previous issues with the game have been fixed and I have been having a great time playing. The new Terran expansion has some fantastic ship designs, a fun campaign, and adds a lot of flavor to the game. I commend Egosoft for continuing the hard development work and really look forward to future patches and expansions.

As you progress your influence grows within the universe, the story & missions in the game have a subtle way of teaching you how things work in X4 that let's you feel like you figured it out on your own.

This is a game to relax to, things won't work the way you think, often the game isn't broken, rather you're missing something.

My biggest gripe with this game is the way it handles mods, sometimes it messes up the versioning, also this is the kind of game that is much more enjoyable if you look up some guides/videos on how to get started, but make sure you're looking up the newer ones as I found some of the information misleading, due to subsequent patches.

It is like Elite Dangerous on a smaller scale, but with a huge number of ships, upgrades, real economy simulation, and building. The combat tutorial alone is quite satisfying with a properly configured HOTAS and TrackIR both fully supported. They could almost spin off a new game like X-Wing focussing more on a scripted combat campaign.

It does have a unique feel to it, which may put some people off, or take a little getting used to - things like the races, the story line, the feel of the universe, etc which give it a more 'B' movie or cult status feel. But the underlying interface and gameplay are solid and extremely deep simulation.

There are some areas that need attention to help new playes, such as the initial missions and how to do this and that are a bit lacking, how to mine, how to get a little money at the beginning - you can spend several hours searching online how to do some things yourself. But the mechanisms are there and do work if you find them, but I suspect may either put some people off altogether or delay them onboarding with the game.

It does need a lot of patience and OCD to get results from the game. You will be spending a lot of time on forums finding out how to do stuff.

Some features which worked in earlier versions also have been changed, such as Auto Trading, and that as well as other features are not apparent as gameplay options in the early game - the only way you can find out about them is either by progressing by dozens of hours or sources outside the game - I'm not a big fan of meta gaming.",1559999730,1616916561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Early on I struggled with frequent graphical issues, the screen/UI would become all glitchy, or my FPS would drop to like 5, the only fix was to restart the game, these issues I narrowed down to the game having a VRAM leak and overflowing my GPU's 3GB of VRAM. I was able to work around it by reducing a lot of VRAM heavy settings to allow me to play longer sessions before it becomes an issue. Up until I hit that point the game runs pretty smoothly for me though, even on ultra when I had it set to that. Ryzen 1700, GTX 1060.

The game has a lot of AI and ""pathfinding"" issues, and AI related features that don't do what the game or devs say they do. For example there are ""resource probes"" that are supposed to direct AI ships to high density mining areas, but your AI ships all ignore these. There are ""nav beacons"" that are supposed to nudge AI ships around areas you don't want them to fly through, but the AI ignores these. The pathfinding issues people tend to excuse because there's a lot of stuff running at once and it's expected to not be great, but the issue is more that stations and gates and such have no ""rails"" for the pathfinding to follow so ships just fly through walls trying to take the most direct course, this isn't a pathfinding performance situation it's just not as much effort put into nav-meshing as required, basically. Many of the ships also rely on speed and forward facing weapon mounts in combat, which the AI really doesn't know how to use at least when you are watching them. The katana for example is a M ship with very high speed and very powerful forward facing weapons, it repeatedly loses fights to small ships because it tries to sit still and point its nose at the enemy instead of flying around using its speed to dogfight.

However you actually have much more control over your AI piloted ships than previous games, with many new orders you can give them and fine tune to have them do exactly what you want in most situations. Station building is also a huge upgrade, allowing you to create truly unique modular stations mixing parts from any of the factions you want, and you can jump into this early game and gradually expand your tiny station into a megabase.

The one thing that concerned me most looking at the game way back, and what caused me to hold off on buying it, was the walking around stuff. Getting out of the pilot seat, walking around your ship, walking around on stations, it seemed very pointless to me and like it would just get in the way. I actually love it, they have made it convenient enough by keeping areas small and using an ""elevator"" system to get where you want to go, and you can quickly teleport back to your ship from anywhere on a station with a hotkey. It's not required that often, there is a player inventory and some trade goods that you carry in your infinite pockets that you need to board a station and talk with a trader to sell, you get these mostly from combat and looting other ships, or lockboxes that spawn randomly around the map. What the system adds though is a great sense of scale and awe, when you get your first M ship it feels so huge compared to your starting S ship, and as you move up to L and XL ships it just feels really good to stand on the landing pad of a huge ship you own.

Other than that it works pretty much like a fully updated X3 with all the features one would expect, mostly just done better, it's a little light on ship variety still, but I think this is a game they still plan to expand on in the future. There are also a bunch of mods, I've started a new playthrough recently to test out one that changes the combat balance a lot and adds a bunch of new ships.

Edit: Actually one thing I want to add to this that can be really frustrating, is saving the game takes like a minute. Understandably this puts the default auto-save frequency at like once every 80 minutes or so, and it means you tend to not think about saving very often. Which also means sometimes you screw up and have to reload which can be a loss of over an hour of gameplay.",1616864047,1616873065,True,15,0,0.61146920919418335,0,True,False,False

There are reasons for this....
I am a long term X3 player, played all of them and X2 before that, always been a fan.
X4 is a good game but it's too much. It feels like a job if you want to get anywhere and that is not why I play games.
It suffers from the same issues as previous games, a steep learning curve. The issue here is that there is SO much to do that that curve is almost vertical now.
I am 30 hours in and still only have the very basics almost down.  You would need 100+ hours to get to grips with everything and a lot of that time is going to be spent asking for help on forums or watching youtube vids. If you have that desire and free time then take this review as a ""Thumbs Up""!

There are some really nice additions to this game, being able to walk around ships and stations is so cool, even if the outsides could have a bit more variety.
I love that space feels bigger now.
Stations look so much better now, no longer are they giant sprawling masses that take 3 reloads to get in the right place!
The graphics look pretty although you do need a hefty PC for high level.

There are also things I dont like.
They changed the names of all the weapons, why? They worked as is and were kinda iconic to the universe.
They changed the ship classifications, again why was there a need for that? M3, M4, M5 all gone.
Combat feels wrong, fighting small ships like fighters is either too hard (Trying to hit them with your guns gimbaling all over the place is a nightmare) or too easy (Turn Auto aim on) There does not seem to be any middle ground which is annoying. A simple ""guns always fixed forward"" key would not be hard I'm sure.
Either way, much preferred X3 combat.

So many little things just add up and, after 30 hours, I have decided that I am just not actually having fun and that, actually, I think X3 is a better game despite it's faults.
This makes me sad because I think, deep down, this is a brilliant game but it would require more time and effort than I can put into a game these days.

I’ll start with this simple statement, X4: Foundations is the best space simulation game that I’ve ever played (in 20 years of gaming). It is a TRUE sandbox, not a ‘sandbox’ in the way that some survival games claim; faux-sandbox games.

I have no intention of turning this review into an essay and so I think I can describe this game in summary with the following:

-	Take Eve Online and it’s massive scope and gameplay potential
-	Remove the online community that often turn that game into a hostile scamfest
-	Replace said community with a living world of traders, miners, fleets and empires
-	You have X4: Foundations

Don’t get me wrong, the original X4: Foundations that was released lacked soul and character. But it was essentially what it said it was, a foundation. With the latest DLC (Cradle of Humanity) I am seeing a more diverse, amazing sandbox world that is, most importantly, a fun world to spend time in.

My only complaint is the performance. It's terrible.

You can potter about the galaxy doing quests, getting into dogfights, mining, trading, upgrading your ship and buying bigger and better ships if that is all you want to do - a sort of Elite Dangerous without the ridiculous monetization.  But at some point you will probably want to start assembling a fleet of ships, hiring mining ships and trading ships to earn a steady stream of income, and building space stations.  Everything takes place in 3D - this is a fully immersive space flight simulator.  
All the components are fully interactive.  As an example of what you can do:  You can pilot your x-wing like fighter ship and land it on a bigger cruiser.  Then, you can walk out of your small ship into the cruiser and take over the controls of the bigger ship.  Then you can fly it to an even bigger ship, like a carrier, and land on the carrier.  Then you can walk out of the cruiser and take control of the carrier, flying it to a space station.  Then, you can leave the carrier and walk around the space station.  You can assemble an entire fleet of dozens of ships and lead them into battle against enemy fleets and space stations.  You can even sneak into space stations and sabotage them, causing them to jettison trade goods into space that you can then swoop in and steal.
There are only two negatives with this game:
(1) Since it is a full single-player galaxy sim, it takes ages to save and load a game.  At least 30 seconds, often more.
(2) Flying ships is easy, but controlling fleets and your AI pilots involves many complex menus and sub-menus.  Overall, I think it is one of the most intuitive games of its type, but still - prepare for a steep learning curve.  On the plus side, you can gradually ease yourself into the game, you do not have to learn everything before you play.  
The only space simulation games that are better than X4 were made by the same developer.  And, tbh, I think X4 is better than it's predecessors at this point.",1616548577,1616548577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most players find the game empty and tedious because they are trying to play it like any other space sim, but this one wants you to automate things much like Factorio or similar games. Yes there is lots of shooting, but for the most part taking direct control of any ship in a way decreases its combat effectiveness than putting it into a fleet and managing it via the map. The whole idea that i should fly my own ship or mine my own resources is contrary to how you play an X game, and the great thing about these games is you can potentially have fun playing it wrong anyway. Yea you might not see major parts of the game and you will be grinding a lot, but they have done a lot to make them more accessible to new players and streamlined some of the mess of menu trees.

Now there is some negative. The frame rates are terrible and unless you turn off some of the fog and effects, it can cost you 50 frames or more. The save function must be a nostalgia thing because it takes forever to save a game, this i really don't get. The autopilot is notoriously bad and will run you into things all the time so having collision damage off can save you some frustration, also being trapped in a station, or parts of you fleet being trapped is common, but easily fixable.

Reading other reviews and people's thoughts on 4.0 before it was released, it seems the new shaders are much more intensive and there's not really any way to change that now, if you play the new Cradle of Humanity DLC.

Like all Egosoft titles, this one was rough around the edges at launch.  Now it's 2021 and X4 is wonderfully polished and I've really enjoyed playing it for 60 hours over the past two weeks.  I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed any of the previous X-series!  The usual bugs/annoyances with AI flight/docking will always be there, sure, but it's nothing game-breaking.  Make ample use of the PAUSE button on your keyboard so you can issue commands to your ships, and you can save some frustrations.

New players, you'll have to put a fair bit of time into learning the interface and mechanics.  5-10 hours, even.  In-game tooltips are somewhat lacking but the tutorials are there now and aren't too bad.  But be prepared to google ""how to do..."" a few times, as the game is quite complex.  Don't give up, once you master how to work and control the game, it's a very enjoyable experience!  (I'm still fumbling to find where some stuff is in the interface after 128 game hours but maybe I'm just a slow learner).  

The experience and freedom you will enjoy in this game is absolutely worth the effort and learning curve.  Capturing ships, walking onto their bridges, building stations and walking around on them, setting up supply chains, going to war, exploring the universe - there is a lot to do and the slow pace of the game can keep you entertained for a very long time!!!

* I have no reason to care about any of these races, factions, or people.
* The entire universe is just a bunch of generic quests filled with copy and paste NPC's.
* I have no reason to hate the main enemy, they are just another generic race.
* If a black hole randomly appeared and took out 90% of the map there would be no substantial difference in game play.


A few things that they can do to improve.

* Put some story elements in this game.
* The main player star base should be rewarded after a long series of quests and relationship building with a faction.
    * Currently its just given to you for pretty much turning the game on.
* Lock the ability to buy anything other then crap ships at the start.
    * This will force a  player to pick a side and follow the story line of that faction.
    * or force them to start acting like pirates to get better ships.
* Make me care that I am helping or hurting a faction.
    * You can  put some civilian interactions in the game to give the choices you make some weight.
    * You can add this feature to ships you take over for example
        * Allow People to escape the ship if you take it over.
        * Hold them hostage
        * If you always kill them off make it so a faction will go into enemy territory just to hunt you down.
* The broadcast woman in the stations when your docked, make her say something useful for once.
* Make certain hero's for each faction that are just bad-asses, like WW1 red barons, or some commanders, or rulers, so that you fear them coming after you.

Before people start saying there is plenty of story in this book, fan fiction, and previous games. 
The game should make me fall in love with the universe so that I go back and read/play those things.

I honestly want this game to do better because I love these types of games, but they need to stop wasting time on dumb things like volumetric fog and focus on making this game more alive.

[b] Initial Take [/b]

Very unnecessarily difficult to figure out 'everything' which isn't much anyways. I assigned most of my mapping fine. However the 'F2 External View' is locked and the 'Camera Mouse Look' key won't seem to do anything [I figured out that you can only Camera Look in the secondary view mode for the F2 view (double tap it)]. Developers take heed to my suggestion: Make the game a better first-time experience for people who have never played a previous X game. Intuitive menus, sensible positioning of UI elements, less overall confusion would benefit everyone. This [i] really [/i] doesn't have to be 'EVE 2' trying to learn menus from YouTube videos. The map/fleet management screen is pretty rugged. I'm pretty sure you also can NOT go down to planets as well. There are lots of cool features that would shine brighter if the formatting was presented more intuitively.

[b] Comparison [/b]

I was assuming this would be less buggy than Star Citizen, wrong lul. This game's immersion level is the closest to that game, however that game is very empty/limited on things to do, has no such NPC recruitment/management functions, and is still only one solar system LUL. Elite Dangerous you're glued to the inside of your ship/your ship is an instance.  So IMHO X4 demolishes ED in immersion alone (so far). More immersive and a less 'confining feeling' is a major plus for me. It apparently has functions for the management of crews and fleets, but I have yet to determine it worthwhile. Managing empires like Stellaris is apparently a thing and I will do my best to let you know if its worth your time once I get there.

My hours played would be more but game crashes and bugs particularly during missions seem to be a thing. Willing to change review upon necessary changes met. Will continue trying to learn the game around any horrendous bugs by trying different player starts because it is unique*. Just can't recommend this title to everyone in it's current state.

[b] Major Suggestions For Developers [/b]

Aside from talking to people, using the trader, watching ships get 'pixellated' together (built), and hiring NPC's, the ONLY other first person features seem to be with the space suit. No third person for the player character, no guns or armor or any FPS player combat only ship-oriented combat. Such an addition would be amazing. There is a function to 'deploy marine units' I haven't tried yet but I hope that if not now, then eventually we can hold a gun and take over stations on foot with our troops/boarding fights. So far every enemy I fight just gets blown up, no boarding and no negotiation seems to happen. Not exactly space GTA is this? But could be..

The 'fleet management' function seems to mostly just be clicking on lists of your stuff, limiting your experience to clicking things on a map (that you can't change the opacity of and is very limited in features). This waste of a great function with 'way-point based commanding' seems highly redundant. Maybe I just don't like the map. Maybe I think they could have used the comms system for a lot more. 

However, nothing else like X4 exists at the moment.  Consider the aforementioned suggestions and get making the next X game an MMO. You'll have everyone interested.

*Elaboration on 'unique': First and Third person fairly immersive space combat/fleet/station/empire management sim. Decent amount of ships (4 classes), races, factions, NPC's everywhere making you feel like its a living-breathing world instead of just an empty sandbox. Hire a captain and be lazy on board that ship or from your own space station. Would ultimately love to recommend the game, after all it has modding support. And as we all know what the devs can't finish these days, the community may create and implement as optional mods. The problem is that I'm not willing recommend something that merely has immense potential. Will certainly [i] consider [/i] changing this review to positive in the future if any of the aforementioned issues/suggestions are valiantly met.",1616285953,1616444629,False,6,1,0.573204219341278076,0,True,False,False

I see a lot of complains and weirds explainations about ""how it was in X2 or X3"", about the lack of informations, etc (actually you don't need to use the encyclopedia to know how the Universe works. Just experience thru living in the universe, and you will know all you need).

Even if I'm ""new"" on X4, I had some really good and long time on the X2 and X3, with a big multi-sector empire in every one of them. So my comment and experience will have a particulary name :

[h1]""On every X Universe games, I experience the same feelings and that is the reason I like it so much""[/h1]

[list]
[*] Step 1 : Frustration about how complex it is and how different from the last version it is (for example : X2 to X3 was a huge step, not so about the content (ships…) but with the general interactions and universe life).
[*] Step 2 : Experience the hard work : Basics things like trying and leanrning from the game. It is good for everything : docking, buying, upgrading, fighting, selling, managing…
[*] Step 3 : Frustration about all the things I now understand but don't master and the time it will requier to me to know how to do all those things. [i]But in a weird and precious good way.[/i]
[*] Step 4 : Evolving with the game and see all the balance the devs manage to apply to the incredebly complex X universe system, pretty much unique in his kind. Nevertheless being pretty simple once knowing the ""basics"".

Half of the items have no description at all, so you're left wondering what they do. Still even in version 3.0 most missions have no description yet, so there's a lot of luck and guesswork as what needs to be done. Crew members are hireable but with the exception of Captains don't seem to serve any purpose, and there is nothing to tell you what they do.

So many things have been unnecessarily added that make the game worse than the previous X games. For instance:

When you dock at a station you can't just open a comm channel to hire crew, talk to npcs, pick up cargo etc, you have to get out and spend 5 minutes running around looking for them. On that note the NPCs you're looking for often inexplicably teleport around the station. In previous games you could send a transport ship to pick up NPCs by the dozen, not in this game though, you have to fly there in person and talk to them individually.

You can walk around inside your ship and see your captain take the helm when you spacewalk. In other words you have to click the captains chair to fly the ship, watch the captain then clip through the chair/floor/walls/you then click it again to start flying, often with the npc captain still standing in front of your field of vision. Also NPC management seems very buggy. I have a manager on my ship for my station, but for love nor money I can't transfer him as although the command is there nothing happens.

Unless you're willing to spearhead testing this game I'd hold off buying it for now. It's a complicated game to understand, with an unintuitive interface, near useless tutorials and the Wiki has yet to be written.

Edit: I'm very much looking forward to version 3.0. Most of my points above claim to be addressed in the patch notes.

Edit: Unfortunately version 3.0 is a disappointment. All the bugs that caused me to stop playing 2.0 are still present, and they've actually managed to make several aspects of the game worse. Auto traders have essentially been removed from the game as all new hires now are 1 star and in the time it's taken me to earn 300,000,000 credits not one of my captains has reached 3 stars, not even close, and even basic auto trading requires a 3 star captain.

Edit: Unfortunately version 4.0 is even worse. They've not fixed the previous mentioned issues and have now nerfed both mining and crystal mining into oblivion. So starting a new game now there is no reliable way to make money without using mods. Add to that crystal mining was one of the few things you actually needed to do yourself, so now you might as well just stand static in a station and order ships around through the map.

The good news is now X4 is now more likely to become X:Rebirth 2 rather than actually X4 I've given up waiting and gone back to the superior in every regard X3:Albion Prelude. I highly recommend THAT game.",1543669657,1616404374,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game gives you freedom to do whatever you want.
Yes, there is a steep learning curve if you are new to the mechanics of the game. Dont be discouraged by this as you got an great amount of control of these mechanics. 
check out some tutorials by gamers that figured out X4 like the youtuber Captain Collins and you know how to various things.

Dont cheap out on the DLC either, the Split and Terran races add their own sectors, ships and station modules to the game. The Split are pretty much the Klingons, focusing on firepower with their ships. great ships to enforce your rule upon others. and their stations and ships look really unique. Their rattlesnake class destroyers got some serious forward facing firepower to pummel stations or other capital ships to dust.
Plus one amazing fleet carrier.

Where the Terrans are the Star Trek Federation technology-wise that came out of the wrong side of the bed and ran into an fight with their A.I alarm clock and after that fell down the stairs to have an fight with their A.I Toaster machine in the kitchen.
They dont like A.I very much, And got some nasty but awesome looking combat ships to deal with them.
You kind of understand why they got dedicated war ships when the A.I ships came to Earth in the past to do ""format C: drive"" On humanity. 

The Devs respond often trough various media and actively are busy improving this game. They often release patches that are free like the 4.0 update last week that fix issues or introduce new features to the game.

i Personally love this game. I hope the missing races from X3 are coming back as DLC to X4 like the Borons. I know its going to be difficult for the Devs as they are an aquatic race. And you can enter/exit/walk around any ship in the game. But i still have Hope.

- Economy (mostly): The economy model is fantastic. I am now making good money and learning to fine-tune my profitzzss. On my second attempt I have 8 or 9 factories, 2 of which are self-sustaining, have maintenance yards, and generate half of my credits. I have a fleet of cargo ships and auto-miners which contribute as well.
- Ships: Oooo I LOVE that new-destroyer smell! I now have 8 destroyers, a carrier, 2 dozen medium attack craft and gunships, and 70+ fighters. I like how customizable the ships are and how specialized some of them have to be. I like being able to swap parts from different empires to build super-ships.
- Strategy: I learned to focus on Xenon containment and pushback, which has really allowed the various empires to flourish. I built defense stations at key  jumpgates to contain them (essential). It's relatively easy to not make enemies with the major empires.
- Organic Universe: In the two times I've played the universe has evolved differently.

My gripes:
- Space stations are mostly empty and running around them is lame. The insides are so big they feel like they belong in an MMO with dozens of other players in them.
- Programming the keyboard/joystick layout is challenge, specifically finding some of the functions (""what do they call it when I'm trying to get my ship to do  ____?"").
- When I am using keyboard controls and I hit the analog thrust on my gamepad, it kills the thrust before increasing to my input level. This is VERY annoying when I forget this before starting combat.

Overall, X4 is a good game. It has it's quirks and annoyances, but so does my wife of 19 years... It has a lot more upside. Once you get sucked in you'll have hundreds of hours into it. My old review would've been a 5/10, now I'd rate it an 8/10. Given how Egosoft constantly works to improve it, someday it might be an 9 or 10.

Old Review:
I quit playing the game for a year to give the devs time to complete what was/is a very incomplete game. I just started playing again and I returned to find the game only slightly improved. I encountered a new bug where my throttle was defaulting to 50%, which I spent over two hours troubleshooting. The game is not a complete waste, but I do find it frustrating and disappointing. X2 and X3 Terran Conflict are the gold standard which the last two games have struggled to live up to.",1577030825,1616331485,True,0,0,0.676220595836639404,0,True,False,False

Absolutely not.

I've stupidly played longer than ten hours so Steam wouldn't let me refund it even if I tried, but at twenty-seven hours in (27 hours, for those of you who will comment without reading) I'm calling it. This is a bad game. Do not buy it, do not gift it, and if you get it as a gift I'd suggest asking politely if you can get the older, better X3 that has given myself and many others hours upon hours of fun. I didn't play Rebirth because I, apparently correctly, surmised that it was hot garbage, but this? This is an actual X game and it's terrible.

Just read all the other negative reviews, I cannot possibly waste enough time explaining in great detail all the things wrong while covering everything. I just can't. There's so much wrong with this title that it cannot and should not be bothered with. All the ""bugs"" that were supposedly fixed, that I've read about, I'm experiencing years later. For those veterans of the X series the UI and menu spaghetti is still present and I think it might actually be worse now. Features that people talked about early on, like auto-trading, seem to be missing and there's some discussion that it was removed so the crew experience gimmick and grind could get its time in the sun.

There is just so much wrong, over such a long period of time, that searching up the information about whatever you're curious about is futile. You will encounter conflicting information, even from the developers, because it was only relevant back then. There's so much complaining about things that you can't find out about any of it and the tutorials in the game break easily so you can't be taught properly anyway. I have played this series since it started and this game will please no one.

So I'd say do not buy this, even if it's on sale. By the time they ""fix"" this one I think you might be better off just playing something else. I hate to say this about an X game, but even long-time veterans are going to wind up annoyed.

EDIT:
After the 4.0 update I would say that this is fine to buy on sale because, while a lot of the issues I've talked about are still there, the ""menu spaghetti"" is less now.

You can actually order ships to directly do something, like capturing an abandoned ship, that could only have been left up to global orders. AI seem to behave better in squadrons and, while I've never used it, you can issue a ""coordinated attack"" now that I assume mimics the AI dogpiling on you when you're deep in Xenon space or something. Mining is less easy now and you do have to defend your own ships from raiders and I like that, it actually adds some challenge to the game without being an annoying and frustrating experience. However, this is just my own personal experience.",1591938739,1616303603,False,4,0,0.466207325458526611,6,True,False,False

Are you fucking kidding me?! 

=======================================================================

Don't get me wrong! I am a super fan of X series! This time, I am really disappointed. After almost 16 months since the initial release of the game, its optimization is still a huge problem! 

According to my prior experience related to X games, if you keep playing the game, with more stations and ships built in the game, the game will run slower and slower! Optimize your LOD or Modeling part a little bit, utilize the muti-threading techniques to better squeeze the CPU! 

Another mysterious staff I cannot really understand why I open the map, the FPS drops dramatically? What magic have you guys cast in this map system? 

I will wait for another huge update, and I will modify my comment if things are getting better at that time.


=======================================================================
OK. Maybe when I have time I will double check the technical support page.

I got an update of my hardware recently:
CPU: AMD R9 3900X (It should be a huge boost though)
GPU: GTX1080 (the old one)
MEM: 32GB (2666MHZ)
Game is installed in an SSD, the loading is pretty fast.

The short conclusion is that I still cannot get stable 60 fraps, simply updating CPU does not help too much.

The FPS do increased from ~45 -> 55 in my old save, but when I fly to the second contact | flash point (I cannot remember the correct name), basically it's a sector with a lot of asteroids. the FPS drops below 30 FPS, and even I set the graphics quality to LOW! 

I started a new game with no MODS, and fly back to the second contact | flash point, well, it runs at 60 FPS, Hm.... interesting.  Basically, the mod I disabled is Faction Enhancer series and Rise of the Ossian Raider. Maybe I should try the vanilla version before installing anything...

=======================================================================
With the 4.0 update and ""No Fog"" mod, the fps finally is at a reasonable range. Most time in regular space (with a few ships + many asteroids) > 80 fps, with empty space > 120 fps, in the shipyard or busy station > 55 - 70fps (depends on traffic).

It's very different from X3. (Tried 2 hours of rebirth and that was more than enough to know it wasn't for me)

It's definitely got a focus on being able to move about the world, and it does so very beautifully. There's seamless interactions from standing up in your ship while your autopilot finishes docking and waiting for the door to open, watching out the window as you land. It's really well done.

The world is immense, sectors are kind of different, and highways and novel transportation types really help you get out there and find new areas to explore. I got caught in the middle of a Xenon raid, and ended up hastily trying to dock at a station coming under fire, while returning fire with stationary turrets. Normally that would be pretty straightforward in X3, just pew pews and little lasers, but in X4 the experience was much more kinetic. Can't wait to experience some large scale battles I can take part in.

As for gameplay, I'm still learning the basics. I've done a few missions, but most of the gameplay so far has been getting used to the controls and UI. Being familiar with X games, I know that's half the battle.

- 2 hours of tutorial learning to fly

- 2 hours flying around trying to find some missions to do
- Giving up.
- 2 hours of mining enough crystals to buy a mining ship
- 1 hours of googling how to buy a mining ship and assign it, why I can't tell it to go somewhere else, what a resource probe is for, what effect crew have on a ship
- Giving up

[b]Notes[/b]
As is often the case with game series that have a long history, many of the reviews are of the nature ""This game isn't exactly the same as the last game, so I don't like it"". Looking past those I could see that playing this was going to take some serious investment but it would apparently be rewarding in the end. I was determined to give it a decent shot and hopefully find an excellent space sandbox to get lost in. I'm sure that underneath all of the terrible UI and lack of information there IS a decent space sandbox here, but the developers seem to have done their best to turn away anyone who isn't already a hardcore fan. I'm sure if they hired a UI designer to completely overhaul the interface it would be far friendlier to newcomers, but as it stands, the lack of information in-game and confusing interface make it impossible to like.

Everything. EVERYTHING I wanted to do required me to Google it. From how to traverse systems, which faction to join, how to earn money, how to find a shipyard, how to find crystals, where to buy a resource probe, how to set up a mining ship, what a trade computer does, all of it had to be found in random forum posts on the internet.

I would love to recommend this, but only with a heavy warning that you're going to need to be extremely patient, and be ok with Googling everything.

[b]Pros[/b]
+ Docking is easy
+ No loading screens at all. Getting into your ship, flying in-system, fast travelling are all instant
+ Autopilot works pretty well
+ Excellent background music
+ Nice ship models
+ In theory it's possible to set up an automated empire based on mining, refining, trade and space stations, but I gave up long before I managed to get into that

[b]Cons[/b]
- I got stuck inside an asteroid. Instead of crashing into it, I flew inside the model. Then I couldn't fly out of it.
- There's very little information within the game on how to do anything, and a ton of missing information on the UI. Any time I decided I wanted to do anything, I had to Google it. ""Why can't I interact with this signal?"" ""How do I find a ship dockyard?"" ""How do I find something to do?"" ""Why do I stop moving every time I open the map?"" ""Where can I buy resource probes?"" ""What does hiring service crew actually do?"". Even Reddit didn't know what crew actually did - just guesswork from people who've played hundreds of hours and deductions made from comments from the devs.
- There is an encyclopaedia in the game, but it's missing descriptions of the factions so you can decide who to side with, and it's missing descriptions for many items in the game
- Voice acting is really not great, it sounds amateurish. So are the dialogue lines that play repeatedly.
- The NPC models and facial animations are atrocious
- Optimisation is pretty bad. I just about scraped 60fps where other AAA games are over 120.
- You have to double click all the menu items
- There is no up to date wiki. There isn't really any official up to date information of any kind. Every time I wanted to look something up (because it's not in the game), I usually ended up on Reddit threads
- Very few NPC models. I've seen the same grumpy female in every station I've visited
- The software in the ship store doesn't tell you what it does. ""Trading software MX1"", zero description
- The game is too unintuitive to work any of the stuff out on your own, so you're left to resort to following guides, which have a very specific set of instructions for 'buy this sell that, mine here, buy these ships' which kind of takes all the fun out of it
- Almost every time I logged in, I felt ""What am I supposed to do?"". ""Play your own way"" is great, as long as it's clear what your options are. The game describes itself as an open ended 'do whatever you like' game, but really when it comes down to it, it's an economics game and everything you can do is based around trade.

Ship movement is so bad they disabled collisions for NPC ships so now they fly INTO stations & other ships getting stuck. Missions are broken., not buggy but broken. Complete a race that can't be done in a ship with over 900m/s & 11000m/s speeds. Its a game that could make better use of multiple CPU cores than almost any other game out there and yet the game can't even seem to use 1 core. The game NEEDS mods and yet Egosoft seems determined to restrict features to people not using mods. Ship management is abysmal and fleets are just a mass of ships operating like a headless chicken. 600 hours in a game and no pilots have improved skills.. not one. They can be improved with seminars but they don't do enough to make a pilot actually useful. I'll do a proper review eventually but it won't improve things. The latest update also seems to use a load more GPU power and yet runs slower & laggier than ever. It turns into a 5fps slideshow a lot.

so.. Missions are broken, NPCs are broken, game economy is broken, turrets are broken, factions are broken, ship commands are broken, fleets are broken, graphics are broken and progression bloat gets really bad.  Finally.. something positive.. sound is ok if a bit annoying.

TLDR...  X4 is a very elaborate space game engine/sandbox.. it needs someone to finish it, fix all the broken parts and build an actual game around it. It can be fun if you have A LOT of patience.

Update: I was wrong, sound is broken too. Ship pathing is broken too unless there is a way to clip through stations like NPCs do. The latest DLC (4.0) has shit-awful ship designs and of course the story is broken too but unless you know this you'll end up wasting time trying to get Terran materials with no access to Terran space.. genius! OK so something positive.. I can do this.. hmm.. one of the paint jobs isn't bad. I dont remember which but I think it has a T in in.. or a vowel.. i forgot.

Been playing X series since X2.
X4
The dog fighting from X2/X3 has been removed, Some of the ships of the Terrans have been replaced with ships that look like they where made by the Paranid, (where is the Vidar,Oden ect?).
Rather than fixing the problem with AI pathing the devs just removed collision damage (beyond lazy), The old Iconic Terran weapons (Starburst,Point Singularity Projector) all removed for some generic Argon clone weapons (that sound terrible).
Big ships and AI 
I have lost so many Carriers because they don't do as commanded when commanded. (they like to slow down and wait for a tiny fighters)
Still no Co-Op
X2/X3 had co-op mods... 2021 why are we still waiting ?
If you want to experience X series get X3 Terran conflict its the best in the series, again sad but it probably always will be.

System specs are on my steam profile.

This game is still unoptimised beyond belief, the constant boring bland content that this developer puts out with their shallow promises of the CPU fix being worked on.  Which we will never get because the fanboys keep wanking off their ego.
The community for this game is totally dead now with only the investors and backers present on the steam forums, stay away from this game, 

TLDR: it DOES NOT work correctly on a multi-core system, has severe ulitilisation issues when it comes to performance, the game launchs and is fairly ok for the first hour then it grinds to a crawl since the entire universe runs in the background, menus will drop your framerate even more and the map... oh the map is the one that essentially cuts your frame to around 10-15 fps, then add to that the fact that your going to want SETA and then game just chuggs down to single frames.

Ignore those stupid idiots on steam that say the game is fine, I had one encounter with one of them and it turned out he was a employee of Bethesda.  Theres way too much biased opinion on this game to how it runs and they seem to think that a fps of 15 is acceptable.



Update 01/08/2020

Came back to this after the 3.30 update.

Game still has no optimisation  for multicore systems, with my I7 9700k at 5ghz, 32GB of DDR4 3000 mhz, GTX 1080TI, this game is still absolute trash, it comes to a crawl after 2-3 hours of game play, in-game settings still affect performance in NO WAY what-so-ever.

Mods to improve performance will initially help frame drops but after a few hours the economy stalls as the  massive amount of strain the single core threading starts to cripple any hardware, Egosoft have stated that there wont be a fix to address this matter, unless you have a computer that resembles the Monolith from the 2001 Space Odyssey honestly don't bother with this X, stick to Albion Prelude.

Short and Sweet

If you use mods in X4 it locks out some of the features of the game.

Same engine as Rebirth, so runs like absolute garbage even on a gen 8 system
NPCS and mass traffic are a major bug-bear, NPC captain in a Cap ship doesnt know where his headquarters is or a shipyard
Mass traffic around stations brings the game to a crawl after an hour or so gameplay

Weapons are absolute rubbish, same as rebirth: all overheat
Missiles are a absolute joke, no turn rate, have this drunked response time
Torpedos are half decent for actual cap ship combat
pulse is well pulse maser - underpowered starting weapon, even high tiers are crap, use bolt thrower
bolt repeater is the gatling gun - still over heats, bad dmg output through all tiers
beam emitter is the heavy laser - fires for around 3.5 secs then has to reload or something
shard cannon is the space shotgun, but its heavily nerfed
plasma cannons are very meh, first mod i made was to increase the shots speed, theya re so slow
ion blaster - does only damage to shields, this isnt bad in all honesty

Economy grinds to a halt after around 6-10 hours of gameplay
Ships are not very interesting due to weapon variety being lackluster",1546980319,1616173626,False,4,1,0.444955825805664063,0,True,False,False

That being completely breaking the mining feature thanks to some background poll that was conducted. Miners not only act strangely by flying away from the ore they are aiming for originally, but now ore yields have been dropped way down, pretty much non existent, in easier to access areas with high patrols. Now you are expected to venture out a lone fighter and your first miner and risk it all to be obliterated by Xen or Khak patrols and lose it all. Or you can spend hours trying to farm crystals manually, or other tedious tasks. Fact is mining was the easiest money maker for new and recent players like me, and with this change we've all been flipped the bird. Another promising title ruined by the stupid mentality of ""harder= more fun"" The developers also seem to be ignoring the problems cause by this update and not commenting on any thread posting about the above issues, do yourself a favor and avoid this game and any other game made by Egosoft. They are buggy, the AI is terrible, and to solve problems (when they actually decide to) it takes them years and a new game just to cut a corner to solve it for example Autopiloting in X3 had a 50/50 chance to result in the pilot blowing up the ship by colliding with something.

However, I decided after 2 DLCs, and nearly 300 hours... Unfortunately the soul of this game feels dead... X3TC was my first ever space sandbox game, and boy did it engross me. I spent countless hours killing enemies in the missions and eventually farmed up enough money to purchase my own corvette, followed by a destroyer, only to realize while I could pilot it, It was slow, boring, and much more of a strategic tool than a player ship.

Then I discovered complexes, factories, and not only could I fly any ship I wanted, but I could, eventually, build a fleet from the bottom up. From the hull plating to the weapons to the missiles. I amassed a huge fleet, and thought that X3, while unintuitive and somewhat annoying, was one of the best games I had ever stumbled across.

In X4 you can do all these things, and if you can get over the jank of the interface present in all egosoft games, you can do it reasonably well. Certainly things could be simpler, AI  could be better, fleet command could be easier, crew training could be more fun, etc... But honestly, the reason I play egosoft games is because they offer such a unique, fundamentally awesome experience that I can easily look past all of the above.

What I can't look past, after 2 years and 2 DLCs is what amounts to laziness and a lack of soul. Here are a couple things that truly made X3 stand apart from X4, and while the split DLC seemed to move us a bit closer to the X universe feel, the Terran DLC seems just as soulless  as the base game (although the story is good!)

Diverse, unique, meaningful weapons and MISSILES with trade-offs and no ""best weapon"", only situationally better ones 
A weapon-energy/capacitor system linked to weapons, to encourage said diversity
Diverse, unique, meaningful ships with different strengths and radically different designs and geometries.
Fleshed out lore with a full encyclopedia, a fully voiced bitching Betty, and an easily understood, FUN mission system.
Factions that feel unique, different, and alive.

The worst part about it is I can't even put my finger on exactly what needs to change to bring back the ""feel"" of the X universe, but something about it died after X3. Even worse? Huge parts of X4 are objectively superior. Station design and ship customization spring to mind immediately.

So why is X4 less fun than X3? Lack of varied weapons? Reskinned ships for each faction? Lack of encyclopedia entries? The truth is I don't know. But I can't shake the feeling that X4 won't ever be as engrossing, alive, or fun as X3, and while nostalgia is a bitch, the truth is I can go back to X3 and find 90% of the magic I originally found, wishing that the improvements in X4 could somehow be moved backwards in time to make the perfect X game...

I feel sorry saying this, but if graphics aren't that important, go play X3TC and X3AP instead, or install VRO, a mod that moves X4 closer to a true successor of my favorite space franchise.

Closing: Devs, if by some miracle you read this, X4 is awesome, but it needs a soul, an encyclopedia, and the diversity that VRO has added to the game at a bare minimum. Maybe, if we are lucky, the last DLC will accomplish this... I certainly hope so",1616130616,1616131220,False,5,0,0.51095116138458252,0,True,False,False

However, that's about where the pros end.  If you were looking for Homeworld, Freelancer, Freespace 2, or Wing Commander, keep right on walking.  This game is purely about economics, because that's about the only thing it's doing semi right at the moment.

The Good:

Space station building is pretty good.  It's the best the X series has seen and I was able to build a gigantic closed loop and basically print money.  The strategic map is the best I've seen in the X series, if you are familiar with the X series, the economic data is quite helpful when you have a satellite network and the ability to send traders over to buy and sell wares has been made easier.  Plus, the Auto Trader seems to be working, so my station was able to finally get those wares for research I always struggled to get.  I hope you weren't getting your hopes up.

The Bad.
Highways.  I want them gone.  X-Rebirth was a terrible game and it must be deleted from history.  They are derpy, look like sh*t, and make me feel like I'm driving a car in the city.

Whilst the graphics are much improved over the true X4 predecessor, X3, they are still cheaply made.  The character models and animations are bargain bin garbage, the ship models are hit and miss, the clouds, fogs, space particles, and asteroids, are all garbage that makes me feel like I'm flying in an acid trip and not in a vacuum.  My kid walked in and asked if I was flying in fart gas.

I'm sick of fog and gas everywhere.  The static asteroids that just sit there surrounded by ""fart"" gas, and pop in and out of existence as I hit the draw distance or load into the map.  It makes me feel like the map designer just quickly plopped down spheres in concentrated areas just to fill up space on a map with their in house map editor.  In short, space is vast and empty, but this game condenses everything into tight spaces, yet requires you to make long drives on stupid snaking highways just to get to those city areas.  It's making me feel like I am a taxi driver and not a space explorer.  The map design and highway system simply breaks immersion.  I'm out.

Sound.
Some good, like Music, but, mostly bad, like practically all engine noise that roars through the station walls or in the bridge of your capital ship.  The sound engine is obnoxious, and so are the character voices.  Combat sound is OK, but the explosions will not only blow up your ship, but your ear drums.  Everything from sampling to noise to lack of dampening effects ruin immersion.  Keep the audio turned down/off for the best experience.

The story is terrible.  
The X series has nice lore, but the story telling has always been B movie quality.  The voice actors are terrible.  The audio is terrible.  The lines are cliche.  I just go to X and shoot Y and hope I don't die again.  Basically, once I unlocked the station, I stopped playing the story until 4.0 came out.  Then I tried the 4.0 story.  One of the ""exciting"" campaign story characters is a blue eyed black man with glistening shoe polish skin, owning a Jewish sounding name and sporting a penis shaped hair cut.  The ridiculous hair and chimpanzee ears just made me think that character was an inside office joke and it ruined my experience.  Couldn't make a more obvious black face character if you tried.  

The writing is so bad, and the character design so God awful...I just decided to toggle them hostile and let my capital ships deal with them.  

AI.  
Yea, it sucks.  Don't let those cool carrier videos fool you.  Those fighters are just going to get stuck somewhere and die.  Path finding is still terrible.  My station is large and complicated, but I spent a great deal of time making very clean and wide space lanes that the AI ships simply refuse to find and navigate.  Instead, they prefer to ride the hand of God and be magic slid to and from the docking berth.  The path finding was so bad, previously, in literally all X series titles, that the dev team finally decided to reduce, if not turn off asteroid collision for the AI because they couldn't stop the AI's from suiciding while in transit.  The leading cause of death for transports in X3 wasn't pirates, it was asteroids.  Feel safe, my friends, that ships will simply fly through stations and obstacles right before your very eyes, but not your ship, no, you will die, unless you clip through the station floor or get stuck inside the walls.  Easiest way to kill enemy stations is to clip through the hangar decks and blast away.  Nobody can get you in clipping land.
 
Instead of figuring out how to path around a sphere or fix the path finding engine, it was simpler to simply grant God mode or no clip for the stupid AI ships.  *sigh*  A problem that has been around for 20 years, obviously using the same junk code from 2003 and terrible level design.  Recycle the same garbage from your previous games and never fix it.  I'm done with it.  

Combat AI is terrible.  You will either destroy the stupid AI pilots, they will cheese and magic boost away from you, or you will get swarmed and die.  You have 3 choices.  Don't bring friends or they will die.  Basically, newb pirates are the only things your AI fighters can gang up on and live, but even still, they will find a way to park right in front of one of the interceptors and lose half their health, and don't get me started on land mines.  Land mines on your map?  Oh yea, your AI will definitely run into those.  Best friends.  Fighters are practically useless.

Ship design.
On paper it seems like we have more design choices than we did in X3.  However, there really isn't that much more than what we had in X3.  We still have low, medium, and high quality variants of ship, and we are still limited to specific shield types and specific weapon types in specific slots.  The only difference now is we actually see the weapon on the ship, which is a visual upgrade over the old game.  In retrospect, I preferred the look of the ship in the old game over a vessel with giant glowing modular pieces hanging off it.  I think the devs can do a slightly better job hiding the modules under the hulls so the ships keep more of their original look.  The modules don't really change anything, they all look about the same.  I usually just by the one with the best stats because I don't want to die.

Load Times.
Compressed, not compressed, doesn't matter.  Go make a pot of coffee and get a hair cut.  It's bad.

In summary.  After I built my mega station, I just didn't feel like playing anymore.  The story was terrible, and the space combat was so bad that I just didn't care to crank out the space navy.  There isn't a fleshed out RTS mode or grand strategy aspect of the game.  You have to build a giant game crashing fleet to have any effect against the Xenon, because your ships will likely derp out and get killed, so you need to swarm the Xenon derp.  It's just a waste of time.  

Fun to fly around and dock with my carrier and play around with stations for a bit, but after that, the game got boring and the end game is bugged to sh*t because AI and path finding is terrible.  Graphics, map design and sound break exploration immersion.  Fart gas is annoying.  ""Volumetric clouds"" never took an astronomy class.  You don't see gas everywhere when you are in a nebula.  It's still black.  Asteroids are too small, too many, and too close.  Characters are dumb.  If path finding is truly fixed and the fleet battles become like Homeworld, then I might come back.  It's kind of possible to move ships in the tactical screen like homeworld, but the fighters will most definitely derp out.",1615997243,1616062492,False,87,13,0.644262373447418213,0,True,False,False

I then compared it to the Default Thrustmaster Profile, and I only had to edit my preferences for Strafe and Yaw onto my rudder.
If you don't like Flight assist make sure you bind that to your controller.
I have no issues with crashes so far
The graphics are beautiful, not problems running it on Ultra

Overall this is NOT X-Rebirth Launch, and so far from what I can tell, Egosoft really took the lessons they learned from other X Universe games, and delivered us what we, as X3 fans were craving for. I DON'T get the impression that this is X-Rebirth Reboot.

As for a con: In the controller set up, I would have labeled ""YAW and Pitch"" instead of Turning, that would have saved me a bit of time in the trial and error of setting up my controller.

Controls are very clunky, hard to turn, constantly fighting with them. My PS4 controller just makes me spin in circles, so that one isnt supported at all for this game. Long recharge on weapons makes you wait between shots, always has me again fighting with the controls. In combat, I dont like one shot, then waiting 10+ seconds to launch one more shot, then another delay... puts me a little on edge.

This game has been out since 2018, I really did not expect to fall through the floor on a ship in the tutorials... that really makes me have to give a thumbs down on this game. Everything looks really awesome, but I expected a lot more after two years of development. Disappointed to say the least.

[b][i] Anyone wanting a finished bug-free product should buy X3 Albion Prelude instead. With that out of the way, X4 gets a thumbs up from me despite a bunch of annoying bugs. [/i][/b]
Being able to fight and own (capture/buy) almost every ship I see is a MASSIVE plus for me (which was missing in Rebirth). I see insane amounts of modding potential for this so if anyone wants to wait before buying and let the modders get cracking, you can do so but please consider supporting the devs. This is a team I personally want to back like I back CD Projekt Red. For players who see value addition in the modding potential of a game, look no further; X4 is what the doctor ordered.

[u][b] This game is NOT for anyone who: [/b][/u]
1) wants a 100% bug free experience
2) can't stand inconsistent graphical quality
3) can't do without good animation in character models
4) is not a fan of space sims
5) likes their space sims about as complex as Freelancer but not more
6) does not enjoy games with a steep learning curve
7) wants a replacement for Star Citizen
8) is not a fan of games that build up in tempo slowly

[u][b] This game is FOR anyone who: [/b][/u]
1) wants a true sandbox space sim that lets them play in any capacity they enjoy
2) wants a challenge
3) is willing to trust devs with a proven track record of supporting their games and is willing to play through a buggy launch
4) wants a game that is more likely than not going to have years worth of mods incoming to refresh and renew gameplay

[u][b] Some tips for the new player: [/b][/u]
1) SAVE OFTEN!! Don't rely on Quicksave only and save in different slots as something simple as getting permastuck in an elevator is possible at this point.
2) Play the tutorials
3) Try to do 'Easy' missions to build up funds towards your first Auto-trader and/or Auto-miner.
4) Get docking software mk2 from an equipment dock asap; manual landing gets old fast.
5) Watch videos on Youtube; many functions of the game are unintuitive and require a helping hand. Save yourself a lot of frustration and hassle by watching youtubers who are making videos for X4. Google is your friend. ;-)
6) Save crafting materials instead of selling; some are harder to find than others.
7) If you have auto-traders/miners running and nothing high priority to do in-game right away, run the game in borderless windowed and watch a movie or two while the game runs in the background and your loyal minions earn you money.
8) Auto-trade or manual trade in the sector of a faction increases reputation with that faction.
9) Disable auto-roll and speed reduction while in menus (they are ON by default). Also turn ON aim assist if it is turned off.

[u][b] The Pros: [/b][/u]
1) Fly/buy/capture almost every ship in the game.
2) Modification possible for ships but limited to weapons, shields, software and engines only.
3) Many variants of the same ship that make sense and allow you to customize your fleet according to your needs.
4) Open sandbox where you get to play police, pirate, trader, mogul or a bit of everything.
5) Faction system that works well with good pregression and unlocks making it feel worth it.
6) No loading screens between areas
7) Dedicated dev team with a proven track record squashing bugs left and right.
8) Modding potential to the max.
9) Your minions can mine and trade for you as well as fight and take yoiur banner to distant stars (so to speak).

[u][b] The Cons: [/b][/u]
1) A subjective point but I personally dislike the ship designs in this game. Seems like they regressed back to X2. Can't wait for mods to replace stock models.
2) Bugs. The bugs are real and can catch you unprepared and lose you a lot of progress if you are not saving often and in different slots.
3) Limited number of save slots.
4) Autopilot is pretty $h1t...
5) Turrets are borked, and I don't mean in a good way... :-(
6) Bad character animation and design for NPCs.
7) You can't see yourself if you look down. No animations or model for the player.
8) Many features unintuitive and despite their best efforts the menu system can still give you many wtf moments.
9) Graphics is pretty hit or miss. Most annoying is when you fly into a densely populated asteroid field... Poor levels of LOD and pop-in galore.
10) Launched with least number of factions in any X-game I have played, and I have played all of them since X2 (and skipped Rebirth, though I did buy it to support the devs).

Somehow X4 is incredibly addictive and immersive, despite having the ugliest character models and equally terrible voice acting. Get ready to cry when you see them cross their arms and stare at you with those vacant eyes of theirs, or if you hear the Split over the radios sounding awfully akin to a character from Rocco's Modern Life (I know that reference will hit with the old people playing this game).

That aside, satisfaction is guaranteed if you're willing to learn. Getting frustrated that the Xenon are laying waste to other factions? Contribute to their war economy. Having trouble with your fleets wanting to play bumper cars with the enemy? Learn turret behavior. 

Theres a story here, but I don't pay much attention to it--as it serves as a basic framework for you, the player, to have your own experience and story. Controls feel serviceable, but I cannot recommend enough that a gamepad or joystick is considered for flying the smaller craft.

That's the one main mistake I made when I fired up X4 as a veteran of X3 and had this sit in my library for a year before getting back into it and genuinely enjoying it far more than I thought I would.

The X games have a history of a simple idea: let the player do what they want. You want to just trade? Done. You want to build a sprawling economic empire with stations and traders? It's all available. You want to just get into a fighter, be pointed at an enemy, and rake in cash for busting the baddies? Piracy? Policing? Go get 'em! Maybe you just want to explore in a fast ship, checking out different locations and admiring the beauty of the environment and you can do that too. The game never stops you from what you want to do other than obvious things like having enough money to buy that capital ship you've dreamed of. 

For me, these type of games brings out a desire to trade. To be a key figure in the economy. And you certainly can do that (right now in my playing, I'm still forming a budding empire). And while I don't like how the system displays trade information to get into that, I found myself surprised at how easy it is to setup miners and traders in this game. If you played previous games, you know that you have to go through this whole process of having the right software and letting your pilot train until they get good enough to be set on their own. Here, you build a miner with some basic equipment, tell it what to mine and what sector to mine it in, and it goes. Similar for trading (you have to do more hand holding for a trader ship, but once it gets up to speed, it works on its own). Because of this, I've found myself being freed up to focus on building reputation, getting my stations built, and exploring a lot more than in previous games.
And there's a good bit to explore.

The game world is broken up into different sectors that, as far as I've seen so far, are connected by jump gates. There's also a highway system that will jet you across a huge area of the game world (and I highly recommend you just let it take you for a loop as a new player. It does make a big circle). Frankly after a couple of hours, you've pretty much seen everything you're going to see as far as variety of stations and objects. But you won't mind all that much. You'll have your sights on other things to handle.

There is a main quest line (beyond what some will say) that guides you like a tutorial. And you can completely ignore it, but highly recommended for new players as it introduces you to the game's major mechanics as you go, including getting a player base station and some ships. While playing it, don't hesitate to peel off at any time, but also don't let yourself get hung up on small details (you have a feature to scan for anomalies and also scan stations for more information. I got burned out trying to 100% scanning stations when I first started, only to find it's not really something worth doing, at least not early on). If anything, I'd say give yourself a purpose in this game, which the game will provide you with many choices for that, and start going after it. Side missions are plentiful, especially as you gain faction reputations. You really never have a point where you feel like there's nothing to do long story short. If anything you feel like a whole world of possibilities is laid out before you.
On the bad side, the game has some optimization issues and will chug in some areas and situations. Which isn't surprising when you realize how many things are running in the game environment. That same feeling of the game not holding your hand and leaving you wide open to it can make you feel overwhelmed. The tutorials are informative, but lack the polish that would really make it sink in better. And you are thrown a LOT of things you need to know to be a rookie pilot, much less get into the finer pleasures of the game. The tutorial was revamped since I first played to make it more pleasant and streamlined, but it still demands your attention if you hope to find any success in the game. Swapping to travel mode, for instance, was a huge turn off for me when I first started. But now that I'm comfortable with the game, I'm swapping in and out of it regularly. 
Other small issues are present too. The voice acting is almost tongue in cheek. Not quite bad, but the dialogue in the background makes it feel a bit cheesy at times. Character models are stiff and, while not ugly or bad, aren't going to blow anyone away. For those new to this sort of game, there is no mercy about being outclassed. If you go near an enemy ship that completely outguns you, you'll be destroyed literally within a couple of seconds. Which can be a nice reality check in the scale of the game, but might be a culture shock to new players. In X3, running into an object could easily wipe out your whole shield and destroy your ship. X4 has made impacts far less damaging, in many cases I didn't notice any damage from moderately hard collisions. While this is nicer to players, it does make the game feel closer to bumper cars when that happens. Also you'll have periods where you have to get out of your ship to do things. And it makes you appreciate the scale of the ships, but some of these ""events"" in your spacesuit in space also make you appreciate that the collision detection doesn't include your head. You'll be looking through environments and completely losing immersion. As well as the fun of bouncing off one wall after another in a hallway in zero G.

Overall I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone that wants a space sim. I don't know of any other game that comes close to the details, depth, and polish put into such a work. For those new to the series, take your time and enjoy it and if you get curious about the lore, there's a whole series of games to go check out. For veteran players who hated Rebirth (I know I did), this is a much better dive into the new mechanics and the sort of gameplay you loved in the past.",1615932124,1615932124,True,8,0,0.555345475673675537,0,True,False,False

I need to say that if you're willing to look past the many flaws and have a unequivocal set of nerves of steel along with a long attention span-- this game has tons of content and is more of a simulator than an actual game. There's aspects of economics, strategy, piloting skills, foresight and such, with the game being a hybrid of flight sim, RTS and RPG. 

In my opinion being the best space sci-fi RPG on the market currently, everything is simulated and everything you do has an actual impact on the in-game world, very much like Kenshi. You even get to design your own nation's or company's crest and roleplay as it. 
For example, I aligned myself with Argon and the Teladi and join the both in fighting the Xenon as they slowly but steadily pushed into my area of operations. Over 50 hours of gameplay later, I save up for a medium-sized gunship and worked along side with the Argon to push back the enemy. As I completely neglected the Teladi side of the conflict, I didn't realise that the Teladi lost 2 sectors, one of which had one of their main trading stations situated on and the other filled with factories. Due to this, not only did the Xenon fortify the absolute hell out of sectors only a few gates away from Argon's borders invading every few minutes with swarms of drones, but also the price of nearly every trade resource shot up, along with demand-- especially medical equipment. Now due to my actions in that save, the situation in that savestate is irreversible and I have to learn to live with the consequences or abuse it's dwindling market. 
And this is why I have been playing X4 Foundations on and off. Because the concept of the game is superb and there's a part of me which considers X4 to be one of the best games in my library, it's like having a second life in the game's universe with everything having a consequence. But at the same time many core aspects of the game are far from perfect, or even good in fact. I could list the flaws-- the UI, lack of information on anything, lack of proper tutorial and hints, odd pacing, bugs with missions, wonky collision models, balance issues, sound design, performance, lack of significant details in the cockpit, etc-- but that would take thousands of words.

But as it stands-- if you're willing to overlook the flaws and want to completely submerge yourself in some old-school sci-fi immersion where you can be anyone from a courier or a front-line pilot, to a governor and a fleet admiral, this game is pretty much perfect for you. Although, to be realistic, you will also have a love-hate relationship with this game, like anyone passionate about the franchise. And also, be ready for the long haul, as I personally have sunk a couple of hundred hours into this game and I'm still learning, with my first base and my first actually self-speced ship. Luckily though, that time isn't wasted in my case as I'm heavily enjoying myself and there's cloud support, so the possibility of losing my save is around none.

I heavily recommend X4 to any hardcore fan of sci-fi, but again, you need to have nerves of steel and god-like attention span to truly enjoy yourself. This is as the difficulty curve is a cliff, and lack of coherent information and hints only adds to that.",1591802784,1615748808,True,1,0,0.438271611928939819,0,True,False,False

What changed?

Well like many other reviewers here, it's easy to get sidetracked by all the new additions like free roam, being able to board stations and ships etc. People will extend this new feature into it's infinite potential and ask why there are limited spaces, why there are few mechanics related to your character. While we can discuss forever what could have been, we forget that this is a feature like many others that was nice to have, but not intended to be anything beyond that, it's certainly not about to become an FPS game. This is an indie dev who has made a sequel to X3, in a series of games designed to simulate an economy and deliver a sandbox universe. The goal for this series has always been the sandbox, empire building, exploration and being a space tycoon. It's never been about simulating populations, characters, and deep story, anything you ask for on those fronts takes away time from the developers who are intending to build a game about trading, fighting and building. While there is a deep lore and there are missions, many will remember that this small team took a risk with X Rebirth to bring us a game all about story with cinematic flare, cutscenes and scripted events. How did that end? The team being the size that it is, it is unfair to say that the missions are horrible or the story is non-existent 'therefore the game sucks', because from their point of view, we do not want that, we want sandbox, being able to control any ship, having vast trade networks just like X3, its a niche game with focused development on a specific sub-genre and it's advertised features. The games scope is limited by the success of sales and the size of the dev team, if you want the story of X rebirth combined with the content in X3, at the quality level of X4? well we will be waiting a LONG time, and they would be broke. It takes time to make ships of high quality, the consequence: Less ships, it takes time to make a stable sandbox economy, the consequence: Less story, it takes time to code the moving parts of 10000 ships and stations all existing in a single game universe, the consequence: The AI is not perfect at this time. It takes time to design a system where any small ship can dock to any large ship, the consequence: Standardised landing pads across all factions. No it doesn't take away flavor steam reviewers, it saves the devs time to work on more important matters like the AI you keep mentioning. 

This is not a triple A game with a triple A budget, so stop pretending that we're missing all these features, and look at what we have got, an awesome and beautiful trade game with infinite replayability within the universe it has been set in. Content will come, let's support this game, maybe one day X5 will take all the success X4 has given and we will be rewarded with a True space sim that delivers the features that everyone wants. 

So the question then is, did they achieve what they set out to do, is the game a good trading and building sim, with action on the side?

Yes! while you may suffer the boring missions, that's not what this game is about, it's about the 300 hours you sink into becoming a leading corporation, with vast resources, ships and the ability to shape the economy and galaxy around you.  You can set your own goals, manage the crisis that is the Xenon? or become the bane of the galaxy, there's nothing more satisfying than leading a carrier into battle that cost you dozens of hours of work, and launching swarms of fighters to take down station hardpoints as you prepare to bring in the big guns. This game has some awesome strategic possibilities, provided you actually get rich enough to be able to use them! And that's a whole game unto itself - Become the tycoon, Become a strategist, a fighter pilot and eventually a dictator, or a protector. 

Can't wait to see what they add to the game, no one can say the devs do not care, they constantly pour update after update into the game, and every month there is something that is better about this game.

-----Summary-----

So if you love trade games, economy games, building games, space sims, strategy, this one is for you. If you're here looking for something to hold your hand, looking for a story to guide you, looking for 1 million features that you believe the devs should have added instead of what they did do, such as FPS, populations, landing on planets, characters, then no, this game is not for you.",1573175634,1615518966,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I see the potential in this game. I came through here based off recommendations of, ""If you liked Kenshi...""

So I'm use to buggy, poor graphics as long as I could enjoy some depth out of it. I really don't mind.

The problem is when a game is in beta development and I find myself hitting glitches where they were first reported in 2018 and its 2021 and barely finding solutions. First, had the Vulcan error, turns out a restart of my laptop fixed that, but still weird and obnoxious. Graphics glitch frequently, characters disappear. Don't ask me about my build, my build ran CP2077 just fine. The humans look rather terrible. Rather than compromising for meh looking models or what have you (Valheim comes to mind) they outright look terrible. I also don't know why there are voice actors half the time with how bad it is. My autopilot rammed me into a station and now I can't get out, so my only option is to load an autosave that was nearly twenty minutes ago. Great. I had made a lot of progress in that 20 minutes, what a morale killer.

What sucks most though is I clearly see the potential, the depth. I want to get to that point if the game would let me. I'll probably change this review in the future, but absolutely hold off.",1615488836,1615488836,False,3,1,0.525615572929382324,0,True,False,False

On one hand, you have the ship or ships that you fly.  You can fly around doing missions, try to help out fighting off the xenon, takeover pirate ships, or even engage in piracy.  The game gives you the ability to teleport, so switching between ships based on what you're doing isn't cumbersome.  Ships aren't too expensive in the grand scheme of things, so in 5 hours or so, you can easily get your favorites if you work at it.  Unlike other games, getting a great ship is only the start, and there's still a lot left for you to do.  There's quite a few combat ships in each size category to choose from, but there's a few stand out as superior.  Most players tend to gravitate towards the same 4 or 5 ships.  One con for me in this game is that most of the older ships could really use a boost to make them competitive or give them a better niche.

On the other hand, you have your empire if you choose to have one.  At any point, you can pause the game and go into the map view.  You can buy ships and assign them to tasks.  You can then unpause and continue with whatever you're off doing.  Starting off, you can mine.  After a while, you can get into stations.  It takes a lot of cash, but you can reach the stage of ship building.  Once you hit that point, your empire really takes off, and you can go toe to toe with factions if you want.  You can also command combat fleets and direct them in combat, or defend your stations and sectors.

Not all of the game has been fun.  One source of frustration for me has been the scripts that handle station trading.  By default, station managers will try to buy goods that the station or its miners provide, making the station run at a loss.  They also frequently get stuck trying to buy something they think they need, but isn't available.  Rather than moving on to the next trade good in the list, all the station traders grind to a halt.  Occasionally, the defaults for sell orders also are incorrect, and the station ends up not selling goods that it should be able to.  All of these things can be worked around by trade restrictions and tweaking the buy and sell orders, but it's been a reoccurring issue throughout my time playing this game.

Despite that, I still recommend the game.  It's got a lot more depth than some of the other space games that I've played.",1615443706,1615443706,True,2,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

But be warned; this game required a considerable slice of gametime and definitely isn't a game for gamers who want hi-adrenaline action and frantic dogfights and don't care for slower gameplay.
Getting started in X4 takes several hours and getting your empire up and running will easily take several dozen.

But the patient will be rewarded with a magnificently ambitious game!
In X4 you are not only spacecraft pilot where you can dogfight others, mine ore or haul wares for profit; you are also the leader of your own faction and are able to build your own empire.
You can build ships and stations and can even 'own' or take over whole sectors of the galaxy map.
A reputation system keeps things interesting and will make factions react to one another.

All resources are tracked real time and need to be hauled from A to B in a realistic manner.
You can even walk inside ships (limited) and stations in first-person!

Some negative points; the character models are ugly in a weird anatomical way and the voice acting isn't too great, in my opinion at least. But these are minor points.
All in all X seriesis a massively ambitious game series and X4 might very well finally be approachable enough for the gaming community at large. The game and its devs deserve all the positive attention it and they can get. There really isn't another game that does what X4 does on the scale it does it.

Still have an issue with building space stations, but that's not game breaking as the main issues here were.

That being said, YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME ....NOW!

The recommendation is Both Yes and No. First Yes series then No series.
Yes...
1. If your Windows Machine almost maxes out at the recommended specs level, this game will easily work with your machine no worries. in WINDOWS 10 type by start button search bar the following command to compare your machine to game needs ""DXDIAG"" THEN PRESS ENTER and ok. my i7 7700 processor handles it easily .

2. it is a good if you are looking for a modernized sequel of sorts to the old Microsoft game called Freelancer.

3. Very good graphics for a 2 year old game.

4. The teleportation mechanic is a GREAT feature but occasionally flawed as when on a ship or station it is randomly difficult as it blocks teleporting to an allied station. however it is rare, just greyed out or unavailable at random when 95-99% of the time it works...AND QUICKLY.

5. if you like a space game where the travel mechanics for this solo game is walk on grounds of stations, float in a space suit, and ship bridges and docking areas only while running an empire from screens located wherever  you are without obligation to travel, just command, then this game suits that very well.

Now for the negatives...
NO...
1. Tutorials.... once the basics are covered, the rest like commanding other ships and setting up ship orders and routes...ARE EXTREMELY HORRIBLE !!!!

2. COMMANDING OTHER SHIPS REMOTELY IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE OR SO ELUSIVE AND POORLY EXPLAINED THE ABILITY MAY OR NOT EXIST! Example A. B. and C.   A. You build a mining ship with drones and harvest the item. Like ice. This is done very well but no tutorial. Once stocked, loaded and MANUALLY FLOWN SLOWLY BY PLAYER, because your 4 star pilots are dumber than slugs and more rebellious than politicians who hate their own nations. After arriving on scene in an ice field the ship VERY CORRECTLY deploys and begins harvesting and returning the ice to the XL universal size freighter without commanding it just does it so well. 

 B. Now you exit the pilot seat and Immediately the ship stops whatever you were telling it to do...IMMEDIATELY!!  Traveling some where on auto pilot? The Captain IMMEDIATELY STOPS THE SHIP AND WAITS AROUND HOLDING AND AWAITING ORDERS !!! I mean seriously, i gave the ship its orders and as soon as the captain takes over and i even TELL IT to follow current orders, NOTHING CHANGES. go to the map screen and find ship click info it ALWAYS says waiting on orders and holding position. give it new orders via map, in person, or via list to captain then ""COMM"" no matter if you are next to it or elsewhere, it will refuse to obey.....ALWAYS !!! 

C. Cannot build routes. no system mechanics in game i have seen allows for it. THIS IS HOW YOU DESTROY A $50 game and nearly make it worthless. In the ice field for example I found an ICE REFINERY for the ice I would mine and sell to. Cannot order ship there as crew disobeys. Cannot sell there as it took almost 30 minutes to get there manually then the station says I cannot dock as i am too big, extra transport ships on board refuse to load cargo and deliver, cannot order trade via menus / map as station has ZERO ice, has room in storage, and refuses to accept it on sales option. SO MILLIONS wasted on a 5 STAR SHIP SPEC'ED TO THE MAX, collects intuitively, but the 5 star captain disobeys ALL ORDERS cannot follow routes or any orders.
Mission structure:
Quick and simple but to a flaw. Going out to attack the machine race I was given a mission to do so. on arriving at location I was told to deploy 3 laser turrets, but they WERE NOT MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS AND NOT SUPPLIED by the faction either. So I went to a station that said they sold them...nope had to go to a ship yard. I beamed there and found they could do ship upgrades. no worries. I ordered my pilot to dock at my location It refused, of course it would. I am the boss who owns the ship and hired it...why does it need to obey me? it just sits there in free space floating around and refusing orders no matter how I try. Even the command system via the menu's where it says it should work, does not.
THIS RUINS ABOUT 95% of how the game should function but deliberately refuses too.
I should on arriving be able to do the following. Auto mine, done very well right click on a destination on a map and choose to go there, done via auto pilot very well. Captain and crew should auto detect and obey the orders I laid out. Even if it did not, I should be able when it takes over to right click on map, ship flies there. 
   Then next should be finding where to sell. This is done horribly and needs to be fixed.
I should be able right click on a commodity there, see who is ACTUALLY buying it, how much is needed, what they will pay, and build a loop of stations to swing by, off load their desired amount, go back and start over. Then build that chain of orders for a crew to follow. All the ordering systems are there except the “route” and who is buying option.
Look, this is a good game for solo play if you want only one ship, and good graphics with plenty of missions outside the games story arc that it has trouble following. i chose the scientist story path and after the intro there are no sequential missions relating to the progress of the player going through the story, just random nonstory side quest that work well with the games good auto pilot system.",1615091247,1615125334,True,20,1,0.591345548629760742,2,True,False,False

while you step out on a spacestation, little cop-cars chase fugitives (which you can do just aswell), then you take a stroll to a local trade office, passing human and alien alike, after you are done you walk back to your passable fighter craft, ask the pilote to take a break and fly your ship yourself, then you charge out of the space station to dock at your gigantic capital vessel, where you can watch hatches open and close, to release little drones (doing their job), take the space-highway to a jump gate, passing stations, empty space, planets and immense asteroid-fields (asteroids never looked this good), enter the next sector where your 50 ship fleet (fighters, frigates, destroyers, and ships that would make star wars blush just for size alone) waits to fend of an attack against a faction your realy don't like, to build your own space station in their sector, or perhaps claim the whole terretory, but now you don't worry about direct control of your space-planet-destroyer-capital-vessel, but instead you sit back and let the npc-captain and your crew do the dirty work. 

describing how complex and full of possibilities the X-series is is at this point nigh impossible. you saw it in a movie? read it in a book? dreamed about it? yeah, you probably can do it here. pirate ships for cargo...or their ships? sure. build trade empires?yup. create gigantic space battles between fleets? yes. explore and discover rare items, ressources or lore? yes. 
mine, trade? yeah..but why do it yourself when you can create a whole mining-fleet?

the fact that everything adheres to the same rules in this perfect sandbox is just the icing on top: every good needs ressources (from ships, to simple trade-wares, to stations themselves), every ressource needs to be mined, etc. , every good needs to be created. which doesn't just apply to you, but also npcs and their factions. the universe is alive, if you partake in it or not: factions wage war, build stations, claim terretory: imagine the good parts about EvE, just done by one of the most impressive AIs today (and yes, ofcourse it has it's issues aswell). 
want a product to sell better? just make accidents happen on stations producing said good or destroy the miners getting the neccessary ressources to create a price-hike...supply and demand. 

With part 4 Egosoft made not just the usual improvements (which are always more than enough), but you can clearly see and feel that they took Rebirth-critic into account. the UI and menu design clearly takes after Albion prelude and Terran Conflict, but also the flight-model, weapon-feel and cockpits have seen a major improvement. i would even go as far as to say that this is the best recreation of the dream to sit in your own ship (or command it's bridge crew) right after Elite Dangerous. 

the X-series has always been king of the 4X-space-sim-genre, but X4 is defintily the most impressive game (no matter the genre) i've seen today. it goes to show what a dedicated developer can do when they care and love their product. 

When it comes to the visuals this is as good as it gets; beeing it the quality of the engine, but even more important: the design and art-work, the X-universe never looked this good. just seeing a Xenon I and it's almost insect like design, matched against the neo-futuristic Telladi style is incredible, and as mentioned: even asteroids never looked this amazeing.
soundeffects are also finaly en par with the quality of the soundtrack: it's not quite the ooomph Elite offers, but when you boost or activate the travel-mode the sound alone is extatic. 

then there's the soundtrack: 
all throughout the series the music was phenomenal. unqiue, multilayerd and carefully composed, especialy with the mix between old-school instruments and electronic beats/music. but 4s soundtrack is a whole nother level; there are many tracks, especialy those with some chorus or almost Balde Runner-feeling, that you will not forget. 

if there has ever been a 10/10 game it's X4 and the name ""foundations"" might be missleading. the foundations where there 25 years ago, what we got with X4 is villa, which stands rock solid even when an earthquake strikes. 
the fact that Egosoft, as usual, still is constantly working, improving and ading to the game is also a fact that cannot be commended enough. you will rarely see a developer this engaged in their product long after it's release.

Also downloaded xenon/khaak bounties cause who tf is gonna pay you for saving their border patrols asses. 
First day in, massive k destroyer force spearheaded by twin I's. All friendlies forced off the gate leading to matrix 451. Defense plat goes down. System defenses crumbling. I'm picking off anything P class and below but those caps are just going to town. Off in the distance the teladi fleet comes flooding in to respond. After an intensely long and bloody fight, we've pushed them out of system. Smoldering wrecks of their invasion fleet. 
By now I've made enough to buy and equip 2 more peregrine beam gunboats and a 4 pack of kestrel beamers. We snuck behind enemy lines, demolished a being built factory, killed 10+ S miners and who knows how many fighter patrols. Hit em where it hurts an keep the front lines far from home. 

This game is pretty damn good. 

It's def got room for improvement. 
It's missing alot of personal detail. The stations are huge but devoid of life, even with more npcs. The back corners of stations don't have underworld contacts. The bridges of ships are eerily quiet. Beam weapons are the only thing that consistently hit from ai. Theirs a lack of weapon variety. Honestly how games like escape velocity handled this was to populate the universe with unique dudes and fleets of various kinds. Up and coming trader captains. Bounty hunters. Etc. They would interact with the player more then the a typical npc. They led their own lives. Had upgraded ships or junker fits. Etc. 
Also at a certain point the game stops playing like a flight sim and turns into an rts. Half the time I'm trying to click and drag units on the fly only to remember everything goes threw the map. I'm in combat having beaten a guy and theirs a P closing in, I've clicked my wingmate and I right click the p but no menu, oh yeah you havta go threw the map. The cons of this game are that it should play like a hybrid flight sim/rts/spreadsheet. Only it plays like a flight sim/spreadsheet, and the larger it gets the harder it gets to wield.

Tutorials breaking button mappings including escape key (wtf?)

Tutorials are just plain wrong and can give incorrect steps. I spent an hour or so trying to capture a large ship only to realise the tutorial was talking utter nonsense. Stuff like making the tutorial actually be correct seems pretty basic to me.

AI is about as clever as a suicidal monkey on meth. Thats as true for piloting as it is for trading. Expect a lot of babysitting if you want to use the AI at all and dont expect them to have basic qualities like a desire to live.

Game breaking bugs

Lack of variety - once you have seen the inside of a station you have seen them all.

Story is almost nonexistent and every single NPC (including that boron scientist with the painfully annoying voice) are just empty of life and any redeeming features.

Save and load times are extreme even on an SSD with a powerful rig.

Some factions (e.g. Split families) just always seem to not work well. I've yet to see the split not loose multiple sectors even when your pumping their shipyards and wharfs full of hull parts. They are just too weak.

I'd highly suggest to get the other DLCs, which I have not gotten them yet. But I surely will because I wanted to learn the base game before I added something different to it.

But the bigger problem is the controls, which are counter intuitive as everything is hidden in menus within  sub menus within tabs within context menus that depend on the previous 2 things you clicked on. The tutorials, which take many hours to go through and are clumsily added on top of normal game play, only serve to explain how to navigate the menus but not what anything actually does. Want to know the difference between a security splicer and a security decryptor, or how to use them? Tough luck. This results in a game with an incredibly harsh learning curve at the start but, once you've understood the mechanics and the 200 near-identical variants of the same trade goods/ships/modules, plateaus out and its just a question of automating traders and stations. A good game should be easy to learn but hard to master; this manages to be the exact opposite.

The actual game play is mixed. I had fun doing missions to get more cash, to upgrade my gear, to do more missions, to progress the story line and so on. However, this gets repetitive pretty fast, and the best player ship with the best equipment (bar some additional bonus semi-random modifications that can be unlocked later) can be achieved very fast, after which its just about acquiring more automated stuff. Then there's all game play that involves looking for a pixel in a hay stack: either a red spark on the side of a space station full of red lights, a dark anomaly floating through black space, a hidden switch on a hidden data centre that doesn't stay on the map even after visiting it... It's terrible padding of the worst type. There are also lots of elements tacked on for no reason. You can now move around as an individual rather than just a ship! But why bother? Ships only have one room, all stations look identical, and the only thing to do in them is access a trading/hacking/crafting menu.

The story is hard to get into, partly because the voice acting is truly, spectacularly, unbelievably bad, and partly because there's little to no background given on the universe. The encyclopedia given in game has no description for most of its entries and, while there is a timeline that could help give much needed context, that has to be unlocked by stumbling on invisible data centres.


The combined feeling of this is that the devs have created an intricate and deep world in a beautiful space setting, but hate the player and want to make them suffer.

+Ability to build your own stations
+Ship and station customization is amazing
+Combat is fun, using your employees to help you do it is even better
+Music and sound design is very immersive
+The UI is very well designed
+Huge galaxy to explore, with multitude of resources, space anomalies and hidden objects
+Decent voiceacting

-Even with tutorials, might feel overwhelming at first
-Game does not hold your hand, you often have to figure out things on your own
-Minor bugs (nothing gamebraking, mostly immersion related things, like npc ships occassionally clipping through some station parts)
-The npc models could be better (this has been improved since my first review)

Overall:
9/10 - Would allow a tentacle alien to take detailed scans of my body for profit again.

EDIT: After 700 hours of gameplay and almost two years later the game is even better than before. New DLC and free new gameplay features and mechanics add to the value of this game.

You can be anything from a trader, bounty hunter, fighter pilot, capital ship captain, carrier task force commander, fleet admiral to even a full-fledged space faction leader. Your ambition is the limit. You can keep to yourself, help various factions repel evil aliens, side with a specific faction to dominate all others or establish your own faction and take over the universe.

First of all, I respect Egosoft team and its CEO - Bernd Lehahn for their dedication to X development and ability to listen to customers. 
I was a die heart follower of X series and unfortunately it ended up for me on X3 and its modifications.
I skipped Rebirth as it was clearly out of wack. Players were asking Egosoft to come back to X3 type but I understood that the game engine was changed and it is not possible.  Recently I started playing Elite Dangerous (ED) and realized that this what  X could evolved into.
1. Joystick problems. I was in touch with egosoft tech team trying to get my analog joystick working with X4 but unsuccessfully. I thought that the problem could be with Stteam and stopped using the joystick.
I connected my joystick (which saw many space battles in X3) with ED and it works magically. 
2. X4 universe is tiny compared to ED and the map is awful in my view. It is much easier to navigate through 400 billion star system in ED. 
3. Highway (Las Vegas style) in X4 is an immersion breaker for me but traveling in ED is much better - can be compared with a jump drive (you can jump from any point to any closeby star system). 
4. Outer station visuals in X4 has this childish graphic (X3 graphic was great contrary). I thought that Egosoft wanted to focus on the younger generation but they are not up to this space simulator game. Capital ship ugly design is also bad compared to X3. 
5. All mini-games in X4 are dull - I found that I loaded mods to skip them. Shooting corners of a container to release its cargo? Scraping surface of stations to find a lose cable? Are you serious? In comparison I love mini-games in ED - deep core mining (interesting and fantastic visuals), fighting interdiction in supercruise, POI = grade emissions with wreckage of ships, land mining.
6. Wrong key binding. When you just start the game you do not realize that you can accidentally switch off flight assist as the keybinding for mouse movement control is close (one is shift and one is alt - I always mix them). It took two hours with flight assist off to land on a station for me. ED keybinding is much better (obviously you can reassign it later) and prevent accidental switching to undesired mode (flight assist or rotation/orbital). Both have training but X training ended in the middle with a game failure - I was unable to continue the training.
So X4 does not have a great skeleton to build on (contrary to X3 - with extra meat/mods it was the best space simulator at the time). It was a step forward to introduce landing on stations but it was done halfway - all station inside are look alike and same annoying music (so I have to say that generally the in-game music is outstanding). I do prefer ED planet landing. it is really a joy exploring land structures on a rover. ED comes with Odyssey DLC which will move them forward even further (extra 60 thousand landable planets with atmosphere and possibility working/fighting on foot). 
ED is also multiplayer (so I frequently play in solo) and I am amazed how well it is done on the technical site.
I gave an example what X could became and all new DLCs of X4 will not bring the game to the appropriate level as they are done on a wrong structure / skeleton. What I remember of X4? Las Vegas Highways and micro universe with unfriendly map (cluttered or something).",1614294408,1614294408,False,2,2,0.492759078741073608,0,True,False,False

- Big galaxy with mechanics and content available for all aspects of 4X experience
- Technically works okay, and it's a great technological accomplishment for the devs
- You can have lots of fun flying your own ship

Cons:
- The galaxy FEELS dead. It may be technically functional, mostly, but does not feel like a living and breathing organism.
- Main quests are mediocre at best, but I personally found them to be horrible for the most part. Some main characters I wanted to be able to get rid of to never deal with them again, but that would've made my further progression impossible.
- Generic quests are awful before you even get to them. Their availability is absolutely random and you have little in a way of shaping your ""career"" if you were to choose one by working for NPC factions.
- If you want to lead a big fleet of ships and wage massive wars, be ready to get absolutely frustrated with how AI flies in formations and executes orders you give. I played many hours to get to the point where I could start assembling my own combat fleet only to find out that commanding it would be the worst experience I had in the game so far. Pathfinding is BAD, the bigger the ship is. Combat AI is even worse, with my own ships acting ridiculous even if I do everything right - equip them properly and give correct orders.
- Wanna know more about how the game works, about the factions, lore, equipment? The encyclopedia is barely there. It lacks even the most basic descriptions for some of the items listed which makes me wonder how something like that is even possible. You add a ship to the game but fail to provide even a couple of lines of text for its description?

I had two fantasies I wanted to fulfill with this game.

1. I wanted to join a certain faction's military and participate in their wars. All factions feel absolutely the same, with only ships looking different and equipment having a different stat focus, and getting to know each faction and why you should even join them is something you can barely do and have to dig into google to find out. Actually joining their military is impossible. Running missions for them feels random, ungrateful (risk vs reward is badly balanced), and chaotic.

2. Having failed #1, I figured I'd assemble my own big fleet. As I am a big fan of carrier warfare, I wanted to get myself a carrier to act as a flagship and main striking force and go from there. I got myself a carrier and a destroyer to escort it. I bought ~20 fighters and equipped them separating into 3 squadrons - 1 torpedo squadron and 2 fighter squadrons. I managed to get a mission to destroy Xenon station.

Flying two capital ships in formation turned out to be A VERY SLOW and frustrating experience, but I got where I needed to be. On my way to the enemy station I encountered enemy fighters and my fighters were able to deal with them easily. The way carrier/parasite craft operations work is far from ideal or the way it is done in real life, but okay, I can manually order squadrons around and deal with enemy fighters before they get closer to the carrier. Can use scouts to find targets and deploy torpedo bombers.

Then I encountered a single enemy capital ship, which destroyed my own destroyer numerous times (I reloaded the save file many times to practice). But okay, I learned not to allow enemy capital ships to get closer to mine and my torpedo fighters were able to destroy enemy capital ships with almost no problems. But I already noticed that I get horribly frustrated with fleet operations, both capital and fighter ops.

Then I get to Xenon station. I deploy my torpedo bombers and they... go die stupidly at point blank range under station's flak fire. Yeah, why shoot torpedoes or even dumb fire rockets from kilometers away? Let's all hug the station and let it shoot at us.

Okay, what about my own capital ships? They also have weapons that outrange the station. Why not order them to destroy it from afar? Oh, what do you mean they dance around the station almost without firing at it, even if you configure their weapons/targeting orders perfectly? Well, at least they don't crush into the damn thing!

Basically, the combat AI, its awareness and pathinding is really bad for fleet combat. You can stand on the bridge of your flagship and facepalm yourself till your nose and skin hurt, but your fleet WILL fail you over and over again. Oh, and even if you do manage to destroy some enemy capital ships, you won't get any award or recognition. Good luck even looting the remaining wreckage.

So save your time. You can grind your way to be able to build many stations and there's tycoon building, but using these funds to deploy your own fleet to wage war is the most frustrating part of this game.

I finally get a rig to run it and........... two years after release its a buggy buggy mess. Not only that its about as bland as a milk toast. 

So tutorial missions are doable, they look good and have decent voice acting... yet when transferred to the larger ships the player falls through the floor like its Star Citizen. Brilliant. 

Basic missions fail because the unit you've been sent to kill just sits there, not moving, or shooting. Again, brill. 

Just moving between locations become a chore, not because the autopilot is janky as hell, but because the game regularly crashes back to desktop... why? Fuck knows. I have the latest drivers and updates and everything else. 

Missions are, boring as fuck. Generic (often T-posing) NPCs who all look the same, will issue invitations to join their faction and issue important missions (at the drop of a hat) and with the same bland expressionless voice acting as if they they are doing paperwork for the DMV. There is so little effort gone into charecter models that they should have just stuck with text boxes. 

Other immersion breaking glitches include newly constructed/ purchased craft being unavailable to use because the pilots chair hasn't loaded in properly... So you have to reload a save to get it working... Great. I've also seen the auto pilot glitch out and send the player craft in the opposite direction of the indicated target not weird at all. The final glitch being emerging from an accelerator / gate thingy to have my ship crash into the super structure and get stuck... 

Steam tells me I can't have a refund because I've played more than two hours, I'd argue that most of that time was spent trying to figure out what had gone wrong now, but I'll settle for this piece of advice : AVOID THIS GAME, AVOID THIS DEVELOPER... DO NOT PURCHASE.

Initial review:
Definitely what I as a fan of X2/X3 wanted from Rebirth but didn't get. It has it's minor flaws like a few bugs here or there, or some flaws in control customization (like not being able to unbind RMB from triggering interactions menu to be able to use it for firing), but I'm sure these will be fixed soon enough. However, the new content is in the spirit of the good parts of the previous games and there are some very notable improvements in the interface and the general way you do things. The trade system interface alone is worth a special mention.

I have to admit though, the overall amount of content seems somewhat lacking. I haven't played through very far, but I can see the number of ship types, weapons and upgrades (although some have become obsolete) is smaller compared to what X3 had on launch. So I'm hoping this will be remedied outside of paid DLCs in the time to come. Despite that, I still enjoy the game immensely with its launch bumps nonetheless.

So if you are a hardcore fan of the X series I'd definitely recommend the game, just be a bit patient ;)
For those who isn't a fan of the series but did likedany of the X games before, I'd suggest holding out a bit too see how the most prominent of the issues get addressed. Don't go too far though, I'm feeling good about this XD

Edit:
After investing over 70 hours into the game, I've decided to change the recommendation. The flaws have become more apparent over time, as I got into mid-game content (seeing as end-game content is hardly to be seen so far). The game just doesn't make me want to go back even half as much as any of the X3 titles did. I would now recommend this game only to the most patient and devoted fans of X series. Keyword is mostly patient, rather than devoted. 
And there is also a scent of simply bad business practices by the developer. Had this game been released into Early Access in its current state, it would be completely acceptable. Instead however, a clearly unfinished game, riddled with placeholders, bugs, performance issues and mechanics of questionable efficiency was released as a supposedly complete full-priced title. That is just not fair to the consumer, period.

Regardless, I do like Egosoft for their products (admittedly, maybe due to the lack of proper competition) and hope they might have done it due to banal financial issues or something. So I hope they're not in too much trouble as I hope they'll manage to not to resort to such practices again. Then again, I'm sure their community would be extremely supportive to their Early Access product and would have thrown cash their way almost as much as they did on this 'complete release', I know I would.

[b] Another edit [/b] after 72 hours put on [b] ver. 3.30 [/b]  (most of it without any DLCs):
The placeholders have been mostly filled. The world is waaaay more functional now with much less bugs (although there still are some annoying ones). I no longer have to keep telling myself to overlook any blatant flaws to be able to enjoy the game, it is genuinely enjoyable as is. The technology variety is still not comparable to what we had in X3:TC or X3:AP. The quest plot line (or lines, if you buy the Split Vendetta DLC) is quite limited, although well-written and well-voiced (except for some ENG voice acting that was clearly done on a level of eager but novice unpaid intern). There are things to look forward to and time invested in the game actually pays off.
[b] P.S. To the series newcomers though, I would probably still recommend to begin your acquaintance with the series from the X3 (""Reunion"", ""Terran Conflict"" or ""Albion prelude"").

I went back and forth on purchasing this for a while - was a big fan of Eve Online a number of years back, and I enjoy solo games as well, so this game along with it's X3 precursor series looked perfect. The reviews kept me from purchasing (general bugs from what I read) but I finally decided to try it out after more recent reviews claimed many of the bugs were fixed. My guess is they probably are, bugs are actually not why I am down voting this game.

Two words: Station Scanning.  For me, it literally kills the game.

You cannot avoid it, it appears in various forms in many early missions, and is required to start getting blueprints to build your own stations at some point later in the game.  What is station scanning? You get in your ship and you fly an inch away from the surface of a space station in scanning mode. THAT IS IT. You fly slowly, over the entire surface of the station.  So far I've spent hours blocked on several storyline or general guild missions and I'm just sick to freaking death of painstakingly flying slowly over the surface of stations, listening for ""static"" at high game volume, or getting blown up the moment I approach a station.

There are two variants in the story / guild missions I keep running into:
1) Scan a hostile station. 
I spent a few hours on this one with multiple types of ships before giving up.  Basically if a station is hostile, it has fighters, or a ton of turrets (usually in my case). You must get within like 100m or something and wait a few seconds to get even a partial scan. At that point, you are blown up. I think I averaged surviving < 2 seconds. Add in long load times, and you can have hours of fun flying at a hostile station at travel speed, stopping short right next to it, try to quickly zoom off again after hitting scan button, only to die within a couple seconds - but don't worry, you can load the game for 90 seconds or so, then try again. I did this with fast ships, small ships, medium size ships, always same exact result. 

2) Scan for data leak / deploy computer worm
So I restarted the game and tried to approach things differently. I got a mission to find any Scale Plate station, and scan for a data leak in order to drop off a computer virus.  Just gave up entirely now after several hours of this.  I found Scale Plate stations, painstaking crawled over them with my ship in scan mode, tried crawling over them with my spacesuit, even tried an EMP bomb to create a leak, and never found a leak.

I finally did something I don't ever do with these games - I downloaded a mod that would supposedly help. It didn't, and reading comments on the mod said it might not work with latest patches, try a different mod.. that's it, I'm done with this. I shouldn't need a mod to successfully complete a very early mission. And this ""feature"" is one of the most frustrating and lamest game features I have come across.  

If you can get past this frustration, or just really enjoy slowly flying a tiny ship over a huge station non stop, then you'll probably enjoy the rest of the game. For me though this is just too much. I'd love to get deeper into the game, I had auto miners, was making money, but everything feels ""stuck"" until I can complete the main missions. 

So I'm moving on and giving up on this after 53 hours, and at minimum I think anyone else looking at this game should understand that stuff like this is apparently a very big part of the game, and you won't be getting into large capital fighters or building stations or progressing far in the story without spending half your time ""station scanning"".",1613417043,1613496626,False,3,1,0.484341561794281006,0,True,False,False

There are still quirks and the initial start of a campaign is pretty daunting, but I think most of the systems in the game are still pretty good.  I do like some of the QOL aspects over the X3 series such as the boarding system.  I found my few attempts at that in X3TC to be so frustrating that I gave up, but only took 3 attempts in X4 to get it right.  I still do need to micromanage some aspects of the process, but overall I have found it to be fun.  The only thing is that I wish the boarding aspect of the game could also be extended to M class ships as well.  One particular aspect that I do not like is the bailing system for S and M class ships.  It feels counter-intuitive that ships are more likely to bail if they are about to be destroyed by a ship that is smaller than they are.  

I have added a few mods such as the Autotrader tweaks which lowers the bar for when captains can autotrade, found a mod that tweaks the bailing system, and added a few new sectors in the game.

To get actual feel for the game you'd have to play it yourself or find a Youtuber who knows what they're doing and knows how to communicate it to their audience. I consider to have come out of the tutorial phase of the game around 40h mark, but at 500 hours I'm still learning things, though the things learned are getting less significant. That might sound a steep learning curve, but actually all the actual tutorials for the game take maybe 30min to explore thoroughly, and you actually have all the required knowledge to play the game after those. The tutorials might be improved upon, but personally I really think it's not worth anyone's while to invest in that department as this game has much of its value tied to figuring out how everything works and what you can do with it. 

X4 Foundations is a medium-light 4X game about running an economy and/or space combat-flight sim. There are also first person elements, but this is not a shooter, and never will be. Do not expect the space aspect to be on the same level and scale as Elite Dangerous for example. Object scale is very much correct and even awe-inspiring at times, but distance scale feels off if you've played already mentioned ED or titles like I-War2. 1000km is a long distance here, as the fastest off-the-shelf scout ship has top speed at around 7500m/s. Weapon projectile speeds and effective ranges also might seem off - all weapons measure projectile speed in m/s and even beam weapons have very low numbers. This is part of the game balance, so not much can be done about it at this point. You can also probably already guess that you're not meant to circle around planets in-system in this game, they are more of a backdrop. There are also stars, and even black holes taking the backdrop duties in some systems. You move with jump gates between systems, and approx 400km is the max you can expect to travel between jump gates in system. There is more to in-system traveling, but it's not fruitful trying to describe these mechanics in text.

The game is very much still in development, which one might find surprising considering it was released over two years ago. Since 3.00 update it has been a working product with some QoL-issues. The game's economy simulator side is played mostly from map UI and station management UI. The map UI, along ship command/behavior managements have been lacking few key items for all this time, problem with moving resources as fleets being the topmost. Upcoming 4.00 update (launch March 16, 2021) has shown in beta phase that it remedies these issues and adds new command category ""mimic"" to alleviate some of the heavy UI interaction from rather mundane tasks like moving larger batches of materials from station to station. The satation management and building UI has some performance issues with larger stations and the controls are finicky. There seems to be a problem with how the engine interprets zoom and cursor/item placement and module snapping in the building UI. While I don't have any info on whether this problem will be fixed, I can tell you that I still very much enjoy designing stations despite the issue.

I find the general look of the game to be beautiful. There is some clear repetition of ideas seen in ship designs especially, but it isn't too jarring. Graphics engine is also still being developed, upcoming update bringing volumetric fog to the table. The engine has also SSR and AO-features. SSR works, but the material gloss properties are over the top, so everything has mirror finish if you enable SSR. 

Game performance is a tough one. Early game there won't be much problem but with about 25 ships in-system close to you the pathing AI seems to run into trouble and frame rates start coming down. Older CPUs get ground to dust here. One thing worth mentioning is that this is an actually simulated economy. There's no queue truncation, or magically appearing resources in station storage to help poorly performing player or AI. If you want to build a ship you need to mine different minerals and gas, enrich/forge them, combine the output to components, and build products out of the components and then you can build ships with the production outputs. You can crash the galactic economy if you know what you're doing - if you don't, you might crash the local sector economy, which might even result in that areas dominant faction being wiped out or just made permanently inviable. Here's a tip: don't build self-sufficient megastations. It might seem a really good idea, but your frame rate begs to differ. 

Pacing is slow, outside combat that is. I wouldn't be surprised if average game time for saves was over 100 hours.

Steam support is currently giving me some static about the refund and i anticipate that a less frustrating use of the 35$ would have been just flushing it down a toilet.

So after you get everything remapped, if you play with trackir, you find that combat is pretty much impossible because the targeting reticule and the area where your shots land bear only a glancing resemblance to each other.

More specifically, the cursor follows your head motion or position and the shots seem to follow the axis of the ship or something. I tried all the aim assist options.

Im not really sure how they got this so wrong as so many games get it right, Elite Dangerous, Il2, i could go on but suffice to say this is the worst trackir implementation i have seen.

And it cost me 35$, six hours total playtime, two hours or more remapping and testing controls and about the other 4 trying to fix various trackir and controller issues. 

If you are using mouse and keyboard or gamepad or dont care about your money, give X4 a shot.

My main gripe and issue is the combat. Game play wise its great, good fun. Accessibility wise, not so great. Gone are the days of fighting random pirates and taking missions to defend stations or patrol a sector. Combat is focused on fighting either xenon or one of the in game factions. This is because of the fully simulated economy. Every ship and every station from xenon to the argon, is built from in game resources. Nothing in the game is spawned in so anything you kill or blow up has a ""real"" impact on that faction.

Personally i feel like this is a very good thing and a big step in the right direction. But i do hope they find a good way to introduce combat on the small scale effectively. That all being said, the big scale combat is fantastic and epic. taking fleets of XL and L ships Supported by M and S ships to an enemy sector and fighting their stations and defense fleets is fun challenging at times (until you get frustrated with the crap fleet controls which is getting a patch in 4.0)

All in all, I have loved my time in the game and intend on sinking in a lot more. Mods make this game 10x better IMO. That being said i don't like to mod my game to the point of being a completely different game so i am light on how many mods i use (I think I have about 4-5 total). I would recommend at least getting the VRO mod sometime after 10-20+ hours of in game time. By that time you have a decent idea of how the game is and some of the pitfalls that i feel VRO helps to remedy.

First, the save game feature is archaic at best. They use a text file to save the entire game. It is XML, but it's still text. Worse, they compress it with 20-year-old technology. Even worse, they auto-save randomly. You never know when you're going to have to pause for a minute whether you like it or not. Expect to spend 30 seconds to a minute or so when the game saves. The only plus to this is that you can rewind if things go poorly. But, there are more modern and much aster ways to go about this than a text file.

Second is that selected objects lose focus easily. For example, I select a ship that I want to move several sectors, I scroll out so that I can then zoom to the target sector only to find that the ship I selected is now de-selected. Worse, another ship or station could have stolen the focus. All is takes to lose focus is to mouse over the path of another object. Another example is stacking orders. I want a trade ship to dock at one station and then go trade at another station. You are able to stack orders so long as the ship you selected doesn't decide to lose focus and stop accepting order. Telling a ship to dock for repairs should not automatically relinquish focus.

Third, this a not a sandbox. The game is specifically geared to faction warfare. The factions are at massive war from the word go. You either begin supporting a faction's war economy immediately or you go play a different game. A new player can expect the starting faction to get steam rolled within hours of start. There is no time for a learning curve. Every aspect of the game is catered to expert players. There is no easy mode. If you don't learn the ropes in 2 hours you can expect to be re-rolling a new game and hope you learn faster the next time out.

For players willing to do a lot of extra-curricular homework and patiently spend hundreds of hours figuring things out then this can be a great game. Egosoft has the kinesthesia dynamic figured out so people do get hooked.",1612748786,1612748786,False,6,1,0.476855307817459106,0,True,False,False

I did not enjoy the game breaking glitches, but once you know what causes them you can avoid most of them (my favorite is caused by running and jumping while on the speedways, sometimes you go flying into space).

What I love about this game is that the more time you put into the game, the more things make sense.  If you look at the negative reviews you will notice three types of reviews-
1- This game isn't finished its not worth it.
2- I can't accomplish what I want and I don't want to spend the time to figure it out
3- I can't accomplish what I want because it's not in the game

The game did start out missing a lot of key features (like being able to build your own ships) and was buggy (ships not building at npc's shipyards)... wait those two bugs are pretty game breaking.  They have since been fixed, but there are still other goofy things that can happen. Understanding this is just part of the journey. 

As somebody who loves 4x games, I am used to games not explaining everything I need to know to run an empire.  Heck people complain about games that have too many tutorials and they aren't as complex as this game.  There is information out there for anything you want to learn about, but they aren't going to spoon feed you everything you need to know. They respect that you don't need everything all at once.

I agree with people who complain about the game not having everything they want.  Not being able to own sectors or build my own ships was fairly upsetting.  I have high hopes for the new update, and I am sure I will put more hours into the game.

I recommend this game only if you have done your research.  Look at some of the bugs, and how people get them.  Look at some combat videos, see if you like the small scale and large scale combat.

There should never be a teleporter in the X universe... NEVER. It takes away everything that makes space what it is when you can just instantly travel to anywhere. It does not cost you anything and even if there was a cost, it still should not be possible!

Combat is completely unbalanced. An enemy in the same ship as you with the same weapons seems to do twice the damage. You get targeted by enemy ships that just spawn out of no where and before you can even react your dead. Upgrading your ships seem to not make any difference, and larger ships you own seem to be much more easily destroyed then enemy ships. It's just not fun at all.

You can order mining ships to, well, mine. Silicone miners and leave the game on all night while you sleep, wake up with 100 mil. Lame. Makes the game so much more pointless.

Stations are time consuming to destroy. I mean lets face it, whats the purpose of this game if not to conquer all the sectors? You can literally spend an hour just trying to take out one station. An hour of remaining stationary and holding the space key down while you target different modules. Pointless.

Its just not rewarding to play this game, and to much hassle involved with some of the features. After the last X game, the devs said they listened and heard the players.

Career paths? Explorer, hacker, pirate, mercenary, trader. It's all fair game. Granted I generally end up just being a ruthless trade mogul. 

The ai factions all have their own little skirmishes, economies, and missions to take advantage of. It really is a sandbox that you are just a part of.

Trading:
I wanted to do some space truckin' and initially had fun just hauling freight around. Eventually I made enough money to buy another space ""18 wheeler"" and that's where the problems began. Ideally you would set your other truck off to go do some trades and just forget about him almost completely. Actually what happens is that you have to menu around for a while to find a trade route, send him off on that route and then he gets stuck and you have to do it all over again/un-bugger the little a-hole. The AI gets stuck on walls, trapped on asteroid pathing forgets what it's doing, an generally just need a LOT of babysitting to make it work.

Combat:
I eventually strong-armed an entire fleet of AI truckers into doing their jobs enough that I finally did make some pretty decent cash and decided to go for a some combat. I build my own little fighter squadron. The idea here being that you and your crew would form up and go kick some serious alien butt! The reality was that you would charge into battle and suddenly find yourself very lonely. WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE ELSE! One ship just out there staring off into space, one ship can't find the accelerator and is just slowly plodding his way to help at 2mph, one ship chasing a fleeing enemy across the map, one needing to be caught before he suicides into a much stronger force (1 vs 20, I like those odds!).

In order to enjoy this game there are a few necessities. First, you have to google everything. Nothing is properly explained. Secondly you have to download some mods because the main game is lacking ALOT of quality of life.
You are going to be stuck inside walls sometimes (using auto-pilot usually works to get out). The AI can be a bit crappy sometimes. Overall, it's going to be annoying, and unbelievably frustrating at first, but if you got the patience to learn you might find yourself addicted.

faction enhancer (all 4)
fire and smoke
Capital Ship Loot Magnet
Fly-by-looting
Secret stash

SectorSatellites
No Xenon (With all these other mods, the xenon will be OP and go haywire really quick.

I've noticed that some of the dialogue options in their X series games had a political slant, that could influence a young or naive person's views to the developer's particular political positions.

Further, if you peruse their forums at the Egosoft website, you'll see an anti-Trump rage thread that is many many pages in length. In fact, this is the longest thread in their English ""Off Topic"" forum. After attempting to provide a counter-balance to this thread and promote an alternative view, I was censored within two days of it being posted. This organization definitely is anti White and against White nations, despite any protestations to the contrary. Their anti-Trump rage thread is also HUNDREDS of pages long, with no history of censorship of an anti-Trump post that I could see. I advised them to simply end ALL real political discussion on their forums (as they should in their games) as a better alternative to censoring one side of the issue, but of course this request was ignored.

This game has all the problems I originally posted plus a few new ones.  To name a few, shield and health bars blinking or completely gone on any ship I've flown.  All are undamaged.  Key contact NPCs are missing, which ended my attempt to give this game another try for the review.  Autopilot sometimes rams objects like rocks and stations and you get stuck inside them with no way out.  I spent a lot of hours trying to get through these glitches.  If not for the constant game breaks, I know I would love this game but two years after my initial review, the bugs/glitches are worse!  I will never trust this game company again.

Dec 2018
The patch notes and video of 1.50 update did not address the worst issues of the game, such as NPC pilots flying into and then clipping through stations or the player ship getting stuck inside asteroids or the overwhelming amount of pirate activity.  I cannot clear a docking birth before being ordered by a pirate to drop my cargo.

What it addressed was the first step toward multiplayer.  Multiplayer?  Griefers, trolls and flamers are abuzz with excitement and they are flaming the hell out of me and everyone that agrees with me, trying desperately to silence us.  Regretably, this tactic works on most people.  They are making comments such as ""I can't wait to send my fleet into someone else's game to wreck their world"".  And ""You crybabies need to shut up and get over it.""  If you don't believe me, watch the Egosoft 1.50 video and read the comments.

Single players and long term X series players are shaking their heads as their game is being taken from them and given to the MP/Griefer crowd.  The next instalment of this series will probably be an MMO, probably with monthy subscriptions.  This is so disheartening as I've been waiting for this game since X: Rebirth failed to live up to the series expectations.

This is not another 20 minute playtime review, as of the time of writing I have 147.8 hours in this game.

Now two years later the X4 4.0 (beta) update is slowly pushing the game from ""merely good"" towards a personal game-of-the-year 2021 contender.

[h1] The Good [/h1]

- Large universe with a fully simulated economy. It's actually fun exploring to see what the NPC factions have been up to.
- No two games are the same.
- Go from rookie piloting a single peashooter to commanding large fleets of industrial and/or military ships.
- Pretty much anything NPCs can do, you can too: build your own stations, establish control over your own region of space, have your own police force, etc.
- You can walk around stations and the bridge of your's/other's ships which adds to the immersion and gives you a sense of the (incredible) scale.
- Anything non-organic looks amazing, as do the backgrounds such as planets.
- Amazing modding potential and a lot good mods already, including some large overhauls like a ""Star Wars"" mod.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

- You need about 30 hours and Google always at the ready to even begin figuring this game out. There's tutorials for the absolute basics but no good contextual help with the myriad of menus and features later. There's no single good information source for this game. There are however 10 incomplete wikis.
- In vanilla a lot of the ships and guns [i]are[/i] same-ish. Same speed, same range, etc. Ship modules also generally don't do anything interesting - they only change a few numbers. The game could take a page out of the EVE playbook here. Don't expect to spend much thought on fleet doctrines in vanilla. Install the VRO mod to remedy some of this.

[h1] The Nits [/h1]

- Some of the effects could look better. A few of the projectile effects and ""data leaks"" look dated. Some are essentially just flat sprites and [i]look[/i] like flat sprites.
- (Human) character animation/graphics are barely passable...  but only if this game was from 2010. Actually the (clothing) textures and models are great, but some bad animations and plastic-looking hair that hovers 2cm above peoples heads ruins the whole impression.

Seems the developers got in over their head on the choice of game engine.
As one developer said, ""Slow and Painful process"", to utilize the engine that is made for modern CPUs. All while the GPU is being over utilized in a engine designed to lighten the load on GPUs.
Meanwhile, developers are refusing to accept that modders. With less than desirable experience. Have already vastly improved upon the core game mechanics involving AI and various other mechanics. Still, with a improved modded game. It still won't fix the lack of engine utilization by these developers. Adding content, ships, races, and missions will absolutely not fix the engine utilization.

I've played the X franchise on and off for 22 years (yes, X Beyond the Frontier launched in July 1999!), all the way up until X- Rebirth which according to Steam I have 95 minutes of play time.

With Rebirth I thought the game was lost, it deviated away from the X we came to know and love and was really a mess IMHO.

However, X is back! X4 Foundations is what I always wanted it to be. All the familiar factions and sectors, familiar game play but with the benefits of 22 years of development.

The level of detail is mind-blowing. I mean you can build a wheat farming space station, and when it's built fly into it in your spacesuit and watch the mechanised harvester reaping the corn as you listen to the trickle of water in the irrigation system. Sometimes you find yourself just spectating from a dock as you watch a station fend off an enemy attack while sirens wail and fighter drones are lifted to the decks on their lifts.

Yes the game has some bugs, but on the whole for me they are minor niggles such as auto pilot glitches and NPC fleet members not working as well as they would if you controlled them yourself.

I'm now 258 hours in and am back addicted again.

Pros:
Massive amount of content.
You can purchase and customise every ship you buy from small scouts and fighters up to huge capital ships. 
I believe there are 4 unique faction ship designs but the list of what ships you can buy is huge with all of the blueprints.
You can construct space stations, build fleets, organise trade/mining routes, plenty of micro management and production stuff. 
The ship battles are so fun and colourful. 
The galaxy feels alive with all of the NPC ships doing their own thing and an actually active economy.

Cons:
The game is really resource intensive. FPS drops are really common around space stations and areas with many ships.
The NPC dialogue is a bit lacking in my opinion and not very in depth or diverse.

=== Original review from 2019 ====
This game has the potential to be amazing, but I don't think it's ready yet.

I'm a big fan of X3, and waited until the end of the year (2019) to buy this game, giving the developers time to remove the bugs, add features, but the game needs to resolve the following issues in my opinion:

1. The game is still very buggy. I've suffered more crashes than I can count, and I'm talking about crashes requiring a full system restart. I've also had more save games become corrupted than I can count, I actually cycle through 4 save files, so I don't completely lose my play through. Nothing is more painful than losing a few hours of gameplay. I've also been stuck in stations, asteroids and even ships, clipping issues are fairly common.

2. Lacking variation. The game is very repetitive and in general lacking in content. The different empires stations / ships / weapons are too similar and there is a real lack of character. X3 has far more variation.

3. This game is lacking in interesting missions or end game content, you really do need to appreciate a sandbox game, which it does well, but you need to set your own goals, as there is limited content for missions etc.

The above can be resolved, and I am hoping these issues get resolved in the near future, at which point I will happily adjust this review.",1577570782,1609679368,True,0,0,0.477317571640014648,1,True,False,False

In general I love space simulation games, be it Stellaris, No Man Sky or this one here. 
That's enough intro.

My review for X4: Foundations is pretty simple. 

Yes, noone can deny that Egosoft is ambitious by creating an AI that does not cheat in the way everything is build (exception: Scale Plate Pirates, SCA and Khaak) and that you are able to have pretty much everything (only exception: the beautiful TEL Trading Station, damn you Egosoft).

By that, this game can and will bug out more often than not. Certain things are still a considerable issue like the AI or performance.

But with the upcoming 4.0 patch the game will be a notch better than before. I am playing the beta for that version since a few hours (~ 40h) and there are some crucial changes to performance and overall empire management which is imo very very nice. 

X4: Foundations is able to entertain aspiring entrepreneurs and other folks, be it warmonger or empire builders, for thousands of hours, if you are interested in investing your game time into this game and learn everything there is. 

The community is a big treasure cove of information and one of the nicest I know of, be it on the inoffical discord or egosoft's own forum (We dont talk about Steam Forum, everybody knows how it is).

Another huge huge bonus: Egosoft will polish there game (maybe a pun, dunno yet) on and on (see X3TC from laggy 1.0 to the current latest version with several new plots etc), so you can actually play a game that you know will be getting better and better, like old wine or weed (latter i don't know exactly, just there for the alliteration)

Same for the AI which has been improved a lot since x3 and xR, even since 1.0 was released the devs have worked and improved the AI and they still are working on it, it works but it's not perect... You'll still see weird things like ships clipping into stations or into other ships etc... but it happens A LOT less. 
People are complaining that they end stuck inside station, this happens almost always when they fly full speed in travel mode and watch the 3D map without looking where they fly and they hit a station or an asteroid at 5.000 KM/s....  there is no collision damage for hull because the AI tends to bump into obstacles so the devs had this as a workaround, it's not perfect but it works.
And keep in mind that the AI has A LOT of things to do, dock on stations and on carriers, destroyers etc.... the scale of the game is just too big and honestly the AI is a lot better than in all other space sims like Elite dangerous or rebel galaxy... 

As of 3.30 I had no problemes with the economy, it works, I played for 500 hours vanilla version and had no issues, people complain that shipyards don't have ressources to buy ships but that's not a bug, it's a feature, everything has to be produced and transported to the shipyard so sometimes you have to wait and do something else in the meantime or you can buy the ressources and sell them to the station and make some profits... your choice.

The only thing I'm disappointed is the war systeme, factions relation is too static there is almost 0 diplomacy and the factions that are at war did not go to war in my 500 hours they build stations in each other territory and only engage in small skirmishes except for xenons and HOP because they start with massive fleets and have a solide economy, but I feel like in vanilla the devs have given too many restrictions too all the other factions preventing them from reallly building up their fleets and engaging in sector conquest...",1543598676,1609168213,True,5,0,0.549460709095001221,0,True,False,False

That didn't pan out. The universe really isn't alive. Sure there are wars, but in my game 100 hrs in, I really didn't seem to have any significant impact. If I blow something up, the AI just replaces it. They spawn random stations that don't really make sense. 

More than anything though, the combat is just boring. Each ship has one or two patterns they repeat every single fight. There isn't much variety at all. If I bring wingmen, they really become more of a liability than an asset. I hoped I could do things like set a line of tanky fighter ships backed by a line of missle frigates, but no such thing is possible. Your wingmen just fly around randomly and fire at the target every once in awhile.

The economy...the hierarchy of goods, or what makes what in this game, is really obscure. The previous titles had goods that made sense. These goods have obscure names and it is never obvious what is needed to make what. You'll constantly have to look it up. It just subtracts even more from the immersion.

[b]TL:DR:[/b]

 This game still needs polish and shaping to be truly great. Graphics are great and at times can be mesmerizing. That said what is in the game is good, close to X3:AP but not there yet in terms of quality. X3:AP took a lot if polish too. And what is coming in future DLCs seems promising.

[b]Story:[/b] 2/5 
- Doesn't hold your hand, But it Doesn't have to. You are tossed in to a semi-simulated universe. you make the story. It is better that way. You may decide to ally with faction and help them end the war against the rouge ""space terminators""... maybe you might like to make Profitsss and sell to both warring factions... perhaps you had a revelation an religious epiphany if you will, to purge the unholy outcast scourge in the name of the holy emperor...  or you decide that you don't like things are being run, you see. and it is time for a new top dog to call the shots for total domination of the known universe.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 3/5 
- [b]There is a steep learning curve that frights most ""casual"" players.[/b]

-[b] If you liked watching micromanaging games, this is one that you will really enjoy. otherwise some aspects of the game could feel like a bit of a chore.[/b]

- You may find yourself reloading saves to get a preferred outcome, as the dice may not always roll in your favor. 

[b]Graphic:[/b] 4/5
- Taking part in huge space battles can be really fun. Especially when jumping into the unknown not really knowing that is at the other end.
- Animations can to with a little more polish.
- The game could do with more optimizations where possible.

[b]length:[/b] 4/5

I want to love this game but im struggling to get into it after 8 hours of trying. idk what im doing which is an expected problem because it is a very complex game. but whats really killing it for me is the bugs ive experienced already. in the tutorials i fall through the station map and end up waling stuck between walls. if i load a game while docked at a station i end up loading in flying between walls. several occasions i fly into the station and end up between walls. ive also had things show up that wasnt supposed to be there cause i cant target or do anything with them. they are just floating and i fly right through them. ive also had a Xenon platform show up that was invisible. i could target it but could not see it or do any damage to it so myself along with several other npcs were just firing at nothing and occasionally you would hear a sound like you hit the hull but there was nothing there. Lastly there was a graphical glitch which i turned down the settings for and it mostly worked. sort of. i would fly into fuzz and pink boxes or random color streaks. i still jump from system to system and if there is a planet it will phase out into a white circle for no reason and struggle to load in. but the planet thing is more a minor annoyance and like i said the graphical errors with the pink boxes and color streaks may have been corrected by toning down settings. its the broken stations and invisible enemies that really get me. i dont mind learning how to play the game if the game was there. i dont want to be scared to walk on a station cause im always falling into the floor and between the walls or be scared of loading near a station. i heard it had bugs back when i got it and i waited to play it cause i also play elite dangerous with some friends. but i know the game has been out for quite a while as of the writing of this review and bugs like that should not be happening.

You are thrust into a dense jungle of mechanics, menus, submenus, and the like, and given a mere pocketknife with which to hack your way through the underbrush.

Making the first part of the game the worse is textbook Bad Design, and this grueling start is almost certainly the reason for a lot of the bad reviews that the game has been getting - and to be fair to them, I'd have binned the game as well if I wasn't a veteran of Egosoft releases and knew to expect not only a brutal early game but a buggy release. 

That brings me to the next matter - the bugs. They're there, yes, but even in the couple of weeks since release, Egosoft has been quickly squashing, stamping, ironing out, and patching. Therefore any review that's even more than a week or two old is likely a bad one simply because of Egosoft's penchant for broken releases. This is also textbook Bad Design, and again I'll say that the bad reviews are fair; this wasn't a perfect release, and the naysayers are well entitled to a mostly bug-free gaming experience, and justified in refunding if that's not what they got.

Right, still reading? Good; those are really the game's worst points, and one will note that they had little enough to do with the game mechanics themselves - because, simply put, the mechanics are sensible, work well, and are fun...once you do learn them. The universe is complex and reactive; you are a small fish in a big pond, and perhaps by virtue of constant struggle you, too, may one day be a slightly bigger fish. Progress is slow at the start (see above about the grueling and frustrating first hours) but with perseverance you can soon find yourself snowballing. Your first million credits are the hardest - within the span of a couple of hours you'll find yourself pissing away a million credits without a second thought as your trade empire grows. It's an immensely satisfying feeling, watching your horizons expand outward as your pilots get more competent, your fleet gets more ships, and your income gets more...more. And you can then leverage your gains for even more gains. Lovely.

Some have complained about ship design, and I will concede that I'm a diehard lover of the original X3:TC/AP designs, and in my opinion the designs here are not only a step down, they're a freefall. But the redeeming grace here is that they're much more modular and customizable - swap out this turret for that one, and marvel at the change in your ship's profile and shape. Paint it this colour or that, and apply your own decal (and even import your own decals from .png's that you have lying around). 

Walking around ships' interiors was a bit of a disappointment - at the time of this writing it seems very bare-bones, with a bridge in which you may hover creepily over your pilot's shoulder and an elevator/teleporter that leads to the flight deck where your other ships are landed(!) or to the airlock where you can EVA. Bonus: You can set your captain to fly to a certain point, then EVA out and sit on the fuselage while in transit.  Stations, on the other hand, are large, expansive, and dynamic. Hop into a parked NPC's ship to look around, and then watch in horror as the airlock closes behind you and the oblivious bastard takes off with you in tow. A memorable moment came when I was in this situation and had to call one of my own ships to land on this NPC's ship to rescue me - and I was able to walk out onto the flight deck and watch my ship came out of the black expanse of space, align its course, and land on this still-moving freighter.

But I ramble on. In short, this is a game I wholly recommend; if one is willing to grit their teeth for what is an admittedly unpleasant start, they'll be rewarded with a deep and rewarding simulation that is, by and large, detailed and interesting enough to reward the early struggle.",1544638368,1608279414,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You start up as someone, start making cash and building an empire. Total control of the universe is your end goal, making money with factories is so easy in fact, that there is basically no way to lose money by making bad decisions, it just takes longer until you make money. 

Huge fleets, all starships are controllable, a completely simulated universe, X4 is the primus of management-combat-single-player space sims and stands (unfortunately?) unbeaten in its niche. I recommend having a monster-CPU, otherwise it can run very unstable once you have hundreds of ships. Those 300 hours I have were made in one run in two playthroughs, and it will be more once I have better hardware. 

There is a learning curve, new players WILL get confused, it's a game that requires you to bite through. EGOSOFT are constantly patching it and releasing new stuff, they have so far shown excellent support even to their less well received games.

Though I'm not one for a massively simplified UI there are constant frustations born from the interface and approaches taken.

It is not helped by heavy fragmentation and a lack of secondary sources. Searches tend to pick up bits and pieces from all around the place that often don't make things really all that clear. It seems there are a lot of resources out there which aren't brilliantly written, poorly selected by the UI or videos which I hate as not only do they take several minutes to explain something that could be read in a few seconds with most of it being noise but for some bizarre reason it's almost as if there's a rule that to make a video on the game you must have an outrageously thick accent that grates and takes a lot of effort to listen to. Though that's not directly on the game it's a missing fallback for some of the more awkward elements.

Constant interface issues can end up feeling like as a player I'm being slapped in the face. Other players that unconditionally love the game rarely help and occasionally work tirelessly to pile in to obstruct crucial feedback needed by developers. Though perhaps not as bad as in some communities it's a bit more vital given the complexity of the game and lack of polish around usability.

I've played X a fair bit before though quite a long time ago so my memory is not super fresh from previous versions.

My first epic frustration was almost comedic and I thought an unlucky one off but really is indicative of the rest of the game. I was pulling my hair out in frustration for an hour at least trying just to dock. It has this 3D lock on thing where each indicator is not explained and inconsistent but to top it off colour coded and I'm moderately colour blind so I need to stare at it a little while longer than usual to see the colours change easily between red and green.

Throughout the game there are less unlikely UI issues that constantly put a damper on what's otherwise a great game.

When things you own dock remotely using the map they keep shaking all over the place (I suspect this might be an old bug in previous games even).

There is a lack of some basic controls around the listings of things (like filter a column by value, nest by and some of the nesting ir broken where ships can disappear entirely or inconsistent as to when or when not to show ships both nested or flat).

In many screens things lack proper descriptions or full relevant information. There's an encyclopedia containing states that should be inline while missing proper descriptions of things or what they do. Particularly for example missiles. There are types that are meant to do things like shut down engines but all you have to go by is their name which doesn't explain any of this. Lots of hidden ill explained things it's way too mysterious about. In real life this could be a scene from Money Python or something. We have this lovely disruptor missile half price. What does it disrupt? I don't know. Maybe the price. Would you buy medicine even though you don't know what it cures but it cures something, maybe you have that, better to be safe than sorry!

A bit of discovery and experimentation is great but it starts to become more of an annoyance when it's heavily contrived by having things missing or hidden that don't need to be.

There's a mechanism in the game where you have to listen carefully and the sound is way too subtle or indistinct to know really what you're after (the game is fill with noise and you have to go around listening carefully for noise to pick up some signals).

Early on there's an automine feature which caused me a lot of confusion because ships then fly of and mine like it's a valid order when it's not. This completely threw me off the resource system thinking patches on the map were just dense asteroids and not necessarily resources only meaning places hard or slow to fly through.

Fleet management is missing an extra bit to allow a headless fleet (all fleets need a depth of at least two, a lead ship or station).

There are many small little nagging things with the inteface or things that are less upfront and more esoteric than they strictly need to be.

Some of the UI comes from that the game takes on a few different forms. It quite often ends up a bit like a sim. Like waiting for plants to grow, etc. You put a lot of things on automatic but other things need manual intervention.

One of the most frustration elements of the game is in managing this. It's very poor at alerting you of things needing your attention so instead unless you give the game loads of attention much of which is to no ends annoying things keep happening.

Loads of things get shoved into this huge logbook which lacks good filters. You quite often get notices of things important that appear too briefly and you then have to go trace them down and they're not separately filtered anyway. Despite all the huge noise in the log books often little bits of information aren't there which might help. The same with the notices. They tend not to even mention sector and in most cases the first thing you need to do is look at the sector in the map. Not much fancy needs to be done to not have the player jumping through all these hoops.

The most frustrating thing is constantly having something brought to my attention when it's too late. Sometimes I can't find a ship and I have no idea what ever happened to it.

Sadly mods don't go that far in fixing interface issues like this.

The game has some other related usability oddities like commands not available without the right experience and gaining experience is way too hard. This is a really blatant balance issue and I'm surprise it's not been tweaked at all.

Some people might mistake this for a steep learning curve but a lot of these things are relatively small to address yet go a long way. It's too much unnecessary friction and given the steep learning curve it becomes a fatal flaw. I think there's a lack of realisation for the kind of balance and what's needed from a UI for a game that has reached this complexity. I want lots of things to do but I want them to actually be part of playing the game than playing the interface.

It's a bit of a shame, like building an awesome engine but then building a car around it that's lacklustre. A lot of the work gone into the UI is good but yet is often incomplete given the enormity of the game.",1607895624,1608067498,False,4,0,0.421687006950378418,0,True,False,False

So here's my short and sweet this game isn't for people who don't like complicated games. First off do you're research. You'll have to look at alot of guides and watch alot of youtube to get things figured out properly. And yes it does get frustrating. I'm running what I think to be a high end gaming rig I built myself. Well put together myself had a friend help me with the part picking, and this game does put a strain on the system when everything else runs fine, but then again I am late game so it can be expected. One of my known issues is SETA can be dangerous to leave up and running just to make money. The NPC factions do war amongest themselves and you could lose access to blueprints cause a faction has be so crippled you can't talk to the NPC to get them cause a station doesn't exsist that he can be on.  I was a big fan of X3 back in the day, and I feel this game is up to par. Only thing that I wished was different I have had long bouts of game freeze while in the station builder going crazy building mega-plexs but after about an hour of ""frozen"" it pulls through and picks up where it left off. So if you're into the megaplex thing use the feature to save your station print so you can come back to it if the game crashes. Other then that the story line is engaging it's fun to just sit in one system and run your fleets about the universe raining havoc upon the eneimes of your faction. and it's kinda cool to have a station that is self sufficent that can pump out a fleet of ships in a matter of minutes (With SETA of course, which is worth dealing with the Xeonon to get)

So if this review has swayed you for or against this game then my purpose was served, the choice is yours early game pays off with all the hard work you need to do, but it's not an instant reward system.

This is so great. 

But saving the game feels like it takes forever. This needs to improve.
And somewhat 'strange' and different from other games, being in tight quarters (ships and station rooms) seems to drag FPS to a very low level. Strange because in other games it is being outside in wide open spaces that drags FPS down.

Make sure to not set AA settings to high. Go for FXAA. 

Also I struggle a lot with evaluating my computers performance for running this game and what a potential upgrade would do for the performance.

X4 fixed many of the problems with rebirth, took some of the few elements that did work from Deepsilvers 2013 title and reframed the franchise in line with what its core audience craved. 

This is a 4X game in space played with a vast variety of ships from several races. the heart of it is a galactic economy sim and the its selling point is the way it handles large merchant empires or military fleets backed by an industrial network. There are many space games, the x series is pretty much the only one with this take. In an era with studios chasing the ability to exit your ship and walk around the stations, this game adds as much of that to enhance the setting but not let it bog down the development cycle. the slight caveat is that some races will be released via expansions in future.

Sorry, the AI is terrible and will be doing strange stuff all the time. You want to build space stations, first get through all the boring stuff before you can start doing this. You want a story to follow? Do loooooooooots of grinding before you can get further into the story.

Maybe if I was 16, I would spend 100s of hours to reach those goals, but now I really can't wait that long.

On the other hand: the graphics are fantastic, they look fabulous on my 4K OLED screen.
The controls are so-so but ok.
The user interface is terrible. I am an engineer and I need help to use it.
The AI is terrible, really.

But yes, the game gives you the feeling of being in space. The big ships really make you feel small. You can almost do anything you want, even walk on your spaceship without a space suit on while your pilot takes off into space.

Will it be the best space sim that you've ever played? Maybe.

Visuals and Sound:

The visuals aren't going to make you feel like you're really there. It's not a cinematic experience. There are clipping issues. The soundtrack is okay, not spine tingling. But if you've come here for those things, you've come for the wrong reason.

Gameplay:

Once again, this isn't the smoothest running space sim. There are bugs to be found across the galaxy. Plenty of them. Fewer with each patch though. There will be pathfinding issues that drive you nuts and you will wonder why your orders aren't being followed. This is an issue that has gotten better but needs to be addressed. Combat is sticky and not fluid.
Then again, this is not a space combat sim.

Now, I've covered what this game is not. Let me explain what it is:

This game is a very complex, very ambitious, space economy simulator. Yes, the economy nerds within us all can rejoice at the thriving and robust economy that drives the X universe. The economy is driven by the one consistent need in space navigation. Ships! For all of the technical flaws, the devs have built a mammoth of a system that operates hidden from the player. 

So, I think the devs deserve a break when it comes to minor graphical and gameplay issues. However, the economy seems mostly fleshed out, and it is time to take care of the AI and clipping inside space stations type issues. I hope the devs don't just rest on their laurels here. The game really needs attention in that department.

TL;DR;

Space Captains - Maybe don't buy this game if you have another preferred space game.

Space Entrepreneurs - Definitely buy this game. Build up factories, fleets, and sectors.

Devs - Please do this amazing creation of yours the favor it deserves and overhaul the AI. Squash the pathfinding and gameplay bugs.",1606570060,1606570060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I also wanted some strategy.  Little did I know I would find so much more. These are the things I like about this game.

Things I like...

0. Ability to save your game- Since a bad choice can mess you up. You can always fall back on your previous save games.

1.  Not super easy with lots to do- A bit of a learning curve. I had to figure things out on my own (at my own pace). If I got frustrated and needed to know something,  forums was a good resource.

2. Strategy- Similar to Stellaris with a twist. Has a gameboard (map) layout but you can do everthing in first person or have your subordinates do it for you.

3. Building stuff- Lots of building. Starts with the basics but you can build many (if not all-I'm still new) of the modules the NPC's are using. So many parts go into the building process for each ship and each factory can create many, if not all of the parts (assuming the area of space you build has all of the base resources). 
3a. Build the factories the way you want- You can layout the building modules (production, housing, storage, docks..etc) how you like. 

4. Reputation-Reputation with the other factions determine trade prices and also whether they are friendly with you. Once your rep is high enough, you can buy blueprints and create their massive ships at your warf. 

5. Lots of variations of ships- Factions have their own version of small, med, large and XL ships. I didn't realize how massive these ships were until I got in my spacesuit and flew around them.  I like the fact that even on the medium ships you can dock a small frigate on them. 

6. Ability to hack and steal blueprints (instead of buying them-expensive).

7. Black market- Trading illegal wares (don't get caught with them on you)

8. Control the actions of your subordinates- if you want your miners to only mine within one sector you can control it. if you don't want them to enter a sector you can blacklist it so they will not enter (sometimes they can get attacked and destroyed).  
9. assign behavior of subordinates-You can assign subordinated to guard you, your miners, traders, other ships, bases etc. 

10. Ability to personalize the game. When starting out, I was assigned a name as ""Val <some lastname I cant remember>"". I was able to change the name as well as rename all of my factories and bases. I was also given the ability to choose a logo and an organization name. 

11. Mods. There are mods from the Steam workshop that can be downloaded to enhance your game experience. I am planning on installing the ""Starwars""  mod when I get some time. 


Would I recommend this game to others to buy?? ABSOLUTELY! I do not think you would be disappointed once you honestly give it a chance.  There are things that need improving but the devs are working on them.

Mechanics are overhauled to a degree that is fitting for a sequel this long in the making (I am ignoring Rebirth), but the 4X style gameplay is defintely still here 100% - building fleets of ships (fly any of them!), stations, combat, missions, exploration, mining, trading - but the new map and method for giving orders, travel mode, highways AND several different types of jump gates are great. 
Launch was not without issues, but compared to X:R and X3:R, buttery smooth.

It´s like X3 all over, but with the new engine and its new possibilities.
I´m so happy they managed to get back to their original series after the X:Rebirth desaster... but was a good test of the new engine, so it had atleast a positive effect..

Gameplay is pretty fun and very complex.... and the map is huge... seems small at first, but once you discover more and more things, it gets so huge, it´s amazing.... even a lot larger than the X3 universe since every sector is a lot larger too.

I love the new station building and how you can put different modules on your ship and actually see the change when walking around it.

Haven´t discovered a single downside yet and i´m so happy i gave them a chance again after X:Rebirth... only because i loved all their old games from x1-x3 and all its expansions.

Another thing to note is that this game is single player though, so if your looking to play with your friends in a spaceship game, this ain't it chief.
But the most excellent part of the game, is simply that it doesn't feel as if it was designed with disdain for the player, unlike in elite (coincidentally, also the name of the starter ship) it is possible to get somewhere without an incredible grind, it also has so much content, and I've only seen around 2 and a half hours of it (1 and a half hours to setup HOTAS controls)
But there are drawbacks, number one is of course the graphics, now it is by no means ugly, it just doesn't have the ""pop"" that Elite's views and vistas have, with on average the game looking more like a 2015 game than a 2018 one, although to be honest, when your looking out your cockpit at the views of planets and stations contrasting with the dark, cold, emptiness of space, you really aren't going to be critiquing it in the moment.
One thing it does have over Elite visually though, is its lack of ORANGE, now I understand that you can change the colors of the HUD in elite, but you need to do some file-editing fuckery that I really don't want to mess with, plus I got elite on xbox so I never really had that option.
The HUD and UI elements are a nice, pale-ish blue and grey, with very little neon being thrown at you, it may be a bit more boring than Elite, but it is definitely easier on the eyes after a few hours.
Second drawback however, is purely a negative, the controls, I set up my controls on Elite ON CONSOLE and it felt like a dream, it was very easy and once it was set up, I had no UI issues, on X4 however, not only does it not allow you to set multiple binds for the same button (E.G: One button to switch both primary and secondary weapon presets) but I also never found a way to DELETE bindings (which I'm sure there is a way for, but I couldn't find it for the life of me) and I had to resort to fuckery to remove keybinds which I didn't want.
There is pretty much no excuse for the state of the keybinding system, but this is a relatively small concern, given that you only need to do it once.

And I selected the start with tutorial missions. If not for lots of other people before me asking (stupid? no, warranted) questions on basic game mechanics I'd be lost. I guess that you're supposed to have played the previous games in the series?

So far I've enjoyed myself, and it would seem like the potential is great. So many features that exist, that works...in some way... It's not that the controls are bad, it's just a bit of a cumbersome UI combined with lacking tooltips and tutorials.

For instance, if you want to build on your space station, but that piece just doesn't fit there because it doesn't. And if you figure out that it's out of bounds, you need to go to another screen to expand the station area. A small tooltip on why you can't build it there (or where you can build it) and less hopping between different screens would be far better.

My biggest gripe so far is the AI. Often it's better to micromanage which quickly becomes unrealistic to do. Granted, you'll probably have more or less issues with this depending on your style of play.

The bars in stations, I would want to drink in. The views of space are amazing. The ship designs are excellent. The ongoing life of the systems, battles, trading, etc. is all a wonderful world to live in. There's a feeling of discovery as you find lockboxes floating in space and get out in your spacesuit to blast off the locks and collect the goods inside. There's a feeling of childish glee when you come upon a massive battle between powers and swoop between weapon blasts to loot the goods from the wreckage. There's the feeling of discovery when you come upon a pirate base behind a massive minefield.

Then again the jank is still here, which I remember from way back in X2. NPCs in cutscenes go invisible, asteroids rip you out of the superhighway, the autopilot takes you on loops of the galaxy. You can't complete missions that ask you to mine a section of space because your own mines blow you up immediately, but your autopilot can fly you through a massive section of space filled with mines at 4.5km/s with no issues. The NPCs look like they were ripped directly from X2, a 15 year old game.

Still you have to admire EgoSoft, because their product is good, and there is love put in here.

What is X4 like?  Well, it is a trading game, with exploration, all built around a flight simulator. You spend most of your time flying around in your ship. Your first ship isn't great. So you pine for a better ship. But money isn't easy to come by, at first, so--if you are like me--you start really mulling over the problem. Next thing you know, you're hooked. Flying, mining crystals, doing missions, dog-fighting pirates or criminals. And maybe even cooler stuff like boarding vessels or building stations, but I'm nowhere near close to that yet. X4 can be repetitive when you land on stations over and over and over again. And the stations are all very similar to one-another, though Egosoft puts in these hilarious tidbits (like rude ship workers) that keep it interesting. Eventually, I learned I can query what the stations buy/sell right through the map context menus, and flying is pretty fun so it hasn't deterred me.

Granted, there is still room for improvement... and improvement is slowly being rolled out. X4 is a long-term work in progress really. There are still barebone features, holes in content and areas in need of some work - but X4 right now is a solid return to the series, even if it took some time to get to that point.

For those new to the X series, X4 is a space sim with a primary focus on building a business empire complete with a vast fleet. You start out with a single small ship shooting up pirates or trading between supply stations and work your way up to being a corporate powerhouse. You don't HAVE to focus on the business side of things of course; though as things progress, you may find yourself in need of wingmen, capital ships and even eventually armadas. X4 can be played with a flight stick (which may or may not need a LOT of work setting up correctly going by some of the weird default bindings), controller or mouse and keyboard. You can fight in the various civil wars and conflicts in the in-game universe either from the front lines or from the safety of your HQ, via a command system. And when I say from the safety of your HQ - I mean you can walk around the interior of stations and even chat with the NPCs there.

Like all X games, X4 is a complex beast that might scare off newcomers with its overwhelming amount of data and information to keep track of; but for a veteran of the series, it's generally more of the same.

Considering that X Rebirth is basically the introduction of a whole new game engine and X4 is the direct sequel to it, understandably, there is significantly less content than X3 (particularly when you're comparing with Albion Prelude). Less ships, less sectors, less game starts and with the Boron not yet properly introduced (and Terrans still in production), less species. But X4 is definitely a visual upgrade, with better flight physics and immersion. If there's one area X4 really fails at compared to the older games, however, its the limited story content - though with each new update and expansion, more plotlines are being added.

In all X4 is... getting there. Probably worth getting if you're into this sort of thing. There are better games out there for combat, but X4 isn't terrible in that department either.

-Why don't my fleet wingmates attack?
-Why don't my freighters sell anything and get stuck all the time?
-Why do you let me buy a 5 million credit freighter then disallow me to use because I don't have a 3 star captain? What use it then? Can't autotrade because stupidity.

Then X Rebirth happened.
I skipped it.


X4 was announced, I was so excited to see the cockpits, the increased freedom, the REAL economy.
Everything Rebirth should have been.

I bought it the day it came out and was really excited to play another awesome X-plot, resulting in me becoming very rich so i could start building my imperium and dominate the galaxy.
It was so much fun to try out everything that I could do now and was eagerly looking for a plot after the tutorial.
(The one where you unlock researching and get your headquarters.)


But there was none - the tutorial was the plot...
And thus the descent into pure disappointment started.


There is more stuff to do, but nothing is fleshed out.

There are more ships everywhere, but the universe feels more lonely then ever.

You can finally walk around in your station and also look outside, but there are only very few interiors and you can only set foot on landing platforms.

You can plan and auto-build your station, but you cannot move parts of it or work in parallel.

There are highways that make travelling WAY quicker, but there are no other streets at all.

You have higher speeds in general, but shorter distances in fighting and between stations.

You have a new interface, but its the worst in the series (after X2).

You have an encyclopedia ingame, but its effectively empty.

You have new weapons, but lost the old ones with their diversity and nostalgia.

You can customize ships, but you dont really have choice.
(EDIT: They reworked this, but its still not fun to me.)

And finally you got mod support, but seemingly noone that wants to come together to create huge, fun mods.
(EDIT: i dont knwo abotu this point anymore. Ive seen some videos of pretty huge mods by now.)

TLDR conclusion at the bottom

well 3.0 has improved the game in MANY areas and i AM hopefull for the 2. Expansion but there are still quite a few things that WILL annoy the hell out of you and make you ragequit here and there... but ill come to that later.
First the pro/con list:

first the pros because the core game is great and now even better:
+ Much improved station building
+ flying and shooting feels good
+ i like the graphics and ship designs (especially the expansion)
+ walking on stations (but not needed to often and there is a fast transport system)
+ imo the universe is big enough (and will keep growing)
+ the highway allows you to get everywhere faster but the new sectors aren't connected to it so its a bit of both i guess
+ Station Managers reduce micromanaging and organize stations and ships themselves (look cons)

i know some of the pros are subjective (universe size and the highway are a con for some)

con (and this still annoys me and breaks immersion):
- if you build dedicated refineries there is no way to make a transport dedicated to supplying your main base (there may be a complicated workaround but i haven't tried it since i use mods)
- no incentive to build more than one supercomplex (build everything you need to build ships and then sell them at 150% price and you are rich)
EDIT: build 2 more Stations and Miners would not deliver ore until i gave the station some cargo drones... IT DOES NOT TELL YOU TO and WHY do i need them when i have a dock 4 L/XL ships?


- ai wars are still pretty broken:
  - xenon invade with max 3 cap ships
  - xenon don't have a large enough defence fleet ( they attack with small fleets but a single Paranid carrier
    can slowly whipe out a Xenon sector - not all though, some are protected with 2 Ks and an I)
  - Paranid send fleets against the xenon while they loose a sector to another faction
  - when i started the expansion those few xenon capitals where already destroying split stations. So there 
    might be a balancing problem: in the beginning they might claim a lot of territory but once the gates are 
    guarded by you they get pushed back slowly
  - xenon still send mining ships in enemy territory to get slaughtered

- don't know if mines work when oos
- there are hazardous areas that the ai ignores and even builds stations in (they don't get damaged oos)
- oos combat has been vastly improved but it still has some quirks (4 of my destroyers were losing against a xenon K because they were trying to keep distance and so whey moved away leaving only the rear turrets to fire. after i ordered them to attack they quickly destroyed the K)
EDIT: my carrier group bugged and did not engage
- the new missions that allow you to alter relations between factions (awesome) are still buggy so save often and in different slots (also missions are often vague on what exactly to do, which would be ok if there where no bugs... but now you never know if a mission is buggy or you missed something... if you cant get your mission system to work bugfree allow us to manually complete quests (like empyrion)


Already Fixed:
- I dont know if station managers can organize miner with different ore yet (ill update once i build my new stations
- you CAN allocate storage manually now
- cant really comment on trade since i dont pay attention to it too much
- defence stations now work pretty well
- cant comment on in systhem (IS) combat yet since i haven't had a big battle after 3.0
- they added the option to turn of most masseges

RAGE moments:
my fleet managed to turn an ally fleet hostile (probably friendly fire) while i was near them doing somethin on the map

- a large transport was attacked by a pirate destroyer near a gate he wanted to fly through. There where 5 of my Destroyers on the other side of the gate. i told the transport to flee but it just flew circles around the gate and the destroyers took forever to fly through the gate. they eventually made it but could not kill the pirate before he destroyed my transport... you know pirates... when outnumbered they kamikaze... its not like they are after profit or anything...

- i found a abandoned fighter in the middle of nowhere, whent outside in my suit and claimed it... and the moment i opened the map: BAM instakill by a random event spawned enemy with hitscan weapons coming in at cruisespeed.
YES there are constant random events when you are far enough away from stations that spawn enemies (not out of nowhere but they teleport them from somewhere) near you to make space more exiting... 

general attitude of the devs:
they added mods so you can play it the way you want, BUT restrict a lot of aspects so you can only play it the way WHEY want...
- you cant disable ALL massages. when you (and only you personally) kill an enemy of someone near his station, you get a reward from the faction AND the stations in range. each reward comes delayed and with a video massage that interrupts SETA (time accelerator). you can not switch them off. like the president of the US or Angela Merkel would personally give you a call when you tackle a thieve or prevented a mugging or defended yourself for the 50th time... its a bounty guys... allow me to switch it off... (even mods seem to be unable to disable them)
Especially since i use a mod they gives me credit for the enemies my ships kill, so i can have a mercenary fleet guarding gates against the xenon... i get spammed with ""thanks""...
its not immersive if i get a huge applause for a kill but my ships don't get shi*.
maybe give my ships a portion of the bounty so its balanced (these guards are a big investment) and allow me to toggle the calls? ... but they already commented they don't want to give you that option cause of reasons...

- mods disable the ""venture"" feature and make it very hard to get your hands on good upgrades or skins...
y not check if a venture-ship is vanilla and if something doesn't match/load/work just don't spawn the ship in other peoples games... if people use mods to abuse venture to get stuff so what? its single player guys...
also some mods are VERY useful and just add to your game. WHY punish people for playing the game like they want?

- they say ""SETA"" (time accelerator) is an extra and they only added it because everybody wanted it... it works ok and i don't complain about it, but WHY do the faction quests have things like: give 1,000,000,000 (yes 1 billion) to some guy for research or deliver 22,000,000 missile components (you don't get payed for them so you have to order 1000 transport runs manually (best transport i could find) and you don't expect people to use SETA for that?

I read in a Devblog (don't remember if it was Factorio or Rimworld) that every function and activity in a game should have a use/reason, fit the game universe and should be fun to do. It seems to me that Egosoft have not used those criteria on some of the aspects of the game...
I'm not saying they haven't improved at all (in X3 building a capital ship could take over 24h real time) but i think the general attitude and lack of planning ahead (in therms of code, implementation and the evolution of game development) is still holding egosoft back... i'm not an insider so i hope i'm wrong

TLDR:
conclusion: the base game is there, has been expanded upon and i like it, but it is still not in a position that makes the overall experience good enough to recommend because the game still constantly reminds you that everything in this game is just a simple, half broken script...
i hope they improve the game with the next expansion so i can finally recommend it

IF (changed from if to when to if again) egosoft manages to fix the core game (they already have improved quite a lot) i will recommend the game, but right a lot of the time spend is still not fun

If you are thinking of buying this, an FYI it takes a lot of time to play and a little hard to get started if you've never played an X game before, It is a little easier than others though.  If you're into spaceship flying shooters as well as strong economy games, this is the game for you.  It's worth the full price but, I will say you need to make sure you know what you are buying.  Watch videos on it, see the reviews, check out the gameplay.  This game is not for everyone.  Good luck and fly safe!  

The game has stunning graphics and you get a grand scale on how big space is but, also the ease of being able to traverse it.

Recommend having a higher end computer to experience it with little bogging down from hardware but, you should still be able to manage without.  It can get choppy late game from the amount of ship you have (I mean in the 1000's) or the massive stations (like HUGE) you decide to build.  You'll end up there if you play the game as long as others or I have.  Reaching 100,000,000,000 credits will just seem like a drop in the bucket and you'll have mega stations everywhere.

Time is an understatement because you will spend a lot of it... trust me.

Here are gameplay videos if you want to get a general Idea of the scope of the game

Much like the previous titles you will need to spend several hours learning and understanding the concepts and interface, probably need to add a few mods (Very good Mod community), and have a love and understanding of empire and industrial management.  If you can do that, this game will reward you with a great experience, that said, like all X games, including the wrongly hated rebirth, the game is hampered by a clunky interface.  If you cannot learn to put up with awkward menu systems, this game is not for you.  Also if you are just looking for a space shooter, I highly advise you look somewhere else.  this has more in common with Sim City than Eite Dangerous.


Updated review:
I now have over 1200 hours in the game ( a bit of AFK) and have to say the game has come a long way in the way of story line, especially with Split Vendetta .  you have to hunt and work around to find the story lines that in turn branch into more stories, but they add crunchy bits of character to a game that is otherwise a bit bland personality wise.  Also the mod collection has gotten so expansive and good that it is near impossible to stay away from dozens of great mods,  making it harder to determine what greatness comes from the base game vs the wonderful mod community.  Highly recommend!  though might be worth waiting a few months after the next Expansion for stability reasons.",1588609703,1603973022,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

TL:DR : recommend trying / leap of faith, but it could just as easily NOT be the thing you are looking for.

this is not an easy game to get into. as an avid X-universe fan you can probably forgive and work around it's flaws, as an ""outsider"" things can get frustrating easily.

to the ever returning:  ""is it worth buying?"" query, Ask yourself the question: can i spare the credits for a leap-of-faith on this game?  because this game has no middle-ground in my honest opinion, you either play for a day and refund it, or easily spend hundreds of hours on it. you HAVE to commit/immerse yourself and ""make it your own"" & ""create your own fun"".

[b]Pro's[/b]
- this developer is unique and commited to the universe it created, i fully expect work being done further into the games lifespan via patches/fixes and additional DLC
- immersion is unmatched, the universe feels very alive at certain points. i love quiet moments where i'm just grabbing a cup of coffee and relaxing on a docking-platform to watch station space traffic/freighters going about their bussiness, everything you see flying around IS there for a purpose, not some pre-progammed cut-scene type of thing.
- hands on, in sector combat . need something done? do it yourself. this game makes me feel awesome being behind the controls of a large capital-ship and showing the Ai scrubs how it's done.
- ship prOn, self explanitory. i have no doubt these 3D artists could create starships for days, but at some point you just need to stop and work with the assets you have. (looking at you: star-citizen)
- do whatever you want. be a space-trucker, pirate, tycoon, private army, combat ace, evil bastard. if you can imagine it, there is probably SOME way you can get that to work.

[b]Con's[/b]
- the steep learning curve, you have to ""invest"" to make it work, do not expect to get pulled in once the initial hours of awe are over.
- do not expect a lengthy Story / main plot, it IS there (and certainly very enjoyable ) , but it is finite/short. 
- Ai (in sector) horrible . expect friendly fire or even shiplosses with large groups of crafts, pathing issues. capital ships overextending and moving into turret-range. many many shennanigans.
- lack of any real endgame. Xenon wiped out (or at least contained) , PHQ built, billions in the bank. thousands of ships. You are effectivly ""done"", at this point it's an open-ended game in which you would have to ""create your own fun"". for me personally, that means: being in the map-view (out-of-sector) 75% of the time, directing forces, building stations, building fleets, containing Kha'ak, chasing down pirates harrassing my freighters. etc.
- bad performance, not much that can be done to remedy this. get the fastest CPU (and to a lesser degree RAM) you can buy and hope for the best. the ""universe"" running in the background will really hammer your system. (if i am hovering around 20-30 with lots going on in-sector i am a happy camper) station building is great, but designing very large complexes is extremly demanding on your system, want to copy/paste that row of 20 Large Storage Modules? be prepared for low-fps or even intermittent freezing)
- bugs exist (not in a truely gamebreaking way i would argue) , most will be fixed, old ones will re- surface, new ones will be pop up.

[b]just a small selection of my personal adventures/experiences;[/b]
- completely subdueing Xenon in all outer ""pockets"" of the universe
- Kha'ak contained around their major ""spawning points"" (free Pilot Experience for rookie pilots!)
- getting that self-sustaining shipyard up and running
- very large station construction projects
- getting several million metric tons of Spaceweed into 10+ large freighters and offloading it somewhere at a station several sector away. (they got pulled over by sector police, lol)

MY universe is borked, i tried to wipe out several factions, some have gone completely hostile due to reasons outside my control. some accidental shots fired, fire returned, sector security getting involved, capital ships retalliating, sector security calling in capital reinforcements, things snowballed from there. 
but, this is MY universe. i shaped (bludgeoned) it into what it is now, and i'm HAPPY with it. Dont know if that makes sense to anyone.

The complained about trading has the autotrade function, but the autotrading does poorly at low pilot levels and better with good pilots. Improvements include the ships and stations having cockpits and the ability to walk around, the ships are now modular and upgradable, as are the stations, many types of control have become viable from mouse or gamepad up to full HOTAS rigs, the world is improved with multiple gate types and highways, the ship types are less confusing with ""small, medium, large"" rather than multiple M types out of sequence, weapons are less messy and easier to understand, and generally its a far superior game.

On the flip side as other games in the industry become far less complex and easier to understand X4's slight improvements in that regard make it a seemingly complex outlier. It will take at least 10 hours to understand the game, likely more for newer players to the series. During this it will seem complex, messy, disorganised, and generally be hard to find your place in the world. I'd suggest doing easy and very easy missions and getting an AI controlled miner to keep funding going.

Its strength is the range of the scale of things that can be done, from walking on stations and piloting small fighters to managing multiple factories and capital fleets. You can also pilot any ship you own, so you can explore the universe in a scout ship, or command a capital ship.

The focus is on building your own space empire, while still having the option to dog-fight or use a gunship to incapacitate lone capital ships. It supports macro-managing your stations and fleets, but still allows micro-managing prices and actions. You can produce basic materials as well as even capital ships. The NPC factions are not that smart, but it serves a purpose: you can have a huge impact on the world. Easy to make a profit, but hard to be truly efficient. Easy to find enemies you can beat, while still offering a challange if you seek it.

    I was hoping X4 would live up to that... sadly i was wrong... so very very wrong. The great thing about most X games is that they were just automated enough were the player could have a fleet and still play the game. 
         That is not the case with this game. IF... you can figure out to play it, cause almost all the tutorials are broken in one way or another, you'll spend another 5 to 9 hours trying to get it to do  what you want and NEED  it too do. Further, you don't get to play your game... cause your always telling your fleet what to do. Walking around is cool... but its at a cost of the galaxy size... the new crew feature is enjoyable... but all those skills are wasted half the time cause of almost no automation so no time to play YOUR game... its always the fleet.
      I am very saddened and disappointed by X4, and i understand why there is no demo... cause had I known i would have NEVER bought this game. Honestly, had Egosoft taken x3 ships and controls updated the graphics, etc X4 would have been MUCH MUCH better. i am done with this game for now, after 16 hours of owning it.

What gets me about it is this game is not a multiplayer game or even reliant upon unpredictable servers for their glitches, they did it all with poor QA and honestly the control scheme no matter the input device you choose is far from flawless even  the mouse and keyboard route has issues with poor menu navigation.

Random EDIT: As I hate to waste money I have still been playing this game.  It seems like it is still a mess, look I do not mind playing a beta before a game launches but they have continued to push an update back and back and now it is in beta.  Just a waste of money stick with X3 for now and use mods.

Update, as of 3.2 update I am still not a fan, I wanted to love this game so much but it is just not working out for me.  Sadly.. I have played nearly 60 hours and I just cannot get into it. But they have added some features that make the game more friendly to new players, sadly I still cannot get into it.  Oh well you win some you lose some. I shall come back at the next patch after more tutorial watching and more X3 Star Wars Mod playing!

Update: 3.30 I have finally changed my review to positive but just barely. First there are still glitches in the game that have been there since launch a few game breaking ones that make you save/load to get them to go away. Such as if you interact with something some times the interface locks up, and then you can not interact with anything else and you must save/load to fix.  Another few annoying glitches is vendors do not always spawn on stations, you get stuck trying to leave the elevator of a station, and your indicator for throttle power, shields, and armor will randomly disappear and reappear from your HUD. There are of course still graphical glitches that cause issues for a planet rendering or other objects.  I have a very fast CPU and GPU with lots of memory for both.  Some of these glitches have been in the game since launch.  

All that said at least the game finally feels like it has enough content as far as factions wars etc. This is what it should have felt like at launch in my opinion.  Also the Dev team should take a look at some of the mods for this game as they are very basic additions to the game that not only have been asked for since X3 but could be easily added.  

Of course my last complaint has to do with Steam and not the game DAMN YOU Steam for not having the Star Wars Mod on your Workshop,

Newest feature two years after release: Crash on startup. 10/10. Would uninstall again.
Srsly though. Thanks to Egosoft. Otherwise i may have wasted more time in even just trying to make game run at a decent framerate, let alone getting in to work properly.
Now I'm free and so is some disk space. Awesome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wish i could give this a recommendation. This is indeed a foundation and it seems that the base mechanics for this foundation are all already implented and seem very promising.
Unlike other early accesses and the likes ,what would make the game great is already here and compared to previous titles it is a huge step forward in what i feel like is exactly the right direction.
Simplified and easier to play where necessary but not too dumbed down with improvements just in the right area.
Basically the magic of the older X titles, but just a little more accessible and easier to handle / play.

Unfortunately all of this is in such an early state that i wouldn't even call it a beta. Many features seem to be just in their infancy while the others are buggy or don't work at all.

The game had the fascinating effect of sucking me in to the point where i could do all day sessions and be fanatically excited about it.
The flipside was that in many instances it being broken,buggy and unfinished made me more furious than anything i've played for a while.
And ultimately it left me with a mediocre experience which i believe could be a million times better had i waited for a year.


The devs may have a history of actually patching up their games which i really respect but again this is not in a state where it can actually be ""played"" properly but tested. If you're lucky you might get a somewhat long playsession without running into critical bugs but even then, unfinished ideas and mechanics can be spotted left and right.

Cannot recommend it at this point and while it may barely work in a couple months, I'd wait for maybe a year and then it may be the fantastic game that it promises to be.

april 2020 update:
Tried it again and still play it. Unfortunately i could pretty much repeat the same thing i said over a year ago. There are still plenty of issues during every single aspect of the game.
Playing it ,really is the wrong term here because just as it was at launch, I'm still somewhat of a tester rather than a player.
And the fact that they're adding more content while one of the core problems seems to be that game is far too much in terms of scale for them to handle is just baffling.
Beyond the early game, the one core aspect of the game is to manage a fleet / your ""empire"". And that very thing relies on an AI that is so stunningly horrendous that it's almost funny.

In short, the game provides what No mans sky initially promised and the atmosphere it can create at times is really great. Or it would be, if it wasn't this broken. 
So if you like finding workarounds constantly for a variety of things, can handle the poor performance even on higher end machines but really need a sort of first-person management sim in space, then by all means go for it.
But i still cannot recommend it, given the yes/no option. Lots of that playtime was spent with stuff that is neither enjoyable or something i could recommend",1545434564,1602603938,False,3,1,0,0,True,False,False
392160,77503002,76561198198916587,0,7,5711,0,5711,1597479129,"TL:DR   If you have never played an X game before this is a decent starting point.  If you have you very well might feel burned by the lack of content if you aren't willing to pay more than AAA prices.

I REALLY wanted to love this game.  I purchased X3 shortly after release having just started getting into space strategy 
games at the time and it blew my mind.  Especially that it ran (and so well) on my old clunker rig.  While it ran without hangups it wasn't until many hours later that I figured out the economy was fairly broken, the ship balance was bad, the AI was lacking in certain functionality that the game seemed designed for it to have, and the universe, for all it's bots, was pretty devoid of a sense of life.  However later on modders in the community fixed most of those problems.  Egosoft did not.  What Egosoft did do was bundle those mods in with a fairly modest amount of newly created assets and resold the game as X3 Albion Prelude.  Being young and naive I purchased that too and was overjoyed.  I put many hundreds of hours into X3:AP and have never regretted that purchase.  But now I'm older and we come to X4 (I won't mention Rebirth).  I purchased pretty close to launch again and put less than 100 hours into it.  That includes the time it takes to learn their convoluted and unintuitive systems, completing all story missions, building an empire of factories/traders/miners and raising relationships with all factions to be able to build any ship I want essentially for free.  I can confidently say I've experienced all content in the base game not including paid expansions.  And I have absolutely no desire to ever play again.

I won't go into depth of all the issues because this review is more for those who have played X3 and it would take too much of my time when there are plenty of other sources for that kind of stuff.  But if you've played X3 you might think like me that you understand what you are getting into and the problems are acceptable.  Personally I didn't find that to be the case.  On top of all the old problems I had to content with entire races, LARGE chunks of what absolutely should be considered the base game, being sold back to me something like a year later.  If the game was...well just more, this wouldn't be a problem.  For instance Final Fantasy 7 is doing something similar by only having Midgar in the first game.  But it still serves a comparable amount of content as the original FF7, that isn't so with X4.  If you are familiar with the systems you will quickly run out of things to do as it is nearly the same exact systems with a shiny paint job and much less content.  A fair number of features are missing functionality or even broken. The worst offender for me is something you will probably be spending a very large chunk of your time staring at, the map.  Once you have a fair number of ships and stations it becomes very laggy and while it very rarely truly breaks it is a chore to use.  Meanwhile instead of fixing these problems they try to make me purchase the content that is lacking in the full price game I already purchased.  I'm not talking about just the races, like I said I don't mind them being DLC but you need to have sold me a full game first.  That should have been the priority.  Not rushing out something half finished and asking me to pay more if I want more than half a game.  Clearly I feel burned by this purchase, but that doesn't mean I think it's a bad game either.  

If you have never played an X series game before I would absolutely recommend this to you.  The X series is still fantastic and fairly unique.  It's just if you have played the series before and were expecting the next step in the series this isn't it.  Nor are you even getting the same amount of content you would expect from previous experience.",1602603876,1602603876,False,3,2,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, even these are unfinished. The short version of my review is this: The game is fun, and tries to be a massive space simulator. X4 has a lot of potential, but there seems to be a lot missing.

[h1]Some specific gripes:[/h1]
[b]Loads of unexplained mechanics[/b] will leave you googling help from the forums or YouTube often.

[b]Some mechanics seem unfinished,[/b] like how you can make decisions on how to crew your ship and who with, but there doesn't seem to be a discernable effect when you do.

You can tell Egosoft laid the groundwork for certain mechanics, [b]but never polished them[/b] (what's the difference between heat seeking, smart, and guided missiles? we have the option to arm them all, and they even cost different prices and have their own logos, but i've fired them all and they act identically)

[b]The AI is frustratingly bad.[/b] You are given access to a huge amount of commands you can give your pilots, with almost no explanation on how to use them or what the differences are between similar ones. My favorite part of the game has been ordering my fleet around while standing over the shoulder of my flagship's captain. However, for every moment of space-armada-glory there are ten moments of sheer frustration as my AI fighters leave formation and drop out of travel mode for no reason, disassembling the formation. Or, AI that decides it will make a 300km journey without travel mode (taking half an hour), only to continue coasting by the jump gates and highways they should be using. The AI coding has been a major source of disappointment because it prevents you from doing a lot of things you would think this game would be good at. The AI is not controllable enough for a fleet battle, not smart enough to navigate the 3-D space around stations and travel points, and not well documented in the menus or help topics so troubleshooting is a group effort between you and google.

[b]The user interface is bulky[/b] to the point you appreciate how much data Egosoft is tracking, but it is a hassle to make quick administrative decisions and many of the menus and displays have loads of info you don't ever use.

For reading this far, I will reward you by saying the game was still worth it to me.

It was hard to get into. It was hard to work out how to do things. I had to constantly look at youtube videos and guides. I couldn't get strafe to work on my X52 Saitek Pro, even though the game has a profile for it. 

One example of the difficulties I had is that I saw a youtube video about automining but it didn't explain your pilot has to be 3 stars to do this and then I couldn't understand why it didn't work. 

I had a trader ship and another ship protecting it but the trader got destroyed. The process of setting up another ship to protect the trader ship was also difficult and I was never sure if I had it right or not. 

I had a mining ship mine Nvidium but I couldn't get it to do it again, despite giving the same instructions and the resource probe showing that it still existed in that sector. 

Everything just seems really difficult.

I also played a few missions for credits and shot down some enemies. I played the game for 70 hours overall but had to keep re-starting tutorials to re-learn due taking breaks from the game due to work commitments. 

I eventually worked out what the game is about. You set up auto miners by getting pilots up to level 3 by manually mining. After you've set up a certain number of them you then leave the computer running while you go to work sot that you can amass money. This seems like a waste of electricity to me, but that is how you play the game.

There are missions to play but a lot of them repeat themselves: destroy mines, repair satellites, escort a person to another planet etc.

Eventually you have enough credits to build your own stations and ships. I never got that far but I got an idea about what this is like by doing the tutorial.

The end game is when you have massive space battles.

I'm glad I had the experience of playing this game and finding what it was all about. I got some enjoyment out of it. On the positive side, I also got to use my Saitek X52 Pro to justify buying it all those years ago, since I never used it for anything else.

I've now got sidetracked by Kingdom Come Deliverance, which seems like a more enjoyable game experience.

Nearly two years since its release, X4 has become an immersive, joyous, and equally miserable experience that invites you to a galaxy of nearly limitless, open-ended space-ing, encouraging you to to explore, trade with various factions, fight your enemies, and think about your next move in a ""just one more turn/command!""-style of addicting gameplay -- provided you can get past its hideous UI, glaring bugs, and at-times downright broken AI and pathfinding.  Long-time fans of the series may be put off by the game's lack of charm and smaller scale compared to its predecessors, as well as the same ol' Egosoft flaws that will never be addressed, but may find its (mostly) streamlined gameplay, visual and immersive enhancements, and improved tools and features for trading and empire management welcoming amidst a familiar, nostalgic backdrop that they know and love.

That being said, I still can't recommend it yet, especially to new players interested in the series.  Here's why, in no particular order:

Performance:
Your PC will choke, especially during large battles and hanging around in busy stations.  It's less to do with your graphics card and more to do with the game's poor use of your CPU combined with Egosoft's antiquated programming chops -- they are a small company from the 90s after all, and old habits die hard.  It's playable and mostly enjoyable, but do not expect 4K/60fps performance in all situations.  A beefy CPU and GPU setup is recommended -- the latter mostly if you want to max out the game's visuals due to its very poor, questionable implementation of screen space reflections and fog.  They will bring your fps down considerably, so I recommend setting these low or off.

Core gameplay:
For the most part, it works, and at times it even works brilliantly and beautifully.  Players will enjoy X4's numerous features to help manage their fleets and stations such as RTS-style queuing of commands, and prospective trading (where information like amount of wares and money coming in/out are determined in advance based on all your planned trades in queue).  They're not as in-depth as X3TC/AP's tools, but nice little bits to help streamline things so you can do less micromanaging on the map and more actual space-ing.

In practice, it doesn't work so well thanks to the atrocious leveling system of your crew, with 3-star pilots -- which are needed to actually automate trading without manual input -- taking an impossibly long time to obtain without grinding RNG missions for 2-star pilot seminars or cheap tricks such as rotating, by hand, pilots in and out of actual combat situations which helps expedite the leveling process.  You shouldn't have to do this; if a trader completes trades, that trader should level up, and in theory they do, according to Egosoft, where each action completed has a small chance of leveling up your pilot.  The truth is the chances are so low it almost never happens.  I'm 300 hours into my save with a multi-billion credit empire, and I can count on one hand the number of three-star pilots I have in my fleet who can do automated trading.  This becomes less of a problem later in the game as you build and set up stations and assign traders to them who can trade on their own for the station regardless of pilot level.  Gone are the days of X3-style merchant fleets that span across the universe, unless you're willing to individually micromanage every single one of them on the off chance they make it to 3 stars.  Stations are where it's at now.

Design:
...which brings me to the next point: the grand design of the game.  The X's have always been about doing what you want: from the humble merchant looking to become a mogul, the curious and intrepid explorer discovering ancient secrets, to the fighter squadron wing leader and the supreme commander of a galactic fleet and beyond, you can do it all.  While you still can do these things in X4, they are all done against the backdrop of the Xenon threat, which if left unchecked will annihilate and take over the entire game universe.  Eventually, you will have to create a sprawling economic empire, and you will have to muster your own fleet to deal with this threat.  You can't be an individual privateer for example, floating from job to job forever, even if that is what you want.  This core element of the game has been polarizing, with some players welcoming the addition of a concrete, well-defined end-game objective that must be dealt with, applying subtle pressure to your every move throughout your playthrough.  Right now, this basically translates to ""get stations and a shipyard up and running so you can print ships and money and then take on the Xenon.""  Trade fleets, bounty hunting, mercenary work, etc. pay nowhere near as close as just spitting out ships and stations for yourself and your partners, and I'm hoping Egosoft will take a second look at alternative, competitive ways to earn your living and riches.

Also, the AI: aside from the fact that even two years later the AI can't still reliably navigate its way to any dock that has two entrances (looking at you, wharfs), you'll also be scratching your head wondering why your AI ships, both in-sector and out-of-sector, are flying through or completely past jumpgates, or why your fighters are hovering over your ship's landing pads descending at 0.2 ms/s after ordering them to dock like two years ago, or straight up ram into and phase through your ship's hull instead.  The list goes on, and plenty of other reviews here will detail them, but yes, the AI is still horrendous.  That same terrible AI is also the reason why the factions cannot be left alone to fend against the Xenon, leading to a rather player-centric and arcade-y experience despite claims of the ""most sophisticated universe ever.""

Combat:
It mostly works, especially at the fighter level.  Dogfights are fast, engaging, and fun, and a skilled pilot can punch above his/her weight class (more so than X3) thanks to ship modifications and a streamlined ship classification system that's less strict and pronounced as X3.  It's also often more fun than sitting on the bridge of your capital ship wondering why your anti-capital turrets aren't shooting right despite being clearly in-range and having clear line-of-sight of your target, and let's not even talk about how anti-fighter turrets suck at tracking across the board and frequently miss, but hey, when it works, it's a sight to behold -- the gratuitous space battles of your childhood sci-fi dreams, right from the windows of your ship's bridge.

Unfortunately, managing your fleets in battle is another story, and this just goes back to the atrocious AI.  Oftentimes you'll want to pull your hair out with, say, your fleet's flee mechanics, wondering just why your AI ship's flee command (which overrides all other commands you give it when triggered, by the way) is sending them flying directly toward the threat they're trying to flee from half the time.  You'll also wonder why your fighters in your carrier aren't taking off when you're telling them to, or why they have a tendency to want to dock first before being scrambled out again to attack their next target.  When it works, it works beautifully, but really the overall experience is just an exercise in patience.  You'll get it to work, eventually, but in a life-or-death situation such as an evenly-matched skirmish, it gets tiring real fast.

Like I said, I've about 300 hours into the game now since buying it last month.  There have even been times I denied my SO intimacy (not proud of this) just so I can play this game.  It's been an effort of trying to love the game, and for the most part, I do, and can't wait for the next big updates and content drops to make it better.

What can I say about Egosoft. Well they are completely passionate about their franchise and the support for their games, is nothing short of unbelievable!!!!!! They listen to the community and their feedback. They do not get the credit they deserve for their hard work and commitment .

Egosoft deserve your money, this isn't just your average game, and they should be supported to continue development of X4 Foundations and Beyond!!!

There is a learning curve for new players, but it is much easier nowadays with online guides and YouTube videos. If you put the effort in to learn how to play these games, then you will finally understand the enjoyment and satisfaction of the X Series games!!!

Ships refusing to trade, ships getting stuck in the mesh, getting stuck in the mesh of your own ship, not being able to control your own large mining ship, and the list goes on.

The game is beautiful, but it's a trick. Every sector has a static ""background"", like a wallpaper in a room. You could enter a sector and see a huge planet lit up by fire. But you can't ever fly close enough to see it move. You can't land on it. It's just there for decoration and means nothing. 

You can control entire fleets of ships. But it's a god damn pain in the ass. They don't often do what you want them to do, and they make everything difficult. For example, you can tell ship A to guard ship B, but if ship A itself gets attacked, guess what? It doesn't know what the fuck to do. ""Ship B isn't  getting attacked, so I'm just going to sit here and get blown up"". 

Even ships you want to fly yourself can't be simple. For instance, I wanted to play through earning my way up as a miner in my own ship, so I went from small mining ship to medium mining ship and everything is fine. But I finally get enough to buy a large mining ship, and guess what? I can't collect ore by myself. I need drones to do it, but the drones' behavior code is  dependent upon the code of the A.I PILOT. That means no a.i pilot, no mining. Sorry. ""Oh sorry, we just assumed everyone would want to play this as an RTS game."" - Egosoft, probably.

And for the love of god, the menus. This is the worst offender. Considering you'll be spending most of your time in the map, since that's where most of the functions lie, this is an atrocity. The text and layout is so tiny and the menus are so confusing and misleading that you'd think that they designed it this way to make it seem more complex than it is. Kenshi has as many functions but works perfectly fine with understandable menus that are easy to read and navigate.

I love this game. 674 hours at the time of writing this is testament to that. The start can leave you feeling somewhat overwhelmed with how to do certain things. The flight school and youtube videos on how to do certain things were a big help for me at the start.
Starting off with nothing and building into a massive empire of stations through to complex shipyards and their fleets of mining ships and traders. Through to Carrier battle fleets with different load-out of fighters, escorts with battleship like destroyers, much smaller frigates, nimble corvettes and cruisers and a bucket load of fighters is satisfying to say the least.
sometimes I have found the story-lines difficult to follow.
The freedom to do almost anything is impressive. The map and the interface with managing your eventual multiple ships, what they do, where they go, how they behave - can be automated, or can be up to you to tell a particular ship how to behave. This can be a lot to take in and the tutorials mixed, with youtube explanations is probably the best way to get a grasp of it all.
There ARE still bugs unfortunately. Which can be rather frustrating and wondering why your traders are behaving a certain way, when you've set things up differently. But it's a relatively small amount and the forums are a big help for how to address most of them.
The economy can also play a big factor in things. What you can buy from where is based on your reputation with certain races and factions. How you can make the best profit for your trading ventures or how do you protect your budding corporate empire, is a lot of fun and can be complex, rewarding and very time consuming if you choose it to be.

1: diplomacy- diplomacy is restricted to the player's standing with AI factions. the AI factions have limited to no options on home they interact. If you wanted one faction to go to war or ally with another.... there is no way to do that. It makes an otherwise dynamic world incredibly static, and reduces the replay value (if you even get a full playthrough in). 
2: economics- the x4 economy is driven by and destroyed by war. Peace will kill the galactic economy because there are no civilian goods or civilian economy. War will kill the economy because it divides trade routes and destroys product, bringing the economic engine to a grinding halt eventually (after a short term boom). This is in need of serious balancing because the economic framework is central to the entire game. 

I am not hopeful of these problems being fixed since the devs have released multiple dlcs that dont address them, and adding additional content without fixing the broken base game is a death knell for whatever x4 could have been.

There are many things going on here, flying ships, a story arc, empire building and a living universe, that is a recipe for awesome and no mistake, but here the rub: None of that is at all fun.

Flying ships is an awkward and painful experience, things like docking have deliberately been designed to be a terrible experience so that you get a feeling of power progression when you dont have to do that anymore because you have teleporters. Wow teleporters you say?
That sounds cool, will i be using them to do cool teleporter stuff like beaming onto the bridge of other ships with a strike team and killing everyone in the face with high tech mind control lasers? Nope, its literally just a way to avoid docking which you will have to do a million times because thats pretty much all you do, fly around in completely unsatisfying generic ships in an endless series of hamster wheels as you grind, omg the grind is insane, its so extreme and there is nothing fun about it. I actually left my machine running so that i could build up space bucks from my automated team of pilots who btw never gain experience even though key interface controls are locked behind an exp wall so you are basically going to have to mod the game if you want to access those features, so good luck with that. So machine running, farming space bucks.. for days but you know what happened? One faction got really strong and basically killed all the bad guys so although i did have more stuff now what i had was still just pathetic on a galaxy wide scale, I had no impact at all, it seems the designers had thought of this too and made sure that you cant do that, you are in a race from the start to get mega bucks before the game completes itself.

Empire building is a deeply unpleasant process of grinding out tech by doing boring drone work and harvesting literally enough coin to wipe out the entire universe with fighters if you just spent the money on fighters instead of building an empire to build fighters, its really stupid and all born out of this disgusting mentality of trying to drag out the game with grind instead of including content.

The living universe as i have mentioned is stupid too, the game basically consumes any and all of your computer resources and devotes them to playing by itself, building armies you dont have access to because you havent done enough boring arbitrary nonsense yet and actively hinders your ability to make progress in the game by building so many things that the game is no longer playable for the human...

So what else is awful?

Well as you might expect there are logs about everything, none of which was ever at all helpful to me and any time i did think 'what was that thing i wanted to know?' that was never there, the are reams of meaningless information you couldnt care less about and nothing of any interest or importance.

There isnt even much going on here, youd think there would be with all that living universe stuff but there really isnt, its very shallow.

There is just nothing fun about this game at all, every single aspect of this game has been implemented in the worst possible manner, often deliberately. Its really painful to me to see paid professional people screw up this badly, if they were firemen they would be the sort of firemen who set people on fire, i wouldnt trust this developer to do the equivalent of getting a stuck cat out of a tree, this stuff is far too much for them.

Honestly it beggars belief how bad this is. This game would have been so much better if it had been designed by 10 year olds who had drunk too much pop at least there would have been something exiciting going on even if if it was nuts.  This game was designed by a commitee of sadistic mid level accountants who some how managed to take a wonderful premise and wash all colour and fun out of it.",1600134820,1600134820,False,6,1,0.502023220062255859,1,True,False,False

Sure it might make some money but your not going to win over a vast number of new players by being a first class game.   Don't get me wrong it needs more content and GOOD WELL VOICED dialogue being that it is not a truly online game, people want that interaction.

-You run into constant menu lockups, some times not able to click, cursor stays highlighted ect- the only work around is saving and reloading the game.  
-Pilots do decent at landing but drive through the hull of stations to exit often.
-When flying with a pilot through asteroid areas they just come to a complete stop and are clueless.  Can take 20 minutes to go through where it should take 20-30 seconds.
-There is not enough control when you have a pilot running and you want to fly for a moment.  You have to stop the ship, get in their place and then you can fly.  For any ship with more than one seat it would seem reasonable to have the player be able to co-pilot or vise versa and take control of the ship at the click of a button / hot key.  Then at least the player can make the corrections where the NPC wastes time or makes mistakes.  Also in that mode you should be able to click objects, select them in space, same screen as when your a pilot just without your control input, unless you want to.  Be able to tell them to do something else (break between command) and not have them go crazy. Be able to fluidly switch back to managing / info in the same screen without having to set away from the controls (have it just be an overlay).

X4 in contrast allows you the choice to build a trade empire, a pirate clan, explore, or whatever - and you have to build/craft a lot of infrastructure to do so...or don't.  The game isn't perfect, but no game is.

++Pros++
  +  Large play area with the DLC, but obviously not as large as ED
  +  Ability to build your own space stations & modify ships
  +  Lots of options on how you want to play
  +  Better mission variety than ED
  +  Can have multiple fleets that you set the behavior for
  +  Flying is more fun/dynamic than in ED & easier due to less realistic physics
  +  The economy, while not perfect, can be influenced directly by the player

--Cons--
  - Exploring is not as rewarding as in ED - sectors are sort of smallish and have invisible boundaries that you eventually 'bounce' off of
  - There are several bugs that have been around since launch that remain unfixed and numerous other ones that while not game-breaking, are frustrating
  - The occasional CTD that takes you to a bug reporting page that shows it hasn't been updated since launch
  -  Character models suck and are shamelessly reused over and over - would like to customize ship's crews at least
  -  The game can be slow/tedious in some cases
  -  Overall while not difficult to play, the multitude of systems means a steep learning curve
  -  The tutorials stop just short of actually teaching you how to do things properly
  -  Likewise important mission info is woefully absent - you have to go online to figure out how to do some
  -  Walking around is overrated since it isn't used to good effect
  -  The in-game encyclopedia is very terse & similarly the official online wiki feels incomplete too

So, owning this plus ED and several other space sims and having played many legacy ones, I can say this one isn't bad.  I haven't encountered many of the issues others mention in there reviews or in the forums and have to believe a lot of that is simply due to people not understanding how to setup things - behavior rules for ship captains, trading restrictions, etc.  Be prepared to lookup a lot of things outside of the game, but once you learn something it makes the effort worth it.

Egosoft still needs to improve on things, especially bugs that were reported in 2018 that they said they would fix, but so far haven't.  They also need to improve the tutorials, mission descriptions, and other things, but if you can look beyond all that the base game is still pretty fun provided you like this type of space sim.

The AI could need more improvements e.g. in the aspects of pathfinding and I'm sometimes thankful for the teleporter.

Still not sure what Egosoft was smoking during that development. But, they learned from the mistakes from that abomination and went back to the drawing board. They took what we loved from X3 and took some good ideas from Rebirth that did work and made X4. 

X4, Like all Egosoft games has a very large learning curve. The tutorial can be quite confusing to new players and finding out how to do things in game isn’t explained that well in the game itself. Many have found answers via Reddit or other social media outlets to learn how to do this or that. This is nothing new with Egosoft games. Things are not explained well. This often frustrates new players, and even returning players from a previous X game that is disappointed to find out they have to learn new things for the new game. 

I bought X4 when it was released. I didn’t actually start playing it until well over a year after it launched. Because I know how it works with X series games when released. It always starts out awful and then over time it grows into the game that was promised. I know this sounds familiar as many AAA game developers have been doing this very thing in recent years, with Egosoft tho, it happens with every launch. While frustrating, I have grown to expect this. Speaking of AAA game developers, Egosoft is not one. They have a development team of like 20 people. So this does not have a AAA development or money, but they sure do try and aim at AAA visions. Because of this, everything above happens. A buggy mess of a release, with lots of angry users. They then use the money at launch to more or less finish the game and make it more playable. This is just my take on it. 

Many people have grown angry at this strategy that developers use as Egosoft is not the only one that does this. It has been far more common in recent years. I wish in the future Egosoft would consider an early access approach so they can get the needed funding while developing the game and getting much needed end user feeback during development. If done right, it can lead to awesome feedback and an even more polished game at launch. (think prison architect) 

The game itself in the state it is, once you learn the large curve and figure out how to do this or that is simply a fantastic game. You can do everything from being just a pilot for a major faction fighting in a war, to a humble trader, to an owner of a large mega corp that you built from the ground up, and even owning your own systems. Don’t like the split? Well get a good fleet and war it out with them and use the resources from your factories to support your war effort. Keep an eye on your losses tho, as in this game ships are expensive and every loss stings. 

In my current game, I am watching the Xenon, a machine race, grow closer and closer to where my factories are based. I’m having to build fleets to counter them and that cuts into my profits. Heck it even has adjusted my end goal of being a supplier to the Argon war machine to being my own supplier to ensure my own survival. I’ve already had many epic battles preventing Xenon from entering my system with many losses that have had to be replaced. Right now, the Xenon are able to rebuild a lot more faster that I am with my four factory complexes can handle. 

That is just my experience. Everyone's different. X4 plays out differently every time you play it. Sometimes the Xenon will get taken to school by the many other AI empires well before they even become a threat. The game is by no means linear and very open world with many possibilities for how your space journey will play out. 

In summary: X4 is well worth the time to get to know. It can be frustrating to learn, but once you start to get the games quarks and bugs under your belt, the more you will realize how fun and immersive this game can be. You just need to give it time to grow on you and look past the learning curve, as it is extremely large. It can be a bit rough around the edges, but it really is a fantastic game.",1599861092,1599861092,True,16,0,0.616687595844268799,0,True,False,False

what is this game?... 
space fighting sim? economy sim? empire sim? sort of all of the above. 

this game is not bug or quirk free. Its way too complex... 
Don't expect subordinates to know what you want, you have to tell them what you want.
some things seems more complex than needed... 
this is no different from real life which is full of constraints and lack of common sense. 

suck at fighting? become a business mogul and have your lackeys do the fighting
hate authority? live the life of a pirate, hiding from the authorities, looking for opportunity to steal and hijack stuff
want to be a hero? join the authority and take down enemy factions, and alien Xenons

front line marshal like Napoleon? grab a battleship and sit in the backlines while watching your subordinates fight it out
backroom strategist? stay safe in your HQ station far from the lines and give instructions. 

economy manipulation? starve factions you dislike by buying up ship building critical resources and selling them to your friendly factions. or just buy up the critical component from everyone and horde it to sell at top prices. 

play the story-missions if you like it or want to unlock some stuff... or ignore it altogether. 

in this game... the choice is yours. 
do note that the game world changes dynamically... it will change with or without your inputs. 
there is no winning criteria, no losing criteria (besides death)... 
play it how you want it, just remember you are not god. you are just a person/ship in the gameworld. 

Game starts have some random aspects of it, so some games might be the same, while others are different.
If you are not a hero and the Xenon rampages through the world, play it out WalkingDead style.

i played quite a bit of x3:tc and albion prelude, but skipped rebirth as it really didn't come up on my radar due to IRL things; after having gone back and looked at the complaints regarding rebirth i could understand the players reviews given my limited understanding of the changes that happened between those games. 

while x4 has significantly improved upon the good parts of x3, and while simultaneously understanding that egosoft is a team of perhaps 20 people in and around the EU, the fact this game is feature complete and playable is an achievement in and of itself - yet i believe there is a lot of room for improvement yet to be had here.

a lot of work has gone into the map. there are some serious issues with the map, however, that would greatly benefit from an overhaul. example: trade filters. these giant squares pop up all over the map and overlay ships and stations when visible, and are unwieldy and get in the way most of the time - these should be pinned to like the lower right. beyond that, selecting a filtered item with your left mouse click actually disables the filter as opposed to, say, highlighting the station which buys/sells that particular item. these are obnoxious issues to deal with at minimum.

there's no quick way for me to say drop a laser tower or advanced satellite while piloting the ship, which is a pretty clear oversight. it's clunky to have to pull up the map, select your ship, right click on it, scroll down to deploy, select the drop and then click it. this is way too many steps for such a simple procedure and would also greatly benefit from an overhaul.

despite my limited time with this title so far, i've encountered quite a few bugs which have made me alt+f4 out of the game. flying in to dock and getting stuck inside stations, or getting stuck inside enemy ships, or asteroids, is really really frustrating - especially if you haven't saved in a while.

speaking of saves - the optimization issues are real and i really wish egosoft would buy a ryzen + amd gpu system to play their own game on. the issues are pretty apparent for us ryzen system users. the autosave function often locks up my system until the process is complete for a period of time that is a bit too long, to say the least. 

there are some pathing issues which pop up when you are in sector as opposed to out of sector. small ships path to way outside the docking area instead of nearer to it.

even the basic control scheme and configuration options leave a lot to be desired - turning/pitching with the arrow keys is incredibly responsive, yet my 10000dpi logitech g52 proteus spectrum mouse can feel really slow just trying to yaw or pitch. why i can i not remap certain buttons? there should be no restriction on the ability to place keybindings, imho.

now, with all that being said, and i could go on more, i still think this game is a drastic step up from where x3 was, which was the last title in the series i played. the station building system is pretty freaking great compared to where it was in x3 - and yet it also could use some improvements (where is x, y and z within the boundaries, so i don't set my station up sideways compared to how i want it placed? why can't i rotate pieces vertically, and only horizontally? i'd like to disable snap, if i could, etc)

i've only been doing playthroughs as the split, but the split ships are just as good as i remember them being in x3, and their customizations are nice as well.

i want to be able to play the vanilla game without mods, as much as i possibly can, but in it's current iteration i feel like people are kind of compelled to use mods simply to clean up some various nagging issues which could very well be options provided within the base game rather than needing them in the first place.

there is a lot to like here, and with some effort and time i believe this can be a really polished and enjoyable game, even for those unfamiliar with the series. i'm hopeful that egosoft will continue to put work into this game, and am looking forward to future expansions. 

it's a niche empire builder in space where you can do whatever you want, mostly. the developers appear to actually care about the product, and delivering something that fans want. that can't be said about several others in this space, who i'll not mention at this time.

tldr recommend for now, but with some caveats. at the time of writing i'll give this game 7/10 stars. good space game with a lot to do, but has some obnoxious bugs and could use some optimization and UI overhauls and/or improvments.",1599774741,1599774741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In this game, you can pretty much set up your own faction. Build your own station and have your own fleets etc. except... THEY DON'T EVEN WORK! With fleets, if you assign ships to defend you, they don't do anything. Set them to attack what you're fighting, they still won't do anything. If you set them to defend a station, they do it for like 5 minutes then get stuck on absolutely nothing and won't move. Building your own station in this game is an absolute chore as well. The game won't recognize you highlighting buildings so you cant move and change where they go. Once you're done dealing with that cancer, you have to assign a builder but every single time that I have done this, the builder will start to build my station, and at some point they will just stop for NO REASON.

At time of purchase it's post 3.0 patch and is a marked improvement on X3, what little I've played so far of either.  I started the Argon campaign and am building a fleet of mining/trading vessels to make me money in between doing missions in my Discoverer Vanguard, a scout ship that works well enough as a light fighter with it's high speed and maneuverability, although it is somewhat lacking in the weapons department.  I want to move on to larger combat vessels and even own a frigate, a Cerberus Vanguard, but it is relegated to defense of my new ore processing plant/station now.

All in all, I intend to play this save file until I can support the Argon Federation and it's allies single-handedly be it through trade or warfleets, and look forward to playing the other starts eventually as well.

Flaws:
1. Automated exploration is very inefficient.  It's faster for you to use a scout personally or just queue a few ""fly-to"" orders in a spiral around the sector to get the default sector map revealed as quickly as possible.  The default explore command  has them flying in a semi-random pattern from a starting point, only pushing the map fog back with a portion of their total radar range, and they often sit there for no reason that I can discern.
2. Learning the UI is still a hurdle.  There are videos that go over how to play  and what buttons do or certain information is, but, ultimately, you're still having to learn a not very accessible system on your own building your own understanding of it.  Keep reading up on the stuff you want to do, spoilers and all, if you want to learn everything you can do through/with/from the interface.
3.  Tutorial scenarios are still somewhat unclear.  The combat tutorial is straightforward yes, but it also gives you a ship from a faction that is known for it's speed and maneuverability, and you're fighting one that decidedly isn't, so it can set up some unrealistic expectations.  The flight school just stopped after a certain point, and if you listen to it implies more to come but I didn't find a way to progress further than, ""here's a few different ships to dick around with, have fun!""  Finally, advanced management doesn't actually teach how to build a station, just the bare minimum of interaction with the interface, doesn't teach how to manage a station in full, and just leaves you hanging in sandbox of 3 or 4 sectors.

Since the learning curve is essentially vertical and the U.I. is about as intuitive as solving a rubix cube blindfolded, I was never sure if the game was bugging out or functioning as intended, well sometimes i was sure--I can't imagine crashing to the desktop is ever an intended feature.  The number of times i had to comb through forum posts to  figure out that what i was doing wasn't supposed to work was infuriating. For instance collecting, inventory items such as crystals is a profitable activity. your employee ships can  also pick up dropped cargo, so you can tell them to pick up crystals too. They won't do it however because its a different kind of cargo. That's fine, but it never tells you that you can't do that it just doesn't do anything and a couple hours later you realize that those spacefly eggs haven't been harvested.  Although i still half expect someone to tell me it is working now, that it was patched and i just need to click on some tab that the game does nothing to tell me about. 

I would also like to point out that I'm not just someone who doesn't like these kinds of games, exactly the opposite; 4x, simulation, automation, managerial, and roleplaying are all my jam.  I've put hundreds of hours each into games like factorio, dwarf fortress, sim city/cities skylines, total war, stelaris, endless sky etc. I'm not sure if its fair to say that this game is clunkyier and more confusing than dwarf fortress, but dwarf fortress has an incredible community with a great wiki and guides to help you learn the ropes and so it was way easier to get into, and even when i didn't have everything figured out there were tons of things that i could do that worked well.  

Which actually brings me to my summary which is that anyone who thought dwarf fortress was too easy and would be more fun if you had to spend more time having no idea whats going on you'll love this game.  If you thought DF could've used  some polish steer clear of this game. If you don't know what DF is you probably won't like this game either, if for no other reason than if you can't figure that out you won't be able to figure anything in this game out.

Sounds like you can hire an NPC that will do it for you in a rather drawn out process, but you still have to sit there and wait for them to do it. No thanks...that is going to get old after a very short while. I mean I could put up with it if there was an upgrade to save up for that would just poof you into the station like in X3, but to do this EVERY time forever? Why? Is this what players want now days? This is not an auto-win button like some games practically have...this a mundane, never changing, boring thing that will do nothing but add worthless game time. Imagine if a fantasy RPG game had some sort of minigame that made you line up your sword to your scabbard each time you put away your sword...that's what this is like. The forward WEAPONS auto-lock on to targets for crying out loud (not turrets). That is actual real game play just taken away (might be a way to disable it...so mad about docking I didn't get far enough to really worry about it). So no thinking aiming, but when it comes to just landing the stupid ship you got to break out the white board and a calculus book? If everything was like this...I would understand, but they automate the fun parts and not the boring parts?

This whole docking thing is such a pathetically stupid add on that ruined what is probably a good game. If you play an hour, you are probably spending at least 15 minutes of that just docking. If you are going to keep this game, the first thing you need to do is buy the Mk2 Docking computer. Then you can basically crash into your assigned landing pad and land just fine. Though you still have to request docking permision and then fly into the hanger which seems to always be on the opposite side of the station as you approach...and on the easiest start it costs 25% of your starting money. I am going to look for a mod and if there is an auto dock...I might not refund this game. Though this really makes me worry about other things in the game that I won't see far a long time. Do I have to space walk with a hammer to pound nails for an hour to build my stations too? I don't see how this can be from the same company that made X3. 

Currently no mod for it seems, but people are working on it. Sounds like a lot of people are not a fan of it, but even Ecosoft gave up on trying to make such a thing. It is proving difficult to implement. So disappointed...though the theme is really holding. There are a lot of mundane activities in the game that you have to do over and over for no reason.

Though there were a significant number of negative reviews that complained of glitchiness, I figured either I'd get lucky and have an experience more akin to that of folks who were leaving positive reviews or perhaps these were left by players who didn't have the patience to fully appreciate the massive scope of the game (and all that may come with that).  I want it to be clear that I was hungry for a new space exploration sandbox-style game, and I really wanted X4 to be the one.  Unfortunately, at this stage in the game's life, nearly two year's after the game's release, I found to be unplayable.

In the thirty-six hours since I made my purchase, I have tried a handful of times to begin the tutorials to learn how the game works.  Each time and in two separate tutorials, I have found my progress halted by different tutorial windows that refuse to go away despite my having followed their instructions explicitly.  In one instance, the tutorial window presented itself over top of the menu with which it was directing me to interact, obscuring it from the reach of my cursor.  Finally, I thought I would just jump in and try to wing it in regular game mode (seemingly not advised due to the complex nature of the game based on other reviews I have read).  Within moments I had crashed into a space station and glitched within the object, unable to escape.  I had to restart the game.

I even tried to drop the graphics settings down to see if that would cut down on the technical issues I was experiencing.  I'm not a hardcore gamer; I'm comfortable sacrificing video performance for a game that scratches my sandbox-play space exploration itch.  It was no use.

Maybe I could have stuck with it awhile longer and eventually learned how this game works and avoided actions that would have presented the glitches that have plagued me, but at the price point I couldn't justify jeopardizing a refund on the game by wasting more hours.

I am writing this review after requesting my second ever request for a refund, the first of which was for No Man's Sky before it was upgraded into the masterpiece I'm now so in love with.  Maybe the same will happen for X4 down the line.  But at 50 dollars (I picked it up for 33 on a sale), I can't say the risk is worth it that this game will actually be playable for you.  It's painful to leave such a negative review for a product that I had such high hopes for, but if it will help others avoid the frustration and loss of money than it's worth it.

Gameplay is awful - the tutorials explain practically nothing about the game, the introductory missions (usually where devs put in the most effort because it's the first thing a player sees) is an absolute pile (""Use your long range scanner"". OK, sure, maybe *tell the player* that they need to attempt to fire missiles to actually, you know, scan, because an Euler diagram of ""Look for an anomaly"" and ""Macross missiles for everybody"" doesn't have as much overlap as the devs seem to think), you then can't visibly mark the location of the missions in-game so you have to either use the autopilot (which will dutifully find an asteroid to run into at full clip) or move -> check map to see if you're closer or further from marker -> adjust and move, repeat. After you spend an excruciating *45 minutes* marco-polo'ing to the objective, you then discover that the scanner only works if you're looking directly at the semitransparent anomaly that you need the scanner to help you find. Which means that you don't really need the scanner at all - by the time you *can* scan the thing, you've already had to exchange insurance details with it.

To top it all off, the ships lack any feeling of inertia and 'flying' feels like a less engaging FPS water level with whiffy physics.

Dont get it, simply as that, get the standard version, if you can manage all the bugs and lag good for you.

I just wish egosoft would go with an early access route the next time or release a more finished product from the beginning.

--- original review ---

[BUYERS BEWARE: This is NOT a finished game! 

After around 20 hrs and really giving it a chance there are so many things where you can clearly see that they didnt have time to finish their work, The ""main mission"" in which you acquire the player hq, the only place where you can research new technologies, ends abruptly after a very short amount of time. I am sure there was more meant to be here.

About researching, its a very blant tree with about 20 technologies which take 10 mins to research each. As with the story it feels like a placeholder for a more thoughtout system.

The enemy KI has serious problems, being unable to hit you if you arent moving in an exactly straight line towards them. Same goes for player turrets, the main weapon system of larger spacecrafts. There are small weapons which you can fire directly who work fine. But on that, there is no description, not even in the in-game encyclopedia, what weapons exactly do. There are beam weapons, weapons that are more effective vs shields or hulls but for whatever reason you have to test that out for yourself, it isnt written anywhere. 

There are different types of missions, normal and guild missions. Normal missions spawn randomly in a system after you discovered stations in them, there are no job boards or the option to specifically go for lets say hunt missions if you enjoy those mission types the most. Guild missions are given after reaching rank 10 in a faction and than you can choose what you want to go for to a certain degree. By increasing your rank you unlock better gear to purchase for those factions. I havnt explored the faction too much yet, thats the next thing on my list, but since there is a story behind the faction you get an introduction to after joining a faction I hope there are some story quests after gaining higher ranks, but I fear due to my other experience that there will be none.

You can board bigger enemy ships, but its bugged and your little boarding crews will circle around the enemys forever or until you leave the sector.

The list goes on but I think I made my point clear.

It's really a shame, I wouldnt mind the problems if this game had an early access tag since it clearly has a lot of potential and with some further development this game can truly be a gem, but as it is I feel scammed as a customer. Well, as it usually is with Egosoft I guess. But with steam its another time now and there is the ability to release games in early access. I would greatly appreciate an open letter of the devs regarding the state of the game and a roadmap of their plans of finishing it.

If you like the idea and want to support a developer that has an unique IP go for it. If you want to play an enjoyable and finished product stay away. Since in my eyes this game is falsely advertised I have no chance but to give it a thumbs down.]",1543731383,1598560426,True,0,0,0.739448487758636475,18,True,False,False

So it is a great game no doubt about that, after giving it a good hard play, i like the x series, from all the titles after X 3, i like this more than 90% of all other space sim's. what gives me a head ache is the fact that the game needs so much fiddling about with graphics settings to get it running at a steady frame rate, i have spent 30 plus hours working on optimisation on my rig, and i know that work wont translate to many other systems. This game is a labour of love, when it is running as well as one is able to get it to there is a problem that seems unavoidable, this game in early game is smooth as butter 60 FPS all day no hitches. Then the Mid game starts and you get trouble ! the frames drop lower than enjoyable rates, AI starts to get confused and wont behave correctly. you can see visual proof that the cpu is struggling to micro manage all of its tasks with out throwing a fit, watching ships shake and spaz out in docking areas is a palm to the forehead moment over and over again. Auto traders needing to be reassigned again and again, same for auto miners, as you get to the late game X rebirth just cant handle all the strings of code needed all at the same time, so allot of the world sits idle waiting for signal from the CPU and dose nothing, eventually it catches up and your playing again. most of these problems will go unnoticed by allot of gamer's, but those paying enough attention will realise that if you want to really enjoy the game you need to have a more passive focus to how you approach the game, i tried to start an empire, trade corp, and place military blockades, all at the same time and this is what i expect to be able to do, unfortunately i had to pick one aspect and cull back my other interest's, this restricting nature of the game made me feel deflated as i was really enjoying my progress up until the point the game said ""NOPE ! to much happening thanks but not today"". So i endured and continued to play and then had a sudden moment where i realised i was not having fun any more, i was getting distracted by frame drops, command line lag, and poor AI management, i tried to do the most primal thing i could for fun and that failed to, that was to create an armada and take it to the Xenon head on, well that went terrible as soon as my fleet engaged the enemy i could not handle the 15 FPS i was looking at. so i am at a point where i have gone back to X Rebirth with the CWIR mod installed and am having a great time, commanding huge fleets into battle against the Xenon and everything runs Perfectly. I Understand the game is Extremely complex, and dynamic, and it has been evident that it in fact is very responsive to the player on a diplomatic, economic, and exploration level. I am stuck in a love hate struggle with this iteration of the X series, as i love it and hate it all at the same time. i do recommend it for space sim fan's i really do, but keep in mind you will have to focus your play through on carefully managing the number of assets active in the game world, limiting your empire to the maximum size it can be before you computer cant deal with the demand any more. Give it a go just be warned this game will have you smiling like a maniac, then dump you into frustration, wishing the game ran better, when you find yourself heavily invested in your progress, and needing to reel in the freedom factor, to what the engine can handle. i give this game a 6.1/2 as opening up the functionality of what the game can do is still less than desired.

First, the problems, because if you can power through them, the game is one of the best space-empire builders I've played, and I've played most of them.

1. Optimization: Please, Please, Please continue to work on optimizing. I've only just begun after the latest big update, and I'm sure it HAS improved, but it has a way to go. Meeting the Rec-Specs and playing virtually any game I've ever owned in ultra at 60 easy, coming here and experiencing CPU Spikes/ stuttering in the oddest of times as well as the game's shining, busy moments (have an i7-7700k, 4-cores, 4.20Ghz, 16GB Ram) is heartbraking in the early hours and has me afraid of actually building an empire later on. Certain ships seem to just radiate stutter when around them, whether there is one or twelve in a group. GPU meets specs and is not ever fully utalized, so I do not believe it is a GPU problem. Also, I have a mod disabling fog!

2. Bugs: The first ship I bought, I couldn't use because the pilot was an uninteractive and unresponsive cinder-block, and it remained locked from my access after firing the pilot. Loading a save corrected this AFTER firing the pilot- but it was still a game-stopping bug (thankfully solved by a save-load) right at the beginning in one of the most foundational parts of the game (buying/piloting new ships). Also, this seems to have been an issue since 2018! 

I can work around occasional annoying bugs, as long as they dont perm-ruin a 60-Hour gamesave. I can deal with some occasional (bad) stutter, and avoiding some of the game's most gleaming mechanics and experiences (massive fights, megafactories, busy stations). But not everyone can, which is why this is not currently a thumbs up.

**If bugs continue to be ironed out, AND optimization (please, please, PLEASE optimize), this game is a glaring thumbs up and possibly one of the best modern space-scapades there is.",1598299057,1598299057,False,62,3,0.728081285953521729,0,True,False,False

But at the same time I may have the skill to make a masterpiece like this.  But, of course atm I don't have the dollars to put together a team.  2 hours in.  Now I likely won't be on this game 24/7 since there's no multiplayer feature.  But this is a great space setting, docking station, flying in your space suit into other ships and the rest goes without saying.  Games like this makes you feel good about how the developers could have easily gotten lazy and went with the blueprint of X3 with updated graphics.  But they actually added to what was already good about the game.  The true feel that you landed the ship.  And you can walk along a REAL dock.  Interact with AI NPCs.  Thus and so...  I guess the only other thing that would needed to be added would be some form of multiplayer.  I don't think the devs don't want to jump into that cause they would need servers and ofcourse people to monitor and what not to actually make it work. All I can say this is a great buy.  Well worth the cost!  Plenty to do.  And you feel more real of a character than JUST flying the ship!  8.75 out of 10.  If you like they way UBISOFT made Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
