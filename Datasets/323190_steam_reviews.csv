Unlike Timberborn, Frostpunk has END conditions, you can fail to keep your promises and be a dick to your people and you will be executed. Fail to raise hope for a better tomorrow and you will Banished. Population is also a non renewable resource (the main scenario operates on a fixed timescale of a 41 days) so every death does matter you can't come back from a disaster. but you can actually complete the game with a recap and reflection of your actions throughout the play-through

In Frostpunk building is managed at the player level with no automatic zoning or building you must place down everything yourself in the most efficient way otherwise you may end up wasting valuable space and resources or placing buildings outside of heat zones which are a necessity for your city's survival. 

Consequences are severe and unforgiving, fail to increase food supply and your city will get sick more often with a penalty to their recovery time which may lead to you having to sign ""alternative food sources"" leading to less people to gather food which sustains a ""Doom Loop"". fail to increase medical supply and efficiency and you end up with people who cant work who will die if they cant get proper treatment or will end up as amputees/palliatives who still cant work 

being a trailblazer in this kind of genre it does have some things to note, namely the scale. Frostpunk operates on micro scale not only in population but also in features as it was designed around a fixed timescale in game. the endless mode suffers from the previously mentioned ""hands off city"" which largely leads the player to go ""the city can provide for itself, survival is no longer a challenge so why should i continue?"" simply put if you are expecting City Skylines with a post apocalypse themeing this isn't it go back and worry about traffic flow.",1706032747,1708796362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In all the tech tree is easily the least interesting part of this game.

My problem is with the way saving was implemented. There is no auto-save frequency adjustment, there are not multiple quicksave slots, the game save system breaks if there are too many saves, and you can't delete the saves on the hard drive outside the game without risking screwing up quite a bit (they will auto-repopulate from the cloud). My game currently no longer can generate quick or auto-saves at this point and there is no information regarding this.

IF the devs respond it's going to be post a bug report. Except they don't respond to posts in the steam discussion bug forum (why have it then) and they refer you to a typical ""worst in class"" EA customer support copy paste: A ""FAQ"" attempting to reduce ticket load that was clearly never vetted that it did performed the intended effect. It is, in typical fashion, so laden with unnecessary garbage that it amounts to a modern EULA ""read and accept"" strategy rather than anything helpful to the user experience. Likely outsourced.

Ultimately I don't trust the next project by this developer given their treatment of the current project, and not only have a lost a number of saves but I now can't really use this one as the saving is entirely manual at this point.

UPDATE: The support response was to reinstall Steam. As I am sure I will have to reinstall the folders that contain the local files to fix the save issues, this means full reinstall with all games I have. Absolute insanity.",1707583910,1708234320,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Frostpunk itself is a very stable game and pretty balanced in terms of difficulty level. A person experienced with resource management should be able to master this game in about a day or two. With some help from videos explaining the games mechanics. The mechanics themselves make sense, but can also be exploited (Ex. Turning off the generator during the day to conserve coal, but turning it on at night so that people wont get sick).

The atmosphere of this game is also very rich, it really does feel like your fighting for survival. Desperately clutching to every little bit of wood, coal and food that you have in order to survive and maybe thrive in this new cold hell.

It has an Interesting storyline, with a world enduring a never ending frost/ice age during a victorian setting. It captivates immediately. The entire game has an enthralling soundtrack which I really liked.

Just finished the main arc, although I had to start over a couple of times because I didn't have the strategy right.  Whilst making your way through the technologies, building layout strategies, decisions and challenges you'll warm yourself through the big frost. Quite challenging at first, but once you get the hang of it, it'll make you want to step up a difficulty level higher.

This game will give me still a lot of hours of gaming pleasure when I start the other scenarios.

The meat of the game, the scenarios, are strongly narrative driven and each provide their own unique challenges. The presentation of challenges is great, with the first scenario ""A New Home"" giving you a solid introduction to the overall gameplay, and the other scenarios forcing you to focus on different playstyles to overcome the new challenges. The visual style and sound design are unique, powerful, and emotional, doing a wonderful job of placing you in the shoes of the leader of these last flickering bastions of humanity in the face of the relentless cold. 

At first, you will likely struggle to keep ahead of the curve as events and the ever decreasing temperature conspire to destroy your city and wipe out the last of humanity. But, as you learn the systems and what to focus on, you will gain a sense of dominance over the awesome power of mother nature. There is no combat, only the cold and human nature to fight against. 

While the scenarios do limit replayability, with the endless mode being something of a letdown, I still find myself coming back again and again to the frostland to try my hand over and over with different strategies to survive. As mentioned, the stories told in the scenarios paired with the amazing string led ost have a way of making you want to revisit them again and again. 

While you probably won't get the amount of hours of of Frostpunk like you might in other city builders like Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress, the themes and overall impact of this game is much, much more powerful. To be honest, ever since the last DLC for Frostpunk was released, I've been trying to fill the Frostpunk-shaped hole in my heart, and have found every other  game in the genre lacking.

I've rate this good piece of game a solid 9/10. 

Story captivated me and made me seek the answers behind why and how the Great Frost descended upon that world.

Build the generator ? or just endless survival ? It has it all , even peaceful builder mode where you just design your own City/Generator. 

One challenge especially made me bang my head against my desk but almost 500 deaths is just statisctic right?

The Earth has died, leaving behind a frozen wasteland and a few hundred ragged survivors, who you are responsible for keeping alive through the next month. Decide whether the dozens of children should sit around in school learning their ABCs, or if they should carry their weight through labor. When one of them inevitably dies in a workplace accident, decide whether to give them a proper funeral or to toss their body into a frozen trench. Then decide whether their cadaver is best utilized as replacement organs for the living, soil to feed your crops, or just straight up soylent green.

Listen to your colonists grumble about having to work 12-hour shifts instead of a 9-to-5 to live through the end of the world. Decide whether this last remnant of mankind should find hope through a strict theocracy of zealotry, a more secular, authoritarian regime, or something a bit more permissive. Decide whether the masses of near-dead refugees knocking on your door should be allowed in to further tax your limited resources, or if they should be left out in the cold to die. Watch your angry torch-bearing colonists gather in the middle of an apocalyptic -100°C storm to protest the decisions you made to ensure their collective survival. Get boiled alive after they decide they'd rather freeze than live under your rule.

Frostpunk isn't the kind of game that offers thousands of hours of gameplay, but what it does, it does well. The lore is quite good. There are four standalone story scenarios, all with unique gimmicks, which each take around two or three days of playing to get through, plus three endless modes. An additional two scenarios are available through DLC. It has some questionable balancing, but overall feels solid and is challenging. The ethical dilemmas are brutal and offer numerous replay possibilities. You spend most of your time zoomed way out from your city, but if you zoom in you'll find that your decisions have a lasting impact in the fine details. Making it through the ""final boss"" feels epic, and should you pull it off, there's a unique surprise waiting for you in the ending.

I learned to make immoral choices (do not take in all of the refugees that show up, they will eat your food and complain until they rebel and cast you out into the cold).  Do not take risky actions with your explorers, as they will always die and send more refugees as a result.

The only complaint that I actually would say that I have about this game is the limited replay value.  In an endless scenario, I had maxed out all of the tech, had an endless amount of resources, and really nothing further to do.  I could get up and leave my computer for hours and nothing bad could really happen (barring random events), so there was no point in continuing beyond that point.

Bugs = in all the hours I have played, the game has crashed to desktop about 20 times, different scenarios at different stages.  there doesn't seem to be a recurring ""sameness"" with them and I report them.

Other than that, no other bugs for me.

Issues = 
Because of my sensitives from my Autism I cannot play this game with any sound on, it is too erractic and even on the lowest level some parts are still too loud.
I hate that the game slows down all the time, I want to play it on the fastest possible speed all the time, but every new day, every time there is a decision to make the game goes into slow mode.
Sometimes I have over 50 people free doing nothing and then I build something and the AI just waits until nighttime, and then the people that were working the entire day then go do the building...
There is no pattern how the AI chooses to build things, I can multiple things at once, and I place them in the order I want them built NOPE, AI has different ideas... I tried to build one  ting at a time but then it just sits there for an IG day or two even when I have a lot people not doing anything.
There is no option to auto skip scenes / cinematic's
Can't design your won scenarios

The medium difficulty level of the game is something that I have attempted multiple times but never succeeded successfully, the gap between Easy and Medium seems to be massive, or it might be my own brain getting in the way of changing to the new difficulty level.

All The Good =
Its a great game with repetitive play across different difficulty levels with some pre-set scenarios that range in difficulty, you can also set it to an endless mode.
Not much more to be said really I find this to be a great game with easy instructions to follow to start off and progress.

You have to take into account the efficiency of which citizens work where, efficiency of building placement, efficiency what tech to research or what laws to pass at what time, and overall what to prioritize. Many times you will be torn between multiple difficult options, such as healing the sick so they're able to work again vs. researching better healing methods that will help down the line, or using your limited steel resources to build an automaton and free up some workers vs. building better-insulated homes to prepare for brutal temperature drops.

It is also a game with the world's worst mechanics in some places, which make it infuriating to play.
Timer ticking down to the *boot-you-out-of-your-game* moment? No warnings, no blinking, bam.
Got banished? No ""oops I left the game running"", no ""let me try that again"", not even an extra autosave to go back to. Just need that 10 extra in-game seconds for the melt? Too bad.
Scout arrived at a point and is awaiting instructions? Guess they'll just hang out in the corner until you notice.

Wanna zoom in just a tad? Guess you wanted to see the intricate details in the floor.

A dying old man is my one true nemesis in the entire game. I first met him in the ""New Home"" scenario, trying to get the deathless walkthough and ""golden path"" achievements on hard difficulty. Mind you, it wasn't particularly hard once I made it through the first few days, so I was preparing to take it easy after that. After a few days since building my first house of healing, an event popped up with a message from a dying old man: ""I die not of cold or starvation, I leave this world in peace after living a good long life; all thanks to the wonderful city you've build! Thank you from the bottom of my heart, GG WP, BTW your deathless achievement is now screwed!"" Aw... such kind words... wait, what?!

The second time the event popped up in the Endless mode on extreme difficulty. The problem was that the decaying body of the old geezer in a healing house was causing an obvious discontent among the rest of the community, who demanded I did something about it. Because the event popped up quite early in the game, at the moment I didn't introduce any funeral law, having my hands full with lots of other problems demanding an immediate solution. Seriously, if you expect people to die soon and have to introduce a funeral law to counter the aftermath in advance, then you're most probably doing something very very wrong. You know, maybe try focusing on making sure they don't die in the first place? Regardless, here I stood on a verge of being exiled due to people getting mildly annoyed with extended shifts in almost all imaginable workplaces, eating soup for the past couple of week, freezing in their sorry tents they would have to call home for a very long time yet, and a storm coming in a few days. And among all these problems comes a dying old man and says: ""Thank you for building this wonderful settlement that let me spend my final days in warmth and peace! BTW, I noticed you don't have a funeral law. So here's my last gift to you in a form of my rotting corpse which will hopefully cause an epidemic.""

Since I literally only just accepted a different law, I had to wait for a 1.5 days before introducing another one. But alas, extreme discontent  from all the things above didn't let me say: ""Hey people, I've got an idea! Let's dump the old man's corpse in a pit, freeze it up and then later on cut it into organs to help heal the sick!""

As I wasn't keen on forsaking the access to an awesome +20% healing speed buff by accepting the god-awful cemetery law (again, if you expect people to die and want to minimize the consequences, you're doing it wrong), I had to instead let people vent off their frustration in the arenas to slightly decrease the discontent and deal with the old man's corpse in yet another day. The plan had failed miserably, because after one more day the foul smell of a rotting dead guy was so strong that no amount of arena fighting could help people forget its existence. The whole story lasted for about 4 days until I finally got a grip and told my people: ""Let's dump the old wise man into the pit"" without the risk of being dumped there along with him.

Alas, much to my surprise, it wasn't the last gift from the old man. Several days later I noticed there was no body in the pit, which was suspicios at best. A bit later I came across a sick child stuck in ""disposing of a corpse"" status. Either the wise old man was a heavyweight, or the kid was too weak from living on soup, but the status wasn't going away, and the kid just stood there above the rotting corpse (which, apparently, stopped bothering people a long while ago). As days went by, the child became gravely ill and then passed away right above the old man, not being able to finish this one task he was ever asked for.

Thus began a long sequence of bugged-out corpses people could not dump, instead getting stuck above the bodies until they joined them. The old man did not pass away alone, eventually taking the whole settlement with him. And such was the last gift of a dying old man.

Edit: a few years later, this is still my most vivid memory from the game. That said, I highly recommend it to everyone and can't wait to play the sequel!",1591616552,1706264838,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons 
Once you finish, you can crank the difficulty, but there's not much else to do. 
Mid pre-crisis late game drags/lags in some missions.

All in all, I felt this was more or less worth the $30 price it was asking for. Now that it's on heavy discount, this seems like a really good buy.

Edit (2024): I've gone back to this game many times over the past few years, and played higher difficulties as well as the additional missions, and over time this has become one of my favourite games of the genre. It's certainly worth playing at least once, particularly at an absurd 80% discount. I'll be buying the sequel on day 1.",1577062405,1705902684,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found the difficulty curve to be spot on. The game does have challenge. I crashed and burned within 1 hour on my first attempt.

At one point during this time, as I started playing the ""The Last Autumn"" DLC again, I said, ""This time I'm going to play realistically. I'll do whatever I would do if I was the leader of this project"".
Ever since I was little, I dream of being a member of different kinds of managerial professions. This dream continued in my youth and I graduated from law school. I carefully choose the books I will read, the movies I will watch, the games I will play; I care about my personal development. For all these reasons, I was sure that I would play this game as myself this time, and I started the game in hard mode with the mentality of ""even if I don't reach the ideal ending in the game, so be it"". Indeed, my people were dying, getting sick, getting pretty hungry, and I couldn't keep up. I couldn't offer them safe working conditions, and I couldn't fulfill their demands for the most part. In order to complete the project on time, I had to compromise my values and even not allow a father to return home when he learned of his daughter's illness.
-And on the 29th day I signed the “Terror” from the book of law.-
I built an execution place. Next morning announcement was made and at 07:30 am one of my people executed. The time elapsed between the announcement and the execution may be a short time in the game, but it hosted so many emotions and thoughts... Did the rulers also go through these stages? What would be the extent of my corruption in real life in those circumtances? Was it because it was a game, or would I really be like this in the future?"". Frostpunk may be a game, but it was a simulation for me in my that experience. A simulation that slams me in the face that I need to develop and consolidate myself and my ethical values. A simulation about how possible it is for the rulers to stray from the path.
You did it again. With This War of Mine when we traded jewelry for a broken guitar and a teddy bear, you made us understand what war actually is. And in Frostpunk, you explained how difficult it can be to make decisions for others, to manage and employ groups of people with limited resources and difficult choices, from a different perspective than the majority. The game itself is an incredible experience, but the reflection of this event on me is in a different dimension.

We struggled through the harsh cold, barely scrounging up enough food and wood to feed and shelter everyone. But I insisted on running a moral city, children would play not work, the disabled would not be abandoned but cared for. Things were hard, but we survived. With the sweat of our brow and the strength of our souls, we soldiered on.
Our goal was to find another settlement, many groups like ours had set out, hoping to find salvation around a generator. We quickly learned of a place called Winterhome, but all the places that we heard about them were abandoned…. Full of frozen corpses…
We tried not to think about it, hope slowly fell, but we prayed.
Then a man arrived. Bearing horrible news.
Winterhome had fallen. They had failed. They had all froze, starved to the point of cannibalising their dead.
We were alone in this world, alone and very cold.
Hope dramatically fell, people began a new movement, the Londoners, people who wanted to return to London, thinking that surely that great city could not fall.
Unbeknownst to them, London was a city of frozen ghosts now.
And so, i saw them needing purpose. And in desperation, i gave them one. Faith.
I used the power of faith to give them a new purpose, with churches and shines, im no zealot, but anything to prevent the city from falling, right? The city must not fall, no matter what… right?
First it was churches,then prayers, then shines, then repentance, then secret faith keepers, then secret informants.
Friend turned on friend, family against one another, turning them in for any sight of dissent or thievery.
And i embraced it, it kept hope up, so i did what gave the city the best chance.
Then came the storm.
Refugees from throughout the land, came speaking of death, of doom, of a great wall of frost purging the land of all life. It would come in 15 days. And they were not lying, it was a monster. Cold sheer death, ready to kill the last city on earth. We frantically tried to prepare, mandatory sermons to keep faith and hope up, 24 hour shifts. I worked men to death to get enough coal to last. The refugees begged us to save the other groups of refugees out there from the storm. They didn't know it was coming, and would surely all be killed.
I left them to die, more mouths would could barely feed.
When the storm came, we hunkered down and prayed, for there was nothing else we could do.
The winds howled, and the air grew colder.
From -94 Fahrenheit, to -112, then -130
Our children huddled up with their parent to conserve warmth. A mans daughter ran out into the storm, fearing the city would freeze. Her father came to us, begging to be allowed to go after her. We allowed it. Feeling he would die.
As frost grew around our windows and we forced the generator to burn hotter and hotter, the temperature continued to drop, more and more
-148
-166
-184
I laid everyone off from their jobs and told them to stay with their families and pray, huddle to their fires and hope.
Our hospitals filled with men, women and children, all with severe frostbite, hands dead and blackened from the icy cold.
And right as the storm grew near its end.
The air dropped to a final deadly freeze.
Two-hundred and thirty-eight degrees below zero.
Our hospitals were overwhelmed, over half the city was dying, frostbite was rampant. I feared all our sacrifices would be for nothing.
Then.  The storm was over
We had survived, the last city on earth had weathered the worst storm in human history.
But at what cost?
I had created a zealous state, where secret police cracked down on any resistance. I banished drunken men to their deaths for spreading fear. I ordered the sickest to be left to die to save the many. I tore apart families and left hundreds to die in the cold to save what i could.
We survived, but had we lost our humanity?
Was it worth what we had done?

Any game that can take you on a journey like that is well worth it.

The UI and gameplay of Frostpunk is very easy to understand, and this is because the game is a marvel of good game design. The main campaign functions as the tutorial and introduces all the mechanics needed to beat the game without taking away player choice. The tutorial aspects of the main campaign are barely even noticeable on repeat playthroughs because of how non-intrusive they are. The UI consists of just a few huge buttons, and there are images of the buildings in the UI itself along with construction prices and a brief summary of what the building does to make things extra clear. Every menu is quick & responsive and clicking out of menus is just a right click. Buildings automatically resize to fit slightly off building spaces. Frostpunk’s UI is seamless and easy to master in a single playthrough, but there is an in-game instruction guide and official wiki supported if necessary. Its done so well that you do not even notice it.

What makes Frostpunk’s gameplay exceptional is that unlike a lot of other games in the city builder and even survival city builder genre is that it demands that the city always be adapting to new conditions and objectives. Research and laws are limited/restricted by time, and this means many ways to approach each campaign. Researching a better generator at the start may mean less people sick & more efficient early game gathering, but more people will need to be dedicated to coal and this may justify pushing out child labor or brutal 14-hour shifts. On all settings it only takes an hour of extreme cold weather to cause amputations and deaths. Coal demands are exponential, and on Hard+ the temperature can suddenly drop multiple levels early into a campaign or Endless Mode before proper heating upgrades have even been researched.  The game does a very good job at adding obstacles and a whole campaign may just be a constant challenge of putting out fires and whatever it takes to just keep the city going as the temperature plunges.

Frostpunk is a great example of games as art as all its mechanics and even its difficulty tie into its story and message. The key word in the title is “Punk”, but this is not just some shallow message about the police and church being bad. Its about the nature of cooperation and how authoritarianism comes from the weakness and fear of societies being exploited by cynical or even desperate well meaning leaders. 

Frostpunk is a well-designed game about building a constantly changing city in a brutally difficult setting. It offers a very valuable humanist message that is supported by amazing art & music design. Its definitely worth its full price with its expansions, and a must-buy on sale.",1659915845,1705756567,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,1,True,False,False

Pros:

- the win in this game is not handed out. You WILL earn it, but once you figure out the key to victory, it is wash and repeat.

- Huge fan of tech tree advancement and this game supplies the goods. Once you get production going, the cost to upgrade is not really that expensive. 

- Building your settlement is a snap. Literally. The grid snapping for buildings is sharp with no glitchy bullcrap. 

Cons:

- Steep learning curve. You MUST learn the path to winning. There are not “5 ways to win”. If you do not do specific crucial things you will die. Again and again. 

- convenient that storms always start at the beginning of a workday. No seriously, they ALWAYS do so it is too simple to count the hours to get your explorers back in time to not die and stuff. 

- There doesn’t seem to be any real way to stop engineers from building and stopping what they are assigned to. We should be able to set building new stuff to engineers “not assigned”. Your dudes will drop that wood they were collecting and build something across the map without care. Too bad you needed that wood. I would think that in tandem, queuing built items would be a great feature as well.

If you like old school city builders (a challenge) then you'll like this. The joy in this type of game IS the trial and error. If it's on sale, grab it. 

To the developers... Would like to see more options for buildings/roads. Since the game constantly goes back to Normal speed after every Tech upgrade/game event, it slows down the pace of play. So you're forced to take a step back and stare at what you're doing. Frost Punk 2 probably addresses a lot of what the first version is missing. Would be nice to add some little DLC packs for FREE that give you just a little bit more customization. Nothing crazy, just to break up the look of a city. Maybe some different road skins, street lamp luminosity colors, distinct building skins, etc. so I can break up the city into districts. Since all the buildings are of a similar steam punk color scheme, visually it's hard to find what I'm looking for after about 30 minutes into building.

When you're a leader, it is tempting to take the shortest term possible solution to get out desired results and gain approval from people, but that will have other permanent costs instead. Your people, end up doing the work for you, so that you get to take it easy, which I feel is not right to do, as games tend to focus on letting you do just that. On top of that, most people don't have the information available as you may have, they might not have the capacity to understand straight away given the circumstances. Simply put, this is a game where you get to learn how to take care of people properly and you'll notice how to do the most humane tasks is the most difficult there is to pull off, but it is the best long term option there is, even if it can appear that your people grow very slowly together. However, I think this is where this quote comes in: ""The slow and steady wins the race.""

Don't sacrifice people if you can choose it, seems to be the moral of this game. Time management, is crucial for success!

I then find one thing interesting: Is there a way to learn to enjoy doing all of this? I believe there should be and things tends to get easier the more you stick on doing something you're focused reaching the most humane outcomes there is.",1705571430,1705571430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The difficulty out of the gate is too hard (medium by default but fiercely punishing) and the tutorials too sparse, consequently you learn through trial and error more than strategy. For instance there will be tech you wouldn't intuitively think to prioritise but if you don't you're essentially done. 
You won't realise at first but once behind the curve in any particular area it's almost impossible to meaningfully recover, so begins the slow and inexorable decline until defeat with no reset button. Any solution will cost you lots of resources you can ill afford and once spent will be behind where you need to be in some other area. Beautifully thematic whilst you're doing this you'll really 'feel the struggle' which many praise this game for, but investing hours of effort only to have to eventually wait to lose and start again isn't fun. 
Be great to lower the difficulty out of the box so I could enjoy some struggle but ultimately be victorious. I eventually found you could play the main story as a 'scenario' and tweak the difficulty down after 8 hours of several excruciating playthroughs. Even on easy if you don't near max out the tech tree and stockpile like crazy you won't survive. 

Can only see the appeal for folks that like to throw themselves at adversity until they can perfect there way through the maze a la Dark Souls and Elden Ring.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happineass of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Hello!
 
Thank you for contacting 11bit Studios Customer Support! My name is Aleksander and it's nice to meet you.
 
Thank you for letting me know and I'm happy to hear you enjoy our game so much! We are aware that this is an issue that sometimes can occur depending on the map that is generated, however, it is a rare issue. Our devs are looking into it, however I'm unable to tell you when it will be fixed.
 
If you have any other questions, feel free to contact us again, we are always happy to answer your questions.

Extremely unfair and dejecting gameplay- on any difficulty other than normal/easy

There's not a f***ing chance in the WORLD these lazy devs tried this on any of the hard difficulties- it's genuinely the worst experience ever if you try for hard

So don't- just play on normal or easy

The resources all make sense- it's creative in how you progress in the game, and fun to gain permanent upgrades

People dying is a death sentence for most save files- you will have no ability to upkeep the city- so be careful of that

It sucks shit and the reason why I've uninstalled the game- never to play again

DLC sucks horse a**

The DLC is way- WAY- too short to warrant the purchase, if you are rich, go ahead and blow- if you're poor- it's truly not innovative- it has 1 new mechanic *stealing your resources* which feels dull, and the ""city"" you build aren't cities- they are super small- it feels hollow in terms of storytelling and objectives - it constantly harvests your earned resources to send back to a city- which just feels like ****.

Don't waste your time on this gobshite DLC
They created the DLC only to squeeze money out of you- they don't actually care about the game or your experience past launch

MAYBE waste your time with the base game if you like resource management games.",1705269417,1705372651,True,0,0,0.4847908616065979,0,True,False,False

What i mean by this is there are things in this game that NEED to be prioritized in a specific order and failing to do so will cause you to lose.

Developed by 11 bit studios, this game offers a unique blend of strategy, resource management, and tough moral decisions. Released in 2018, ""Frostpunk"" has earned praise for its challenging gameplay and compelling narrative.

Graphics and Atmosphere:
The first thing that strikes players upon launching Frostpunk is its stunning visuals. The icy landscapes, detailed buildings, and weather effects create a truly immersive and chilling atmosphere. The game's art direction perfectly captures the desperation of a society struggling against the harsh cold.

Gameplay:
At its core, Frostpunk challenges players to establish and manage the last city on Earth in the midst of a new ice age. The central gameplay mechanic revolves around balancing resources like coal, food, and manpower to keep the city warm and its inhabitants alive. The game introduces a unique heat management system, where players must strategically place heating sources to prevent freezing, making every decision critical.

Moral Dilemmas:
One of the standout features of Frostpunk is its incorporation of moral dilemmas. As the leader, you must make tough choices that affect the well-being of your citizens. These decisions range from implementing harsh laws to sacrificing a few for the greater good. The consequences of your choices are not only reflected in the survival of your city but also in the emotional impact on the players.

Storytelling:
Frostpunk weaves a compelling narrative through a series of scenarios that unfold as you progress. The game presents a thought-provoking exploration of human nature under extreme conditions. The writing is poignant and succeeds in immersing players in the struggle for survival, adding an emotional layer to the overall experience.

Challenges and Replayability:
Frostpunk is not for the faint of heart. The game presents a steep learning curve and challenges players to adapt quickly to unforeseen circumstances. While the main scenarios provide a gripping experience, the game also offers various challenges and scenarios to keep players engaged long after the initial playthrough.

Conclusion:
In summary, Frostpunk stands out as a masterfully crafted survival game that goes beyond the typical city-builder. Its haunting atmosphere, challenging gameplay, and moral complexity make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Whether you're a strategy enthusiast or someone looking for a deeply emotional gaming experience, Frostpunk delivers a frozen symphony of survival that will stay with you long after the last embers fade away.",1705082118,1705082118,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

I hope you like losing.

But for real, it's brutally difficult even at easy difficulty and there's actually very little variation between the difficulty levels - the game really wants you to follow exactly what it wants you to do and doesn't really offer you a lot of flexibility otherwise.

But, it really sets an unfair standard to other city builders. It's got a lot of polish, a lot of character, great replayability and very straightforward mechanics.

I'm conflicted because I wish this game were more approachable to people who like city-builders and not this specific type of resource-scarcity-management game, but if it were more approachable it wouldn't be as good. Maybe. I dunno. I got the ultramarathon extreme achievement but I didn't feel like it was much harder than just learning the basics of the game.",1704971505,1704971505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is unique among strategy and building games in that even once you've conquered the struggling portion and start exponentially expanding just a few wrong moves or a lack of future planning can still throw you into losing half of your population in a single night and going into ruin with little chance to recover.

the last autumn dlc is must have, i think the others are safe to skip. The game is an actually difficult city manager with an emphasis on survival. and it is hard. but it also has limited replayability since its not fully sandboxy. tho trying for the hardest difficulty on each of the scenarios will still take a huge amount of time 🤷‍♂️ Frost punk is aiming for a more story driven approach. 
If you've ever been playing a city manager and felt bored cause the difficulty just kind of goes away after a certain point, then this one is a nice reprieve from that experience.

I've played some city/civ builders before, but the setting, stakes, and pacing in this game really keep you on the edge of your seat.  Compared to other similar games I've seen, it really forces you to micromanage and squeeze resources and space for maximum efficiency - which is stressful, but satisfying when you finally latch onto a successful strategy. Seems to have good replay value not only inasmuch as you will probably be banished into the frozen wastes the first time and have to start over, but because there are numerous branching choices to make in the scenarios which trigger different challenges and/or cause different outcomes.  Each scenario has run about 8-10 hours, which at least allows the satisfaction of finishing in one or two sessions, and adds some exciting urgency to your actions and tech choices, since there is no time to merely max everything out.  The replay factor compensates for the shorter game length.  Minor downsides for me are the camera perspective - although you can pan, zoom, and rotate, the angle from above a canyon wall does block the view of perimeter buildings sometimes, and there's annoying inconsistency (perhaps purposeful?) on various equipment - some of which you can freely adjust and some you can't, regardless of tech tree advances.",1704831605,1704831605,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of my favorite games and I don't even play city builders. This game and This War Of Mine always puts me on the line, makes me question whether I'll give up my morals so my people can survive. how far will I push them, do some of them have to die so more can live? 

And the gameplay is something that's better experienced than told because holy is it good. There are many resources and needs you must handle all at once, it's just a matter of what you will solve first. Do you tend to the ill first so they can work? Will you spend your efforts on homes and heating to avoid being ill in the first place? Or do you focus on upgrades so production will be more efficient? And it's not that you'll make the wrong choice but rather you feel like you should've focused on something else before.

This is a wonderful game even if you don't like city builders, and its expansion The Last Autumn is something you should get if you crave more content, though it may be pricey so waitng for a sale might be preferable.",1704640592,1704719717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: 9 - read below
Graphics: 8 - pretty good for strategy (no ray-tracing, DLSS, etc, which is ok for strategy genre)
Audio: 9 - atmospheric, relaxing at times and engaging at times
Scenario: 8 - keeps challenged and interesting, depends on your decisions
UI/UX: 9 - easy to navigate, nicely designed, fits well into theme

[h1] Target audience [/h1]

If you like clicking the same buttons without thinking - this won't fit you.
If you like games that require pretty decent brain usage, but don't want to spend hours to learn it - this is it.

[h1] What is it about? [/h1]
Your people is at the edge of extinction. What kind of decisions will you make?
Will you be able to keep human moral values, or will you forget them to survive?
The game will challenge [b]both[/b] your strategic thinking and moral values.
Get ready to make tough decisions and take responsibility for them.

[h1] How hard is it? [/h1]
Game mechanics is easy-to-get. Does not require hours to get in, you'll get into it in minutes.
Yet the game itself is hard, requires decent brain usage. Has difficulty levels to fit everyone.
Gameplay is not repetitive. The possibilities grow gradually as your settlement grows,
in a way that it feels refreshing but not overwhelming.

[h1] How long is it? [/h1]
It gave me ~50 hours of interesting experience in one main scenario only,
and there are other scenarios + replayability. Definitely worths the time and money.
A game session typically took 1-2 hours, since it's an ""atmospheric"" game.
Yes you can play 10 minutes and have progress, but make sure to keep an eye on the watch ;)

[h1] Rare note for a strategy game [/h1]
This game has NO silver-bullet. Tell me if you find one! :)
I have played lots of strategies - Age of Empires, CnC, Stronghold, Warhammers, Total Wars, SimCity etc... 
Found silver bullets in lots of them in just matter of *hours*.
Yes, some easy steps which can be repeated again and again to gain lots of money, resources...
So those games became boooringly easy after ~20 hrs, and I either stopped playing or carried just for the scenario.

Yet, did not find such silver bullet in FrostPunk! Its quite well-balanced, congrats to 11BIT!
So this is the 3rd strategy without such issue, along with Anno and Discord Times. 

[h1] Verdict [/h1]
A rare game of the last decade that is unique, hard, fresh, non-copy-paste, and finally  - worth playing!

[b]Update for 2024: [/b] 6 years have passed! Yet, this game still remains the last non copy-paste strategy game of the decade.",1591128912,1704469949,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It took me a couple of tries before I beat the main story, and if that was all there was I could probably still play it for months, just because there's always a way to improve yourself and save more of your people. But there's a ton of additional content outside of the main story by itself that puts a whole new spin on the game! I don't think I'll ever get tired of it, not gonna lie.

One of my favorite things is how the world develops and the game progresses. It all feels natural and smooth and the way you have to be conscious of and cater towards your people. If you focus only on building and work and progress and disregard your people's needs/wants then that's how you'll really lose the game. It's a really fascinating dynamic you can play up when you do it well.

I absolutely love the music as well, Frostpunk has probably got one of my favorite video game soundtracks bar none; the way the songs build and provide atmosphere and feeling really immerse you in the world.

The scenario is a climate catastrophe set in an alternate reality in the period of the industrial revolution (basically steampunk) where people are forced to abandon cities and head off in steam engines to find a place to escape the weather. You are a colony leader and you must manage the resources in the locale of your steam generator to keep the colony alive and develop technologies to mitigate against the ever worsening cold weather. In the meantime, you may explore the wilderness outside of your colony in search of abandoned resources and other refugees. The population of the colony is subject to a mixture of hope and discontent which you can manage through enacting various laws.

Unique setting and atmosphere: Frostpunk throws you into a harsh, frozen world where surviving the elements is a constant struggle. The grimy steampunk visuals and haunting soundtrack bring the world to life and build a constant sense of tension.
Tough choices and moral dilemmas: You'll face difficult decisions that force you to consider the needs of your people versus your own principles. Do you allow child labor to boost production? Do you enact harsh laws to maintain order? The game will make you confront the dark side of survival.
Deep city-building mechanics: Building your city requires careful planning and resource management. You need to ensure your people have enough heat, food, and work while expanding your reach for new resources.
High replayability: With different scenarios and choices to make, Frostpunk offers multiple playthroughs with unique experiences.
Weaknesses:

Can be brutally difficult: The game is unforgiving, and mistakes can have serious consequences. If you're not a fan of challenging games, Frostpunk might not be for you.
Slow pace: Building and managing your city can be time-consuming, especially in the early stages. Some players might find the pace too slow-burning.
Repetitive tasks: Certain tasks, like gathering resources, can become repetitive over time.
No true win state: There's no ""perfect"" ending in Frostpunk. You'll always be making sacrifices and dealing with the consequences of your choices.

Overall, Frostpunk is a well-made and thought-provoking game that won't shy away from challenging you both strategically and morally. However, its difficulty, slow pace, and lack of a definitive win state might not appeal to everyone.",1703899932,1703899952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also having all of the citizens be completely white feels ahistorical for Victorian era England, as by then there were DEFINITELY many immigrants from different cultures. It feels like a missed opportunity for this game about maintaining social harmony/overcoming discord not to include some of the inherent tensions between people of different backgrounds, plus would have made the NPC portraits of frozen white people a little less repetitive.

Also also, there are some years-old bugs in scenarios like Last Autumn that have never been fixed which is a bummer.

It's ridicliously, stupidly hard. I've tried playing this for several years now. I pride myself on being able to win a large number of games at their ridicliously difficult settings. However Frostpunk has two options

stupidily easy
moriconally hard (basically any setting above easy is death wtihin 15 days). 

I get there is a it's a ice age however the amount of whingers. I've got functioning cities with food and heating and yet it's a never ending set of whingers. Jeez I don't live in a f**k*** ice age despite working \0 hours a week and i don't whinge 1/100 as much as the people who you govern. 

And its not just the difficulty. The scenarios are just stupid especially after completing Winterhome/a New Start you still have to constantly research the same technologies over and over and over. Don't they write anything down? 

It's Victorian England, and yet you still have to research centralised heating??? You've survived the big storm and yet when you send out your men to open a army warehouse they don't know anything about how a heater workers?

Your told constantly not to bother replying to your whinging citizens and yet when you take up this advice you're punished, as if these idiots have another place to go. 

And the generator. Building it in Victorian english era. For godsake during the construction of the Panema Canal over 22,000 men died from disease and accidents,

And yet the developers of the frostpunk world have designed a game that punishes you for not going ahead with christmas (you know when everyone is going to die if you don't keep the generator running). 

 Argh

i've tried giving this game a chance but even after playing the DLC it's not improved. It got worse. In the autunm scenario you're literally beset by never ending union problems. Seriously its the 1800s, unions were taken care with a gun and a beaten. 

If this game was set in the 1900s then perhaps you could get away with this overalay of modern industrial concepts but not in a world verse where you're literally building massively inefficent generators to survive an ice age (really, that's what we'd do, build over air heaters generators that would radiate 99% of their heat into the atmosphere. Not underground bases.

In fact thats what i'm going to do. An underground base building game surviving an ice age",1702784836,1702784836,False,0,3,0.479797959327697754,4,True,True,False

   (if you dont want any spoilers, come back to read this review after at least trying a few times to make it in the arctic meatsicle paradise )     game rated   9/10  (in my opinion)

 Good village building and management game, with immersive storyline about helping people survive arctic meatsicle doom.  Spoiler alert kind of after this.  I would give this game top rating, if storyline was not contradicting itself ( after 30 days or so, after researching upgrade on beacon to forecast temperature ).  We are given choices to make during the story progression, sometime we choose not to take on extra people (survivors) we find exploring using the scouts, because we cant house them or feed them or both.  
     
     That being said, personaly, i chose to not take on survivors after my village was about 150 people, watching my coal and food consumptions, i estimated i could provide for about 150 people.  I do have a way to still rescue some survivors that will come live with us, by willingly having some of our villagers, die.  After numbers go down about 20-50 then theres room to rescue one group approx.  I have restarted about 6 times, just to test the different adaptation and purpose laws that we choose to instill.  
  2nd Spoiler kind of alert here.   a- I recommend you make children work (at safe places like cooking and farming as well as pickup resources when its warm enough for kids like warmer then -40), b- the only way i could get rid of londoners, is with the prison and occasional beating on culprits.  Once there is no more prisoners, or troubles you can unman the jail as close it down, just like medic and infirmary buildings can be shut down when there are no sick patients (to save on coal fuel).  I ended up having 4 robots to gather resources for -60 and colder weather and that works great.

  Just very didapointing (spoiler alert again here), that the story after beacon upgrade, now asks me to rescue all the people out there, when i dont think i our little setup can support 100-150 more people.  I will play it through and try, to see if game is over for me, as i wont save them all i'm sure.

  Anyway. lastly, there are many fun type buildings also, to help boost people's morale, like church, pub, fighting arena, gardens, or pleasure house they call it lol.  Buildings to help you control people and problems they create, like guard tower is great with patrol etc.

  Have fun and dont forget to turn off heaters when people dont work at their stations after 6pm !!!

I had brought destruction to the frost lands and could only feel regret for my previous choices and move on. Now I still continue to hop on from time to time to see what I can attempt to ruin next, so ramping up the difficulty to see what I can accomplish on the next run is always a joy. Going from a peaceful protector, ready to sacrifice resources for comfort, on one run to a heartless leader, ready to sacrifice bodies for progress, on another, while suffering all of the consequences of survivor mode, always brings a change that I often don't expect until it is too late.

When I stopped, I had learned from my mistakes and had an advanced understanding of the game's mechanics.

So I ended up playing until the ""end-game"" state of the basic game. 

Am I enjoying it now? 
No, it is a waste of my time. 
The further I got into the game, the less invested I became. 
Which should not happen. 
I am not too happy about the mechanics of the game but overall I just don't think the game is deep enough, developed enough nor offer you enough of.... basically anything to make it worth your time and money.

_____________________________________________


I can see what the developers went for and it is not a bad idea. 

I just don’t like playing the game. 
It is a game you have to start over and over to get an idea of how it is played.
Even then, you seemingly have to be lucky to pull things off. 

I wanted to progress, but you can’t save even when things are going well meaning you have to start over every single time. 

It is not a game for me. With a few tweaks, I think it could be, but I just don’t like how the mechanics play out. It feels unforgivingly punishable way too often (rather than just “averagely punishing). A difficulty setting could improve the game a lot, but no. The developers want you to suffer. A lot. 
I play to have fun. I don’t mind being frustrated, but this game goes beyond that. It only wants you to suffer. A lot. Over and over. 
And as such, I feel like the game wastes my time. 

I am not happy about it, but this is why I can’t recommend the game. 

I can see how people may like this, but I warn you. Don't think this will be for you.

But.

My old computer died and my replacement laptop has a high screen refresh rate. The game wouldn't launch despite everything.

I had a reply from a very nice member of the Dev Team who said: 
""our engine (Frostpunk is based on our own tech) is a tad moody when it comes to launching it on systems equipped with high refresh rate displays. We're well aware of that and we're currently doing our best to fix it - in the meantime, you can try lowering your refresh rate to 60Hz and attempting to launch the game then. If that doesn't help, I am afraid you have to wait until it's patched by our devteam.""

Sadly manually altering the refresh rate didn't help.

I had another reply:
""Sadly, I am unable to provide any reasonable ETA of the patch, but our engine team has taken a delivery of 120-, 144- and 244Hz displays in the last few days, so the search for the reason is on, we'll do our best to get rid of this issue as soon as possible. ""

This was back in June. Patches and DLC have come out but I still can't run the game and this is a real shame because it is really excellent. I highly recommend this game in general and I even bought the DLC in support of the Devs despite it not working but I can't really endorse it until they manage to fix this issue.

A point I've seen sometimes in negative reviews is that it isn't very replayable, which I agree with. I haven't properly touched the game in months at the time of writing, and I've beaten every single scenario, DLC included. Endless mode exists, but even that gets repetitive after a few runs.

But I can definitely say that even if it's not the best GAME, it's absolutely one of the best STORIES I have ever interacted with.

The first run of Frostpunk is what I call the ""true"" run. You're experiencing what the Captain is experiencing; you're pretty confused on what to do and won't know what your actions will lead to. A law you sign or a few buildings you place now may have major impacts in the future.

Later on, after you know what everything does, when stuff occurs and what options are good, the game kind of loses its initial charm. This tale about humanity versus the elements and how far you are really willing to go is irrelevant if every building is a sauna and you're mining enough coal to power five cities.

But that first run. I myself can remember actively PRAYING and hoping with all my will that this virtual city of Brits won't all perish in the face of the unforgiving world. My Generator even ran out of coal right before the end as one last plot twist.

If you can get it on sale, do so and do NOT research anything about the game. Go into it blind and truly experience all of the hope, helplessness, despair and determination that Frostpunk invokes.",1702457220,1702457220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

We've survived 4 storms so far, we have top housing, we got plenty of coal but ... idk i feel hopeless"". There are ways to deal with this but the endless mode is quite tight on the number of people. Or the houses are confortably warm, the working places likewise, small risk of getting ill, so 25% of the population goes for 3 days to the clinic. Must be the hopeless/depressed thing. As i said the game mechanics are sloppy. Maybe developed last ? Like 5 days before launch ?  Then you have the UI design. Its fine except when it pops up, takes your pointer out of context, preferably at inopportune moments. And something I found out lately, you can blow the generator even when its out of coal. The graphics people did their job mostly. The gameplay people could have used some more time to finish the game.

The game itself is good for its sale price, but lacks the depth nor the fun unlike the masterpieces in this genre. The game is centered around (un-)ethical choices for the survival. The main problem is that, by design, people in Frostpunk are just numbers, unlike the dev's previous one. For the people shown as numbers, ethics is just about comparing numbers. Child labor? Great, it's just trading discontent with extra hands. Organ transplantation? Yay, just getting the medical capacity for free. Move numbers by one-click. Then the game reveals the shallowness of the game mechanics. Basically what you only have to do is to keep the core chain of coal -> temperature -> health. That's all. Then you will have scenarios / events that gives you debuffs that is just prepared to torture players. Torturing player itself is not fun for players like me; games I like also have treats for you after you pass the wall. But this game is not. Just. Torturing. You. Period.
This game is not bad. But in this game genre, there have been already many very good games, and Frostpunk could not reach that point in my opinion.",1702051075,1702051075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The presentation is solid. It does a great job setting the theme of survival in a world that wants you dead. Every person is named and you can see them walking around the city. The music is top-notch too. The [spoiler]final storm event[/spoiler] wouldn't be as epic without the music. 

The cold is very oppressive which makes the game engaging. Resources are limited. It forces you act pragmatically instead of always doing the right thing, reminds me so much of Pathologic. You might have to send little Timmy to the coal piles if you want to survive the night. 

The game loses its magic after learning the best effective strategies. If your city isn't struggling, you're playing on 3x speed, or you start min-maxing, it might be time to put the game down (some people like it, not me). The engagement comes from barely scraping by, probably why people suggest to go in blind.

Frost Punk is hella good compared to them all. It's unique and interesting and while the building and resource management is familiar, its all done in a unique and interesting way.

My favorite and at the same time least favorite mechanic of the game (Lol) is managing hope and discontent. I didn't watch any tutorials and didn't even find the tutorials until my 3rd play through (the previous 2 play through I failed miserably and my city froze too death and I was also kicked out of my city for sucking at management lol)

the 3rd time I started to get a feel for managing each crisis as it came and prioritizing needs appropriately.

But, in the end I beat it!

No seriously, I plunged my city into religious dictatorship and there's no coming back from that.

The bulk of the gameplay consists of scenarios: cities with a unique set of problems, a story to follow and a set end point. While the overarching goal in every scenario is ultimately survival, there are plenty of unique challenges separating them to keep you on your toes. There's also an endless mode scrapping the idea of an end goal and letting you keep going for as long as you can.

The game never lets you rest on your laurels, throwing new challenges at you with each day that passes. You must meet the demands of your citizens while balancing a delicate web of resources and responsibilities. A mix of both long term planning and on-the-spot decision making means that you're rarely left sitting with nothing to do. As time goes on your settlement becomes more advanced but the world outside becomes increasingly hostile and the swelling population makes both material and social requirements tougher to meet. If things ever seem to be going well, chances are that's about to change - or it already has and you just haven't realised it.

The experience is complemented by great visuals and an arresting soundtrack that changes and ramps up to fit the situation at hand. At its most intense moments where your food and fuel stores are about to run dry, your population's discontent is about to boil over and the cold threatens to paralyse your city's fragile infrastructure, the orchestra swells and Frostpunk is untouchable.

My only real complaints come from a UI that doesn't quite convey all I need it to, when I need it to. It can sometimes feel a bit clunky managing your city's workforce, especially when needing to micromanage where people spend their time to balance resources. I would appreciate blanket commands so that I could do things like open or shut down all of a given type of workplace with a single button, or press another to fill all vacant workplace slots with whichever idle workers are on-hand.

I wholeheartedly recommend Frostpunk to anyone looking for a city builder or survival game with more of a bite to it. It's tough and chaotic at times, but pulling through the tricky scenarios is uniquely satisfying and leaves you itching to return to do things better.",1701606977,1701786596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Death at every turn, until you understand the game mechanics and that the game pushes you into extreme positions to satisfy two mutually exclusive meters, your towns hope and discontent. The music was the best part for me personally, but I really do not like how limited you are in this game, it's more like a puzzle than a city builder, and the puzzle is easily solved if you've ever played a resource management game. I did enjoy my time, albeit short, I'd say it was worth $5 but not much more than that.

The end game is suspenseful, there's a good deal of buildup warning you of some trial to come, however it also ends abruptly and it doesn't evolve the game in any way, it was for me, having done everything possible prior to said event that was even possible to do, like watching a film, there was zero, zilch, nada, that I could do about the event, once it came except for just watch, which is disappointing. I was hoping there was more afterwards at least but the game ends there and like I said, abruptly.

The city building is fun and while it is freaking PUNISHING at first, once you get a hang of the mechanics it does a good job of hitting the sweet spot between being intuitive while still making you feel like you have to do everything with urgency.

However... the writing. Oh my good golly gosh, the writing. I am going to be laughing about it for a while. First of all - why exactly did we move NORTH from LONDON in an attempt to survive the GLOBAL ICE AGE? You know it gets colder the further you move from the equator, right? And it only gets worse from there. Highlights include:
-People in the last outpost on earth threatening to riot over 12 hr shifts
-Plummeting temperatures causing people to demand that they not have to mine coal anymore
-The game chastising me at the end over my nefarious deeds of... posting propaganda fliers
-People pissing and moaning about having to eat soup. Apparently the apocalypse is no excuse for subpar cuisine
-And more!

Literally all of this is purely writing error - you can just change the flavor text and not touch the mechanics and it'll still make total sense, but as it is, you will occasionally find yourself getting frustrated trying to manage the prissiest apocalypse survivors you've ever seen. Oh, and the game will still tell you you're a big meanie-head at the end no matter what you do, so... no, FrostPunk, I'm not particularly sorry for what I did to survive.

I was hoping for some dark humour but it was just immediately depressing. I don't play games to be even more depressed than I already am, thank you very much. Also, the title screen had as much space devoted to shilling other 11 Bit projects & DLC (including a massive Frostpunk 2 banner) as it did for settings and stuff. It was a bit of a turn off really. If I invite you into my house and immediately start trying to get you to subscribe to things or sell you my handycrafts, you'd be a bit put off wouldn't you. Offer me a cup of tea or something first, y'know. 

Then I started a ""new home"" (this game's ""new game"") and gave it a go but it was just immediately miserable. I built two structures and my wood ran out (fnarr fnarr) and the tutorial (I assume that's what I was in - since there was no separate option) didn't really help me cope with that. So I destroyed a structure to get some wood back and built a road to my coal hut and then waited - then 28 people froze to death. All the time I was thinking that that this was very reminiscent of another high production value / graphically appealing yet ultimately shallow game that I played years ago - Anomaly: Warzone Earth - and when I checked, it was the same devs. So I could see what was ahead of me here and chose not to get invested. They seem to make games for older casual gamers that wish their old Amiga games had modern graphics. It's all shiny shiny but I'm not fooled by that anymore. I have developed a reasonably reliable sixth sense when my time's going to be needlessly and monotonously wasted with scant intellectual stimulation (and let's face it, that's what you want from this type of game since it's not exactly testing your reflexes and situational awareness is it) - I don't think I'll be missing anything revelatory here.

Frostpunk is an [b][i]incredibly[/i] atmoshperic[/b] game. If there's one word to describe it, one aspect that's beyond phenomenal, then it's the [i]atmoshpere[/i].

In Frostpunk, you will most likely start with the scenario and as such be in charge of helping your people survive the end of the world. The winter has come, it's as deadly as feared and it doesn't seem to end. In these conditions, it's your mission to keep a small village alive and help humanity survive.

This game is [i]tense[/i] in all the right ways. The soundtrack is simply [b]incredible[/b]. Very fittingly, the violins will embark you in a [b]chilly[/b] shivers inducing stress and fear. The time is running out, as are any other ressources, and the cold just keeps getting colder. 

People keep dying left and right and those that manage to survive will have to be kept well fed, medically treated, housed, motivated, obedient - and it's your job to do that, all the while you've got your hands full with managing shifts to meet deadlines, signing laws, running patrols, exploring the area, studying new tech and most importantly building, expanding and repairing a huge generator that is your only hope to survive.

It's a beautiful game and a very unique city builder. There is a free mode/unlimited scenario in Frostpunk, but it's main charme is definitely the story and the DLCs expanding it. The scenarios are challenging, you will most definitely fail, quite a few times. Each time will leave you motivated, having learned to prioritize better, progressing you not only in the story but also as a player. 

Frostpunk is extremely immersive and dark, cold, long, stressful, sometimes anxiety-inducing - it's the [i]perfect[/i] cuity builder and survival / strategy game for an apocalyptic scenario.

For instance:
I had an >80% plus bar for hope and a <10% for discontent, I thought ""Hey, I'm doing OK. Not great, but OK."" (I was running thin on resources, trying to manage hope and discontent). Then, literally out of nowhere (not because of a choice I made, or anything else), a man walks into town, spreads the rumor about a city going down, dies, and suddenly I have a 50% full discontent bar, a <10% hope bar, and half my city threatening to go back to London. 

I didn't DO anything to prompt it; I had built a beacon forever ago. A scouting party had returned 4 days prior, and I was just minding my own business. But It wanted to make me contend with The Londoners, which felt really cheap, because it STOLE my hope bar. If I had gotten to chose a method of rumor suppression, or it had directly come from my scouting party returning with bad news, or if it had only been a HIT to my hope bar (not a complete reversal of it), it would've felt way better than just to have it randomly stolen because the game decided it should.
It felt so incredibly arbitrary; it wasn't as if it was a killing blow to a weakened city, or even just testing a city, it just decided that I was now a weakened city so I would have to deal with the Londoners, and waste my careful attempts to maintain hope and discontent.

The game inspires a lot, showing that much is possible if you have a strong will, no matter the obstacles on your way. Personally it inspired me to change a lot in my life and way of thinking.

In the beginning I noted the fascinating soundtrack of the game. It is made the best way it could've been done. The music makes you feel the ambience of the events Frostpunk revolves around just like another real reality. The voice acting in scenarios is wonderful and surprisingly artistic, however, I wish there was more voice acting.

The only thing I would really argue about is the way the game takes ""easy"" ""medium"" ""hard"" and ""extreme"" difficulties. If you think that when you easily finished the scenario on ""easy"" difficulty then ""medium"" difficulty should be just a bit harder, you'd be wrong. The differences between difficulties are humongous, making it very tough to practice and learn the new tactics of gameplay and citybuilding without any additional guides.

323190,152497709,76561198118433883,0,44,290,0,290,1594053748,"Frostpunk, developed by 11 bit studios, delivers a unique and emotionally charged city-building and survival experience set in a frozen, post-apocalyptic world. Released in 2018, the game challenges players to lead a group of survivors in the last city on Earth as they contend with the bitter cold, scarce resources, and the moral quandaries inherent in desperate times.

The standout feature of Frostpunk is its atmospheric and chilling setting. The game's visual design and art direction effectively convey the desolation and frigid temperatures of a world gripped by an eternal winter. The attention to detail in the frozen landscapes, steampunk-inspired architecture, and the subtle shifts in weather create a hauntingly beautiful backdrop for the city-building struggle.

Frostpunk's core gameplay revolves around managing a city generator, balancing resources, and ensuring the survival of its citizens. The unique twist is the reliance on a central heat source to stave off the deadly cold, with players facing critical decisions such as resource allocation, law enforcement, and managing discontent among the populace. The depth of strategy required to maintain both hope and order in the face of overwhelming challenges adds a layer of complexity that sets Frostpunk apart.

The narrative unfolds through a series of events and scenarios, with players grappling with moral dilemmas that impact the city's direction. The branching storylines and consequences for player decisions contribute to a sense of agency, making each playthrough a dynamic and engaging experience. The emotional weight of choices and the impact on the city's inhabitants create a connection between players and the virtual society they are striving to protect.

The sound design in Frostpunk plays a pivotal role in enhancing the overall atmosphere. The haunting music, the crunch of snow underfoot, and the distant howls of wind contribute to a sense of isolation and urgency. The audio cues effectively convey the struggle for survival and the constant battle against the elements.

While Frostpunk excels in many aspects, it's not without its challenges. Some players may find the difficulty level to be quite unforgiving, especially in the later stages of the game. The learning curve can be steep, and mastering the intricacies of resource management and city planning requires patience and strategic thinking.

In conclusion, Frostpunk is a masterfully crafted city-building and survival game that stands out for its unique setting, challenging gameplay, and morally complex decision-making. The blend of atmospheric visuals, strategic depth, and emotional storytelling creates an immersive experience that is both grueling and deeply satisfying. For players seeking a gripping and thought-provoking journey into the frozen unknown, Frostpunk offers a memorable and impactful gaming experience.",1701239725,1701239725,True,1,0,0.499679684638977051,0,True,False,False

Developed by 11 bit studios, the game combines city-building elements with a unique twist—the struggle for survival in a frozen wasteland.

Set in an alternate 19th-century timeline, where a new Ice Age has enveloped the Earth, Frostpunk challenges players to establish and maintain the last city on Earth. The gameplay centers around managing the city's resources, maintaining a delicate balance between coal for heat, food supplies, and the well-being of the citizens. The core mechanic revolves around the use of massive heat generators to stave off the bone-chilling cold, as temperatures drop drastically, posing an ever-present threat to the population.

One of the game's standout features is its morally challenging decision-making system. Players are often forced to make tough choices that can have profound effects on the citizens' morale, hope, and overall survival. The narrative is driven by a series of challenging scenarios, each presenting its own set of dilemmas and pushing the player's moral compass to the limit. The consequences of these decisions are thoughtfully woven into the storyline, creating a sense of emotional investment in the well-being of the city and its inhabitants.

Visually, Frostpunk is stunning. The frost-covered landscapes, steampunk-inspired architecture, and the constant struggle against the icy elements are depicted with a level of detail that adds to the overall immersive experience. The game's haunting soundtrack complements the atmosphere, intensifying the sense of desperation and isolation.

While Frostpunk's difficulty can be quite challenging, especially for newcomers to the city-building genre, the game's learning curve is well-structured, guiding players through the mechanics gradually. The replay value is enhanced by different scenarios and customizable difficulty levels, encouraging players to experiment with various strategies to ensure the survival of their society.

In summary, Frostpunk is a compelling and emotionally charged experience that successfully blends city-building mechanics with a harsh survival setting. Its unique premise, challenging decisions, and immersive atmosphere make it a standout title in the strategy genre, offering a refreshing take on the post-apocalyptic theme. Whether you're a fan of city-building games or looking for a thought-provoking and challenging gaming experience, Frostpunk is well worth your time.",1636142657,1700995376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then, Terry Pratchett's books opened a portal to a fantastical realm, introducing me to the captivating genre of steampunk. ""Frostpunk,"" with its chilling narrative and steampunk aesthetic, not only fulfills childhood dreams of technological marvels but also poses the intriguing question: What if our world had developed solely on the power of steam?

The game's graphics, ambient sounds, and enveloping darkness skillfully transport players into a world where frosty winds bite and the relentless cold seeps into your bones. The visual and auditory elements in ""Frostpunk"" effectively convey the harsh realities of a society struggling against the elements, creating an immersive experience that resonates on a visceral level.

What sets ""Frostpunk"" apart is its ability to make you feel the biting cold and truly empathize with the citizens under your care. The emotional connection to the plight of the people turns decision-making into a deeply personal struggle. Every choice you make has consequences, and the weight of responsibility for the survival of your society makes the game a poignant exploration of morality in the face of adversity.

The steampunk aesthetic isn't just a backdrop; it's a crucial element that shapes the game's mechanics and narrative. The ""What if"" scenario of a world powered solely by steam unfolds before you, offering a unique perspective on technological development. This distinctive approach to world-building adds layers of complexity, making each playthrough a fresh and intellectually stimulating experience.

As a gamer, the challenge presented by ""Frostpunk"" is both exhilarating and rewarding. The game doesn't spoon-feed success; it demands effort, strategy, and critical thinking. This refusal to hand everything on a plate adds a layer of satisfaction to every triumph and imbues each setback with a lesson to be learned.

The developers of ""Frostpunk"" have achieved something remarkable in creating an addictive game that effortlessly draws players into its icy embrace. Creating an immersive world is no easy feat, but the combination of atmospheric design, compelling narrative, and strategic gameplay has resulted in a truly outstanding experience.

""Frostpunk"" is not just a game; it's a journey into a steampunk-infused winter wasteland that challenges your mind and tugs at your heart. It successfully melds childhood dreams of technological wonders with the captivating allure of steampunk, all while delivering an emotionally charged gaming experience that leaves a lasting impression.

This game adds a flavor of morality to each decision you make and makes you feel like you're not only managing resources, but also lives. There are almost no easy decisions and I feel like I am making one prickly decision after another in the name of survival, power, or benevolence. The path to winning is never straightforward and even when you complete each scenario, you're forced to recount your path to victory and reflect... did anyone really ""win""?

Speaking of games like Red Alert, this game has an absolutely incredible soundtrack that is every bit as enjoyable as the gameplay and worth mentioning in its own right. It hits the right notes (pun intended) and sets the perfect mood for the weight of this game and its setting.

Frostpunk keeps me coming back for more icy punishment. I've just completed all of the scenarios including the DLC scenarios and I am still hooked to come back and try my hand at the Endless Mode and Survivalist difficulty of the scenarios. This is the type of game where it's very easy to get sucked into helping your frozen town survive and then you look up at the clock and you realize hours have melted away.

Update: 2023/11/10
Would like to add that if your going to play beyond just the story missions and go for the various achievements. Learn to play with a iron fist on what your population is doing.

Some science'y aspects of the game might not make sense but hey were humans we make stupid things work, especially in extreme situations.

Don't change job positions unless node is emptied and gone or you absolutely have to until after end of shift. Especially early on in run. Early on in runs it can be good idea to pull all workers from gathering posts/sources and then just before shift starts reassign based on most needed resources.

Food Soup vs saw dust. Well both work but one makes more and you can always heal people. Discontent and hope are both resources use them. Dismantle and pause dismantling kitchens to stop people form eating when they should be working. Then cancel when you want to let them or need to make food so they don't die from starvation.

You can abuse overtime shifts, by starting then removing everyone from building and reassigning them back a few 3-4hrs later, to try an avoid deaths early on in runs.",1695883848,1699662098,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The thing I like about management sims, is reading the tech tree, planning out your long-term strategy, and gradually seeing it come to fruition. That's not how you're 'meant' to be playing Frostpunk. In the campaign, you're going to be suckerpunched by events that you cannot anticipate. You cannot read future tech in the tech tree, so if you take the wrong approach, there's not much you can do but reload a save and try again. That said once you learn the beats of the campaign, it becomes much easier to succeed. So it ends up feeling like the Dark Souls of management: it feels punishing until you repeat a trial and error loop and figure out an approach that works. 
This War Of Mine was similar, but the 'unfairness' of that game fit into its theme: war is hell, and if you're caught in the middle of it your survival is often a matter of luck. But the setting here is not at all real-world, and so it kinds of blunts the experience to reloading a save and knowing what you have to do to survive the next story beat because you peeked at how the next chapter starts. 
Apart from that, the mechanics are solid, visual design is great, and I generally like how you never really feel like you're on top of things, which is appropriate in an icy apocalypse.",1699569097,1699569097,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

323190,66387951,76561198200206278,0,9,2738,0,539,1699222037," I purchased this game during the cold snap in 2021. But the premise of the game made me viscerally angry. It was just too depressing. It was so promising too! Great graphics, beautiful wintry landscapes, and steampunk-styled technology. 
But I spent money on it, so the other day I decided to reinstall it and give it another try.
The premise of the game is that you're in a world that is getting increasingly colder, and you have to keep your citizens alive by any means possible. Everything you know and vaguely tolerate in a society simulation is here. With simulation games, it's always a careful balance between keeping your people fed and safe, and exploring new technologies that will make their lives better. In this case, you're doing what they actually need to survive, which doesn't always allow for their comfort and happiness.
Your goal is to make sure your citizens survive the coming cold. It's not easy to do that without resorting to inhumane tactics. It gives you plenty of opportunities to treat your citizens cruelly. All sorts of moral dilemmas are presented. But if you choose to help your citizens and treat them fairly, you'll be better off in the long run. Your city performs better when the citizens are optimistic. The game charts your progress and vulnerabilities based upon the mix of Despair and Hope at the bottom of the screen - when you show the citizens that you care about their well-being, it increases hope. 
Or, you can choose to go down a darker path of child labor, adding sawdust to the food, and forcing your citizens to work double shifts. If you keep the kids in jobs that are not dangerous, like the Cookhouse, it at least keeps them safe and warm. As long as your Hope levels are above your Despair levels, the citizens will do what you want. If you have 0% Hope, you lose the game.
The structure of this game resembles Civilization, but it's more limited. Instead of enemies to fight, there's the ever-present cold and dropping temperatures. Resource gathering is limited to five things. You can build around the inner ring next to the Generator and eventually will get the technology to heat individual buildings. You'll be researching many of your builds, so like Civilization it will be a careful choice of which technologies to research first. There's also exploration, which will bring more citizens, technology and supplies to your city.
One absolutely useless but beautiful feature of the game is that you can customize your view, so that there are more ice crystals and soot on the lens you're seeing the game through. All the menus and splash screens are well-done visualizations and the graphics are superb. This game looks wonderfully grunged and lived-in.
Do I recommend this game? If you like harsh environmental sims where you have to keep your citizens alive against overwhelming odds, this is the game for you. I found it very difficult to play, partly because I have empathy for fictional video-game characters. And I really hate being cold.  I started over several times, trying to find the right balance between keeping the citizens happy and researching new technology.. The morality is far more nuanced than I originally gave it credit for. And the visuals, of course, are fantastic.

In general, this game is rather challenging, even on ""easier"" settings. Random events are quite demanding, and can easily derail the city on first playthroughs. Tutorial could be better, many aspects are not clear by simply reading the info provided, and the initial mission is already tricky. The city planning aspect does improve as the city grows, but the game focuses more on resource balancing, using random events to unbalance your plans. The graphics are quite solid, but the color scheme is a bit drab, though this is expected given the scenario. 
I'm actually changing my review since after giving it some more time and thought, the game ends up as a bit boring. The stressful bits are not rewarding, and feels more like ""figure out the right build order"" than a city planner.

My only complaint is that in endless mode, after you get around 650 citizens, you stop finding survivors.  After you find 20 steam cores, they become basically impossible to find as well. These are confirmed to be limited by the time. I had enough coal and food to last a month, and plenty of housing with about 3/4 of the map available to build yet. But I had no way to get more citizens. Gives you no intensive to play. Very frustrating. Not sure if they limit it for technical reason, but I have a fairly modest PC and get 100fps with 650 people.

The gameplay is quite fun, being one of those games you can binge a couple times whenever you're in the mood for it. It did take me a couple hours to set up the keyboard and controller controls in a more convenient layout though. 

It has some pretty neat additions to the typical city builder, incorporating features reminiscent of strategy games like Civilization. For example employing scouts to explore and gain loot from nearby locations on the map, and a tech tree. The theme is rebuilding civilization in some kind of new ice age, so rediscovering/building technologies to unlock higher tiers of buildings rather than just population milestones is a logical implementation for this game. 

The law book has that Civ feel to it too, but it works basically the same as the ordinance/law system in a typical city builder. It has all of the other features of a city builder as well. While some city builders implement a grid for laying out the buildings, this game employs a circular grid around the main heat source. Which would serve as another cool immersive feature if the balance wasn't broken.


After completing the main campaign I've experienced enough that I can say for sure that the game has some serious balancing issues. The heating lamps one can build along the streets between buildings are OP, and to balance that it seems the devs amped up the weather difficulty to ridiculous extremes. To be specific: 1 heating lamp has the same power with about as large of range as the massive heat generator that the game is entirely designed around the concept of building your town around, and the power automatically scales up in the heating lamps to match the main generator power upon it being upgraded.

Additionally the range upgrades on the main generator are separate, and multiplicative of the fuel consumption rather than incremental like the power upgrades. Making it dramatically devastating to city development (guaranteed game ending) if you attempt to build the city in the way the tutorial prompts you to. Meaning there is only one way the game can be played for city development without being instantly wiped out by weather, which is to completely ignore the main premise of building around the central heat generator, avoid its range upgrades, and focus solely on heat upgrades, placing heat lamps, and for the -80°C to -150°C you'll also need all of the building insulation and heater upgrades. 

The heat lamps are very cheap to build, cost significantly less fuel to run than the increase in cost for generator range upgrades, and they sit on the roads between buildings. So they do not take up any space, and they don't even block movement or anything when people pass through them. It will always be several times more useful and cost effective to simply build heat lamps around the place (building around the heat lamps), and detrimental to try to support range upgrades on the main heat generator. Making the circular grid centered at the main heat generator just annoying, with needing to destroy and rebuild sections of the town when connecting them with heat lamps between them. 

The first time I continued my starting game I got a couple massive drops in temperature (from -40°C to -100°C) while still in the early game that made it impossible to do anything. Workers won't work if their workplace is too cold, or they get sick because their homes are too cold. Because I'd been following the tutorial suggestions and building around it with range upgrades everyone instantly became sick and stopped working. Ultimately forcing me to start the game over from the beginning, save file seemingly inaccessible after Game Over. 

On my second play through of the main campaign I used what I'd learned of how the mechanics work from the first, and I was in the mid-game by the time I made it to where I lost last time. I got to the unlimited resource deposits before I'd grown the town any, so I needed the heat lamps for the mines and realized how OP they were. This time I realized it didn't even matter what state your town is in, because I had 0 on my discontent meter and 100% on my hope meter with every building still comfortably heated after the massive drop in temperature, no one hungry or sick, and my hope was still set to 0 and discontent to 50%+ by the triggered story event. Therefore the only way to not lose instantly from scenario design is to have done everything perfectly so that your progress can slowly recover from there. Which is a terribly weak scenario design in my opinion. 

There are several other scenarios as well as an ""endless"" game mode though. So perhaps some of the other scenarios will be better, and the Endless Mode is probably more like what I expect in this kind of game. I have the complete edition though, and much of that is bonus content that may not be in the base game. Still I'd say it's a decently fun game, and I'd recommend it at maybe $10 for the complete edition. If it isn't on sale, there are probably other games your money would be better spent on.",1697303403,1697438097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The worst thing is that there is no mod support. That would be the only way for me to make this game a little easier for me so I can at least play again. But the developer blocks mod support.

Because I love city building combined with survival, but its hard to find a good game that balances the two.

Everything you do has an impact on something else. 
I love a good challenge and Frostpunk really gives me that. 
I've spent over 170 hours on this game because every level of difficulty makes it a whole different challenge:
You can play on easy if you just wanna build and balance. And you can play on hard or worse if you really wanna persue a goal. 
The game can be so challenging that you have to start over multiple times a night. Miraculously never getting tired of trying again and again.

And no we can't afford to give more food for child [strike]slaves[/strike] workers.

This game is great. You start with a few people and a nice comfortable temperature of minus 20°C. You start nice, send your workers to start gathering coal and wood, maybe build a few houses so they don't freeze to death in their sleep. After a few minutes, the game mentions that you could really use some extra hands and suggests to open the place where you can sign new laws. And whats the easiest way to get some additional workers? That's right, put children to work in safe jobs. Later, you notice that you made a promise to heat all homes to a livable temperature but you don't have enough coal to actually keep your promise. So how about we sign a law about extended work shifts so we can get a bit more coal before the night starts? And food is running out so why don't we stretch it a bit by adding sawdust to the food? Later on you have some gravely ill people (possibly due to that sawdust) and you need to decide if we amputate them or just keep them alive while wasting valuable medical spots. And thus the slow but steady descent into a very grim dystopia begins possibly ending with you killing revolting workers because they didn't like your decisions. Or you could be the nicest leader of them all and everyone ends up dying of starvation. Or you're actually competent and manage to keep everyone alive, while only passing laws that aren't that bad.

Cons
→ very simplistic for a city-building sim, lacks depth 
→ locks players into specific play-styles with little to no variability between them. Multiple playthroughs become tedious and repetitive right out the gate.
→ You're told this is the last surviving bastion of humanity, but you've been given a bunch of people who would have already succumbed to this kind of reality/environment given their level of intelligence and overall temperament.
→ Complete lack of dual+ monitor support. 
... windows key is disabled in game regardless of your personal settings, removing the option of using the built-in Windows solution to this kind of issue
... launch commands that would have gotten around this are disabled 
... game client resets program's screen position whenever you change resolution in windowed mode
→ game locks your refresh rate to 50-75Hz
→ text is REALLY small on anything less than 1920 x 1080
→ windowed mode locks your mouse into the program, forcing you to still have to alt+tab.
→ you're given absolutely no ability to change UI or text size

i am sick of retrying the same scenario over and over again only to fail in ways I do not understand. This game does an absolutely crap job of explaining itself. People are dying of cold when i have heaters built everywhere. I can't seem to view who died, where, or why. (How does one fix a heating problem without knowing which people are cold?)

I have asked for help here before and doing what people said only opened up more problems. I still cant make it past a week in the game. I have no idea what this beacon they want me to build is. There isnt enough people to get enough materials to build enough shit to keep enough people alive. I don't get it.

I am no stranger to difficult games but a difficult game needs to explain itself. Instead this game punishes you for not knowing what it doesn't tell you. I feel no motivation to try again when I don't understand why i failed or what I was even supposed to do. I only just found out there is a hidden difficulty setting, which should definitely be the first thing you're presented with when starting a new game.

This game is unlike any other city builder. This game is art. I've never experienced anything like it. The people who made this game started with a goal: to portray hope, hopelessness, desperation, and resignation in the face of a slow freezing death. They wanted to portray a story of humanity's desperate attempt to use technology and determination to save itself from the cold. They wanted the player to realize the weight of their decisions when it is too late to change them. They wanted the player to sit uneasy in the calm before the storm, only able to hope that they have done enough. Then, they meticulously crafted every aspect of the game to meet this goal. Every single element works together in harmony. The music, the sound design, the visuals, the writing, the story progression, and the game-play all work together. Nothing feels out of place, everything has a clear purpose and adds something to this overall singular feeling: desperate resignation. All games are technically art, but this game feels like it was made to do more than be fun and make money. It was made from the heart, a cold heart.

Balancing resources, managing happiness, citizens complaining, the decay of your morality, downward spiral, distract them with alcohol, brainwash them, it gets colder, downward spiral, make their children work, it gets colder, round up the non believers, it gets colder, leave the children behind, downward spiral, it gets colder, spend lives to save the coal mines, it gets colder, ice crystals form in you're lungs, it gets colder, your tears freeze your eyes shut, it gets colder, the air is ripped from your lungs, it gets colder, still ever colder.

The visuals are very good and the music and sound effects are phenomenal. 

As far as downsides, it is true there isn't a ton of replay value for the average person. After beating all the scenarios on normal the closest you'll get to a fresh experience is playing on hard or survivor difficulty, which are a genuinely difficult (though not unfair) test of your knowledge of the game mechanics. Endless mode can be fun initially but you eventually reach a point where you've capped out on population, taken up all your land, and have such a strong economy that you cannot possibly lose.

Plugging holes left and right is very engaging, there’s always something to do, a path to choose, a law to decree.

The industrial steampunk city in the midst of the eternal winter of the north is visually pleasing, fun and simple to build thanks to its circular grid system and easy to keep track of due to its rather tidy user interface.

You’re constantly being forced to make hard and very impactful decisions, it truly feels like the fate of the city is in your hands. A city builder very much after my tastes.

I especially love how its complexity is drip-fed slowly, at precisely the correct pace, and nearly every variable (including heat) can be understood either intuitively or with just a modicum of effort.  Well made and immersive.

My only knock against it is that Frostpunk can feel oddly ""small"" for a city-builder.  If someone looked over your shoulder 2 hrs vs. 5 hrs into a scenario, they could be forgiven for not seeing much difference.  There ARE differences, of course, but Frostpunk doesn't feature a prominent burgeoning grandeur that is often a draw within this genre.  The spatial elements of city-building are minimized.  The game isn't small, really - there's a fair bit of depth to explore in the various systems and scenarios - but if you're looking for a playground sandbox of post-apocalyptic creation, this isn't it.  Each scenario is a puzzle, and while there are slightly different approaches you can take to solving it, this isn't a game that allows for much meandering.",1693667540,1696538362,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

For the people who just wanna read, this game is amazing. It's something I never knew I wanted which made it stick to the little tacky board in my mind palace that is reserved for stuff I like to do on the annual. Mostly, literally the cozy micro management if not survival based struggle buses like ""Don't Starve"" and ""Dwarf Fortress"". However Frost Punk is also a herald for the streamlined and tailored experience that is not usually delivered from our AAA developers and their schemes to crowdfund- Early access fund - and monetize the menus of our would be beloved experiences. 

 Frost Punk is a classically structured game in every sense of the word. It has an intro cut scene which is frankly carried (beautifully) by the score. The SCORE is amazing! This sound track is awesome. Truly half of the experience. The design and graphics are such that you can't zoom in all the way to peoples faces but you can click on every individual citizen and know almost every minute detail about them. Each one with their own sad portrait of their cold blushing faces. The intro lets you know how apocalyptic things have gotten. a last stand of human beings aims to survive the harsh end times with a generator they have been tugging around. they settle a place and begin collection rubble garbage and abandoned wrecks of miscellaneous old world items and get to work re purposing them. 

As you begin managing what work is being done it becomes clear that in order to mitigate the chaos and despair of the bastion city of humanity you, the mayor, must adapt and lay down the law- literally. You are given a choice as soon as the first few days go by. Do children work or stay in a home? 
Which has lasting and sometimes unexpected consequences from then on which is not something you see in most other games. Some games change a single variable give you a boost in one thing but not another whilst Frost Punk will have you bumping into whole story branches that have been unlocked. Is there entertainment? What do you do with the dead? What about food supply management? How about we use kids to help in other ways? 

very soon you unlock a tech tree by building an engineers building and after that its sim city with motivation and that apocalyptic blessed soundtrack. The limitations given throughout the game make things incredibly interesting and managing expectations while also giving people hope and gauging how much you can get away with makes the game a remarkable experience from start to finish with a fantastic end state that wraps the whole experience up in just 5 or 6 hours. If you're looking to see how long you can survive the eternal winter then by all means go endless mode and test your skills. 

A final note on game design. This is one of the few games that I love because it respects my time. as an adult with things to do every day I love that I can finish a run rather quickly compared to some of those insanely huge games out there that think you want to live in them. I like these kinds of paced out games. It feels very much like having a solitary board game to play at home. I'm not so overwhelmed that I can't manage it for a half hour and I'm also not bored at all the entire run. Every event that takes place adds to the agency of the mayor character your playing. Failure itself feels very fun and has me smiling every time. 

If you're looking for something that wont suck your life away and still leaves you wanting to revisit it about once a year if not more often then I highly recommend this game. I would even go so far as to say that it is a must have and I haven't even played the DLCs but I am excited to get those soon this year and have a go at them.",1695929960,1695929960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: So I reviewed the game before finishing the main story scenario, and I have to say words really don't do it justice.

The game itself offers several ""scenarios"" with numerous diffiulties that adjust the way you play, primarily force you to be stricter and more ruthless with your people. Amazingly thematic game that has managed to pull me into the story quite a bit with its amazing soundtrack and story-telling pop-up windows.

A unique game in its own category, it's really hard to find anything that's wrong with the game for me personally. Only going into a great detail, where the game ultimately leads you down a narrow path of a strict tech and law order, in case you intend on playing on extreme or survivor difficulty. At that point you really cannot divert from a specific click, build, tech and law order.

Managed to play for 200 hours, played each scenario a few times on all the difficulties. Even for a single run of each of the scenarios, the game offers unique stories for each of these scenarios, which are all unique not just in story but also many other things. Most unique being The Last Autumn DLC that takes place before the apocalypse.

The idea has potential but seriously so many times you give orders or make decisions but they never get carried out by the st00pid AI. Not even sure how this is supposed to count as a strategy or survival game! I'm only glad that I didn't pay full price for it and purchased it when it went on sale. I would have been really upset had I paid full price for this kind of dullness.

EDIT: My previous negative comment is above but I'm giving this game a shaky positive review now and here's why: After several attempts I realized that this is Not a strategy game and as long as you continue to view it as a strategy game you will continue to lose. It's not about what you want to do with the map, it's what the AI (The people you have to ""save"") need. So in other words it's about managing things, and you have to anticipate these needs, for example if you know your scouts have found survivors and are sending them your way then you better build housing for these survivors before they arrive. Also, ignore some unnecessary upgrades in the beginning for the sake of upgrading your coal production cause you're gonna need a lot of heat. Yes, the developers are a bunch of sadists! A temperature of -150, are you kidding me?! Smh Oh and what survival is this when 2/3 of the population ends up dead no matter what you do! lol Anyway, if you keep this in mind: that it is a game about managing a situation that's already broken and that you're gonna lose most of your population anyway before you win then yes, you'll find some enjoyment and ""fun"" when you actually reach certain mile stones and eventually win. So yeah, there you have it! Could be improved but again here's a shaky like from me.

At the beginning, survival is a struggle and you'll most likely fail a few times until a proper strategy is formed. Even completing the first scenario feels impossible at first, especially with the discovery of 'The Storm'. Persevere, as is the indomitable human spirit that powers our city. No matter the cost, the City must live.

This game will allow you to make hard decisions. The beauty of this system is that as desperation sets in, these initially difficult decisions suddenly become easier to make. The City must thrive. Your cruelty and your kindness as a leader are in a constant battle, as is the discontent and hope of your city.

When all is said and done, you'll be presented a time lapse of your city, and a reminder of the decisions that was made along the way. The game won't judge you, but you certainly will.

There are additional scenarios as part of DLC, each one a new story of human will and the lengths we will go to survive. My favourite would be the Fall of Winterhome.

At its core, Frostpunk offers a captivating narrative that keeps you invested throughout the game. The backstory is set in an alternate 19th-century world where a catastrophic volcanic event has plunged the Earth into a new ice age. As the leader of the last city on Earth, your mission is to guide your citizens through the relentless cold, making tough decisions along the way. The morally complex choices you face are the heart of Frostpunk. This game excels at forcing you to confront the darkest corners of human nature.

The Generator is your lifeline. If you lose this or cannot fuel it, you doom all of Humanity to an agonizing and slow death. You must keep feeding coal to the heart of the city in order to keep your citizens from freezing to death. 

Frostpunk also excels in forcing players to confront moral dilemmas. Should you enact child labor laws to keep the generator running, or is it worth sacrificing the children's well-being for the greater good? These choices are not black and white, and the consequences are felt all throughout the game. The depth of these decisions adds layers of complexity and emotional weight to every playthrough. Your citizens react to each and every law you write.

You have the ability to become the all-mighty dictator of an highly-organized yet brainwashed society. Conversely, you can also become a God to your people and be worshiped devoutly, and any heretics of your rule shall be eradicated. Although these ideas seem promising, you will soon discover the true reality of being such an authoritarian leader or deity. You must decide whether you cross that line and plunge the remainder of Humanity into it's darkest era.

In conclusion, Frostpunk is a masterpiece of the indie gaming world. It combines a compelling narrative, stunning visuals, innovative gameplay mechanics, and morally complex decision-making to create an experience that is both challenging and emotionally resonant. If you're a fan of city-building games, survival challenges, or thought-provoking storytelling, Frostpunk is an absolute must-play. It's a game that will stay with you long after the snow has melted, leaving you pondering the moral choices you made and the lengths you went to for the survival of your city.",1694147268,1694147377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Frostpunk? More like ""Frost-chill-your-bones-to-the-core""! This game throws the rulebook out the window. Forget those city builders where everything's sunshine and rainbows – in Frostpunk, you're in a world that's colder than your ex's heart. And what's amazing is you can take it slow! No rush, just build your icy utopia at your own pace.

[h1]2. The Drama Hits You Like a Blizzard:[/h1]
Talk about the feels, my friends! Frostpunk's got this ""human drama"" thing down pat. I'm tellin' ya, when you see those polar bears attacking or a cave full of helpless folks, especially kids, it's enough to make you reach for the tissues. And as you get deeper into the game, the decisions get INTENSE, and the consequences? Well, let's just say it ain't all sunshine and ice cream.

[h1]3. Lore So Deep You'll Need a Shovel:[/h1]
The lore, folks, oh, the lore! If you're into diving headfirst into a game's story, Frostpunk's got you covered. There's lore galore here, with snippets and tidbits scattered all over the place. It's like putting together a puzzle, and when you finally connect the dots from all the DLCs and games, it's mind-blowing!

[h1]4. Music That'll Give You Chills:[/h1]
The music in Frostpunk is a whole other level of epic! I mean, when that storm finally hits in ""A New Home,"" you're gonna say, ""THAT MUSIC!"" It amps up the tension, it's spine-tingling, and it's just plain amazing. It's like having a front-row seat to an epic blockbuster.

[h1]5. Graphics as Stunning as a Winter Wonderland:[/h1]
And let's not forget how easy on the eyes this game is! The graphics are jaw-droppingly beautiful. The icy landscapes and cityscapes are so detailed you'll be glued to your screen. It's like playing in a winter wonderland, but with a dash of chilling survival.

In a nutshell, Frostpunk is a game that'll warm your heart (even in the cold) and give you a gaming experience like no other. Massive props to the developers for this masterpiece. I'm highly recommending it, and even after all those hours, I'm still coming back for more. And, my friends, I'm hyped as heck for Frostpunk 2! Can't wait to see what icy adventures await us next. Thanks for tuning in, and as always, stay frosty, my friends!",1694041346,1694041346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With Evil Genius 2, it was really easy overall. (I know its weird comparing this to Evil Genius but bear with me) In this game, you've got multiple aspects to control. Heat, Hunger, and Sickness. If even one of these things gets out of control, New London spirals out of control. It's an overall difficult game that is extremely fun and I would 100% recommend.  BUY IT.

BUT I figured it out:  to play this game, it's best to remember everything is out to get you:  the cold, starvation, the citizens, tech trees ?, the UI ??, and the developers ???.  I'll explain.

The cold is omnipresent and will require constant adjustment of heat provisions through micromanagement.  This seems stressful but don't worry, your citizens will get sick and die no matter what you do.  Dying is a best case scenario, actually:  you can end up with useless citizens through injury who drain your resources indefinitely before you get mid-game technology to do anything about it.  Yes, citizens will constantly be falling ill no matter what so you might as well start child labor ASAP so you can get work out of them before they inevitably keel over.  Don't feel bad--have you heard of Minecraft?  The children yearn for the mines.

If that isn't fun for you, to break things up, gameplay will be occasionally interrupted by insipid storytelling that amounts to ""Very human much sadge"".  Just a text popup about ""Marge lost her husband"" or ""Billy fell down while he was playing"".  It only leaves me asking myself things like ""Wow, what was Billy doing out of the coal mines?""  Oh, by the way, hope you didn't forget about your actual game micromanagement tasks after that pop up!  Whoops, too late, you forgot some heater button and three people are crippled by frostbite now.  

The citizens are actively working against you, don't kid yourself.  They are not your friends; they do not want to survive, they just hope to make you as miserable possible before they off themselves to make you lose.  Citizens will ask you for expensive improvements that will ruin your economy, but will get butthurt when you tell them ""no, I don't want to use up all of our vital limited resources"".  If that wasn't enough eventually they start organizing, convinced that they will be taking some portion of your city's supplies to return to the city they left during a big tearful intro scene.  ""YOU'RE F***ING JOKING.""  No sir, I am not.  Their big plan is to leave the city and walk ALL THE WAY BACK through the blizzard they can't even work 8 hours a day in.  Why am I stopping these people--hell I'll go with you to the land of milk and honey, it sounds amazing.  Too late, now they're revolting.  But here's a heartwarming story about a stuffed animal.  And six more people died while you were distracted by it.  Sucker.

Getting new technologies is a hateful exercise that never feels good.  You're going to either eat big up-front cost that may bring other upfront costs, be absolutely useless without other costly technologies, or triple resource costs for some niche marginal sidegrade.  Congratulations!  You can upgrade your giant coal consuming heat engine--it's now two or three times as expensive to operate.  Or better yet, you can spend resources to discover a building that costs resources to inefficiently farm resources.  Unfortunately, there's no technology to burn citizens alive in the furnace for making crackpot plans to hike 3000 miles in the snow on the tech tree.  I'd buy that one first every game.

Lastly, the UI really ties the game together, in that it's mostly for people that weren't loved as children and are hoping games will help them recapture that magic.  The game pings Help Tips when new game elements appear.  But then clicking on the prompt just brings you to the Help Menu.  It's as though they're telling you ""FINE YES IT'S A GIANT HEAT ENGINE FIGURE IT OUT, I'VE BEEN HOLDING YOUR HAND FOR WELL OVER 3 SECONDS ALREADY!"".  This strongly suggests that the people who made the Help Menus were probably tapped for modeling the citizens' sociopathic behavior as well.

If you were dumb enough to keep playing like me, you slowly discover sh*tty ""tricks"" that the developers programmed into the game.  For instance, your first mission is to get coal for the giant heat engine your people ""desperately"" need.  You rush to hook it up and get it pumping heat bc wow you're just a great guy.  Well, stupid, you don't actually need it at all during the day.  You're literally wasting coal completing the quest.  Surprise, you run into a coal bottleneck a few days later when the temperature plunges.  Now a bunch of your citizens get frostbite, are crippled, need a special building, and will no longer work.  F*** me to tears.

But knowing this, you can now play knowing the real secret:  this game is scripted linearly, with scripted events, scripted outcomes, and scripted gameplay.  The illusion of choice is simply a process of discovering inferior or deadly outcomes of incorrect choices.  Definitely play this if you didn't just flip to the end of Choose Your Own Adventure books as a child.  For everybody else, the ending is:  they all die.

You lead a group of people huddled around a big generator that creates heat. Workers, engineers and even children will have to make their contribution in order to survive.
I've never played a survival strategy before. There are no enemies, so your main problems will be the freezing temperature and lack of food. As expected, there are a number of buildings and upgrades that help you achieve your goal. The game is divided into several scenarios, with a common objective to survive 30 days (or so) in the freezing wilderness. The extra scenarios come from DLCs, but they don't really differ much from one another. Also, there is an endless survival mode.
While the game captures the atmosphere of despair and self-sacrifice very well, it soon becomes repetitive and tedious. Everything revolves around having enough coal for the furnace or enough food for your workers. The first scenario is fun because everything is new, but all the subsequent ones are just more of the same. Scenarios tend to have unexpected story turns and need to be played in a try-mistake manner (something tragic happens out of the blue and you're not suitably prepared for it - tough luck, try playing the scenario from the beginning). The music and graphics are passable. The user interface could have been done better - I frequently find myself spending a minute or so while looking for a specific building or worker. The game seriously lacks depth, and basically you'll see everything it has to offer in the first scenario (which only lasts a couple of hours). I like the design of buildings and upgrades, but there are too few of those available.
Frostpunk has a good idea, but it is too short and shallow. Worth buying on a discount, but don't expect too much.

Insurgency: Sandstorm is a testament to the sheer satisfaction that comes from finely tuned weapon customization and diverse class options. As a fan of tactical shooters, I've found this game to be a refreshing and immersive experience that delivers on its promises of realism, strategic gameplay, and exceptional customization.

The weapon customization system in Insurgency: Sandstorm is nothing short of remarkable. The level of detail and depth in tailoring weapons to your playstyle is a delight for anyone who revels in personalizing their loadout. The plethora of attachments, scopes, grips, and skins allow for a level of fine-tuning that's not just cosmetic, but genuinely impactful on your in-game performance.

But where the game truly shines is its class system. Each class feels unique and offers distinct advantages and limitations, promoting team-based cooperation and strategic diversity. Whether you're taking on the role of a Rifleman, a Medic, or a Demolitions expert, the game's balance and attention to class-specific abilities create an environment where each player's contribution feels vital.

The immersive nature of Insurgency: Sandstorm's gameplay can't be overstated. The combination of realistic visuals, sound design, and attention to detail in weapon handling creates an atmosphere that pulls you right into the heart of intense firefights. The way bullet physics, cover mechanics, and team coordination come together makes for an experience that is both thrilling and demanding.

The only slight downside is that, while the weapon customization and class diversity are exceptional, the learning curve can be steep for newcomers. This can lead to a frustrating experience for those unfamiliar with tactical shooters. However, with patience and practice, the depth of the gameplay becomes more accessible and rewarding.

In summary, Insurgency: Sandstorm is a tactical masterpiece that excels in weapon customization and class variety. The level of detail and strategic depth in both these aspects makes for a satisfying and immersive gameplay experience. While it may pose a challenge for newcomers, the payoff for those willing to invest the time is an unparalleled level of satisfaction and a tactical shooter that stands among the best in the genre.",1692790412,1692790412,True,1,1,0.444145113229751587,0,True,False,False

And not just great, we're talking AWESOME-level awesomeness. It's like you opened a box of cereal expecting a free toy and instead found a tiny, perfectly cooked steak – unexpected and deliciously satisfying.

But wait, there's more! This city-building game has a twist that's as refreshing as sipping an ice-cold lemonade in a desert – you're not just crafting buildings, you're battling the cold. It's like becoming a city planner and meteorologist all at once. ""Today's forecast: chilly with a chance of resource management.""

And let's talk quests – it's like this game sat through a thousand ""quest committee"" meetings and decided, ""You know what? Let's just keep it simple."" It's like the game designers are the Zen masters of questing, leading you down a path of straightforward warmth management rather than a labyrinth of confusion.

Keeping everyone warm becomes your Everest, your ultimate challenge, and your life's mission – it's like you're a winter fashion guru, making sure your pixelated citizens are cozy and stylish. ""No, Greg, those mittens don't match your scarf – start over.""

The pros list is longer than a CVS receipt – gameplay, graphics, story, perks, events, user-friendly interface, and a mechanic for materials that's simpler than explaining the plot of a soap opera to your cat.

And here's the grand finale – this game is SO different, it's like your eccentric neighbor who has a pet llama and hosts yoga classes for squirrels. It's so refreshing, it's like a splash of cold water on a scorching day – you didn't know you needed it until it hit you.

So grab your thermals, channel your inner city planner-slash-meteorologist, and prepare to embark on a journey that's not just gaming, but an epic saga of keeping your virtual citizens snug as a bug in a digital rug. Winter is coming, and it's about to get pixel-perfectly cozy!",1543150428,1692210952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very unforgiving, very dark and bleak. You will lose the first handful of playthroughs, but it's incredibly addicting once you get the hang of it. It's not a city builder, even if you are technically building a city - it's more of a resource management game.

Also there's a lot of allegories to some of the darkest moments in European history. I don't think anybody outside of Poland could have made such a brilliantly bleak game and have it still be fun.

I especially commend the 'Last Autumn' DLC for its wonderful game-ification of the Soviet perversion of Marxist ideals. That's something you'd never see from an American game studio.",1692153608,1692153608,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game leaned heavily into aesthetics and immersion at the expense of gameplay and content.  In my opinion, it actually pays off... the first time.  It did immerse me.  The choices the game presented were brutal and nerve wracking.  The min-maxing was fun.  Then you finish the first campaign and realize that's all the game has to offer, and that the devs want you to spend more money on their DLC.

Pros:
* Aesthetic.  Vibes.  Setting. This game had a vision and successfully delivers on an alternate, dystopian steampunk ambience.
* Looks good, particularly the lighting.  This comes at the price of performance, though.
* Story is more compelling than most strategy games.  I did actually want to survive the storm for reasons beyond just 'beating the game'

Cons
* Mediocre gameplay.  It isn't bad.  It is serviceable.  The real innovation to this game is the aesthetics, so if that doesn't interest you, you probably won't like it.
* Very poorly optimized. This is the worst performing city builder / strategy game I've ever played.  Wouldn't run on my original PC at all and I had to refund it.  I got a new monster pc at a later date and tried it again and it runs fine.  Installed it on a macbook pro while on vacation (was surprised its even available on mac) and the frame rate is abysmal and input lag makes it unplayable.  
* Threadbare content / low replay value.  This game has nothing to offer beyond the main story.  Side scenarios are shorter, easier, less interesting versions of main story - no new laws, buildings, or any functional changes to gameplay.   Main scenario takes maybe 10 hours.  You can squeeze a bit more out of it if you replay it at higher difficulties for achievements, which is what I did.

Ripped away from the world and casted into frozen hell, stranded and hungry, with only marvel of the passed age standing between you and ruthless cold. Soundtrack is great and it has few gems like ""The city must survive"". Mechanics add to it, with diseases, discontent, hope and so on. It feels as if you were struggling to survive - at least at the beginning.

At it's core it seems to be really cramped city builder with huge focus on survival mechanics and with no real potential for sandbox playing - which itself isn't a flaw in design. Gameplay revolves around specific scenarios with specific problems and challenges that move story forward. Finished scenario usually leaves little to no space left for buildings in the city.

But to the point - the gameplay. There is always the most optimal way to play a specific scenario. For convenience let's imagine it as a curve. We'll call it the A curve. It contains all decisions player undertakes during the game. Here, depending on difficulty level, is a certain distance you can derive from the A curve [in given direction] during your game and still win (survive). If you will go beyond this treshold - you won't be able to succeed. For the standard difficulty the ""tunnel"" around the A curve that marks how forgiving the game is is quite wide. The problem is that at maximum difficulty it shrinks to the size of fiber-optic cable. You basically have to find out where exactly the A curve is (the hard way) and then follow it meticulously until the very end.

What I want to portray here is that the game doesn't give you many ways of solving complicated problems if you want to be challenged. You have to know the scenario and know exactly what to do and what events are going to appear and when. So the game rewards you for being a seer, not for reacting best you can to unexpected. 
The example with the curve is somewhat simplified, and there may be actually even few of those. The point still stands - you have to find this exact path of maximum efficiency and stick to it.

Design of the city itself affects those curves slightly at best. What I mean is that the efficiency of our colony can be only marginally increased by well designed city outlay. The projecting side of the game is not really impactful, and the outcome of the scenario depends generally on how many specific buildings we have if anything, not where those are located.

There are also some other minor problems with gameplay, but it's whatever at this point.

In terms of lore it makes very little sense that the generators are capable of sustaining cities of only around 800 inhabitants each, especially given what it took to build them (building a generator is probably the most interesting scenario btw, it's in dlc though). Also bri'ish larping pagans because of natural disaster is as believable as fallout lore. I understand that much can be said and expected from them, but this is beyond ridiculous.


In the end, we get a game that could have been good, if development was more focused on city-sim side of the game, with more gameplay flexibility. What we've got is quite annoying survival simulator with city builder elements within it.",1683320885,1691518501,False,3,0,0.471252143383026123,6,True,False,False

Waste of a great premise. There are some parts of the execution of this game that are spot on and it has great aesthetics and some cool ideas, it's often briefly REALLY fun to play which is why it stings more that the difficulty is almost unplayable and the games makes very minimal attempts to be accessible to a new player. You have to learn the hard way how to survive on even the lowest difficulties and most of the creative possibilities of a city builder are lost to invariable challenge. Worse the game tends to waste your time buy causing you to die because you're not ready to meet objectives you didn't know were coming, forcing you to replay hours of scenarios even when you have the skills to complete them.

I was all set to change my ""would never recommend"" rating after finally completing the first scenario on easy  difficulty. Watching the timelapse of my city, which I had nurtured and lovingly guided through the many huge challenges of the scenario to ultimate success felt  so fulfilling.... then I was dumped into the menu screen. Thre was no way to actually play and enjoy the city I had built. It was over just as I was about to start having fun. I would give this game somewhere between minus 30 and minus 120 stars out of 10. Fuck this shitty game.

Also the game aggressively advertises its DLC and sequel at you while you're in the game menu. Hey, marketing tip! If you want to get me to buy Frostpunk 2, the time I am LEAST likely to do that, is when I've been playing Frostpunk 1!

Game gets just about good if you add -devconsole to steam launch arguments, start an endless scenario on the most forgiving map press backtick and type ShowDebugButtonsPanel, that way you have some buttons to hit every time you almost die from stupid shit. That means you get to play the game long enough to get the hang of how it works, rather than dying too fast to learn anything from your mistakes.

I actually unlocked almost all of my achievements without cheats once I'd gotten good at the game, but first impressions count so I still rate the game poorly. If I hadn't had cheats I would never have had a good enough time to warrant continuing, or had the practice to build up those skills,  so the intended play experience is worse than garbage.",1689613291,1691072408,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Let's talk about the good:
It's interesting.
It's clever.
It's fun...when you're not annoyed at it.

Let's talk about the bad:
1. The game has the ability to show how much time is left on your quest.  But fails to do so for some quests.  This leaves you with the misunderstanding on other quests that you aren't running out of time unless you deliberately go to that quest and verify if there's a time limit on it or not.  The fact that it doesn't show the time when the game has the capability is VERY irritating.
2. The game will deliberately slow the clock down every morning.  You almost never want the clock to slow down in the morning.
3. You can't set slowdowns for your own items.  Gathering post out of things to do?  You get a tiny alert on the left which quickly vanishes.
4. The alerts you receive for interesting/actionable/important items are too difficult to hear when playing the game at low volume.  And the same deep boom sound is played for non-actionable items, making it very confusing when you hear the 'new thing' sound but there's nothing to do.
5. Visual indicators for alerts can be on the left side of the screen, the bottom of the screen, the right side of the screen, or even not displayed at all on the screen!  The game effectively forces you to stay centered on your city at maximum zoom out so you don't miss stuff.
6. The game likes to tell you about things you already know about.  For example, a new tech tree opened up and I started researching it.  Three seconds later, a concerned citizen informed me about the new tech tree.  Wow, thanks, game. :(
7. The Winterhome scenario shows an extra slot for outposts.  You can't use it.  I messed with that spot several times, only to find out that it's reserved for a specific building that unlocks later.  Not cool.
8. Of all the complaints, this next one is probably the one that ticks me off the most.  The game uses what I call 'Witcher' logic.  If you haven't played The Witcher, that game is known for giving you choices...that don't matter.  And all the choices are wrong.  FrostPunk gives you tools to help keep your citizens happy.  And then berates you for using those tools on the closing credits of the map.
9. Finally, there are four storyline maps and 7 'endless' maps that come with the core program.  That's a good deal if you paid under $7 like I did.  But how many people got this game for that price?  Btw, no multiplayer.  Just an fyi.",1690615533,1690871382,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

They are a reflection of the ethical dilemmas and moral choices that define us as a society. The decisions you make are not merely strategic moves, but moral quandaries that question the very nature of humanity. Do you sacrifice a few for the survival of many? Do you uphold human dignity at the risk of extinction? These are questions that transcend the digital realm of Frostpunk and resonate deeply with our real-world ethical dilemmas.

The game's narrative is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving a tale of desperation, hope, and resilience. The characters are not mere pixels on a screen, but embodiments of human spirit, each with their own stories, dreams, and fears. They are a mirror to our own selves, reflecting our strengths, our flaws, and our capacity to hope even in the face of despair.

Frostpunk is a testament to the power of video games as a medium for philosophical and ethical exploration. It is a game that does not shy away from asking difficult questions, challenging our preconceived notions, and pushing us to reflect on our own values.

The hope system is broken. All the hope modifiers are temporary except the authoritarian ones. You can make a utopia where no one has ever died, and all the work is done by automatons but still get overthrown because a storm is coming. Apparently, an inbound storm caused my people to lose all hope despite having survived others and having plenty of food and coal stockpiled. The game forces you to become an authoritarian and then tries to morally grandstand you. The main campaign also fails to differentiate between passed and utilized polices. For example, if you pass the soup policy but never serve soup, the endgame will say your people suffered with watery soup. This is especially frustrating because some onerous policies in the tree have to be unlocked to access gentler policies. (emergency 24hr shift -> longer workday)

The are also some graphics bugs. The overlay for a freeze/thaw gets off to the side a lot. It makes an otherwise impressive effect look cheap.

Frostpunk, a survival-themed city builder, has proved itself to be more than just a game; it's an engaging narrative that presents a challenge while also providing a sense of personal connection. This game has managed to offer an impeccable blend of strategic difficulty and a user-friendly tool-set, something not many titles can balance perfectly.

One of the aspects I truly admired about this game was its challenge curve. Initial impressions might suggest that the difficulty ramps up too swiftly, but upon immersing myself deeper, I discovered a beautifully calibrated progression. The increase in difficulty was strategic and deliberate, keeping my city from sinking into a static state of complacency and constantly propelling me toward new objectives and achievements.

Frostpunk brilliantly avoids the need for a min-maxing approach, which is an often tedious requirement in similar genre games. The game provides the freedom to strategize based on your preferred style, whether min-maxing or a more casual approach.

Graphically, the game is an absolute treat. The portrayal of the icy landscapes and the individuality infused into each entity is commendable. The attention to detail in each character, structure, and scenario helps bring the game world to life in a very tangible and immersive way.

Perhaps the most striking feature of Frostpunk is its ability to personalize the gaming experience. The city's survival weighs on your shoulders, and the game does an outstanding job of communicating this responsibility. I remember the first time I lost the game; it was a punch in the gut. Frostpunk has this unique ability to make you care, make each decision matter, and make you feel like your city's survival genuinely hinges on your actions.

In conclusion, Frostpunk is a gem in the survival/city builder genre, offering a compelling mix of strategic challenge and player agency. It truly makes you feel responsible for your city, each decision, and the fate of your citizens. Whether you're a veteran of the genre or new to city-building survival games, Frostpunk provides an experience that is captivating, challenging, and deeply personal.",1690061425,1690061425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However  outside of the main campaign a lot of the mechanics don't seem to mesh well  ( note even with how many hours I have I haven't played every single mode through)For example  the last autumn’s  generator construction is a really unique idea  but even on easy juggling generator construction and well-being of your workers tends to be too much. If you focus on generator construction motivation plummets and discontent skyrockets, if you try and focus on motivation and safety  you get fired on day 15 for missing  your deadline.This wouldn't be so hard  if one of the more frustrating elements of the game wasn't as prominent which is  simply put scuffed situations: most of the time I quit a campaign solely because it would be a waste of time to reach the bad end  because You will often do everything right in  and still lose. And while other games do have this  prevalent as well, the main issue is this conflicts on one of the earliest advice you get in the main campaign  which is “  just solve problems your way it's fine”  and quite a few campaigns this is awful advice especially on higher difficulties  you usually need to go in with a battle plan in the back of your head in order to win some scenarios, and if you're not smart enough to do that on your own well time to start searching up a  campaign guides and do everything by a strict rule book.The other  large problem I have is a few campaigns feel like an afterthought ( obviously they weren't a literal after thought they would look  and feel a lot worse if they were)  but what I mean by that is  campaigns like the arcs last  45 minutes  to an hour tops will simultaneously not giving you enough time to really do anything or experiment with the cool scenario  as well as endless  Builders scenario  has the blood of two different scenarios that mesh horribly  and create a lot of scenarios where you  end up overflowing with discontent and /or  sick and dead people.Finally some laws just don't seem worth it due to their counterparts just being better in most if not all scenarios, for instance  Child Carehouses  and child workers would be a bigger decision  if it weren't for the Apprentice  boost you get from The Care House branch  along with the morale boost you get normally,Same with cemetery/body disposal  paths  well a bit more even than the former  Cemetery tends to be the better option because of it giving you  a permanent way to deal with dead bodies and not adding another building you have to manage and work around ( take this one  with a grain of salt because I haven't tried out Oregon transplants for a campaign). 

Despite my negativity I think this is an amazing game  but  the mechanics  tend to clash and be unforgiving for wrong reasons often  if you're not someone who's very into city builders the gameplay won't be  very fair And expect more out of you than you can possibly do even on easy.So if the atmosphere doesn't somehow bring you in then there's unfortunately nothing in the gameplay for you.

The game distinguishes itself from others in its genre thanks to the original way it combines city-building, resource management, and moral judgment.
The weight of your decisions becomes apparent as you guide a group of survivors in a frozen post-apocalyptic world, influencing both the health of your civilization and the morale of your inhabitants.

As you observe the frantic struggle for existence amid the freezing environment, the immersive experience is further enhanced by the eerily gorgeous images and ambient sound design. The realistic and pressing atmosphere is a result of the game's attention to detail and its dynamic weather engine.

The gameplay mechanics of Frostpunk are expertly designed, and they force players to properly balance resources, build effective infrastructure, and oversee the psychological and physical requirements of their population. The game's depth and intricacy guarantee a satisfying and stimulating experience.

High replay value is provided by the narrative-driven and deliberately planned situations, which encourage players to experiment with various approaches and deal with a variety of difficulties. The game's capacity to arouse feelings, such as hopelessness and triumph, only serves to emphasize how excellent it is.

The developers' dedication to the game's community is also admirable. The experience has been improved and expanded upon through frequent updates, maintaining the game interesting and new.

Frostpunk receives a stellar grade of 9.5/10 for being a wonderful work of survival gaming art. With its gripping gameplay, fascinating graphics, and difficult decision-making, it proves the value of storytelling in video games. If you appreciate survival simulations or are looking for a challenging and riveting gaming experience, Frostpunk is a game that you just must try.",1687374435,1689577904,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Frostpunk is a good game, but if you already know you dislike city builders, this probably wont be the one to shake you from that position. 

Frostpunk carries with it the cardinal sin most city builders carry with them: No matter what else the game does, it fundamentally struggles with presenting you with anything interesting after you've completed it once. Frostpunk does alleviate this somewhat with diverging choices in the game but most of them are poorly explored and boil down to, ""Do I want everyone to become a religious fanatic or a fascist?"" The setting is poorly leveraged beyond, ""Extreme situations drive humans to extreme ideas"" and the game itself doesn't really change much. You still have the same overall goals, the means you achieve them with are still the same except your choices provide very slight opportunities for variation. Every single event in the game is virtually guaranteed with few or no exceptions, most results are of little consequence. 

As a result the game presents a lot of 'telling' and not much of that 'showing.' Allowing children to work in, say, a coal mine never runs the risk of a general strike. If you pursue the path of religious fanaticism you'll never find yourself in a position where the faithful find your own faith lacking. If you encourage proto-fascism, you never face any consequences for it other than that, maybe, one person dies of a hunger strike. 

As a result of that, this game does have a problem where once it becomes a SOLVED game, it becomes decidedly boring. Which is a shame, because everything else about the game is great. The setting is inventive, the art and sound direction are great and when and where it manages to get you invested, it's fantastic. But then you find yourself on the other side of those challenges and realize there wasn't much to it. And there's no new challenges for the game to provide. So instead it has to lean on scenarios that only slightly off-set the challenges.",1689565016,1689565016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Once you have come out of it, looked it up online to figure out how to solve the adjacent to road problem, and come across some very uptight fans, you will find a sort of puzzle game with a story, where you are slotting and making laws to make your unhappy and cold population as happy as possible.  It has a maleness about it in terms of the lack of intuition involved in living in a freezing crater.
I am going to say yes it is worth its money and worth playing, however it has already established itself as not a good personal choice due to the very high irritation factor and lack of flexibility.
If you are an uncreative, slightly grumpy gamer this one is definitely for you, however if you are more interested in the occasional cheery moment and being clever about solving problems, probably don't.

First playthrough I got absolutely devastated within a few days since I wasn't quick enough to secure sources of coal and food.

I have 0 food rations stockpiled currently and I need 1900+ lmfao.

Honestly, I hate this game. It's frankly awful, and the fact that half the content is locked behind DLCs (for example, can't do free-build without buying the DLCs), and on top of that, there are blatant advertisements for Frostpunk 2 right as you start the game, before you even get to the main menu, is just stupid.

Also, this game is absolutely difficult, and not in a good way. I don't get how so many people praise it when even at its easiest difficulty it feels like a stress-inducing chore with very little replayability. I like the idea of it, but I hate the actual execution.

Start the campaign, try to gather some wood and coal far away from town center while also trying to build houses and a medical tent so the people would stop complaining, wood runs out, dismantle the gathering post, still not enough wood to build another one, cue rapid collapse, and game over in 20 minutes. You have to do things in a very specific order. There's no room for error, at all. There's no freedom to play the game your way.

- It was pretty hard to lose.
- Wish there was some attempt to understand why it is so cold. It could always be a mystery. But towards the end, we had a lot of engineers with free time and a technology level that includes robots.

It ilustrates how difficult being a leader. A beautiful game. When ideal math, art, philosophy, ethics put together, you get Frostpunk.

First things first of all that changed city builders is that it the danger is real. You can feel oppresing atmosphere as you play, the changes in temepeature, the feeling is dread, huge amount of shit being thrown at you everyday. 

To be honest this what makes this game great, you undestand what is going on, you neeed morality to either stay human or survive. There is no in between, Morality in this game isn't some kind strange thing like being called good or bad on some arbitrary grounds. 

But something that is real, you can and will understand the needed changes in city because you may needed, and it is known that you are in danger constantly. This is not your Anno or Banished. Sure in Banished they are some problems with winter and food, but you can mitgate it easily, here you have tools, but half of these tools are expensive, you cannot trade ( in main game) you are islolated and you know there is no help. 

You either survive or die, and if you die there is only one way the cold. The workers in this game are also important, while haveing names help them one bark from few of them and the eve of new day helps you undestand

Here you can see, when people is out of resources, you will resort to the superstitious power, blind faith and unethical decisions. Being a leader, thgere is no right or wrong, only responsibility.

Goal is to survive 48 days in the cold and make it through end-game final ""storm"". Had to restart it a few times because I failed and got lovely ""Your Time Has Come"" message from my population. You have to manage heat, resources, food, health and also Discontent & Hope which are governed by actions or decisions you take as leader. Also send scouts out to explore and gather other survivors and ""steam cores"" which can't be crafted/made. Game doesn't last very long once you know how to play it and what is important to focus on (coal). I think I had less than 18 hours with it. Each replay makes you go back through scripted sequences and initial challenges so that gets a bit old, but they've added new features and challenges which I have not played yet. Graphics are good with the animations and artwork. Voice acting and voice prompts are good. Building is limited to circular/radial patterns around the central generator. Not a huge issue and you can decide what to put where. Upgrade trees are present for different technologies and then a set of ""laws"" you can enact that effect Discontent and Hope. Enact a law regarding health and some hope may rise, but discontent may also rise. Tell them to let a kid die in the cold and hope will fall, but discontent may fall. Lots of variables. The only thing I didn't like is that there's a time-scale button to increase game timing half or double speed (something like that). If you click double speed - which you'll have to do or just sit there waiting for hours - sometimes your Hope or Discontent will spike and you'll lose before you can address the issue. There were a few times when all was well (good Hope and low Discontent) and when I clicked the speed-up time, it suddenly notified me ""Your Time Has Come"" which is the game's message that you've failed. Units can also only ""work"" or ""upgrade"" during daylight hours although they will build and hunt during the night.

Cons: - Not many scenarios available (even with DLCs). After 50h of gameplay, I found myself wanting more, but sadly without anything left to do other than replay the scenarios at higher difficulties or chasing the steam achievements.

- Scenarios are linear. Once you play it, you know what will happen, and can prepare beforehand in choosing your decisions regarding certain events.

I do like it when a game keeps me on my toes. However in this one, you are always in a disadvantage in every step of the way. 
Which is fine at first, but further in the game you're doing nothing but trouble shoot and react instead of acting. 
Then for no reasons somehow a building has no workers, though you didn't put the workers elsewhere. You notice that when you are getting out of ressources.
Then there's always the demand to heat the living quarters. But when you place a heater right in front of the building it won't do nothing.
After reloading it magically works and the homes are heated properly, still you broke your promise and people loose hope.
Also to find the one cold home is like trying to find the needle in a pile of snow.
The developers really should fix those bugs.
I'm aware that this is a hardcore city builder, but there should be more options to react on the problems than the two obvious and definetly not the best solutions.

If you like to play games like Anno, Tropico, or Cliff Empire, this game won't give you the satisfaction to see the fruits of your creation. Instead it only demands more and more.",1688889795,1688891905,False,1,0,0.460207581520080566,0,True,False,False

The initial playthroughs are brutal, exacting, and unforgiving, demanding you to truly understand and acclimate to the frigid world you inhabit.

The expertly composed music and sound effects heighten the experience, imbuing a palpable sense of grim realism. You can almost feel the oppressive weight of existence in this frozen wasteland, each note and sound adding layers of depth to the stark reality that this game portrays.

The decisions you are faced with are as profound as they are unnerving. They are substantial, fraught with moral ambiguities, showcasing the clear thought and meticulous planning that went into the development of Frostpunk.

Yet be forewarned: Frostpunk is a game that seldom allows for a pristine sense of triumph. The decisions you're compelled to make to ensure survival are often shrouded in ethical gray areas. So, even as you persevere, the actions taken to achieve such 'victories' leave an indelible mark on your conscience, akin to a stain that won't wash off. Survival here doesn't always taste sweet; it’s more a grim acceptance of what you've had to do to secure it.",1688436443,1688436443,True,25,1,0.7026214599609375,0,True,False,False

TL;DR - Strong recommendation to play, visuals and gameplay have come together into brilliant release.

It has been quite for some time and 11 bit studios brought upon us challenging management problem - surviving and saving during deadly frost times, heat them, feed them, treat them. Help humanity withstand disastrous catastrophe never faced before.

It has been released long time ago, but probably someone will check out my review before Frostpunk 2 on the horizon. Here are my strong points of recommendations why the game is worth your time.
- If you fan of strategies, management, city-building, etc just buy and enjoy, it will not feel like any other game before
- Challenging, across multiple stories you will need to face different victory conditions, some of them are not easy to fulfill from the first try of the game. It has a learning curve
- One more [strike]step[/strike] day gameplay.
- Visuals, they are definitely one of the topmost reasons. Steampunk setting of Victorian style English colony bring some of the best aesthetics in genre.
- Decent ""replayability"", I was not tired of the game through the hours I had spent on it. Would probably have spend even more but wanna check out other games from my library as well. Also sequel is coming so likely will spend time in it.

This is one of my favorite games ever. The atmosphere, lore, and visuals are all amazing. Gameplay is extremely addicting.

How far will you go to save your rule? How desperate are you to get your resources? What line will you cross to ensure survival? All choices are yours to make. 

Frostpunk has multiple scenarios you can play after beating the main one. My personal favorite being the tragedy that is the Fall of Winterhome. All scenarios tells different stories, each rich and builds on the lore of the universe you partake in.

It beats sandbox city-builders because there's something like a campaign instead of open ended nonsense where you have to decipher the game and entertain yourself.

Hur-dur child labour. Yeah, there is no government endorsed child labour, and it's illegal. But when things get going parents exploit the hell out of their children. I've spent all my childhood working potato fields, growing crops, stealing cow turds at nights, building the house, sorting and assembling ball pens, manually washing clothes, scrubbing homes and washing dishes, because parents assigned me such tasks to earn my share of food. This is not a game about first world democracy, this is survival. And people in live or die situations don't behave like extremely rich white people from usa.
If they can't self-provide and self-organize to the point of making you a scape-goat for their own inability to make any decisions, they should work better. If they want to die so much, well, let them. 

It can be a challenging game for people who love artificial self-imposed challenges more than common sense. Even if you make something stable, the next quest will intentionally just gift you like 90% hit to all the stats. The only winning move is not to play the game.

Frostpunk taught me that even when it seems impossible, there's always a way. You might need to adapt, and change. But you can always find a way to survive. The game is a brutal, brutal survival experience. I failed my first 5 or so play-throughs. But eventually I beat it. I survived. By the end, I didn't think I was gonna make it. The cold had simply frozen all of my food generating structures. The number of sick was growing rapidly, and I got worried. But then I stripped all of my frozen structures, and put my medical buildings as close to the heat as I could and I gave it all the heat I had to help heal my dying city. And then eventually, after painful, brutal, days... The sun came, and I survived. A game hasn't tested me like this in some time, I was determined to beat it though. Everything about it is excellent though, from the music to the artstyle to the concept. Some pop up decisions didn't really make sense to me though, like the game might give you three choices and it tells you the outcome of all three and for example, 2 might be negative outcomes and 1 is much more positive. I don't know why you'd choose any of the negative choices? Seems bizzare but it only happens a couple times. Other than that, the game is fun through and through.

considering the choices you get in the game between ""the right thing to do and outright eveil"" - I thought the theme was like the decades old citybuilder black & white, where you choose between good and evil. 

My first play through i made a good samiritan run, the second run was going to be an evil run. Quickly did i realize that its not a choice between good an evil, its actual moral dilemmas. Can our stockpiles of food sustain refuges or do i doom my citizen to starvation? Do I secretly fill up the food reserves with human meat or do we all starve to death.

neither is the ultimate ""laws"" of either religion or ""order"" the goal to achive, rather they are the result of a slippery slope where in the most desperate of times the temporary benefits of executing treasures elements in the city is has an aluring appeal.

The universe is very fascinating, based around the ""Year Without Summer."" The scenario(s) are interesting and interactive. You tend to take your decisions a little to personally, especially when messing up. Watching your little NPCs work to death in the arctic cold. When you screw up, you begin to learn and find out ways to improve. As a guy that HATES to do things twice, this game, I don't even give it a second thought. 

Very problem solving, critical thinking, and resource management based of survival game. Gotta think on your toes and prioritise, and get ahead of what is coming as best as you can. I without a doubt LOVE this game and cannot wait to try out Frost Punk 2!

I got this game once for free on epic, but solely the base game. After I played a bit the main scenario, I immediately bought it on steam as I wanted more of the game, and I don’t buy any games on epic.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
The idea is that you build a small city around a giant machine while managing heat and other resources. There are 4 Scenarios being usually around 2-4 hours in play time. They each have some unique twist to them. As an example, in one you have to horde masses amount of food and prepare houses as a slowly bigger storm of refugees arrive in a wave. In another one you have mostly to keep up the heat of seed vaults.
Buildings that are closer to the machine usually don’t need heating on their own so its good to build houses or medical stations there while buildings that are warm anyways  like workshops for research can be placed further away. 

Additionally from building heat sources, deciding which building to research next or build, you can have scouts that traverse a non-random map with resources, stories and other stuff to find. The difficulty in the game is usually with the scenarios main goal and additionally the heat will drop and rise but slowly being lower than before meaning old buildings may not retain liveable condition and needs to be heated or people will get sick or die.

There are also some political rules/choices you can make which can go into a fascist dictatorship or religious rule. Generally, the religious path is just way superior because they have better bonuses and do not require men all time to patrol the streets.

The game is played in a way that you barely can win on the normal difficulty if you don’t know what’s coming. As some have scripted scenarios that can lose your game if you didn’t quick save all time.  For me it was incredibly fun to try and build different approaches managing to finally beat a map and I feel like for that the main “normal” difficulty is a good challenge between not too hard and not too easy if you accept that you might need to retry once or twice. The higher difficulties on the other hand don’t feel that fun as they are feeling like a lot RNG based and on top of that you basically have to follow 1: 1 guide to beat them.
Overall if you beat everything you can also do an endless mode but for that the game wasn’t really programmed or at least mainly intended and balanced. Beating the scenarios is incredibly fun but its rather short lived as without DLC there are only 4 which u beat probably in around 10 hours. After that you can do miscellaneous achievements in case you want to continue playing but I found the game had way too many and some being repetitive like play a run without building a or building b etc. Or misleading ones as there are no death achievements despite the game featuring scripted deaths anyways.

[u]Story[/u]
I found the scenarios stories fun and engaging having various sudden plot twists and while also giving some smaller decisions. Overall really engaging and immersive having also some smaller lore info’s sprinkled into the loading screen as there are wide arrange of contrary opinions about the cold or they explain the reason why the game is even set at the artic.

[u]Sound[/u]
The game features heavily violins and generally orchestra music which also ends into a very heavy cascade in the finale of a scenario making the city must survive one of the best songs I have ever heard in any video game.
Also the general sound design is conveying the danger and threat of the barely habitable surroundings perfectly from its heavy on duty warning noises, to snow storms pillaging across the area.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Im always impressed with these base buildings games animation of diverse buildings and characters. Its fun to look around and see what kind of building does what. This doesn’t feature this a lot and is more focused on A LOT of images that have small animations adding its own style to them. This type of animation style always looks fantastic and is in the game almost everywhere to be seen and rarely these repeat.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I found the game very engaging due to its unique setting, great orchestra OST and fun gameplay that while not being too complex still is something rather unique with its heat management system. There are sadly only a few scenarios but those that exist are really good, wanting me to tackle them on higher difficulties albeit I found the higher difficulties more frustrating than fun. The endless mode isn’t really balanced that great and therefore my biggest critique is the rather short gameplay time. And me saying I want more of the game is more or less a good thing.

Unique and great city builder with addicting but not too complex gameplay.",1647452525,1687266737,True,50,1,0.794686853885650635,0,True,False,False

I am so glad I gave it a shot, yet somewhat regretful, because I have become so obsessed! This game is frustratingly difficult, I love it. Even if you think you have everything set up perfectly, it can all come crashing down within seconds, but it is so worth it when you finally reach the end of a scenario.
It's a city builder with resource management and harsh survivor mechanics. Each scenario sets you up a bit different, but beyond resources and labor, you need to also maintain Hope and Discontent levels of your people(for most scenarios at least). You can lead your people down a path of Faith or Order, hold religion over your people's heads or rule them with an iron fist. All of these needs are constantly battling for your attention, and you're never truly in an abundance of any needs being met. A decision you make early in the game, could be the reason for your downfall 5hrs into the game later.
This game has massive replayabilty, I usually never replay games but I can't stop redoing scenarios to achieve different results, not even to mention the variety of difficulty setting you can play with. The game is still worth it on its own, but the expansion does a really good job of changing it up while still feeling like the same game, making gameplay feel endless.

A city builder with a twist. It's fun, well written and absolutely leans into this crazy world of... frostpunk.
I love the main scenario, and a bunch of the other ones were also quite fun to attempt.
Small twists on what the game focused on in that scenario made for a genuinely interesting experience.

-> Immediately ran into a bug with 'The Last Autumn'. It felt more like it was just of an annoyance that I was there, and the addition of new materials already made me grow cross-eyed. It was okay, but I'm not a fan of having to restart again...
-> 'On the Edge' was okay, but it became very much an overworld management screen, rather than the Frostpunk I enjoyed. Very little city building, and much more concerns around choices, which would have been fine if the game changed to manage it better.

One of the best if not the best city-builders I've played in a while. The atmosphere and score really create the perfect environment for an addictive but punishing city-builder. The lore is just right to where not too much is revealed in the main game, but makes you wonder about a lot of things. This game is a perfect judge of character for anyone who might need that and is also a perfect resource-strategy builder. The challenging part of the game is really what makes it so good, the immersive-ness of the game makes you want to sympathize with the survivors, while also creating order and faith to keep the city running no matter what. The moral choice this game will have you make really stand it apart from other city builders, aside from the great score and graphic design.

It's an immersive and riveting campaign, full of hardship, stress, and triumph against all odds. You'll be faced with challenges that will make you think ""How can we possibly survive this? We're doomed!"" and then, as their leader, you have to find a way to pull through, no matter what. There's no other choice. You'll find yourself growing attached to your citizens, thinking that, after coming so far already, you can't give up. You'll be constantly wracked with uncertainty and fear of what could be next, but also full of the perseverance, grit, and determination to face it.

The mouse cursor is white and can be difficult to find in the predominantly white snowfields of the game.  The tutorials of the game consist of flash-cards indicating what to do, but does not adequately describe how to do it.  Need to send scouts to a city?  Make sure you select your scout team, even though you've only got one scout team and there is no warning that you need to do so.

While the graphics are brilliant, the design of the buildings is not.  A lot of them look identical from your top-down perspective and the only way to find a specific building is by scrolling through the GUI.  You also have no means of keeping track of how many buildings of a specific type you have.

The difficulty curve is best described as 'Dark Souls'.  Mere days into your run you are hit with devastating blizzards that can permanently send the temperature so low that buildings stop working and your citizenry start getting frostbite.  This cripples your ability to gather resources, which makes the citizens angry, who demand expensive action that costs resources you don't have.  Worse, the game does not really allow you to experiment and find solutions: you HAVE to know in advance the one true solution or you'll be kicked out -- and this is AFTER you rig the game to its easiest setting.  The game badly needs a sandbox mode where you can study its mechanics in peace, but it's not there.  The result is learned helplessness and rage-quit.

The narrative of the game is incredibly interesting, but it is presented poorly.  The opening prologue in story mode is beautiful, but it runs for too long without providing any desired insights.  Snippets of lore only come on the load screens, and too short to truly read and absorb.

I truly wish I could have enjoyed this game more, but the frustration I have while playing the game stop it from being fun.",1686094192,1686094192,False,27,6,0.48566243052482605,0,True,False,False

What a delight! What an absolute delight of a game. I played it, played it again, bought the DLC, and played those, too. Replaying each scenario to get the perfect ending was enjoyable, and hunting for the achievements was even more so. I only wish that there was more, such as a multiplayer option or further customization for your starting point (possibly allowing the player to see how much easier or harder it was for the settlements of Children's Mine, Hot Springs, or Shipwreck Camp).",1614788138,1684817189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Contrary to other strategic games such as [i] Sid Meier's Civilizations [/i] and [i] Heroes of Might and Magic [/i], there is absolutely no honor and glory in [i] Frostpunk [/i]. All there exists is the extreme level of responsibility imposed upon you to lead your people to survival in the extreme environments you are in; your success yesterday is easily forgotten and your failure today will be remembered with grudge and hatred. You will be threatened both by Mother Nature and your own people all the time, and nobody is there to soothe your pain, let alone save you.

The beauty of [i] Frostpunk [/i] is in that it goes to the extreme length to emphasize the price and burden of leadership. Typical strategic games promote the aesthetics of honor and glory in leadership, paying as little attention as possible to the weight of the crown. But [i] Frostpunk [/i] goes the other way and bring out to the surface how painful and agonizing it can be as a leader. There is seriously no time to feel entitled; Mother Nature keeps lashing on your back and the people you are supposed to protect keep complaining and protesting your rule. Sometimes you just want to quit, but at the same time, you know that someone has to do this or everyone including yourself will perish. No dream, no ambition, but sheer responsibility keeps you moving. This, I believe, is the crucial reality of leadership that modern day society has long ago forgotten and that [i] Frostpunk [/i] successfully reminds us of with its extreme premise. I'm very impressed by their delivery.

Overall, [i] Frostpunk [/i] feels more like an artwork than a video game. At a glance, it's a strategic game like [i] Sid Meier's Civilizations [/i], but [i] Frostpunk [/i] does not have enough contents to call itself as either 4x game or city builder game. It focuses more on its unique aesthetics stated above, and keeps throwing thought-provoking questions to you as you play through. Personally, this was a very refreshing, or even educational take for me. It feels like a classic literature on political science (ex. Machiavelli's 'The Prince', Plato's 'The Laws', etc.) in video game format. If you are also someone like me looking for realistic aesthetics of leadership, I can recommend this with confidence.

it's difficult, but restarting is always a joy. I have 140 hours played and have never finished the first mission. That might make me a bit of an edge case and weird, but at the same times it tells the story of how replayable and well thought out the mechanics are. Every single time before finishing the mission I think ""I could have done this or that a little better"", quit and restart.

Mechanics are well thought out. You know what is happening, and why it is happening. UI is great. Graphics are solid for the genre. Atmosphere, as well, is as good as it gets in this genre.

My only major criticism is that in some cases the game doesn't really make sure you know what you need to know when it comes to timed objectives. 9 times out of 10 when I fail to build something I promissed to build in time it wasn't because I couldn't have managed to do so, but because I simply forget.

Pros :
(+) the difficulty is always changes even you pick it on easy mode, start option is just like a decoration
(+) ""impactful"" events, bad choice not always lead to worst impact

cons :
(-) idk if it just me or what but there's no option to force time always keep it's speed times and not change it back to normal when ion 6am and 4pm, i know this option is helpful but it worst when you in sandbox endgame times 

Opinion :
The darksoul of city building, frostpunk is a game to someone enjoying colony management survivor but in hardmode, mostly 1 person die in colony will impact your mood / force restart.. but only in this game... a dead is statistic.... cant wait for frostpunk 2

In Frostpunk, you play as the ruler of a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic ice age. Your job is to build and manage a city that can withstand the freezing temperatures, while also keeping your citizens happy and healthy. It's like SimCity, but with more parkas.

And let me tell you, keeping these people warm is no easy task. You'll be juggling coal supplies, generator maintenance, and the occasional freak snowstorm. But don't worry, you're not alone! You'll have a team of trusty engineers to help you keep the city running smoothly.

But the real star of this game is the moral dilemmas. Do you sacrifice a few citizens to save the many? Do you institute child labor to keep the coal mines running? It's like playing the world's coldest game of Would You Rather.

Overall, Frostpunk is a chillingly good time. Just make sure you have a cup of hot cocoa on hand, because this game will make you feel like you're living in the middle of an eternal blizzard.

Compared with other survival city builders on the market you can get much better games which you will play for much longer. I’ve got vanilla Frostpunk and all DLCs for £10 and I feel it’s the alright price.

Pros:
- Fantastic soundtrack and arts
- Very unique game (especially when it was released)
- The first game is really really interesting and you will definitely feel like you should play once again with different choices
- If you are playing for the first time, it really feels like a survival game

Cons:
- In the first game, Frostpunk will try to create a feel of being a deeper game (from the story, choices and mechanisms perspective). It’s fantastic on the first run but on the second run, you realised how many things here are pre-scripted or are not changing that much when you will choose a different path.
- I failed to survive the last blizzard and I was excited to play the second time but the second run was just boring and didn’t bring any new to the game, so most of the time I setup on the max speed and pause the game when something was happening (research complicated, I need to send somewhere troops on the map, more coal etc).
- The main split in the law & order is when you need to choose one of the path: totalitarianism vs church. Yes, there are different laws between paths, different ways of governing the city and different buildings but in the end, it doesn’t feel like there is a bit of change between paths in the gameplay.
- If you finished your two first runs and you chose different law paths then the game will not offer you anything else. Each run can take 4-6 hours, so after 10 hours, you will see everything that the game can offer to you.
- My second run took 4 hours and I felt bored for most of the time. It was just copy-pasted gameplay from the first run for 90% of the time. The difference was with choosing law and different buildings which I could build.
- I thought when people will be more unhappy it will impact my city in some way but I couldn’t feel it at all. I couldn’t feel a difference between the 0% unhappy level and 60%. I never achieved more than 60% because it’s so easy to get it down to the bottom.
- I think the map (where you can send your troops) is pre-generated and there is no difference in the told story, numbers of getting materials, place of locations etc.
- You can get some resources per each found city per 1 day but in the end, I haven’t seen a point to get anything else than just steam cores. All other resources are available in your city and can be gathered much quicker.
- I got an automaton on my second run from the 3rd location on the map and from this point everything was going extremely smoothly. After getting the factory and the first 4 automatons to get busy in coal mines, I felt like I’m just cheating here.
- After the first two runs I known which technology is the most useful, which law is the most powerful and where to get the best resources from the map. At this point, you know the meta and there is absolutely no reason to change it during your next run.
- I haven’t finished any run for the DLC but I’ve opened each map and I’ve checked possible laws, technologies, locations and non of the DLC was interesting to play the 3rd time.
- Even if I will play every single scenario from vanilla and DLCs 3 times, it could be in total 40- 50 hours. It's still really low number if we will think it's a city builder. There are many other city builders which can start showing new mechanism at 50 hours gameplay and you can still discover new things. Here? It's total maximum which you can take of from this game.

Have very much enjoyed playing through the various difficulty setting of the game over time, its enjoyable because you start on normal difficulty and at least for me it kicked my ass and I only just scraped by the first scenario.
After playing through the various scenarios on normal and then eventually on hard I had learned enough about the game that normal mode was now too easy and it felt really good to get to that point. 
Now I am slowly working on completing the various survivor modes which are insanely hard and have had me fail so many times but even so I am having an absolute blast. Having to optimise my survivor runs to the max is making it so I am still learning new little things about how the game works even now.

Really excited for Frostpunk 2.

1. You'll notice almost immediately that the developers incorporated some weird splash effect on the windows and popups that reduce visibiliy, and increase wait time, and feels like a cheap alternative to using real graphics. This same ""cheap graphic design"" is also how I would describe the ""icing effect"" that covers the edges of the screen at nearly all times.

2. There is almost no replayability in this game. The choices do matter, because if you choose the wrong one you lose but not because there are multiple choices to win. The only major choice I could see having an impact on the campaign is whether you choose to side with order or whether you choose to side with religion but either way you're scouting the same locations, building the same structures for the same resources, and in the same order of operations or your settlement will die.

The complexity of the game isn't in that it provides choice but in the illusion of choice it describes well the benefits and detriments of each action. For $30? Pass. If you happen to find it on sale for $15 it's probably worth a few hours of your time.

EDIT:

I wanted to edit my review after playing the game again recently. The developers actually did listen to feedback and removed the intensity of the graphical splash effect! Better, the new DLC adds greater depth and longevity to the game. The best part is that even with all of the new content this game is now only $12.

The entire game (Minus expeditions) is set in a single location around which you will build your colony.  Within each variation, as far as I can tell, there's no variation as to what the landscape and the available resources will contain.  Don't take that to mean that there's no variety, there's plenty of it, it just comes in the form of the dynamic events that occur throughout the game as well as the expeditions you'll undertake.

There are five resources to find and utilize - coal, wood, steel, food and steam cores - and you have very little time to setup systems to obtain these resources at [i]least[/i] as fast as you're consuming them.  There's a somewhat invisible resource of heating, provided by your generator by way of expending coal, and this will be your life line in this post-apocalyptic land of frost.

As the game moves forward, you will be in a race against time to obtain what resources you need to keep your civilians alive in [i]that[/i] moment while also keeping more than just a little of your brain power on what they're going to need next.  And they will need more things and increasing amounts of them sooner than you'd think.

The resources present on the ground will run out in a matter of days, and you'll have to establish more permanent methods of harvesting the raw materials you need to stay afloat, as well as ways to heat everything during cold spells or you'll quickly become inundated with sick citizens who still need beds to sleep in and food to eat but won't be providing valuable manpower.

My main complaint about this game is that, within a scenario, there's basically no room for error.  If you don't meet a specific deadline for certain things - providing housing within the [i]first day [/i] for instance - then you will quickly be beyond recovery for that run, and you're left with limping along to an inevitable loss or just starting over.  But the thing is, that next run you'll fix that issue and then immediately be hit with another situation that you couldn't have foreseen without foreknowledge, fail again, and repeat this process ad nauseum.  

And yes, it's a survival game.  I get that failing and learning and trying again is what the game [i]is[/i].  But I feel like they should have made each critical point such that you have some time to adjust and correct course without outright failing.  Sometimes you can, but the vast majority of the time, if it's your first time seeing some critical event, you're almost certainly about to spin up a new game.

It seemed like nothing I was doing was happening fast enough to save my city from certain demise. That's when I realized, that's the point of the game. It's supposed to force you to choose the lesser of two evils and challenge your morality in the face of nigh unwinnable odds. The moment you start to think everything's going smoothly, a hundred refugees will turn up on your doorstep and you've gotta either have the infrastructure ready to receive them (and all the problems they will bring with them) or reluctantly turn them away to die in the wasteland.

To make it short, Earth has undergone an eternal winter and each day gets colder. You must build the city, which is surrounded by a large heat generator powered by coal, while maintaining the peoples needs and their ""Hope"" while making their ""discontent"" as low as possible. Certain actions can raise or lower either, too high discontent or too low hope and it's game over. You start the game with quite literally nothing but a few survivors and scattered resources, as you gather it allows you to start building more things like homes, medical outposts, and coal mines that are essential to maintaining warmth. Sometimes it seems like the people forget they're in a post apocalyptic wasteland and instead thing they're at a 5 star hotel as they'll consistently ask for things like better homes when you have no resources available, easier shifts when longer ones are more important at the moment because you're low on a lot of things. You can decline them for a time before they demand you do something at the cost of increasing discontent significantly should you do nothing. Usually you have a few days to keep your promise made to the people but should you not finish the project, or for whatever reason your people just don't build the damn houses in time it will impact your hope. And then there's the frustrating moment when you have too many buildings but not enough workers.

Despite these frustrating moments within the game, it's really fun and always keeps me coming back as each session you learn something new that you could've done better to ensure your people survive and the next session you survive a little bit longer.

It doesn't hold your hand and you absolutely will fail over and over. But that's the point. Its mean't to be hard. Don't give up if you fail, remember your mistakes and try again!

Some tips in no particular order;
- Keep tabs on your research, try to make sure you're always researching something as soon as the last is done.
- Do the same for laws. 
- Emergency shift is a life saver for research and resource production. Don't abuse it but at the same time, use it where you get the chance, preferably when you have low discontent. 
- Prioritise coal supplies, get coal mining ASAP and eventually have them be automated. 
- Do not ignore heating. Its critical. 
- Try to get the max cap scouts out when possible, this will greatly help you late game and do not forget to use outpost teams, the resources will be valuable.
- you can fast forward gameplay, 1 to default speed, 2 to medium, 3 to fastest. Much nicer using the keybinds. 

Overall amazing game, really enjoyable, its worth getting!

Arguably, 11 bit studios' greatest hit. Frostpunk is a fantastically immersive and fun game set in a world where frosts had overtaken the world, and humanity is at the brink of extinction. It is incredibly tense, and every day is a new challenge. Survival is a constant battle for resources, and to be effective one must think several steps ahead and prepare accordingly. 

It's a wonderfully unique game that does an excellent job at immersing you into the world with its visual presentation, music, general atmosphere, and gameplay loop, The gameplay consists of you collecting resources, researching new technology to help fight against the cold, and managing the morale of your people. The whole system runs like a well-oiled machine, and it can be quite unforgiving on higher difficulties. 

Even though there's not a lot to dislike about Frostpunk, there are still some things that it could've done better. The morale mechanic, for example, is not very fully developed, and you don't get any advantage or reward for maintaining high hope and discontent low. It's a missed opportunity to make the game more exciting and rewarding for players. On the same note, the two different governing styles that you get to unlock to help you govern the morale of your people aren't that hot, either. They both play quite similarly to one another, and picking whichever one is akin to choosing a new coat of paint; The only real difference between the two trees is their themes: Faith or Order. But arguably the worst thing about both of them is their final skills, which effectively makes the rest of the skills in their respective tree completely worthless. 

As a piece of advice for all potential Frostpunk buyers out there, don't purchase the game of the year edition. I repeat, do not buy it! There is a reason why each of them is rated so poorly, individually. It lacks effort, doesn't try to offer anything substantially new to the gameplay formula, and it's grossly overpriced for what they are actually offering. Trust me, you are 100% better off not buying the complete edition, The main game, as well as the three free scenarios, are more than enough to keep you busy and entertain. No need to shell out extra money. 

All in all, Frostpunk is a great game. While it may be a bit underdeveloped in some areas, I believe this is the case where the whole game was able to rise and be better than the parts of its sum. I had a wonderful time with Frostpunk, and I wouldn't hesitate even for a second recommending it to people I know.",1630563974,1681987226,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The aesthetic is cool and creative, and the style feels like a cross between managing a Victorian town and managing a moon base. FrostPunk is one of the better city builder/pop management games out there. Living through the storm without losing a soul is a good feeling.

This game is fairly hardcore which can be a plus or minus depending on the person, and the game expects you to quickly grasp the game mechanics in order to be successful. The difficulty settings are unforgiving and the game feels hard even at the default medium setting. The mechanics are not directly explained well but generally adhere to common sense. One of the most important things to know is if you build outside of heat zones you're going to have a really bad time. It's better for your people to be homeless and living near the generator than it is for them to have a home out in the cold, as the pops would apparently rather freeze to death in their homes rather than be warm but homeless. The game is very unforgiving about sending people into the cold, and if you send people to work in the freezing cold they will soon develop frostbite and die pretty much how people would in real life at those temperatures.

In my opinion some of the hazards are a little bit unbalanced especially for new players. It's not unusual for certain hazards to be worse than the storms themselves, and since they are RNG this can feel very frustrating especially at first. However, these features can add to replayability for more experienced or advanced players since the hazards pose a significant challenge.

Overall I'm glad I bought this game and recommend it to fans of survival or city-builder genres.",1681940153,1681940153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I only played the classic main story so far. So my reviews are based on that experience.
It's a very well made game, I haven't encountered any bug after 20 hours of playing, the visual is beautiful, and the art is very cool. The main campaign is packed with scripted events and DnD style encounters so there is no RNG involved, but it is nicely done, I was always on my toes and cautious with my first playthrough. The game is always pushing players to the edge without overdoing it at a normal difficulty.

Attempting to play the game's most casual mode, on the most casual map, just for a fun building experience without any intensity, I encountered a bug where every single night 10-15% of my population would take ill. Regardless of the difficulty settings, or the strategy I chose. Regardless of whether I carefully protected my people with heat or let them freeze. The result was always the same, not just repeatable but inevitable. This is a game-breaking bug, because there is no conceivable way to manage this illness rate: Even if you dedicate your whole educated population to battling sickness and ignore all other things you are supposed to manage, the illness overwhelms the whole settlement after a week or so. I did not experience this particular bug playing through the campaigns, only in the game's sandbox mode (called Endless).

Research is not only required, but necessary for success. Players must determine which items to research depending on the weather, desired play style, and need to acquire certain critical in-game resources.

I loved the absolutely punishing choices and un-winnable situations your past decisions placed you in. Restarting from scratch and applying new strategies was fun. Loosing was fun. I've played Dwarf Fortress... BTW.

As I drew closer to the most impossible of situations I applied every tactic I could and held firm. The sunlight was approaching, my people were all alive, our morals were unbroken(important), and I was about to see how this games developers handled such a challenging genre blend... 

The sunlight comes. The game faded away. Okay - so there might not be an unlimited play after the main campaign. WORDS! words on the screen! This looks like a recap! Just like the Harvest Moon style games. This is a fantastic way to end the game. The player activities triggers that fill out the variables that make up the end game story cards. This gives the players ownership of what they've achieved. Brilliant!

Or at least it would be if I knew who's game I was reading about. I never did any of this stuff. My rations were all full and hearty. My children went to daycare. My people had warm(mostly) beds and healthcare. What the hell it this end game triggered fromm~oh my God they had no(few) triggers... This is a good/bad ending. These developers had the potential to create a beautiful finale for an epic journey and instead they spat in my face. 

After all that complex & genius design - you fail here...

Now I am giving the game a thumbs down as the game is way to fucking hard.
Even on easy, one fuckup and boom, inevitable failure.
Place buildings a little wonky? Hidden deathtrap.
Made a wrong choice for laws? Welp, cant amendment that shit.
Made a upgrade to the reactor that drained all your coal in one night. Lol!
Don't complete a main story part fast enough? Welcome to hard mode, the people fucking hate you.
Cant find steam cores. Huh, that must suck. Good luck trying to build critical infrastructure! 
To compound that crap on top of the fucking weather getting worse is just the cherry on top. 

This game is for people who like city management with a healthy helping of constant stress and pre-pre-planning.Some people love the stress and high difficulty but I cant. It sucks I could not find fun in this game and genuinely felt like this was a wast of money.

	11 bit studios created a madly atmospheric game about survival against all odds. Player takes a role of a leader of one of the last settlements on earth. The Great Frost is coming and you have to prepare for freezing snowstorms. Each playthrough is a race against time, but ever-worsening weather conditions are not your only problem.
	Frostpunk throws a plethora of moral and ethical dilemmas at the player. It asks thought provoking questions and explores themes of power and corruption. This is a though, bleak world, where sometimes it's not possible to make a good choice. 

	Visual design paints a vision of nineteenth century industrial city powered by coal and steam. Soundtrack composed by the great Piotr Musiał adds depth and meaning to the story. It's just fantastic!

	11 bit studios created a polished title. Gameplay mechanics blend seamlessly with eachother. Frostpunk has it's own identity. Never before, maintaining a digital city was this dramatic and stressful. 
	Various scenarios mixed with great Endless mode provide content lasting for many hours. Frostpunk demands skill, planning and resilience. It's not an easy title by any means. But it's a rewarding experience. 

	I recommend this game.

While the game has received critical acclaim for its unique game play and immersive world, it falls short in several key areas that can make it a frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying experience. One of the biggest issues with the game is its lack of replay ability. While there are multiple scenarios to play through, the game play and mechanics quickly become repetitive, making subsequent play through feel like a chore. This can make the game feel stagnant and uninteresting, particularly for players who are looking for a more dynamic and engaging experience. Another issue with the game is its punishing difficulty. The game is designed to be challenging, but it can feel unfair and frustrating at times. It can be difficult to balance resource management, building construction, and citizen needs, and even a small misstep can have devastating consequences. This can make the game feel stressful and overwhelming, particularly for players who are not experienced with the survival strategy genre. The game's story line is also a problem. While the game's premise is intriguing, the story itself can feel disjointed and unsatisfying. The game relies heavily on the player's imagination to fill in the gaps, which can make it feel incomplete and underdeveloped. Finally, the game's interface can be clunky and difficult to navigate, which can make it frustrating to manage and oversee your city's operations. This can lead to mistakes and missteps that can have significant consequences for your citizens' survival.
Frostpunk has some interesting concepts and game play mechanics, but falls short in several key areas that can make it a frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying experience.

That's because the game tells an interesting story and it does so pretty organically (through the decisions you make). You'll find yourself empathizing with the poor souls living around your generator, clinging for some warmth. The mechanics are rock solid and the setting is great (especially, if you're a fan of ""The Thing"" like me) My only complaint is, that there could be a bit more replay value, but that's a lot to ask from an indie title. 

It's a 9.2/10 for me, so if you're on the fence like I was, you'll probably like it.

I sat down and started a Frostpunk game,. Then had a moment and played the game pretty much solidly until I completed the starting scenario at 2 AM.

It's pretty, it's atmospheric, there's a nice (albeit periodically jarring) attempt to create an atmosphere and make you invest in your people's hopes and fears. The challenge - of progressively falling temperatures and refugees from <nonspecific event>, and of managing your people's hopes and fears - is pleasing. Figuring out how to arrange your appropriately polar city is fun. Music's fine (I didn't turn it off) and your scouts venture into the wasteland to discover what seems like a cool story.

So far, so good. There are a few things I outright didn't like: the choices/challenges the AI presents you with are pretty mechanical and independent of context; the tech items cannot be ""read"" until you're able to research them, making planning ahead difficult; the morality of the game (like D&D) doesn't match the setting; and information is generally scanty, meaning you might well play partly or wholly through your first run just to figure out all the places you went wrong.

That leads on to the game's worst feature, that it is essentially a bounded puzzle with (very) finite choices. I haven't tried the endless mode, but suspect it would be like an inferior version of Timberborn: periodically circumstances become difficult, periodically they relent, you manage. Timberborn, though, isn't final release. I want to play another run or two at the scenario to explore the other laws tree and to try and do a few things I didn't realise were good ideas first time around (like not recognising how crucial your scouts are meant to be), but fundamentally this game has shot its bolt.

Things can go wrong very quickly all because the temperature dropped a couple of degrees. Or vice versa, a bad situation can turn around because of rising temperature. Many elements can come together and if one cog falls out of place, it's over. Its a great blend of survival resource management and plenty of hard decisions to make. I recommend reading every popup for decisions, it's great flavor text to keep you immersed in your personal story of running the city. Usually being cruel can make your life easier, but the art of the sad, cold people looking at me makes me think twice a time or two. 

The music is also phenomenal. It really sells the feel of sad Victorian British people just trying to make it out in the frozen wilderness. You got your quartets and strings, everything needed for that turn of the century mood. I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't played this, but ""The City Must Survive"" is the best track in the game because of it's context alone. 

This game is hard, so keep that in mind when you buy this and don't get discouraged when things don't work out. I flubbed my fair share of scenarios, but I eventually played and beat all of them. You can also change the difficulty before you start a scenario. I only recommend doing this if you cannot get far in the current difficulty. I think the mood of the game is softened when things are too easy. 

I love this game and it's easily in my top 10. I'm pretty upset I haven't played it until now considering this came out almost 5 years ago. If you're thinking of buying this, stop thinking about it and just do it. The expansions are also worth the asking price.

Pros:
Love the atmosphere and story
Doesn't give you the luxury or fast-forwarding (one slip up and you find yourself chasing issues instead of preventing them)
Great music (really in a way gives you that feeling of sadness/hopelessness yet......a glimmer of hope)
Makes you take the time to think about the pros and cons of every law/important decision you implement is truly a call to your character and believe me your choices really have consequences (being a leader is not easy)


Cons:
This honestly isn't really a con but this game can be EXTREMELY difficult and infuriating. Again this isn't really a can but more of a warning. I absolutely love this style of games and thought of myself as pretty good at them......boy this proved me wrong.

The people don't want to work even though they will all die if they don't.   They have working hours that they stick to and they get pissed off if you make them work outside the hours even though they need to to keep everyone from dying.   You have to decide if you want children to work (which they should since this is life or death) and when you make them work, everyone gets pissed off at you.
You would think that in an end-of-the-world survival scenario people would be willing to do more...  Nope.
You have to research the DUMBEST things and then build them (a pit in the snow to store dead bodies for example.)
Just tired of yet another survival game where the people want to kill themselves with laziness.
As for the game mechanics- Worker management is HORRIBLE. Research management is HORRIBLE.

In the game, you play as the leader of a group of survivors of an unexplained ecological cataclysm, which has resulted in the world freezing over. You order the construction and staffing of the means of production, with the populace providing feedback in the form of demands, and meters of Hope and Discontent. If they get too upset, they'll depose you -- though this has never happened to me. As a leader, systemic problems like supply shortages fall to you, and the game invites you to solve these problems with such innovations as: putting children to work as workers (bad), putting children to work as helpers (good), working people until they drop dead (bad), institutionalizing sex work (bad?), and opening a pub (also bad?). The ethical compass of the game generally suggests that you are the anti-hero whose only redeeming quality is keeping (almost) everyone alive.

I enjoy Frostpunk as a game where I get to say, ""Everything is fine, actually."" I refuse to proclaim inhumane laws (with the exception of hospital overcrowding, which is flat OP) while meticulously ensuring nobody dies. This involves a great deal of reloading old saves in order to make perfect choices, but it's also the only way I find the game appealing. In a world as dire as the one we live in (outside of the game), it can be a relief to stare tribulation in the face and know with certainty that nobody has to die. Even if we get a little chilly, we will pull through by our collective strength.

I find the alternate playstyle, of watching your settlement fall apart under your ineptitude, to be un-fun precisely because that's the world I navigate day to day. Despite my best efforts, I cannot prevent systematic cruelty; at best, I can abate it for a time for a meager few, while working toward a just transformation of the way of things -- a transformation I have no guarantee I'll live to see. We go to work in the cold and we are told to toil or perish, even under rampant plague and abject privation. I do not need a reminder of it; I do not want to romanticize it. So when Frostpunk begs me to institute child labor, I say no. We all deserve better than that.",1679930137,1679930137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ Creative and refreshing setting. Extreme cold and Victorian steam punk? Yes please!
+ Choices that actually affect play through experiences.
+ Interesting mechanics and gameplay loop for a city manager game. As the memes suggest, 10/10 would use child labour and turn dead bodies into manure again.

Cons:
- Needs some real controller support, even though the interface LOOKS as if it could be controller friendly. Steam input through keyboard works well enough, though.
- The outcomes don't feel very heavy hitting. The moral choices don't deliver the intended gut punch because you feel no real attachments to the people you order around.

From the moment I started the game, I was captivated by the post-apocalyptic world and the challenging gameplay. The attention to detail in the graphics and sound design is truly impressive, making the game incredibly immersive. FrostPunk is an exceptional game that truly stands out in the strategy and city-building genres. From the immersive post-apocalyptic world to the challenging gameplay, FrostPunk is a game that will keep you engaged for hours on end.

One of the things I love about FrostPunk is the way it presents you with difficult decisions that have a real impact on the survival of your city. Every choice you make, no matter how small, can have consequences that ripple throughout the game. Some decisions present moral dilemmas that offer interesting choices without directly impacting the city's survival, while others can completely change the course of the game.

The graphics and sound design in FrostPunk are top-notch, immersing you in the game's atmosphere and making you feel like you're really in control of the fate of your city. The gameplay is both strategic and thought-provoking, requiring you to constantly balance resources, technology, and the needs of your citizens to ensure their survival.

Overall, I would highly recommend FrostPunk to anyone who enjoys strategy games or city-building games. It's a great game that presents you with meaningful decision-making and impactful gameplay, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it.

You have but a handful of people to build a city for you, and to bring in the resources you need for their survival. Will you try to be a compassionate leader, or will you put even the children to work 14 hours a day as a last ditch measure of desperation to keep that Generator going?
The fate of your people is in your hands, and every decision you make has immediate and longterm consequences, for better or for worse. So pick the path you descend on very carefully.

You will really need to strategize and prioritize as you just never seem to have enough workforce to keep everything flowing at the rate you need it. And when you thought it couldn't get any worse, beware as the temperature is about to drop significantly in a couple of days, better get the next generator power level researched at all cost before we all freeze over. Oh and make sure your coal production can sustain the next power level too. And try also not to starve, nor overwork your people to death in the meantime. Then just when you thought the worst of it was over, the story f*cks you over for good measure.
You'll be kept constantly on edge as you try to manage the flow of resources made possible by the very people you're trying to prevent from falling sick or worse, freezing to death, all while having to respond to emergencies and social unrest if you're not careful.

I find the setting, the story and the whole ambiance really immersive, and the OST is a masterpiece, it really conveys the feeling of utter desperation, of real struggle with all odds stacked against, of desolation and loneliness, of barely holding on.

There are 4 campaign scenarios that play out differently while generally giving you access to all the same buildings. Until the late game, you will be struggling to maintain a good balance on resource gathering, building up your city, and keeping it heated. The positive to this struggle means that almost all the technology upgrade choices are good and many seem prudent. You will often catch yourself stuck between a tough choice of 2-5 different techs each time you go to upgrade for most of a scenario.

The biggest issue with this is that 2 or 3 of the scenarios have major (or seemingly minor) scripted events that occur that can completely screw you over. Since you have no clue what these are going to be the first time through a scenario, they can keep you from getting the best possible outcomes or even cause a cascade to failure. This means you typically need to make a hard save backup once every 3 or 4 days, otherwise enjoy getting royally screwed through no fault of your own since you had no way to predict what was going to be coming.",1679318520,1679318520,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

- the aesthetic and artstyle

- soundtrack (i could listen to this for the rest of my life and still be happy)
- pacing and story

I don't like:
- linear gameplay (there's not much you can really do other than one specific path)
- not much replayability
- difficulty (seriously, it's absurdly difficult. probably just because I'm a freshie to the whole city builder / survival genre)

Easier difficulty would be less interesting to play. 
The game's athmosphere is very well done and the level of difficulty is perfectly right for what the game aims for: 
You get really immersed into the menace of the frost and feel the pressure to survive, while there still is some room for moral decisions.

I managed to survive the final storm in a new home on the first try, as it was quite clear what measures and actions could lead to survival. But to do so, the workers had to do 24h shifts in mines and farms, while regular public executions kept down the level of unrest, the sick were triaged and then used as fertilizer, and ""volunteers"" had to sacrifice their lifes to maintain coal production, as the alternative would have been a reduced heating radius and people freezing to death. 

Was it worth it? Thats a good question, and it was presented in the end after surving. There had been many decisions, what difference could it had made, to take different ones? If you see the game, the sick, the unrest, the dead just as a system of numbers and survival as goal, or if you consider a totalitarian dictorship by you as ideal, the question might be easier to answer than if you try to survive while maintaining humanitarian values.

And then it hits: It is a fictional scenario, but clearly an allegory to the real world. When you learn history about Soviet Union during world war 2 and how they defended against the aggression, which sacrifices were made and what did society was like afterwards, some parallels are obvious.
The question is still highly relevant today: We still live with the menace of societies wiped out through cruel war. What means are appropriate for defense?",1679234083,1679234083,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's quite a bit of depth to the gameplay but decisions are really where the game shines. You've only got so many working hours in a day so your supply of resources is limited which means the choices you make have to be carefully considered. It simply isn't possible to buy, build and research everything you want so you have to make sacrifices. There's a balance that needs to be achieved between short and long-term goals and if you skew too heavily one way, you'll be punished pretty severely

On finishing the campaign, I am feeling complete with a warm feeling of accomplishment: I am feeling like having overcome interesting, hard, cruel, but fair game challenges...

Rarely in my many years of gaming have I encountered one that so completely monopolized my attention.  I daresay I fired more neurons beating the main scenario than Einstein fired figuring out relativity.  Which is not to say the game is all that complicated, it's just that engaging.

The game-play is solid and satisfying survival/base building with the amp turned up to eleven.  The pressure to stay ahead of events is relentless, eventually building to a stunning crescendo that leaves you bracing for the inevitable death blow - which you must also somehow survive.  Every decision counts, and counts alot.

The story is very good and well-written, both supporting the game-play and adding a social and political dimension that directly impacts your chances of survival.  

The art is steam punk-cool, beautiful and imminently immersive.  The music, sublime.  A hauntingly beautiful and masterful composition, it manages to unobtrusively weave itself through your consciousness and pull you deep into the frozen world the game creates.

Frostpunk is a great game and a complete experience that has me looking forward to a second playthrough, the DLC scenarios and, of course, Frostpunk II.  

Get it.  You'll be glad you did.  

I am.

There is no replay value, which I believe a city builder should always offer gameplay diversity, in which this game absolutely fails to deliver.

Play this for the atmosphere, music and art but in terms of gameplay variety, pretty much any other city builder games do it better.

The game challenges you to balance multiple factors at once, such as temperature, resource management, and the happiness of your citizens. This forces you to make tough decisions and think strategically, as even the smallest mistake can have dire consequences.

But despite its challenging gameplay, Frostpunk is an incredibly rewarding experience. As you progress through the game, you'll be able to research new technologies, construct new buildings, and upgrade your society. And as your city grows, so too will your sense of accomplishment.

Another impressive aspect of Frostpunk is its city-building mechanics. The game allows you to construct a wide variety of structures, from steam-powered generators to hunting huts, all of which are essential to the survival of your society. Each building has its own unique function, and you'll need to carefully consider which structures to prioritize in order to succeed.

But Frostpunk isn't just about building a city – it's also about managing the people who live there. The game features a deep and immersive citizen management system, which allows you to assign jobs, pass laws, and even execute criminals. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the gameplay, and ensures that you're always engaged and invested in the fate of your society.

In conclusion, Frostpunk is a masterpiece of a city-building game that is sure to captivate anyone who enjoys strategy games. With its innovative mechanics, engaging gameplay, and immersive world-building, Frostpunk is a must-play for anyone who loves a good challenge.",1678861607,1678861705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is no word to describe this game if not ""beautiful"": it's graphically beautiful, the soundtrack is chillingly (pun intended) beautiful, the gameplay is pretty unique and the lore is very original.

I won't explain the premises because you can read them above, so let's focus on the game itself.
It kinda starts out as a normal city builder, with an original circular simmetry, because you must build around the big central generator, which provides heat (in exchange for coal) for all the colony. Heat is indeed a resource of its own, and you'll have to manage it well. It could have been nice to have a couple more ""advanced"" resources (for example: where do these people take the clothes to cover themselves? There's an ice age outside) but the game can be very challenging managing the ones you have, so it's ok anyway. Two ""resources"" unique to this game are your people's hope and discontent: in order to manage them (but not only for that), you'll have to sign laws, which can also have you face preatty big moral decisions, spanning from legalizing child labour to instituting care houses for the amputees.
Finally, you'll also be able to scout the sorrounding frostland for resources and lore.

To sum up, this game can be a very challenging and rewarding experience (it also has an ""easy"" option don't worry), perfect for any strategy/city builder fan. Can also be good for someone who's not a fan of the genre, if he is without prejudices.
The price for the main title is definitely right, while some dlcs may be a little overpriced (but I don't own them so don't trust me on this (planning on buying them anyway)), nothing that steam sales can't fix.

The only downside is that devs decided to stop adding new content, which is really a shame because Frostpunk had so much more to tell, from scenarios to game modes and mechanics. Sorry if I've written too much =)",1605007729,1678825135,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A nice little game and totally worth 1 or even 2 playthroughs

If you are the kind of player who gets annoyed quite easy, best stay away from this game.

The mechanic behind ""babysitting"" that big heater, can be really frustrating.
If you forget to turn off overdrive, you lose the game and kind of have to start again (or get thrown back to your last autosave which cost you a few minutes of gametime...)

I think it was a really bad decision from the devs to handle things like they did.. it feels like they just wanted to extend playtime for this game by making you lose it, in such a stupid way (i.e. you pause the game, build some stuff, release a policy, check on your scouts, then you speed up time in game, but forgot that you still running overdrive, boom, game over)

i like the difficult and challenging economic decisions one has to make in this game and ofc the connected outcomes, but the overdrive mechanic can tilt you quite fast. early to mid to end game feels quite similar in every playthrough and its just really frustrating to start from your last autosave, just because you forgot to switch off a controller after zapping through a lot of sheets and menues....

still a thumbs up for the discounted version

Even so, I am convinced my experience would have been just the same had I started playing on a summer afternoon. The atmosphere of this game is absolutely stunning. Frostpunk sets the stage in a way I would otherwise think impossible for a story so brutal you will find yourself shivering by the end. I recently saw this game mentioned in Jacob Geller's ""Fear of Cold"" and he describes the idea better than I ever could: cold is not something that can be conquered. All you can possibly hope to do is survive it — to stave off its icy grip until, maybe, something warmer comes to fill that frozen void. Frostpunk encompasses this perfectly. Whether you like it or not, the cold will come. You may wish, plead, or bargain, but the cold will come. When it comes, if you are not ready, you will die.

Beyond the breathtaking visuals, novel concept, and unique mechanics, Frostpunk is built to offer endless replay value. Every city will have a uniquely harrowing story, recounted to you at the end of your struggles. This game also presents a challenge that many will find tantalizing. You will have to make difficult, sometimes heartbreaking decisions. You will suffer losses. You will wish you could go back. Unfortunately for you, the cold's advance halts for no one. Frostpunk is a tragedy of the struggle between efficiency, morality, and harsh, cruel reality. As your city branches out like the snowflakes adorning the fallen, you will be forced to ask time and time again whether your actions are worth the anguish.

Crashed at minute 12, but chalking that up to some prior software installing/uninstalling without a reset.  Stable after that, going on 5.5 hours now, seems fine.

Very good value at 90% off during the current sale, though dubious at over $100 for the game and DLC (if purchased at full price).  Graphics look nice, though nothing stand-out this early into the game (launching the balloon was cool), and hoping it stays low-key like this, with similar (and increasingly grandiose) visuals as I progress the story.

The same buildings. The same problems. The same pictures. The same incredibly small linear tree of ""laws"" that end up making every game identical after you have chosen either 'facism' or 'religion'.
No workshop content, the DLC's are the exact same in premise with a few little quirky changes. 
If you could Steam workshop mod it, if there was more proggresion and variation in gameplay (excluding difficulty and map choice) 

Maybe i just don't get it, but from the outside perspective of someone who doesn't really give a fuck about the lore and creation of the game, just someone who wants a banging colony sim [b]first[/b] and then a rich universe to explore afterwards... This game feels a lil backwards? 
Audio and music for purchase, artwork, backstory, anecdotes, trinkets and doodads from lost explorers, ""about the world"". All of these aspects seem so incredibly fleshed out while the game itself is rather lacking.

Its like they really want to shove in your face:
[b]""Look! Look! Isn't this cool? Isn't this a cool story we've made? Come on! Buy some artwork! Buy some of the audio you can hear for free on youtube and in game! Why don't you support us so we can keep making Frostpunk better!... Actually add some replay value into the game?... Uhm... I-.... Ermh... Here's a Q&A about the frostpunk lore instead!""

The many ways to build your society to survive along with all the challenges makes it a chillingly refreshing City builder survival game. Despite having played it since its release, I keep coming back for more. The difficulty curve is nice and smooth and you can easily sense it steady rising depending on the gameplay you choose. the Learning curve as well is simple and easy and it wont take long before you build a metropolis within a frozen over world. That at least is my positive side of the review.

Personally, while I love all the game has to offer, even its endless mode, I will say that there is a severe lack of updates and content to keep the player base engaged and wanting for checkup. I would love to see them come with new content, or challenges instead of letting it gather dust while they finish making the sequal. I am not expecting something big, personally. Just enough to keep people in the loop and having fun.

All in all, if you are looking for several hours of fun and a fetching story about the end and possible rebirth of the world and humanity after an iceage cataclysm, I warmly recommend this game.",1677948164,1677948164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Ark and the Last Autumn scenario's are my favorite ones.
I don't know any other strategy game that does ethics this well.
The game will maneuver you into scenario's where you are forced to choose 1 of 2 evils, and the consequence will follow you through that entire game. This gives this game excellent replay-ability, you can play the game again and try a different route, or throw your ethics out of the window and build a penal colony.

The idea is great too, building circular around a gigantic generator where everyone's huddled up for warmth in an ice-age world.

The challenges are also that - challenges. Survivor mode is incredibly tough to beat, and makes you revisit the way you play the game - often by having to pick Laws that don't make your people very happy.

I wholeheartedly recommend picking this game up to anyone, especially if it's on sale, this game is worth every penny.

I'm honestly surprised this game doesn't have overwhelmingly positive status somehow.

old review:
I keep coming back to this game. I love how different it is from conventional strategy games, and find myself wanting to drive the smoothest playthrough, or the most morally acceptable playthrough. I love the decision making process they added that heavily impacts the gameplay - and that at harder difficulties you are probably going to have to make some choices that aren't as ethical as others.",1587713413,1677620590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is hard, at first, but once you understand what you need to do it gets easier. If you still want your challenge, good news! There's higher difficulties.

Frostpunk is a game about what humans do and how they react to the extremes, I feel. The world has frozen over, almost everything is just snow and ice for as far as the eyes can see. We must survive, and we must band together to do so. But people are, at the end of the day, people. Human. We panic, we lost hope. We fight. And we must ask ourselves, sometimes, is survival at any cost worth it? If human life is sacred at this point, should we really descent into methods that allow us to control almost every aspect of another person's life just to survive?

There's several scenarios, some of them free and some of them paid, for you to playthrough. You won't unlock them until you get far enough in the Main Scenario, A New Home; You'll assume the role of the Captain of a convoy or transport of sorts. You lost many, but you arrived. And no one else is here. Despite the odds, you'll have to make it. You'll have to keep people happy. And if not, either you, the city, or both will perish.
And there's no rolling back laws, either. Once you sign off on something, that's it. So pick the laws wisely.. or save often. Save often in general if you're not good (like me.)

I don't wanna spoil much, so I'll keep the review light. But if you do want my advice... I like to use Charcoal Kilns early on after I get the wall drills in the main scenario. Scout south, too. Be ready to take on new people, but get to steel bridge as fast as you can. You'll want whats there, and you'll want to send it home. Trust me.
And once you have the coal, use Steam Hubs to heat smaller circles outside of the generator's influence. 
If you do play this game, I wish 'ye good luck, I hope you have fun, and I hope my advice helps you. <3",1677090442,1677090442,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Its a good game and the scenarios are all quite varied and interesting. These can be quite additive to play but one of my most greatest issues is that there really need to be more scenarios and longer ones.

As a city builder game its quite unique and different from other city builders as your building around a heat source (part of the post apocalyptic theme) with a weird circular build area which is quite unique to most city builders.
It can be quite additictive to play and also challenging with many routes to failure. 
My main issues besides it being not long enough is water is never considered in a game about survival and many other resources aren't considered. It tends to be quite simple in that respect.

The conceit for survival colony sims in general is building something out of nothing; is recovering and rebuilding a city, a nation, a civilization; is striving against the darkest impulses. 

The copy for [i]Frostpunk[/i] positions it squarely in line with its peer games: [i]It is your duty to manage both its citizens and infrastructure. What decisions will you make to ensure your society's survival? What will you do when pushed to breaking point? Who will you become in the process?[/i]

In the face of such challenges, many games adopt a “darkest-before-dawn” mentality: that is, challenges must be overcome to mold a better tomorrow. [i]I Was a Teenage Exocolonist[/i] and [i]Spiritfarer[/i] embrace this conceit with grace, as does a game like [i]Beacon Pines[/i] (though not a sim in any respect). [i]Before We Leave[/i], heck, even [i]Don’t Starve[/i], [i]Rimworld[/i], and [i]Stellaris[/i] offer players roleplaying choice. [i]Frostpunk[/i], on the other hand, adopts a “darker and darker and darkest” mentality where even the best of binary bad choices is despicable.

The signs are there early: To unlock entertainment – and a literal bar/restaurant – you need to unlock pit fighting first. What?!? Why?!? How about no?!? And that’s only a starting point. 

Thereafter, the classic [i]Frostpunk[/i] scenario enforces a binary choice: Will you embrace religious zealotry and militarily-enforced theocracy, or will you embrace rigid authoritarianism? How about neither, please?!!?! 

Having “fun” with [i]Frostpunk[/i] means leaning into such abominable choices and suspending idealism on the one hand – and any roleplaying agency on the other – in carbonite. 

My vitriolic reaction to this game may very well indicate to some readers that [i]Frostpunk[/i] has accomplished what it set out to achieve; I would argue that this aim itself is ignominious.

I do have problems with it:
1) There absolutely is a meta-strategy. Game is honestly easy (on Normal) once you figure out what sequence to discover new technology, what sequence to build etc.
2) The morality system is a joke. The game considers your survival to possibly be a bad thing if you have guards and print pamphlets saying everything will be fine. Meanwhile the game is more than happy with you bribing people with food and brainwashing through religion.
3) The game markets itself as being about 'making hard choices' or how choices have 'long-lasting consequences'. It does not. Pick the ""good"" choice and you get good-boy points.

Isn't it kind of depressing? This game has a certain rep, but you really can play as a [b]good guy[/b] and god bless autosave. 

If you want to just play around, no stress? You can do that! They created a freeplay mode years ago, play on easy and I guarantee you will be drowning in resources to do whatever you like (there are harder modes too). 

Freeplay has the 'benefit' of no story, but the plotlines... It's a complex human drama about a really bad situation, but its not some dirge on how much humanity sucks. Being the good guy is harder, but very often the game will reward you for it. You really don't need to use child labor to succeed (seriously, it's objectively the worse of the two options they give). 

It can be a bit intense when a scenario has gotten a bit out of hand and your balancing the basic survival needs with dealing with a crisis. But with increased experience you get a handle for things (took me about a week or two). Just remember that pause is your friend, and whenever the generator blows, you can just start up like it never happened from the autosave (just remember to turn overdrive off when you load it).

Edit: Played level 2 - the story is not well coupled to the gameplay.  They randomly choose resource targets rather than presenting conditions.  Everything is one color, so it's difficult to find the buildings, and the atomotons tend to sit on the buildings so you can't select them.

This game is a building/resource race against the ever colder frost. The world has been plunged into an Ice Age. And you are the leader of a small group of survivors. As the leader, you manage everything from: food, housing, medical, industrial, resource, research, law, refugees, expansion, scouts, and games and recreation. But who for? The People. The people are of course, the heart and soul of this game. 
Every choice you make will cause and affect the population's Hope and Discontent. And every choice brings you a narrative, your story, shaping the lives of your people as you make the gut-turning choices that sully your hands. 

Advice: 
Your first few playthroughs will be long, so take the time to learn and plan out the best thing to do. Since a big factor in this game is resource management. And trust me, you do not want to be caught with your pants down on resources by the end of the game. Aim for a net positive, but most importantly, stockpiling. For new players with a lack of experience, you'll be making poor choices in regard to resource management. So just pause the timer in-game, read the descriptions and options of buildings/icons and learn. Figure out what you need, what can wait, and what will screw or save you in the long run. The rest is in the tutorial.  

I have high expectations for Frostpunk 2.

Having the ability to interact and compete with other players would bring a fresh dynamic to the game and would offer players a new challenge. It would also give players the opportunity to learn from one another and discover new strategies for survival.

The game feels very polished and balanced. The difficulty was just right for me from the main campaign over the first two scenarios up to the winterhome scenario which is the hardest of them by far.
I also played the last autumn DLC, which I reviewed seperately (recommended imo, even though a bit easy on ""normal"" if you played winterhome before).

It's easy to get lost in time while playing this game and you can choose many ways to engage with most situations. There is a lot of strategizing, especially with the different laws and technologies you can unlock.

One thing I want to name specifically that made the game way more fun and approachable was the refund on destroying buildings. This makes just growing your city and changing things later a blessing.

Sorry, it was not.
Because as a game developer, You have no stand to criticize me.

Technically, I do not recommend this game because its gameplay is very linear and structural. And the whole gameplay is very short. It is really not worth $30 USD.

Although difficult (even on the easiest settings) this game keeps drawing me back for one more play through.  The main story is very compelling and every decision you make feels like it has an impact on the events that happen later on.  In fact, some decisions you make will have some minor effects on the ending.

The extra stories and DLC are also very fun and interesting.  Every story is unique and tells a different tale to further add to the lore and intrigue of the world.  Each story also has their own unique game play mechanic to keeps things fresh.  This is definitely one of the few games I would recommend buying DLC for.

If there is one thing that bothers me, however, is there is one mechanic in the game that feels rather terrible.  As part of the scouting mechanic, there are certain encounters that become a pass/fail that could kill your scouts and set you back within that play through.  The only way around is to ""save scum"" and try again.  There are a only a couple other examples of this kind of mechanic, but they don't usually make you do a 50/50 forced decision and have some other way to circumvent the problem.  Hopefully in the sequel they will find a way around this because this is the only major problem I have with this game.

This game is so sadistically punishing, I tried to put my dick in the PC and got stage 3 frostbite.
Now for real.
The game is very interesting lore-wise. I don't want to spoil much so just read the description of the game and that should suffice.
The gameplay is punishing, but very addictive. The city building is very satisfying. I like the fact you have to limit yourself by the small area and the generator-centred building system just gets me coming back. For the last week, I couldn't play any other game.

The endless mode and the expansion more than make up for this in my opinion however.

You cannot please everyone and you must carefully consider where and when you spend your resources. Compromise can often be a good choice. Resources are scarce and there is not enough of them in the pit - you must venture out of its safety to get lumber and other things. Do not get content, and do not waste time - use pause to plan and build. You have a limited space and you must consider where you place your buildings and how you lay out your roads. It can be very frustrating at times, especially in the beginning, but worry not because if you are patient, you'll learn the things that matter and in the end you may find yourself content, running a well oiled, efficient machine that can handle anything.

The game will keep you on your toes and you must accept that there will be some setbacks. You can't win everything, you just have to survive. This is a true strategy game about base building, resource management and also a bit about leadership and responsibility. The soundtrack is superb and the world feels just as grim as it looks.

But 'difficult' is when strategy and skill are combined with the players knowledge to overcome challenges and feel rewarded. Difficult is NOT a series of quests you must complete where the variables are all out of your hands. After 6 trials I finally began to understand the game and the priority of building/actions/etc. I got my scout party up and kept resources managed as I heated houses, etc. The quests start coming... Heat houses. Did that. Oh wait nope, you didn't. Doesn't explain why, just says 'liveable' all houses are heated and 75% of the population lives in a bunkhouse. That's fine its alright. Then the first real storyline quest starts, The Londoners. People wanna leave and you need to convince people to stay. Except nothing you do has a positive effect. Give people what they want, they just don't get angry. They don't get happier though, just not angry. Then back to back to back quests to build an infirmary. Level 3 tech. 4 carehouses and 5 med bays didn't matter. So I research level 3, giving up other quest and making people angry so I can build this building. Except I can't, because it needs steam cores. You can't make those. You acquire them randomly as you explore, which takes between 24-72 hours. The quest is 24 hours long. So even if you find one, it doesn't matter. Random quests generating and random loot chance isn't 'difficult'. Its the opposite of fun. It sucks hard because I was super engaged and the game was seriously great until I reached this point twice and couldn't progress.

 I've the base game, from the steam sale for 6£.

 I'll start by saying that the 'normal' mode on this is pretty savage & unforgiving if you're new to the game. This game is way less forgiving than others like it, there's a very particular order to build & r&d that if you get wrong then thats-it ! And the tutorial is hardly worth the name lmao.

 The 'easy' setting is still pretty challenging in the 'mission' based scenarios, if a little forgiving.. a good introduction to the game I.m.o. 
  I've not played 'perpetual' mode as yet, more interested in the little narrative stories of the scenarios. 

 There's no real song & dance for finishing a 'mission', an animation montage of your games  base-building at the end & a little text is all. And there's nothing to state Complete for a mission/scenario, only the Steam Achievements.  I'd feel better if there was a proper Slap On The Back moment at the end of a successful run & the 'mission' listed as complete. 

Oh, and be prepared for a good 30%+ of your game time to be reloads, until you get used to it.

For such a small download it's pretty card intensive, on my RTX 3070 TI it is anyway. Have had some stutters where I'd thought it might crash, but luckily it didn't.

In the end I didn't go back to this title. I still think I got my £ worth from the very low sale price though. It's ultimately variations of the same thing through this game.

You exist in a small circle and gather resources and research technology in order to have an efficient economy for survival. You eventually branch out and explore by deploying scouts to the surrounding area. At first it doesn't feel like real-time strategy because you can survive at a nice casual pace, but after you die a couple times you realize you need to do upgrades much sooner in the game. There's also a political element in which you make decisions about how to deal with the behavior of the citizens and what sort of governing styles you want to go with, having different strengths and weaknesses as trade-offs.
The game is visually pleasant, although not a ton of detail - similar to your Age of Empires type games. It's basically similar to an AoE type RTS but without fighting and in that regard without a dynamic opposition (you're battling prescribed weather patterns and scarcity, not an intelligent/variable opponent). The cut-scenes/audio are good. I also have yet to beat it at over 50 hrs and there are other scenarios etc available, so you'll get plenty of play time; even if you're an expert it still takes quite a long time to get through - in that regard it's different from an Age of Empires/Mythology match that might last 1 or 2 hours, I'd say it's like 5-10 hours to get through a scenario (TBD).

I just wanted to address one particular negative review, which had something along the lines of ""shit happens that you can't possibly foresee that will cause you to fail, and you have to restart over and over again getting one bullshit event further each time"". This is a hard paraphrase because I haven't looked at it in a couple weeks.

My 2 cents is, the first time I played through this game I completed it. It felt like I was behind literally the entire time, but in the end I pulled it off. I think this is the games greatest strength.
This game is about perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, and in my opinion it's balanced extremely well against that. If something isn't working you generally have enough time to pivot, and even though it can feel like everything is falling apart for most of the game, there are ways to pull through.

My one tip to new players: Just because certain things are off cooldown and available to be clicked doesn't mean it's a good choice. The game has a habit of serving you up 2 bad options and forcing you to choose, a lot of people have issues with elements of this. For better or worse, the game railroads you towards it's final destination. 
But you don't ALWAYS have to make choices as soon as they are available. Sometimes it is best to wait and see.

Figuring out what you did wrong and improving until you finally beat the mission makes Frostpunk very rewarding. Frostpunk is played in real-time with a pause available, which makes the gameplay active and dangerous situations hectic. 

I did 2 playthroughs and actually enjoyed the game much more on 2nd playthrough on hard difficulty, where your choices have more impact and you have a better understanding of the game. Frostpunk is definitely designed with replayability in mind. You are encouraged to try different approaches to solving problems and finding your own style.

I liked the stories in each mission and the different choices you can make in each story. This also gave the missions a proper ending and stopped them from dragging on forever. The length of each story was good enough to allow variety between each run. 

On the technical side, the graphic design is great and Frostpunk looks gorgeous. I had no issues with performance on my mid-tier 2016 build PC. Frostpunk did however crash and freeze at least 10 times during my playthroughs. 

The only problem I found with the graphics was that most of the building looks very similar and finding certain buildings especially in big city is frustrating. You can find certain building by opening the building screen and hovering your mouse over the building type you are looking for, but this is cumbersome for such a simple task. 

The UI in general could definitely use improvements in many areas. There should be more hotkeys and views to help manage your city. Cycling through a large number of building is also something that could be better. When playing on hard difficulty you will most likely have to restart your mission often when things go wrong, yet there is no restart mission button in the in-game menu. The difficulty setting also resets to normal every time you go back to the menu, which is annoying. I hope they really focus on improving UX in the sequel.

The overarching theme of this game is that of practicality and efficiency vs empathy and humanity. Using a branching system of available laws, one can push the colony to maximum production efficiency through implementing heartless laws such as child labor, overtime or 24 hour work days, and sawdust in food rations. However, this can and will turn your populous against you, leading to your demise or banishment. On the other hand, if one is too considerate and humane they may find themselves unprepared for the unbelievably freezing storms and thus end up with numerous casualties. 

The story is simple but brilliant, with surprisingly deep lore that the player must find on their own. Essentially, the sun is blocked out and the global temperature plummets, the only places capable of surviving are coal-powered, steampunk settlements in the arctic that were meant to serve as research bases. There are a variety of different scenarios you may undertake, but you invariably arrive and find that all the settlements have already fallen as a result of incompetence, cruelty, or simply overwhelming odds. The world is rich and atmospheric, though extremely depressing and intense. 

All in all, a solid game. I strongly recommend it to fans of steampunk, base management sims, and top of the line gaming computers.",1552406313,1674281911,True,5,0,0.533132493495941162,0,True,False,False

Most games that are society-building hit a dead end at some point because there is either no story to follow along, no motivation, no challenge, etc., but Frostpunk is different. There is a story in each scenario and time limits for goals that can have multiple endings and/or multiple outcomes. I love that this game is genuinely challenging, even on the easy mode. Damn you, Arks...
The shorts that play before each scenario is beautifully made with amazing voice acting, music, artwork, and its simple animation. The graphics in game are beautiful and very detailed instead of just crude models of structures and environment aspects. 
My only issue with the game isn't the game's fault itself, but I do play it on a laptop (Dell Inspiron, idk the specs im not good with hardware details) and it does not flow smoothly on my laptop at all. I've played the game on a desktop (Alienware Aurora r10) before so I do know it is just an issue with my laptop in particular.

Im adding to this review in Jan 2023, i still come back and play it sometimes, i have actaully played another 50 hours offline too., The game is set in an alternate 1886 Steampunk like Universe At the Height of British empire And its ownerships of expansive territories oversea's in its Colonies.where the eruptions of Krakatoa and Mount Tambora(Volcano's), the dimming of the Sun, and other unknown factors caused a worldwide Apocalyptic global Ice age. Reminds me so much of Snowpeircer the film/Show This game is quiet  intense.Plays like age of empires building system, with choice based system that effects everything,How society is ruled, And your decisions effect thing greatly, example: the choice of rationing food: 1. put sawdust into the food as 'filler' this will bring discontent,people will hate you for it, but people stomachs will be full for longer, 2. soup  and bread instead of full meals raising discontent, but less than'filler' would, 3. extreme rationing, 1 meal a day, This may lead your people to canniblism (Hidden 'Alternative food source' in the tech tree , fighting ,leaving in masses or may even try to overthrow you, Create a religious Order, Or A militia,Dictated  police state .  The morale choices you have to make are tough , complex  and varied and do have later game effect  on the game, so sometimes being the nice ruler at beginning leads to later hardship down the line. This is a very challenging game too. you defiantly cant please the mob always that's for sure. Really does bring meaning to working towards the greater good,The city must survive.  This honestly most meaningful RPG city builder ive played, There been so many times ive not wanted to do something but pushed on and did, even if it meant loss of lives of my people, For greater to good so that city, and people left survive.Each charater has a name ,And you can hear that character talking if you zoom in on the scene, And start recognise voices ,Excellent  minor details even if some charaters have same voices. The voices all do react to whats  happening, hunger, riots, Death, Decisions so forth. The whole feels alive, and you get sense of mood constantly. It really does feel like the wrong choice can lead you brink of death of the city, then the people. generators can be overcharged, to produce more heat, You have check this, often,lf sothe generator works like steam train, more you put in the more you get out, in terms of speed and heat expansion, its not very efficient being late victorian tech, Putting too much coal, wood to make sure everyone warm keeps  everyone happy, but it also puts everyone lifes at risk of it blowing up.. its always risk/Safe option, and sometimes the people, more so lower classes dont understand that. 9.5/10 Still some perfomance issues, Where it will crash, On the dlc's odd, glitch, But extremly polish,I wont give it 10, even though i know could be 10, Its lack of steam workshop support, waiting on mods, this could massively increase the replayabilty ,All dlc , i'd say there up 200hrs of content here. 50 hrs or so if you were just play the main story chapters once. 
Ive returned to frostpunk recently, And all the chapters open up more lore about the world, What happened to winterhome, What became of the refugee's ,What happend with American expedition to Tesla City (Nicola Telsa's Own Electric ran city) What Happend to the Londoners.
And where you currently are on Earth.  The lore and survival is the narrative driving force here . Depending on your personal beliefs, And choices will determine the outcome of your expedition",1605102620,1674254384,True,0,0,0.463623374700546265,0,True,False,False

This is a survival, builder, resource gathering, strategy game, that presents predictable challenges - this has been done, in different settings.

I wanted to give points for the somewhat unique political system, by which, you're sometimes forced to make unsavory decisions - but then I realized how you're actually forced into this situation by the game design. So, I give no points for this.

My chief complaint, however, is the resources this game consumes. Given the graphics (which are not groundbreakingly awesome), and that every other game mechanic is no more complex than any other strategy game, I'm trying to figure out what, exactly, is pinning my CPU and GPU - ALL THE TIME - eventually, leading to slow gameplay. What is this thing calculating, and why? Why do the fair graphics require so much power? Is this just lazy coding? I don't have an answer, because I don't care enough to investigate deeply. All I can say is, for what this game delivers, it vastly mismanages resources.

So, given that this game is the same old strategy game paradigm, in a unique looking wrapper, that pigeon-holes you into making ""unique"" decisions, and given its horrible treatment of my computer, I really can't recommend this game.

The variety of decisions and their outcomes, and you have to decide what you do, in order for your people to survive, so you basically have to accept bad laws and do decisions which your people wont like. (it is possible to not accept any bad law, but you need to be experienced and I only see it on extreme difficulty on some videos, but not on survivor difficulty, thats really hard).

+story, gameplay, decisions, 
-some laws (overcrowding vs extra rations - extra rations can be played, but not on harder difficulties, they are just no so good, child shelters vs children job - you need to build a lot of shelters for your children to have hope bonus), gameplay itself gets boring when you get to state when your economy is fine, your people are living in chilly+ conditions, you have good food industry, your medical post and infirmaries can treat sick sufficienty - in this point it just gets boring for me, because you dont have adrenaline here no more, endless mode - I have played mostly builders mode - cause its the best, but same problem after building generator, it is boring after it, 

DLCs
Last Autumn - fine DLC, whole new variety of play, instead of temperature you have safety, instead of hope you have motivation, I personally have less fun playing it than the new home scenario (the winter just gets more adrenaline than building a generator)
On the Edge - fine DLC, settlements are fine, maybe they could use more options in them, also in the Endless mode settlements cannot establish safe route

I'm very glad that it has options both for having an ending and not, as well as extreme difficulty options. (which I'm too scared to try.)

This game teaches through repetition, like a souls game - you have to know what needs to be done and practice until you get it right. If you're new to the game, you're almost certainly going to fail a couple times. I don't love that you can't really recover from things, as others have noted. There is a right way to do things, you have to know what to do in advance. This is especially true in The Last Autumn. Certain events will happen and you won't be able to respond in the best way without having certain technologies in place that the game never suggested you have. (Just a lesson for next time, I suppose.) You don't know the balances of what resources you'll need when, until you've played a couple times. I also don't love that hope and discontent are resources of their own. Keeping hope topped off and discontent at 0 is actually kind've a mismanagement of resources. 

I do wish that pop-up decisions had a bit more in the way of options. On that note, the final act in the main scenario is a bit irksome as you can never prevent issues.

Jokes aside, this RTS game will push you to your extremes, both in terms of strategy and moral choices. It's set in a steampunk, pre-ice age era in the late 1800's, where extreme colds are setting in and your only source of heating is a giant heat generator. Your job is to keep everyone warm and happy.

Sounds easy, if not for the preamble I just wrote. You see, when you run out of workers in this game, you don't generate them with food like in Age of Empires. You either bring them from an expedition, or you introduce a policy that forces child labour. Too many people are upset because you can't heat their homes? Watchtowers and propaganda. People getting frostbite? Allow amputations and see where it goes from there. The moral dilemma that Frostpunk puts you in is unlike any other RTS game I've played so far, making you question if your decisions are really for the better of the population, or if you are just being a dick.

This extremety comes from the very high difficulty of the game itself. The main ""campaign"" so to speak (btw, if you only have the base game you are definitely missing out) is more of a tutorial on just how badly you are going to get screwed over. The scenarios pose some new challenges that, once you get the hang of it, will make you SUFFER due to the odd situations it places you in. The biggest problem with these ones is the fact that oftentimes you may be going well with little discomfort and high hopes, when suddenly a SCRIPTED event will turn the tides, and while that is awesome in the challenge aspect, it is also a bit frustrating that the difficulty comes from simply not knowing what will happen. That means that, once you do know how to handle resources and situations, everything becomes easier. I hope Frostpunk addresses that to some degree.

Still, the game is amazing, and I suggest anyone who wants a challenge and a much more gruesome, gritty and dire RTS to give this one a go.",1673822116,1673822116,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

4/5 Very well made but lacking in content. 

Took me 16 hours to work out and beat 2 senarios. Soon to try the last one. More are promised to come but we'll see when they do.

Other than that first game in a while that has gripped my attention so quickly and so long in recent times. 

Atmosphere graphics gameplay are all spectacular. 

Game is challenging and has a steep learning curve which makes beating it very satisfying. When I beat the first senario I took a photo and recorded it and sent it to my friends who also owned the game. I haven't done that for years. 

Do yourself a favor go in blind and learn the game and try to beat it. You will fail. It will be frustrating. But when you beat it you'll be estatic.

Maybe one of the hardest base management game I've played lol. But the ruthless of choices. But it's the most realistic ones, nothing that perfect and not having any side effects. Glad I started it easy. I can imagine if I upped difficulty to hard lol. So until I understand how the game works, I'll play easy 1st.
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ The game graphics is beautiful, its depressing, steampunk, winter fest. But its really good.
+ The gameplay is a bit weird at start but I starting to get into it. Easy to understand hard to master.
+ The law/decisions everything had its plus and minus so safe often if you regret it lol.
+ You can be full Tyrant or Cults lol. Have their own Upside/Downside. I often choose order tho since its easier to play the game if hope isn't a problems.
+ The resources at the start is hard to get by but later, it get easier.
+ You can have giant automatron if you lack of people to work in factories lol, and they are winter proof. So produce much especially the 1st scenario that will mostly kept your people in home and not working.
+ The soundtrack is really beautiful. None of them felt sore in my ear, immersive even i can feel the temperature drops IRL lol.
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The tutorial doesnt tell much especially at workshop upgrades so you need to read the tutorial the most. So the game wont tell you much as you play but there's a guide manual in game so you must read it.
- Save often so you wont regret choices, the game doesnt have autosave which is a bad/good thing for some people. So if youre screwed far you must replay from last save or even from start.
- The snapping of buildings sometimes annoying you must destroy them and it awlays eat some resources and not snap efficiently.
- The steamcore/things that you can only find in exploration is sometimes too rare lol. But idk that's make the game longer I think. It's all RNG there to actually getting what you actually need.
- The scout can be died if storm is coming/random events to save survivors or trying risky things. And they are a bit expensive to replenish and you lose any items they had before.
[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The game deserve it GOTY title, unlike those self proclaimed Far Cry 6 dan Cyberpunk 2077 that should win scam of the year 2022.

But why, Oh why!.. would you suffocate the city building in to a tiny whole? This feels Very much claustrophobic to the whole design of the game.  There are a few  bugs related to camera clipping and rotation. Like the UI system for example (any chance making it smaller, so the city that you built is actually visible and not abstracted by giant menu all the time?) . Also I wish this game had ""STATS"" at a Glance mechanic... Similar to how they had it in Banished or Farther Frontiers, where you are able to keep track of all of your villagers at once. So like a full statistics about all villagers in one place where you could assign and unassign them instead of 3 different places.... Because the game forces you to play in a very tiny area it is very difficult to see the buildings and the road connections.. it took me a few hours to figure out that a lot of my buildings wernt' simply connected to the road and that was the reason why they were not working properly. 

I love the FrostPunk concept, but it is just too TINY to play... Feels like you are forced to cramp your whole city in to this very small tiny area... Every time you zoom out even a little bit the giant frozen wall abstracts like 30%- 40 % of your play view.... I do not understand how this is a feature.  The biggest struggle for me was selecting building (and I know you can see them in you menus, but it not the same) It just feels chaotic.

 I think if the Frozen wall was 2-3 times wide, so you can really sink in to the ground and look at your city it might have helped.

The setting, a frozen post-apocalyptic world, is both bleak and beautiful, and the choices you have to make as the leader of your society are often difficult and morally gray.

One of the things I love most about Frostpunk is the sense of urgency and tension that is present throughout the game. Every decision you make has consequences, and you're constantly struggling to balance the needs of your people with the harsh realities of the world you live in.

But it's not just the gameplay that sets Frostpunk apart. The graphics and audio design are also top-notch. The environments are atmospheric and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, adding to the overall sense of tension and desperation.

Overall, Frostpunk is a must-play for any fan of city-building or survival games. It's a thought-provoking and deeply immersive experience that will keep you engaged for hours on end.

Every choice you make as a leader is consequential down the road, especially in more advanced difficulty levels. Some consequences are predictable, some just hits you in the face like cat's piss in the morning. It's maddening that even if you save, it's not a guarantee that the same problems will not occur down the road.

I especially liked how Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs can be applied by the player to the game. First playthrough half my villagers died because of not lack of housing. Second playthrough got better until food ran out and most starved to death. Third playthrough saw my healthcare being overwhelmed. Fourth failed due to my inability to control discontent and hope. I finally finished it in the fifth playthrough, after carefully following Maslow's theory. I hate school.

Of of the few strategy games to come out that really captured my attention--The Guild 2, Republic: The Revolution--this one easily reigns.

When I'm playing, the hours fly, and I'm completely sucked in.

It’s still very good.

First off, this game is beautiful, to the ears especially. AAA games have this level of polish, but they take weeks of your precious off time, and are never base-building sims. Frostpunk gives you a AAA-like base-building sim in a short playtime (it’ll take you 10-12 hours max to complete the first campaign, which is a full story in of itself and a great stopping point for time-strapped gamers out there; and another 20 to complete the others), and it’s a treat to behold. And the soundtrack–oh, the soundtrack–is possibly enough to justify the playtime by itself. It’s all quiet foreboding strings when things are warm, but epic and trumpety and Marvelesque, even, when things are going very badly, such as in the great storm featured in the first campaign. The visuals and effects make you feel like you’re not so much playing at a computer as you are looking through a window, perhaps from the balloon you deploy early in the game, down at the settlement.

Visuals are nothing without gameplay, of course, and Frostpunk mostly doesn’t disappoint there. It’s fun to build a city, power it, heat it, and grow it. If you’re trying the game at a higher difficulty, or going for achievements (I’m currently trying a Hard No-Death run), the game starts to feel like a puzzle. Everything is deterministic in the game, which I’m absolutely fine with. You are able to come up with a strategy, a build order, a plan for each mission in the campaign, and if you have the right plan and execute it perfectly, you’ll keep everyone alive through the cold. It’s fun to do, and it works.

Also, back to the visuals for a moment: The circular design of base-building is unique to Frostpunk, in my experience. The “grid” is circular, surrounding the generator, resulting in a city that almost seems to be worshiping it. It’s beautiful. Building a city is fun just because of how it looks.

Which brings me to perhaps the weakest part of the game: I wish there was more to the lawmaking system in the game, especially once you choose between fascism (“Order”) or theocracy (“Faith”). I don’t hate that the game has you make this choice: Indeed, a society like this may turn to inegalitarian means for security. But though gameplay surrounding lawmaking starts strong (I like choosing between child shelters and child labor), it turns out to be a little too boring after the Big Choice is made (There are few meaningful choices).

I’m excited for Frostpunk 2. I want to find out what happens to New London, and I’d like to see them take another crack at the Laws system in the game.

It’s still a masterpiece, and regardless of price, you should play it.

Original 2018 review follows below:

Frostpunk satsified the fantasy I never thought I had: Running a colony in a frozen wasteland. It blends the survival and RTS genres with a compelling narrative, laying the responsibility of the lives of dozens and then hundreds of humans in your hands.

it has no tutorial. Its beyond fustrating to hear the game go ""hahahahahahaha you lost"" essentially. 
I could have collected resources by just clicking on the resources and sending people there. And not build a hut or something...

you got the book of laws and ..... Yea they want you to essentially make ""Hard decisions"" to balance 2 bars. Hope and Dispair .. If either goes to 100 you loose. 


but its pretty looking..and in a city builder. You just build a city and look at the people. Also its fun to collect resources and to balance out against the cold , hunger , building needs(hope/dispair). 

Probably going to be a while before i reach the end. Few more mistakes. Cool new fun toys in the research building to play with... resource wise...maybe more idk

I can truly say, Frostpunk is fun. It feels gritty, choices matter, death is always a decision or two away. The hallmark of a true survival game. Certainly no hand holding. 

Definitely excited for Frostpunk 2.

I only have a few issues about certain game elements.

Why does the coal thumper produce coal that needs to be collected? Why does the coal thumper have a stockpile limit? When the coal mine collects automatically. No matter the amount of gathering posts, there isn't enough hours in the work day to collect it all. Now that I think about it, it's only the coal thumper that produces materials that need to be collected. Seems a little unnecessary to have a building solely for collection of one material. I mean aside from when you've gathered all the starting bundles.

The research tree feels extremely bare bones. I feel like the current available upgrades are only a taste of what extensive list of options that should be discoverable. 

Once you get about 2-4 Automatons, they kinda render your workers obsolete. On endless, it gets pretty boring having 1000 people and only 200-400 actually work. Not to mention how restricted workplaces are, should be way more job spaces. Especially when a storm is on the way and you need to direly prepare.

The Generator gets on my nerves ngl. The short starting range, how even having the overdrive on can spark the ""It's about to explode!"" decision. How coal hungry the damn thing is all the time. Sometimes it feels like ""Coal gathering and feeding a generator simulator"".

Why can't you set the work hours? Conditions people aren't allowed to work in? Like a night shift option would make so much sense. Things that would allow you to avoid having sick and gravely ill citizens. To be blunt, I feel the aesthetic was prioritized a little more heavily than the actual game play.",1672446920,1672446920,True,11,1,0.621876060962677002,0,True,False,False

Things are already pretty bad when you begin the main story; the unexplained climate and societal collapse causes refugees to flee, Fallout Vault style, to isolated generators which pump up heat from the earth to shelter small communities from the snow. As you might suspect, it's pretty stressful being one of a handful of people just trying to stay alive in deeply sub-zero temperatures... but then It Gets Worse. As days go by, the temperature will drop more and more precipitously - avoiding spoilers, you (the player-manager of New London) will need to gather resources, research improvements, and sign laws in order to keep your population not only alive, but also contented and hopeful. Naturally, therefore, the challenge comes from balancing all of these as Things Get Worse for the settlers.

There's a lot to say about the game mechanics - which I would usually put here, but will instead leave further down so that potential new players can experience the game as naively as possible. What must be made clear, however, is how incredibly invested you become in your communities, and how (surprisingly) emotionally taxing it can be when they crumble. I have never cried at a movie and generally don't get hit by strong bursts of emotion, but it was hard not to get a little choked up during the final cutscene, after you've experienced first-hand the struggles settlers have gone through and the decisions you feel you had to make which have lead to, perhaps, more pain and suffering that they need've experienced. The same goes for each of the DLC scenarios, which I experienced several years after completing the main storyline - the [spoiler]failure of a healthcare system overwhelmed by refugees, with each death toll a stab in the heart[/spoiler] in The Refugees; [spoiler]explosion of the generator before you've managed to evacuate everyone[/spoiler] in The Fall of Winterhome; the [spoiler]coming of the first frost, or the industrial accidents[/spoiler] in The Last Autumn; the [spoiler]desperate gathering of supplies for a New London on the brink of collapse[/spoiler] in On The Edge - each one brought those same emotional highs and lows. [strike]I will go into more detail about the DLCs when I review the Season Pass specifically, but[/strike] can't do that lol. To summarise: each scenario functions like a total conversion mod of the main game - some, like The Last Autumn, are virtually unrecognisable at the beginning - but each is, undeniably, worth your time after the main story.

[i]The next paragraph contains low- to mid-level spoilers about the mechanics of Frostpunk which may influence how you play the game - I strongly recommend going in blind![/i]

I played Frostpunk back when it first came out, and (at the time, on a different website) wrote something about the morality system at play, on which the real, player-imposed 'challenge' is based on. In short: when it came out - and, I believe, to this day - it contained one of the more thoughtful approaches to video game morality i'd seen up to that point, an enormous leap forward from Bioshock-tier 'press x to be a terrible person' mechanics. The game forces you to choose between two ideological systems (based on either 'order' or 'faith') which, on top of the positive effects on hope and discontent, provide production and health/healing bonuses respectively; this starts off pretty innocuously with watchtowers and chapels, but as you enact laws deeper into that tech tree it rapidly escalates into propaganda centres and crucifixions. Crucially, however, the extent to which the player-manager delves into the thinly-veiled communist or theocratic nightmare is, ultimately, up to them; when I watched streamers play it at the time, this caused a certain amount of anger as many of them believed they were 'forced' into extreme measures, and adopted an interesting denialism that it could have gone any different - which can be disproven almost immediately on a second playthrough, since understanding of the game mechanics and the general progression of the game makes it quite easy to keep things cheerful, with no need to resort to public executions, torture, etc. That's not to say it's a loss-condition as such to descend into hell, except for insofar as you feel quite bad about torturing a bunch of people; the game will [spoiler]admonish you during the final cutscene if you have 'gone too far'[/spoiler], but will [spoiler]praise you if you don't. 'The line', in case you were wondering, is protector of the truth/righteous denunciation and pledge of loyalty/forceful persuasion - mostly reasonable, I think, although one which has the potential to cause arguments and fuel denialism[/spoiler]. It is this self-reflection - on top of the normal 'discontent was too high/hope was too low' - which constitutes the real challenge, and it's one pulled off so well that you, like me, might well be mulling it over for a while after you've uninstalled the game.

[i]Spoilers end.[/i]

I personally find the HUD very easy to navigate. Compared to some other civilization games, this game has very little visual clutter.
It is decently replayable, especially with the custom gamemodes, but the progress in each individual run is relatively linear and straightforward. There is an element of RNG when it comes to the placement of resources and scout locations, but it's usually not enough to drastically change how you play the game. There are a few rare random events which can have huge effects on the run, but they're so negative that it's hard for me to want to continue the run. 
As for replayability, I would strongly recommend buying the standard game first, and if you decide you like it, definitely buy the season pass. The other gamemodes are very interesting and change up the game in cool ways.
The only moderate issue I have recently had with this game recently is that the menu for the beacon in the Arks gamemode is terrible. It took me forever to find the little arrow to press to scroll over to the automaton relief option. Would be best to just show all 2-3 options in the menu, there's plenty of room.",1672308805,1672308805,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hate the brutal mission, I hate the brutal environment, I hate the brutal attitudes of the Karens that we decided to lead NORTH!!!! when the world is freezing over.  (Seriously WTF were we thinking?)  I hate pretty much every facet of the MFing game... and yet I'm still drawn in trying to save the world, every stinking time, even knowing it's doomed.  The DLC has made the gameplay tolerable; most of all, however, I've learned that playing COOP makes the game even a shade enjoyable.  ""Wait, what?"" You are asking, there's no COOP mode in this game!?!?  And there isn't, officially.  I bought the game for a friend, and we 'play and pass' on the couch when we're in the mood.  That IS fun, because really, misery does enjoy company, and I've found that as a City Builder, I am way less likely to tell my tinys ""Die, you ungrateful b-tards!"" and go on a suicidal meltdown of the main reactor if I have someone to trade off with, take a break, eat some snacks, and chill for a bit.  So my recommendation to the game builders is this:  create a multiplayer option, and people will keep playing your game.  My recommendation to players is similar:  if you want to play this game over an hour before rage-quitting, buy some DLCs and get some similar-minded friends to join you on the couch.",1671839591,1671839591,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Really loved the little reference to the explorer Nansen thrown in offhandedly -- I just read Madhouse at the End of the Earth last winter and it's still very fresh in my mind. The only real complaint I have is that the scenarios don't have a lot of varying behaviors within each, so once you know where the storyline is going.

I played three times and lost every time and then quit. I knew it was supposed to be a ""great game"" but I decided I had too many other games I hadn't played to waste time on one like this that had opaque mechanisms (you don't know exactly what's further down the tech tree until you research stuff above it) making advanced planning difficult if not impossible without resorting to wikis & reddit etc to get spoilers on future events & tech. Yes I understood it was kind of meant to be that way, sort of a rogue-like resource management/pausable-RTS, but it just wasn't for me so I quit.

I didn't think about it for a full day. I went on to play a random pickup-&-play game I like until I decided on which meatier game to dig into and put it out of my mind.

But then it came back to me. Thoughts of what I'd done wrong. Ideas for how I might do better. Nothing resembling a grand strategy but something to get me past the first big hurdle I'd found annoying enough to decide I didn't want to deal with it anymore.

So, I loaded it back up & began from scratch. My vague strategy succeeded, I passed the hurdle, and finally understood enough of the mechanics to see the shape of things and want to see where things lead.

In the end, I did not at all have the patience to play it ""pure"" and wait until l researched things to see if taking a certain branch was worth it down the road, and save scummed at least once when the game presented an option with fairly significant consequences before really explaining them, and oh by the way the outcome is determined by a RNG.

I looked at wikis and reddit posts and tried to glean a bit of knowledge about optimization without completely ruining things by turning it into a min/max Excel spreadsheet with a fancy interface.

And I enjoyed myself along the way. Enough that I'm writing this review right after buying the two main pieces of DLC, one of which is a prequel of sorts and the other-- not a sequel, but more of an epilogue. 

Oh, and I was a right #($hole to the people. Not by design, but because the the NPC's in this game couldn't get their heads out of their undersides. It was the the quite literal apocalypse and they complained about issue of convenience or practicality as though Buckingham was still up & running & living high on the hog while they starved the Irish to death. You know what kills ""hope""? (a core metric in the game) Watching your kids die because some idiot caused a riot over having to eat soup or complained that their kid was asked to drag garbage from the rubbish heap to turn it into something useful.

If you've read the game's description here on Steam then it's no Spoiler to tell you the game gives you a minor guilt trip in the form of a ""But At What Cost?"" at the end if you don't go down the path of sunshine & rainbows. But what more should you do for NPC's at the end of the world? I have them work to do, a  Pub to relax in, and lots & lots of entertainment. I'm not the grinning programmer that thinks they're clever with their ""at what cost"" question, yet only bothered to put in **fighting pits** as the **only** form of entertainment and then ushers players down the path of either Saintly Demagogue or Bastard Despot. I'm just playing their game-- and enjoying it!-- which says as much about them as it does about me.

Alright alright, it wasn't just fighting pits. You could optionally allow booze & whores. I decided to allow the booze but punish drunkards who abused it. Prostitution seemed a pretty stupid option to waste labor on when I already had to choose between having enough food to avoid eating soup or enough coal so people wouldn't freeze to death. (I chose to eat soup and, awful as I was at the game, still managed to make enough halfway decent design choices so that after a few week everyone was on solid food AND not frozen). Besides, as far as brothels went I figured that anyone who survived to the point where I could make that choice was minimally practical enough make friends with willing partners outside of work hours.

The point is, at the end of the world when you every living person by name and can walk across the entire livable surface of the planet in 5 minutes... at that point? Hope is overrated. Hope is irrational. Hope, taken as a value to be maximized
instead of an an immeasurably small and knowingly unreasonable  delusion is, in fact, deadly. Or at least it is when it's hope that you might do more than just survive, and use that hope as an excuse to decimate the chance of survival. 

All of which is to say, all of the above, despite any appearance of rantish anger or other such ridiculous things to waste time on for a video game, I had a bit of mild frustration playing the game before deciding it wasn't for me, but then gave it one last go and ended up having a pretty good time. I just think it would have been more a more interesting  game world if the developers had moved a bit beyond the simplistic questions of social policy & governance covered in the first weeks of PoliSci 101 and allowed for a broader spectrum of gray area. But while I'm not a game developer I still understand that the complexity & balance of game mechanics for this genre allow for only razor thin margins of error. Balancing even black & white choice making in a way that doesn't kill enjoyment is hard, so my objections here are made very much as observations and wishlists, and not at all chastisements. It's a great game, and I like forward to both the DLC I'm about to play and the full sequel they're working on.",1671597373,1671597373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The challenge of the game is entirely driven by scripted events that catch you off-guard.  That's my biggest issue with the game. If you go in blind, you will fail, by design.  You are then expected to replay the game, and this time prepare for the event that you know is coming up from your last playthrough. If you are still playing blind, you'll fail again because of the next event, and play through a 3rd time...


So in the end you approach the game doing things from the first hour on that are setting the foundation for your city surviving the end scenario - that technically you aren't even aware of yet as a leader.


In short, to win in FrostPunk you need to do things that you only know to do because it's either your 2nd+ playthrough or because you are following a guide. I just can't accept that as good game design. 

If I fail at a game, I want it to be because I made a bad choice. Not because I made a good choice but was given no information on what I was actually preparing for so the choices turned out to be wrong only with the blessing of hindsight.

I am genuinely confused about how so many reviewers talk about ""choice"" in the game when reality is that a choice between ""Do one of these two unappealing things, or die"" isn't really a choice at all and it doesn't make any real difference in the grand scheme of things of which path you take. You can have no amputations and no deaths and the game will still give you a tough time in the ending...

Apart from the intrinsic and fundamental technical under-achievement of this 9GB plus stinker, the music and intro video is hysterical nonsense. A coal fired paddle steamer-icebreaker and oh dear the world is freezing... How the foog is this possible as coal dust would lower the freakin' albedo, not to mention the firedamp and other greenhouse gases released from mining that coal. Jebeezuz tiddy fooging kerist. The heat from the furnace would melt the ice, the pall of smog would stifle all life, apart from some happy little Gammaproteobacteria infesting the water intakes of the boiler, and the ashfall would paint the world black.

Yet none of this is presented in the intro. Ridiculous crypto climate denial.

EDIT:
I played this on my desktop machine and it expects way more than the skimpy specs listed on the store page. The game is still really horrible, just because the interface is a disgusting distracting humourless clunk-fest.
Could not get into it at all. What a waste of time.
The zoom, pan, camera lensing all these worthless artefacts along with a dreary soundtrack...

Absolutely fantastic storytelling, soundtrack and theming. Will happily question your morals.

I used to play a lot of RTS games, but I never really played them against my friends. PvP was just frustrating and a way to make us break out in arguments after a 6 hour game (or 20 minute if your friend rushed you). I spent hours and hours playing against the computers though. Then it was about managing resources, and dealing with issues as they showed up.

Frostpunk is a lot like that. The violin in the soundtrack will tug at your heartstrings, and houses will not just show how warm they are on the heatmap, but have different amounts of snow on them depending on how warm they are. The mechanics are solid and make sense, both from a gameplay perspective and from a world theme perspective. 

Frostpunk also asks you fun questions:

Do you bury your dead? 
Do you throw them out into the cold so they become corp-sicles so you can slap their organs in someone else when theirs start to fail? 

Is it wrong to use force to keep people in line for their own good? 

Is it better to help everyone at the cost of your own stability, or do you covet your resources making sure you and your city survive?

It's not a horror game, it's an existential horror game. Each decision has it's own benefits and drawbacks and after a couple missteps suddenly you'll be deciding whether the moral high ground is worth being lynched by the mob because they're panicked and scared.

The weakest part of this game is probably the number of scenarios. There's sadly only 5 or so, and while they're all reasonably different, they're all kinda short, ""Endless"" mode can be solved and eventually you just have nothing left to do. There are difficulty sliders, but they don't necessarily make the game more fun to replay. Unless you like replaying the same scenario over and over, you'll probably put this game down after 20 or 30 hours...which isn't always a bad thing.

I'd really recommend Frostpunk if you enjoy resource management at all, because it's probably the best example I've seen. A smaller playtime means that it doesn't overstay it's welcome, even if you wish it would. It'll probably give you some new things to think about in the process.",1671308221,1671308221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
