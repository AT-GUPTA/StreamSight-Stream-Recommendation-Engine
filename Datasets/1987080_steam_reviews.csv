My GPU is a 4080, my CPU is a 5700X, and my HMD is a Quest 3 (connected via SteamLinkVR on a wifi6 network). On the default resolution scale of SteamVR (150% in my case) the game will run at less than 1 FPS on low graphics with antialiasing, SSR, and Volumetric lights off. 

The maximum resolution the game runs at is 1784x1912, a single pixel higher and the game will run at 1 FPS instead of the 72 I have it set to target

The game uses insane amounts of VRAM, so if you are using an older card the game may perform even worse.

Alongside this, the most recent level added to the game WILL NOT LAUNCH IN VR.
The old VR lobby was incredibly disorientating since it locked your view, the new lobby is even worse since it locks your view AND puts you in third person without a theater screen. There are also some points in maps where you will be teleported if you are playing in VR.

The levels themselves are decent (puzzles, environment), but the AI is a little basic and doesn't really pose much of a threat.

I give the game a 5.5/10 overall (3.5/10 for VR), most of this is due to performance issues and bugs (like join in progress not working EVER)
I personally believe that the devs added the workshop feature as an excuse to stop adding new content to the game, so I do not believe any of the issues will ever be addressed.

I would not recommend buying the game as it is today, but if you just want a quick few hours of horror with the homies it's ok, nothing special.",1707604569,1707604569,False,9,3,0.578444063663482666,0,True,False,True

I personally, and take this with a grain of salt, do not like how difficult this game is just playing through the first two levels. Apparently this game has over 1,000 levels, and I could barely put a dent in that number. The main reason for this was that the monsters were too powerful and that the map was very large and hard to manage where to go. Even though that's the point, it was executed poorly in my vision. I'm going to leave it at that. The game has a lot of opportunity, and I really do believe that it is one of the greats in the horror genre, but I myself wouldn't classify this cherry at the top of my list.

Anywho, Project MKUltra was an illegal human experimentation program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and intended to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used during interrogations to weaken people and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture. It began in 1953 and was halted in 1973. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions, such as the covert administration of high doses of psychoactive drugs and other chemicals without the subjects' consent, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, and other forms of torture. MKUltra was preceded by Project ARTICHOKE. It was organized through the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence and coordinated with the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories. The program engaged in illegal activities, including the use of U.S. and Canadian citizens as unwitting test subjects.

If I can't even access my steam menu through the button that is supposed to bring it up in a game where I have to recenter myself, that's already a red flag for me.

I got to an elevator portion in which I tried every combination under the sun, even looking around for any extra clues and whatnot and it wouldn't let me out of that one section. I'm getting a refund as soon as I figure out how. 
TL;DR 
-Can't join other multiplayer lobbies
-For some reason I can't access the steam menu normally through the button mapped for it(whether that is the dev's fault or a fault of the headset itself is beyond me, but this is the only game that had the issue, so take that for what you will)
-Elevator portion is either impossible to get past or it might just be a skill issue.

The atmosphere is there but it doesn't last long, while you become immersed in searching the clues for puzzles.
One huge disadvantage is how OP the lockers are. You are essentially immune while entering it (mid animation) and even if  the barbed wire monster sees you enter it, he can't remove you out of it to insta-kill you or at least to continue the chase.
As a last thing, it's rather forgiving. You receive plenty of supplies to stay alive and monsters have a big spawn interval so you can figure out clues for the next puzzle.

If you have 2-4 friends to play this with I fully recommend it, but only with friends.


The biggest issue is the inventory; it's so extremely tedious to equip anything from your inventory, the only things that have a keybind are your flashlight and radio. Everything else, you have to press I, scroll down if you have a lot of items, click it, click use and if you unequip it or pull out your light or radio, you have to do that all again. The game gives you so many items to use like snowballs, spray paint, breadcrumbs and even a motion sensor but it's just such a pain to use any of them it's not even worth it.
Why there isn't just a toolbelt that is bound to 1/2/3/4 that you put items in I don't know but it's really annoying. 

Another issue is specifically with the party level(I don't know what level# it is but it's after the parking area). Maybe it was an issue with my system or settings or maybe it is part of the game but that level is so stupidly dark I could not see a fucking thing. You get the motion sensor before that level and the monsters are all around you so it's incredibly useful to have, but without the flashlight I was completely blind so I had no choice but to not bother with the motion sensor.
Besides not being able to see, the level was just very frustrating in the gift stage.

For some reason every player only has 10 lives, if you die 10 times you are permanently dead and just have to spectate or leave. It never happened to me but it did happen to one of my friends I played with and it seems like a really stupid design choice. Nothing breaks immersion and ruins the enjoyment of a game like not being able to play it or having to quit out, invite everyone back and restart from the beginning of the last level.
Death is really not avoidable, especially on the party level where you just cannot avoid it because there are multiple monsters in extremely tight spaces and absolutely nowhere that is safe to hide.",1703409912,1703409912,True,10,1,0.655506670475006104,0,True,False,True

No save option = no thumbs up. 

Having a busy life precludes being held hostage by a game that chose such an omission intentionally.

Other than that, there have been only minor (but persistent) glitches so far, smooth controls, great graphics overall, and a solid take on the Backrooms genre. I'd rank it in the top five or six Backrooms games, and would rank it higher if not for the head-bob mechanic (nearly universally loathed, but someone out there always thinks it will add realism to their game. I don't get a headache when I walk down the street, and I shouldn't get one when my character does in a poor attempt to mimic greater realism) and the aforementioned lack of a fu*king save option.

Lastly, there's an awful lot going on for a Backrooms game. I'm avoiding entities, navigating a maze, collecting body parts, looking for VHS tapes, manipulating sculptures to open secret doors, looking for a key and looking for the door that it opens, assigning my collected body parts to the right bodies, looking for clock parts for another puzzle, finding anti-radiation protection and using a Geiger-counter to find more mysteries, and this is all just in the first level...and there may be more as I haven't completed all of this due to the lack of a save function and having to start over each time!",1673149748,1703296700,False,14,2,0.546245455741882324,0,True,False,True

problems:

Lighting. Its way too dark everywhere from what a normal version of the backrooms would be. It has that mystical black fog effect, so when you've got a flash light shining it really only shows you about twenty feet before dissipating into darkness. I'm guessing this was done to make it more spooky, fear of the dark and what not. But the specific horror the backrooms entails is not the claustrophobia, its the idea of huge spaces that are vastly empty and familiar. In other words, if the lighting was better and allowed you to see much further, it would add to that visual and psychological spook element the backrooms is known for.

Stamina: bad. So there are three movements. There's either walk at a tip toe pace, or there's crouch walk at an even slower tip toe pace, and then there's sprint which is drained quite fast. Essentially, you're best bet to not get murdered by an entity is to walk at a snails pace, and then only sprint once its spotted you and you have to run away. Basically to play smart you have to play painfully slow and boring. Ultimately, you're going to sprint a little bit to get places, which means that at some point you're going to be running from a monster, run out of sprint, and then you are simply forced to walk at a snails pace while an entity is whacking you. Simply put it is just not the way to do it. It feels absolutely wrong and wonky to imagine tip toeing away from a monster that's wacking your ass. the non sprint speed should be a little faster, fast enough to be reasonable. If necessary to add difficulty back, lower the sprint speed slightly but increase the walking speed. This would balance everything out and play with so much better flow, not having to tip toe all the time at a snails pace.  

Entities: Neutral. Not factoring in the whole running out of sprint and having to tip toe away from an entity, the entities actually feel quite respectable. They look scary enough and behave in a way that I would say seems appropriate for the quality of this game. My only complaint is ive seen entities walk straight through doors which seems cheap. Overall I'd say entities are a neutral element in the game, they aren't excellent and they aren't poorly done either. SPOILER ALERT- there is one segment in the pool rooms where you have to navigate past a BUNCH of these arm spaghetti human meat ball looking things, and there's like a dozen if not more of them in one pool. You have to go around them and if you go to close they eat you. I think theres simply too many of them for it to be considered fair. END SPOILER.

Gameplay: Bad. It's pretty much entirely puzzle oriented. And its way too many puzzles and each one is unnecessarily difficult. Expect to look up multiple guides per level. For example on the second level i believe, you have to solve like four puzzles to progress which feels absolutely off. (there's two lock boxes that require inputting a simple code... why two lock boxes? theres already two other puzzles so just have one lock box, its already more than enough. Put both items in the same box). And they aren't easy either. They involve finding over half a dozen parts that are randomly scattered in lockers, so loot EVERYTHING. If anything this game becomes more of an intellectual puzzle game than a horror or backrooms game. It is just so off. Every level I had to look up multiple guides maybe except the parking lot, since that one doesn't really have puzzles. I'm assuming most of the backrooms audience members are kids, and I honestly cant imagine anyone below the age of 14 being a serious contender for being able to beat this game. I think its like 3 or 5 bucks, well personally I would pay another 5 bucks to have not played it and gotten my time back. It's difficult where it shouldn't be difficult and its easy where it shouldn't be easy. Probably the least fun game ive played in years.

final complaint. I beat the game, got through what was the old ending and even got to a game completion screen and woke up. I knew there was a sewers level so i was confused. I went to the menu to see if it had been unlocked since i  ""beat"" the game allegedly. Nope. Sewers is still locked for me, despite progressing through everything prior to it. Thanks. so basically i put in all the effort to progress through the first 3 or 4 levels, just so i can be denied accessing another 2 levels that i presumably paid for. Theres some youtube guides on the sewer levels but they dont mention it having any quirks or weird pre requisites to unlock. im either guessing something was changed in an update or maybe it requires another purchase as some kind of DLC, either way some kind of notification or identification as to whats going on would be helpful, preferably in the menu where it can say whats going on, whether it needs an extra dlc purchase or what. Cant in good faith recommend this game to a single person.",1701658647,1701658647,False,19,2,0.546751439571380615,0,True,False,True

It became incredibly unplayable at points, i was being camped by entities when i revived so i just died instantly again. The entitys are so frequent that I couldn't do much, when i was having fun gathering and working on puzzles i'd be instantly interrupted by an entity that came out of nowhere despite me sneaking. Level 3 Office with the safe was where I stopped because despite checking MULTIPLE times, i put the code in correctly and it said it was wrong, which became so annoying I had to stop playing. It looked cool and a bit janky which would've been fine if it wasn't for the fact it's basically a locker simulator. 

It was scary at times, but I think if fixed and improved upon the issues I listed, the game would be incredibly fun to play over and over. Right now it's not really playable.",1694918865,1701135446,False,10,0,0.606483697891235352,0,True,False,True

Rating: ★★★★☆

Inside the Backrooms is a captivating exploration into the enigmatic and bizarre realm of the unknown. This indie game, developed by a small team with a passion for the surreal, offers a unique and unsettling experience that will leave you questioning reality.

The game's premise is simple yet intriguing: you find yourself trapped inside a series of interconnected, dimly lit rooms that seem to stretch on endlessly. The minimalist graphics and atmospheric sound design work in harmony to create an eerie ambiance that keeps you on edge throughout the journey. The sense of isolation and claustrophobia is palpable, adding to the overall sense of unease.

One of the standout features of Inside the Backrooms is its procedurally generated levels, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same. This unpredictability contributes to the game's replay value, as you never know what twisted surprises await you around each corner. The developers have successfully captured the essence of internet urban legends and creepy pasta, bringing them to life in a way that's both unsettling and fascinating.

The lack of a clear narrative may be a drawback for some players seeking a more structured storyline, but for those who enjoy a more abstract and interpretive experience, Inside the Backrooms offers a canvas for the imagination. The game encourages players to piece together their own narrative from the fragments scattered throughout the unsettling environments.

However, the game isn't without its flaws. Some may find the controls a bit clunky, especially when navigating tight spaces or trying to avoid lurking threats. Additionally, the randomness of the procedural generation can occasionally lead to frustrating dead ends or situations where progression feels unfairly hindered.

In conclusion, Inside the Backrooms is a commendable indie title that successfully taps into the psychological horror genre. It may not be for everyone, but if you're a fan of atmospheric experiences that leave you with a lingering sense of disquiet, this game is well worth a try. Just be prepared to question your sanity as you navigate the haunting corridors of the backrooms",1700178884,1700178884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pude tolerar los descuidos y modelos 3D de baja calidad cuya apariencia te hace sospechar si se trata de ser assets gratuitos en Escape the Backrooms, porque cuanto menos sabe orientar al jugador y plantea bien los escenarios en función al estilo liminal; mientras tanto, Inside the Backrooms hace lo mismo, pero mucho peor.

Es más complicado orientarse, llegados a cierto punto es casi obligatorio hacer uso de alguna guia, y encima el backtracking es obligatorio si te saltaste algún objeto esencial. En mi caso, jugándolo Co-op con un amigo, tuvimos que repetir varios puzles unas cuantas veces para recuperar objetos que perdimos al cargar partida el día siguiente.

Y los escenarios parecen menos las backrooms de la leyenda y más un mapa de Garry's Mod.

The puzzles are difficult but very rewarding when you figure them out. If you don't have all the time in the world, I would recommend playing the game on easy. Sometimes there can be some bad RNG where the entities trap you in a corner of the map and end up draining a good amount of your lives on a level that already spent you an hour and a half in. The cons are that there really isn't a way to save your progress in a level from my understanding. You have to finish the level which could take upwards of 2 hours depending on the level, and if you don't finish it, you will have to restart the level in the next session. On the other side, there are some good jump scares and really good level design that makes the game really fun to play with a friend.

It was like wandering through a maze of endless beige hallways, where each flickering light bulb revealed a lurking terror. This game took my fear to new heights, as I navigated through the unsettling monotony of the Backrooms, with every step echoing like a distant ""wah wah wee wah"".

The atmosphere was suffocating, as if the stale air whispered secrets from the forgotten corners. I found myself questioning reality, trapped between the mundane and the macabre. The developers captured the essence of the Backrooms, immersing me in a world where every wrong turn could lead to a spine-chilling encounter. It was like being lost in a surreal nightmare, where the walls watched me with an eerie gaze.

So, my adventurous friends, if you dare to venture into the abyss of the Backrooms, be prepared for a bone-chilling experience that will make your heart race and your mind unravel. This game will leave you trembling, like a leaf caught in an eternal ""wah wah wee wah"" dance. Embrace the fear, and may your journey through the Backrooms be both terrifying and exhilarating.",1698612723,1698612723,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's also good to remind that this game is being made by a very small team which is impressive how much they have done so far and I'm only hoping that it can expand even more and I would love to see more themed events happening (eg. Halloween, Christmas, etc). I think it would make the experience even more fun. 

The only critique I have is that the game should have more checkpoints overall. The reason why I say so, is because in my case in the level of the offices was a bit hard and the birthday puzzle was also a bit difficult and after we were able to reach the pool rooms part me and my friend both died and we had to do everything all over again and it can be a little bit frustrating. 

But overall and besides that part, it's a really good and fun game to play with your friends and I absolutely recommend not only to play on Halloween but at any time you wanna get yourself and your pals into a spooky and interesting adventure with some cool puzzles to solve while you're trying not to get killed by the entities that live inside the Backrooms.

Review done.

Why I stopped playing and will probably NOT come back to it:
It took me about 8 hours to beat the first map, or rather watch my friend beat it, since I ran out of lives (I spent my last life in the pool section, right before the end).
I played a bit of the sewers (second map) after that which, I believe, has a prerequisite before you can gain access to it. The prerequisite, I believe, was to get far enough through the first map, which I did.
A new map was released recently, which I was excited to play through with the same friend. However, since I had not fully beat the first map, I had no access to the new map. Now, I do not plan to play through the first map AGAIN, since I basically completed it in coop but died last minute.

They are both Backrooms themed escape room games but there are pros and cons to both. This review is coming from someone who has played both games with a friend (no singleplayer experience). If you are looking for a fun backrooms themed escape room game to play with a friend, Inside the backrooms is the game you should buy. Escape the backrooms seems to follow more of the lore of the backrooms while Inside the backrooms seems like an escape room game that is Backrooms themed. In Inside the backrooms each level is carefully crafted with puzzels that interlock with eachother. Escape the backrooms just seems to have an exit somewhere and plop you into a new area. Escape the backrooms has many more levels compared to inside the backrooms, but they can be short (15min). Inside the backrooms has many puzzels to each level and can keep you inside one level for sometimes 2 hours (there are also multiple endings). Inside the backrooms does not have a sanity meter like Escape the backrooms but if anything I think that makes the game better even though it is not as realistic to the actual lore. The walkie talkie situation in Inside the backrooms is a bit annoying so I would recommend using a third-party voice chat app. Overall I think Inside is the better game because it is more catered to the experience of the player (there are emotes) while Escape the backrooms is more trying to imitate the lore of the backrooms (no emotes), but if you have money to spare def buy both.

Play yet another backrooms games with puzzles and stuff to do with friends. The puzzles in this one are often laden with too much pressure that honestly just makes it no longer fun. To that end, while you have a generous amount of health to be able to take hits, the amount of entities that you can encounter is honestly too much and makes the game less scary and more annoying than anything. The tension almost never gets to build up.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
You are John Backstreet Boy and you get sucked into the backrooms by a fucking .jpg, It honestly awful that there is some weird ass entity at all there, it just looks dumb. It would be better if you just stumbled in there or if that scene were done with proper creepy tension instead of whatever that was.

[h1]The Visuals:[/h1]
This is one of the best looking backrooms multiplayer games. Especially in regards to the characters and the way they look wearing the hunchback banana pajama outfit. The animations are still quite jank especially the way your character leans forward with the posture of a drinking bird in stasis.

[h1]The Sound:[/h1]
The voice acting in this game is dog water. It's a level of bad where I feel anyone can do a better job than what was done. I'd offer to do the lines for free if it meant I did not have to hear that dumpster fire of a performance. The ambiance and sfx for the entities is one of the pillars to this game's sound work. Too bad the entitles get spammed so much that the sounds they make actually becomes obnoxious.


[h1]The Experience:[/h1]
After coming off the heals of Escape the Backrooms, I expected that this would be a much more premium experience. While enjoyable, it certainly was not. It scratches an  itch, but it also just feels like a chore. Here do a puzzle while I swarm you with enemies you have to run from every 2 seconds. It had a cool/scare factor for the first 5 minutes, then it just became just an annoyance. The party room puzzles were notably, neat in concept but mostly just a frustrating mess. The writing was also bad, and too confidently placed in the game for it to not be issue. Overall the experience was mid, and you would be better off playing a different backrooms game for now. Hopefully development does not stop on this game so I can change my overall recommendation.

Hopefully I see more games like this in the mere future.


Update on review: as much as I want to keep the positive review for this game. The lobby functioning is terrible. Loading sometimes freezes where you have no choice, but to exit out of the game entirely. I believe this needed to be mentioned in the beginning, and for future reference you need to have a option set for either US or other country lobbies.

At first when I got this game to enjoy with some friends we got so demotivated because the features of the game just didn't suit us. There was no real option to load from a specific point that you had reached and there was no help when you died to find the effing door to revive yourself... Also some other features that were just making the game less fun (that I won't mention due to spoiler risk) have now been changed as well...

Therefore, the game as it is NOW is actually very nice. The devs have made some major changes to the game in a short amount of time. We decided to give it a new go and it is now exactly what we wanted the first time we played it. Sure, there are scarier games out there. BUT, this game is a lot of fun with friends and it gives a good scare. The price is also good and just overall, I have nothing really bad to say about the game anymore. I found it well balanced.

Alright I'll break it down for ya with this game, it's not bad, some good horror aspects and everything I'll give it that, with all the updates and everything that have come out and the areas as well as the recent inclusion of workshop support, this game is I think worth it, mainly with friends is where the game shines, It's more puzzle oriented in aspects compared too the horror.

For actual progression things are simpler than they used to be, spawn locations for items and other such things are not terrible, and can be found with just a bit of looking.

It has quite a few backrooms levels that, well are based on the backrooms yes, there's not any random generation for the levels themselves just the items so repeated runs will have that issue.

In terms of content there's a lot of levels here, but for still a main issue, the sewer is not very fun, it has been reworked since my original review, now it is MOST CERTAINLY easier to manage, the entire level isn't water, less rats and more interconnected paths so it won't take you 10 years to run back and forth, however the level is still rather long, with far far too many puzzles for me to comfortably enjoy.

It's worth it for the price, and a not too bad horror game with friedns if you can give it a go.",1661616335,1696355471,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However it can be very tedious if you're not sure what to do, as you need to look for items that can be hard to spot. Puzzles are also randomized, meaning you can't watch a video or look up the guide to get all the immediate answers you need. Example, if you need to enter a password for something, it will always be different each time you play.

Also, entities (or just one) spawn randomly, which can be a pain if you're trying to do something and they keep chasing you causing you to run or hide constantly.

This pathetic debacle of a game is the most piss poor take on the backrooms that I've ever had the displeasure of running on my computer. The sewer and grassroom areas I thought would be a fresh new take on the game since there was an update and I'd attempted to play it twice with my friends already and despised the way I felt afterwards. I was hopeful and left with extreme contempt. 

The puzzles are grueling and exhausting to play through, the steps to complete each chapter were tedious and unforgiving, and after the first 20 minutes of playing it feels like you've been playing for a hour. Playing the game made me wonder if the developers played it themselves before subjecting people to this reprehensible product. The stamina system is flawed and requires entirely too much time to refill if you're being chased by an enemy. It takes less time to cook a hot pocket in the microwave. Upon dying you need to find a door to respawn but the sound indicators such as the heartbeat and angelic harmony bug out and don't occur. Also the trail of light is very obscure and is seldom an accurate path to follow to reach your door. Often times I would respawn and be insta-killed because the enemy that killed me was still stomping around on my body to revel at what they'd accomplished (though it didn't take very much).

Even while playing with a full group of 4 the puzzles started getting more annoying than fun, the office in particular where you have to deal with solving that code on the computer and the way you type on the computer is so annoying why not just let me type it on my real keyboard instead of artificially making it so I'm waiting their longer to find the key and maybe misclicking while the enemy is around to hit me. Don't get me wrong it is doable but just annoying, and man the 3rd area has a lot of backtracking or maybe I just found things in the wrong order. And the pool room is just boring nothing interesting there to see, or any really interesting mechanics but maybe I just don't see the same vision I don't dislike that one I just find it a bit boring. The next thing I dislike is the Sewers and the hotel Those are annoying in my eyes with soooooo many enemies that can instantly kill you and a lot of things that just slow down the process in general. 

That being said everything about this game isn't bad the first part although doesn't scare me I can see some decent atmosphere building. the teamwork aspect can sometimes be fun on occasion like when I was trying to find out the code in the office for the upside-down area or solve the cypher with the monitors. the game graphics don't hurt my eyes and a pretty good too though I will say depth of view seems to cause more problems than it does good like when it doesn't focus on what you want it to. 

hopefully, this can be used as constructive criticism for the devs and a good review for people who want to play this. I'd say go for it if you have a higher tolerance for somewhat annoying puzzles and area design. and if you want to play with some friends, it's a bit jank but not a complete waste of time.",1692871103,1692871103,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Me and my friends gave all the entities funny names so here you go; smiley, demodog, cable man, the dredge, balloon girl, and parasytes (in order of how i first saw them) mister man was also a name i used for dredge and cable in particular

UPDATE: I have many more hours on this game now and it's been updated a lot! Having multiple endings is extremely nice and makes the game more immersive, since it gives you choice. I'm sure it's planned in the future, but I wish the Terror Hotel had a seamless entrance in some way instead of forcing you to remake a lobby for you and your friends.

From the very first step, this first-person horror game plunged me into a realm of unrelenting fear, where the boundary between reality and nightmare is chillingly blurred.

Inside the Backrooms delivers a masterclass in suspense and horror, immersing players into a grim and unsettling environment where escape becomes a desperate struggle for survival. The mere premise of navigating through a labyrinthine expanse of backrooms is enough to send shivers down one's spine, and the game executes this concept with an eerie finesse that is both captivating and terrifying.

The absence of detailed information about the game only serves to heighten the atmosphere of mystery and dread. As I cautiously tread through dimly lit corridors and long-forgotten passages, the unsettling silence is punctuated only by the echoes of my own footsteps. Every turn and every shadow seems to harbor an unknown horror, leaving me perpetually on edge, my heart pounding in anticipation of what nightmarish creature or malevolent force might lurk just beyond my field of vision.

The monsters that inhabit the Backrooms are nothing short of nightmares personified. Each encounter is a heart-pounding race against terror, as I scramble to escape the clutches of these monstrous entities that seem to exist solely to induce fear. The sense of vulnerability is palpable, and every fleeting glimpse of these abominations is enough to send a chilling shiver down my spine.

The game's ability to manipulate atmosphere and tension is a testament to its design prowess. The interplay of light and shadow, the haunting soundscapes, and the oppressive sense of isolation all contribute to an experience that is deeply immersive and utterly spine-chilling. Every creaking floorboard, every distant whisper, serves to remind me that I am never truly alone in this forsaken place.

As I navigate the treacherous terrain of Inside the Backrooms, the quest for escape takes on a profound psychological dimension. The constant threat of danger and the palpable feeling of dread make each decision a life-or-death gamble. Every door opened, every step taken, is fraught with the anticipation of what horrors might be unveiled, and the relentless tension never loosens its grip.

Inside the Backrooms is not merely a game; it's an exploration of fear's darkest recesses, a plunge into the abyss of the unknown, and an adrenaline-fueled journey into the heart of horror. Its ability to immerse players in an atmosphere of chilling uncertainty, coupled with its relentless pursuit of terror, sets it apart as a masterpiece in the realm of first-person horror experiences. If you're seeking an unforgettably harrowing adventure that will test your courage and keep you on the edge of your seat, then brace yourself for the spine-tingling descent into the nightmarish depths of Inside the Backrooms.",1691270028,1691270028,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

1987080,143315549,76561199518699784,0,6,698,0,484,1706359657,"I had an overall negative experience of this game, starting from the later half of level 2 and continuing through to the end. This is not to say that the game is bad however, the first level was very well made, the objectives of it were made clear and it was, overall, a very good level. Below you will find my dislikes. 

My gripes begin with the transition of the parking lot into the office, the puzzles started to become convoluted and (at least to me and my friend) seemingly not thought out, notes began to be unreliable as they read very strangely or provided little to no actual hint on what to do, the levels begin to become quite large (and at this point far more difficult), enemy spawns in these levels worked well, to a degree but could be tweaked slightly.

The partygoer section was truly terrible you are given vague hints on what to do ""find your gift"" , you would assume that this meant there would be one for each player, there is not. Another reason why i claim this top be terrible is the time limit, when wandering through the maze it was incredibly hard to know where to go, finally the partygoer did not use its own rules (this is prevalent in the part where you need to blow out candles). After this the game only gets worse. 

The sewer level. My god. what an abhorrent level. It was far too large for its own good, it was incredibly difficult to know where I was going, the puzzles were terrible, there were no hints to tell us what we needed to do or where we needed to go, for example, the medallions. You need three medallions in order to get a cog, a friend and I spent at least an hour wandering round just trying to find the final medallion all while avoiding as many enemies as possible (which was an incredibly difficult task considering how many hand dudes were wandering about). When we actually find the way to get it we felt it was incredibly stupid as there was no way we could've seen the door in the wall unless we were actually looking for it.

The terror hotel was all in all, a decent level. it was still convoluted and we found that it was a very very poor experience, it would be better to put the door number on the door instead of above it. The steam generator puzzle was aggravating as it had no actual effect on the moths. the gem puzzle was pretty silly, considering that there is no apparent way to pick up the fossils, (the only reason that we were able to do it was because i accidentally clicked on the fossil) due to the glass covering the fossil it would make more sense that you would need to break the glass, but no, you just need to reach through the glass instead. It would make more sense to remove the glass from the puzzle all together as it adds nothing to it. The puzzles were vague and didn't make a lot of sense.

Overall:
The first level is the undeniably the best,
The puzzles start of well but get progressively worse
The increase of map size, puzzles and entity amount per level do not equate to a good experience
The player models and enemy models were well made.

I do not think that it was worthwhile to purchase, it did however provide my friend and I a good experience for an hour or two. I only hope that you find it to be far better than I did.",1691062141,1691062141,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True
1987080,143314704,76561199134379094,0,2,685,0,453,1696366569,"first the positives, the beginning of the game was most enjoyable, the puzzles were layed out, easy to figure out and the map was easy to traverse, it was very understanding in what you needed to do where, with parts just layed out in front of you so you could figure out without trouble what to do, the enemies were iconic and well designed with game mechanics that anyone can get behind.

now the negatives, the second half of the game (mainly the rat sewer level and also the ""terror"" hotel) were poorly designed, the sewer level was FARRRRRR to large with endless amounts of slow and tedious back tracking, with horrible key item placements in ridiculous random spots guarded by enemies with too big a hit box with horrible pathing in too cramped a space. actually figuring out what to do can take hours, but then actually doing the task can take twice as long, over half the play time was just for figuring out where only a select amount of the key item in the sewer were. it was near impossible to figure out everything wit the copious amounts of enemies with horrible pathing and conflicting game mechanics (having to sneak for the rat and hands, then having to run from the ugo dog). the ""terror"" hotel was a good map size BUT there were far too many enemies that were more annoying then anything in a really cramped space where it was really easy to run and get stuck on anything and everything. the ending moth section was weird and buggy and the game didnt make sense on how the steam would actually effect the moths and they just continued to attack me.

in conclusion, the first half is worth the play, the second is a massive steaming pile of dogshit and shouldnt be played until it is reworked or fixed to have A. a smaller more understandable sewer level with properly detailed instructions on where small key items are B. the moths are fixed to actually be effected by the steam at the end of the hotel C. the pathing for the sewer enemies are fixed (they stick to and phase through walls and corners and can attack you through certain walls because of this) D. all objectives are fully understandable (not said exactly what to do but less cryptic and more of a slight guidance of a certain area you do need to be in) E. have objects have key commands on them so then you know how to properly interact with them because it can be confusing when certain turn by pulling left or right and then others are to be turnt with a circle motion or clicked and dragged, when they can just be clicked",1691060903,1691060903,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

but there are very big problems with the game as of currently
-monsters hard camp, very annoying when your basically stuck in a locker for 10 minutes at a time
-random stuff like gas out of the walls or vents isnt explained so its just kinda happening around you without reason
-big one is that there is no way to choose between levels, we finished the first level after 2 hours and wanted to continue later but had to try and speedrun to the office instead after replaying the entire first thing when we came back
-there are no settings to distinct how many lives you have in game, in the description of the game it says you have 3 so you expect that but instead have 10 for each person right now
-again description of the game is wrong, it says there are 4 levels but those aren't out currently or finished so it feels like a scam (hopefully it will be updated in the future but frankly a lot of the description is wrong)
- also items are shared between players, 1 screwdriver and hammer and motion detector to share between potentially 3 people. and during the pool part that is very hard to go through behind one person without everyone dying right at the end of the second level

all in all this was still fun and cool puzzles for the first time but still just frustrating and a lot of wasted time while being repeat killed at times

EDIT:Made that review about a year ago and since then the game has added multiple new levels and features that Im happy to say are great, i played this with a full party of friends each time and am doing this edit now as of august 1st 2023, I personally love the game, there is some things that honestly just didnt like and was a group consensus on being annoying but the game is being constantly updated and even grievances like before the safe being impossible to use half the time was fixed very shortly. 

For annoyances: -the party room maze, super annoying for most of us and the only way it was not infuriating was cause we were on easy mode with infinite lives, the game takes like a half hour if you're not afraid to die just for that one part and i cannot imagine doing that without the motion tracker or a finite amount of lives 
-the AI still is campy in the earlier levels, i understand its kinda what makes it scary but it just adds unnecessary time to the game cause you're waiting to get out of the locker for a lot of the beginning levels
-If you try and play with someone who hasnt hit a certain checkpoint then they just cant play with you, feels like its silly its not an option not to spawn them in with the same items as everybody else as thats what it does for anybody whose hit that point already, for anybody that hasnt and wants to play with their friends then you just gotta give up or go through the whole game from where there last checkpoint is 
-Ingame vc just sucks so use discord
-The sewer level in general just too big for no reason, the water making you slower and the fact that the place is huge is just a headache, we spent 3 hours on that level and half of its because the place is just too damn big for the amount of rooms it has 

Overall if you want a game to just play at 3 AM with a group of friends that are willing to goof around with you then despite all of this I still found this fun to play and would recommend it as  a experience for people to go through, the developer is still working on this and I do hope it keeps improving and providing more levels as I do find the puzzles to be fun when theyre not being wonky before patches",1659841494,1690883536,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

We didn't realize we had to backtrack to the first level to solve a puzzle we had missed because it looked unsolvable at the time (the keypad had 3 dashes but needs more than 3 numbers). After getting through the kinda grueling experience of the office we got to the sewer where I died with the pliers and while spectating my two remaining friends they solved a labyrinth sliding bar door puzzle only to find out they needed the pliers that were on my body back at the beginning were we had split up to cover more ground as we HAD to do in the office. The puzzle of course just assumed they would have the pliers so they would have had to unsolve the puzzle find my corpse in the waterway grab the pliers RE-SOLVE the puzzle they just did JUST to open a door that honestly should have just been unlocked and not require a singler item from the FIRST level, had we dropped the pliers at any point assuming we didn't need them due to the inventory getting overfilled with what is assumed to be no longer needed key items like the geiger counter we would have essentially soft locked ourselves or had to do an egregious amount of back tracking for what feels like something that shouldn't be our fault.",1690778420,1690778420,False,20,5,0.592550218105316162,1,True,False,True

- Entity #3 is broken beyond belief no cues to let the player know in a lot of instances especially on the first level. He needs an audio cue for when you're nearby
 
Sound is not all that great; in most regards.

Gameplay on controller feels like cutting butter.

Am going to redo a review after we beat it but 2 tries this game isn't looking good.

Escape the Backrooms is the better version.

It's a short yet satisfying horror game that captures the essence of the creepypasta lore. But there are a few things we wish we knew before delving into this spine-chilling adventure.

Stamina is a crucial factor, and running around recklessly will quickly drain it, leaving you vulnerable. Respawning is possible, but the door's location changes each time, so don't waste time searching for the same spot. Losing your flashlight means navigating in the dark or finding a replacement, as items don't respawn. 

Puzzles are randomly generated, adding replayability and keeping you on your toes.  Entities in the game may not follow the exact rules from the lore, so don't rely solely on your prior knowledge. The game's order of levels also deviates from the canon, offering a fresh experience. Beware of the birthday party section, as it presents the toughest challenge in the game by far. 

Lastly, while the ending may not be as satisfying as the rest of the game, it's still a worthwhile journey.

Inside The Backrooms is a game that creates tension and offers spooky thrills, but be aware the game as of this review is prone to crashes and glitches. While not present on my end, it was apparent and fairly noticable for a few of my friends. But for $7, I cant really complain.",1689573103,1689573103,True,16,0,0.664954721927642822,0,True,False,True

I love Inside the Backrooms, it's fun and pretty atmospheric when you're relatively new to the game. The puzzles are extremely fun to go through and figure out (for the most part, there are a few that should be re-examined). I have but only a few complaints. Firstly the monsters. I feel as though some of the monsters (Entity #3 and partygoer) are kinda lame and hard to counter. 
To go in more depth; Entity 3 (creepy face) feels like it has little to no counter. It can spawn on your face and have a chance to kill you even though you didn't do anything. Also doesn't go away even if it has killed someone. As for partygoer, I have a huge problem with both the fun room and the creature. The creature in the first section is the worst part due to the fact that it will freeze you in the claustrophobia-inducing maze. It makes it feel crappy, even if you're about to die anyway. I feel as though the whole level needs a complete revamp on how it works. Or make it optional.

This game is objectively bad. It is a travesty of game design. The enemies are unavoidable, the puzzles are boring, and the sewer level in particular is a tedious chore. Walk across the map slowly through sludge, find out you need something from the opposite corner, go back and forth, rinse and repeat. After two hours of trudging back and forth, we realised we still hadn't encountered at least three puzzles referenced in some notes and we decided we'd sooner become sanitation workers in real life because at least it would be rewarding.

The first level will see you cornered by all three enemies at once, you hide in a locker for a while, go to leave the room and they chase you back to the locker. There is no strategy, just luck and patience, of which mine is wearing thin.

Other than that everything else is pretty simple, inventory space is good for most items (other than moth jelly imo but I guess multiple speed run attempts have made me want more), the smiley monster is a pain for sure as sometimes hes camping corners and you just turn right into him so I wish he wasn't able to spawn on you or on a corner that tight. 

The game though is great for early access the secret levels are really fun too. Excited for future levels to be added!! For a simple game this provides a lot of fun for those running it multiple times with different groups testing your ability to work together. Right now my fastest time has been 46 min so I will keep trying for the shorter run. 

If ur a streamer this game can be a lot of fun to stream and relax with friends while also the intensity of it being a bit spooky at times.

Stepping in to those yellow, stained halls immediately had my renal artery quivering in fear. As I ventured forth into the unknown, looking for an escape (and possibly a romance but we'll get to that later), the tension was palpable. Being chased around by such large, imposing, and slightly sexy beings had me in a turmoil I still have yet to come to terms with. Don't even get me started on those dead bodies. 

It changed for me when I arrived in the hotel and saw who I now know as my love, and savior. The rat. That hunky, chunky, funky rat had me head over heels in moments. 

That leads us to now. Here. I sit in this vaguely fecal-y water, pining after those beasts of muscle and pleasure. I fear it'll all change soon, this moth jelly only works as lube for so long.

Decent mechanics, interesting monster designs even though they are pretty much just existing creatures from creepypastas or other games. The two endings I've gotten are pretty disappointing and a little anticlimactic but there are others so I cant speak about all of them. Some sections flat out suck when you replay them especially the sewer. Lots of needless waiting. He broke a few times and just flew through walls or teleported to us though I don't know if thats intentional or what he is supposed to do. Some of the gifts didn't appear the second play through so he ate up a lot of lives until we restarted. The motion sensor broke for 2/4 of us so that left only two of us able to keep an eye on the monsters. All around fun. I'd say playing with friends is probably the way to go and will make it a far more enjoyable experience.

1. Optimization Issues: The game suffers from poor optimization, causing frequent stutters even on hardware that meets the recommended requirements.

2. Graphics: The graphics in the game are subpar and fail to create an immersive experience.

3. Jump Scares: The game's attempts at jump scares are lackluster and fail to deliver the intended thrill.

4. AI: The AI in the game is disappointing, as it can be easily manipulated by breaking line of sight.

5. Puzzles: The puzzles in the game are not necessarily difficult, but rather tedious and lack coherence.

6. Voice Chat (VC) Issues: The voice chat feature in the game does not work properly.

7. Lack of Save Points: Surprisingly, the game lacks save points, which is a significant drawback. In our case, after spending an hour in the first level and dying repeatedly, we discovered that the game did not save our progress. This frustration prompted us to look up a walkthrough, only to realize that we were not even halfway through. This lack of save points was the final straw that led us to abandon the game.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The game is reallyyy good. I love playing it. It is scary at first, but after a while, you will get used to all the dangers and you can improve your skill in this game. It A LOT of fun playing with friends and quite tricky to solve all the riddles. I really like the atmosphere of the game and all the levels, expect the [spoiler] party room [/spoiler], thats also the reason why ""only"" 4 out of 5 stars are given. [spoiler] I feel like the party room espacially with the labyrinth (maze) is more luck based.. I would wish for an alternative to gain the Red Key Card [/spoiler] , as it would be a great opposition to the luck sided gameplay.

Sure, It'll boot into steam VR, but the menus do not work, the frame rate has something dreadful going on that doesn't occur during the normal play mode, and, most egregiously, many scenes in the game put your camera somewhere so you can read a note or something. 

During those scenes, while you can turn your head to look freely, moving your head in any direction does not result in the world moving relative to yourself, which is the most reliable way possible to instantly make a player motion sick. This include mission critical events like reading the names on the bodies, interacting with many of the puzzles, and, most importantly, hiding within a locker.

I nearly puked. I've never gotten that motion sick in a game before, and it happened within 2 minutes in this game.

DO NOT BUY FOR VR.

As a flatscreen game, I cannot see anything that would make me want to play this over the other backrooms games. I'd say skip this, get escape the backrooms instead.

[b]Gameplay[/b]:
The main gameplay loop revolves around solving escape room-style puzzles to progress through each level, with the added challenge of hostile entities from The Backrooms mythos lurking around every corner. While the concept sounds intriguing on paper, the gameplay becomes increasingly tedious the longer you play. The main problem is that the entities are simply way too oppressive, without there being any effective means of fending them off. While the game implies that each entity is attracted only to a specific action such as lights or radio communication, the only truly consistent way of avoiding an entity is by hiding in lockers. This is a huge problem as entities can sometimes camp an area you need to go to progress, and you are left simply hiding for prolonged periods waiting for it to leave. As a result, the gameplay experience very quickly devolves from horror to boredom or frustration.

[b]Level 1: Lobby[/b]
Moving on to the individual levels, the first level of the game is a reference to the iconic Backrooms Level 0, also known as ""The Lobby"". The entities in this level are Entity #3 Smiler, Entity #8 Hound, and the unknown entity from Kane Pixels' Backrooms video series. This level consists of multiple escape room-style puzzles, where each room have clues for a puzzle in a different room, which then unlocks a different puzzle in another room, until you finally unlock the exit. While these puzzles are initially interesting, the presence of three entities in a single level often results in extended periods of hiding and waiting. Very often, multiple entities appear at the same time, blocking both our path forwards and our retreat backwards. This results in us being unable to do anything but sit in place until the entities disappear. And while navigation in this level is supposed to be confusing by design with every turn and corner looking identical, the combination with the three entities have the effect of making the level feel unnecessarily prolonged and dragged out.

[b]Level 2: Parking[/b]
The second level of the game, Parking, most closely resembles The Backrooms Level 1, also known as the ""Habitable Zone"".  For some reason, this level was extremely short with the puzzles all being relatively straightforward, and the only entity on this level is Entity #10 Skin-Stealer. Nevertheless, this level does provide a refreshing change of pace, as rather than simply hiding from the entity, you get an opportunity to instead ""fight back"" against it by [spoiler]locking it out of the room[/spoiler].

[b]Level 3: Office[/b]
The third level, Office, combines elements from various levels in The Backrooms mythos. You start off in what looks like The Backrooms Level 5, also known as ""Abandoned Office"".  The gameplay of this level is very similar to the first level of the game, where you need to go around the level solving escape room-style puzzles. One upside of this level was that each room looked distinctly different from each other, making navigation somewhat more bearable. Unfortunately, the Entity #10 Skin-Stealers on this level is somehow an even more overwhelming presence than the three entities in the first level combined.

Afterwards, you enter a small room which contains a few objects taken from The Backrooms ""Level Fun"", albeit the surrounding environment is still that of an office. Here you will be challenged to a series of life and death minigames by the Partygoers. While the first minigame was rather pleasant, it very quickly devolves into just solving mazes in a given amount of time. Unfortunately, the game fails at the horror element in this section, as the short timer results in repeated deaths that becomes progressively less scary each time you respawn. While the mazes in and of itself are decently challenging without being completely disorienting, the repeated deaths very quickly sours the experience.

Next, we enter into a room containing just a huge swimming pool, with Entity #5 Clump lurking beneath the waters. If anything, I think this was actually the most scary part of the game since you were unable to physically see the entities, and the only way to avoid them was by [spoiler]detecting their location using a proximity sensor[/spoiler]. You could actually do this part without dying, which ironically made it more tense, especially when you see your friends in front of you get dragged underwater. However, there is one major design issue with this section. When you reach the end of the pool, the only way to proceed further is via [spoiler]a red keycard[/spoiler]. Yet, there is no indication of such a requirement prior to going through the pool. Should this happen, it means that you're forced to backtrack through the entity infested pool, with it feeling more frustrating than scary the second time around.

Finally, you once again enter into a section that resembles The Backrooms Level 0: ""The Lobby"". Except this time, it is even more of a maze than the first level of the game. In this section, you need to [spoiler]find the correct door while avoiding the fake ones[/spoiler]. The problem however, is that we didn't realize that if you [spoiler]enter a wrong door[/spoiler], an Entity #8 Hound is permanently unleashed into the maze. As there is no way to reset a level without starting from scratch, this mechanic feels unnecessarily punishing, because it means the more mistakes you make the harder the level gets. This makes the experience very frustrating, as you are constantly reminded of and regretting your mistake, while knowing that you wouldn't have had to deal with the entities if you did it correctly the first time.

[b]Level 4 and Level 5[/b]
For some reason, these 2 levels remain locked even after completing the previous level. It turns out that in order to unlock them, you must [spoiler]replay Level 3: Office and backtrack into Level 2: Parking while having the red keycard on you[/spoiler]. This is an extremely unsatisfying design choice, as the game is basically punishing us for finishing the game by keeping levels locked away from us, and forcing us to replay levels we've already beaten. At this point, I have not completed these levels, and should I end up playing them at a later date, it would only be due to my friends dragging me to play with them.

[b]Technical[/b]:
Aside from gameplay and design issue, the game also suffers from a few technical issues. Considering that this game seems primarily designed for co-op play, it is inexcusable that players are unable to rejoin a session after disconnecting. Not everyone has consistent and stable internet connections, so the possibility of disconnects is absolutely something that the game should have prepared for, especially given that a single level can take at least an hour to complete. Currently, should a player disconnect, the only way to get them back is to restart the entire level from scratch. This not only disrupts the flow of gameplay, but it is also a highly discouraging and frustrating experience.

Additionally, players with higher ping lags when attempting to use the in-game voice chat. While we were able to resolve this issue by communicating via Discord, it does detract from the immersion that the game was going for.

[b]Conclusion[/b]:
In conclusion, Inside the Backrooms presents an interesting concept, but numerous frustrating mechanics hinder the overall experience. While the game's puzzles and atmosphere initially captivate, it fails to strike the right balance between challenge and enjoyment. This serves as a reminder that less can be more, and that the absence of certain elements often evokes greater horror than their actual presence.

It was fun when i had people to play with, but as time went on it kept getting harder to actually play the game.

Despite the time of this review, I have only played through Lobby - Office, back when they were the only levels the game had.
But I do write this review after return from my hiatus
And speaking from right now I cannot see myself playing through it anywhere past that.
This is because in the game's current state,

To start: The game's servers are basically dead.
There are no where near enough public lobbies that are actually public lobbies, and not ""I forgot to set it too private"" lobbies.
Now, I could play Singleplayer, but with all games that are created with multiplayer as the main premise, Singleplayer gets real boring real quick

Secondly: The game is broken.
Now when I say broken, I don't just mean simple bugs with the gameplay, no.
Sometimes joining a lobby would just softlock the game,
and if that wasn't bad enough:
I Don't want to install this game again because it has shown that it can be harmful to my PC.
Leaving a lobby I, myself, created, somehow crashed everything that was connected to my PC. Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, headphones. As soon as I clicked that exit button, everything just flat out died, just from leaving a lobby, not going out of my way to break the game, just LEAVING A LOBBY.

There are a whole lot of other issues I would like to address, but due to my hiatus, and the glaring -getting into the game- flaw, I can't tell what issues still exist, or what issues have been patched",1686262188,1686262188,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It has a pretty good shock factor for the most part and has really good jump scares for the most part. This may look like a lazy backrooms game at first but I would definitely say that this has to be one of the best if not the best backroom game out of all of the replicas being made so far. The Models are actually pretty good as the enemies in the sewers and the hotel actually look very well and the Dead Rats have very good movement and animations. The Bad animations I don't really mind because it is a small company and they make updates where they can and the game is still enjoyable.

And since this was cheap and early access, also watched some youtube videos of earlier levels and one of my friends got the game, we decided to try it!
The levels were big, with numerous puzzles that are connected to each other, a monster or two that dominates each level that we try to avoid. It's scary and I'm a scary cat, but I'm super excited to play this with my friends as they carry me and I focus on the puzzle solving XD. I like that vibe and types of puzzles in it, it's bad for someone who can't remember the map, but I can follow my friends so that's ok.
The one only complain rn is when we left the game midway (during sewers level) and went to eat dinner, the game froze for one of us, so we had to restart the whole level, but it wasn't too hard to catch up on the progress so wasn't too bad. Not sure if it's a steam issue or game but that's the only occurance so far. :)

It's kinda funny to say that the birthday room was one of the scariest experience but somehow I loved it even though it's scary and the idea is soo new and vibrant. I actually tough up and run around the corners to find the boxes since instead of hiding, it's better to find the boxes and pass each level.
There are some glitches like the rats try to chase a friend in the sewer and a group of them got stuck in the corner, which we happily enjoyed so we can run around to find clues when we get stuck XDD so we don't mind if you don't fix that haha.
I was also surprised that the birthday room level had multiple exits?? I still haven't tried the second way that I saw on youtube video, unless it's changed that you have to play birthday room?
We waited for long for the new level so we're super excited that level 5 is out and we'll try it soon! While waiting we got the labyrinthine and escape the backrooms. They were somewhat different, but I think we all enjoyed this game the most in terms of the map size (not too much tedious walking or trying to find the right path), puzzle types and solvability, monsters and how to dodge them, we enjoyed this a lot! Also, we don't feel dizzy after playing for many hours straight, since it's a really big bummer for some games. Please lemme know if you have any questions concerns! :))",1685042731,1685042923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love the combination of puzzle and horror and the feeling of being lost with the beginning of each new level. To find out what kind of monsters might be there and how they react on movement, sound or brightness, etc. was thrilling.

In contrast to what some other people said I did really enjoy the sewer level. It was way more relaxed than the ones before, so that one had enough time to search for items and figure out how the puzzles work. 

Even though, I have to admit, that we restarted the game in easy mode very early. We just didn't want to be game over when being close to the end of a level. But I guess for gamers seeking a challenge, the normal or hard mode might be interesting.

The hotel level was my favorite so far! Please give us more of that! Loved the puzzles and the enemies were fun. Got caught by some pretty good jump scares. I liked that one was exploring different puzzles at the same time, so that there was always something to do and something to find out without the game feeling streamlined.

The only part that I found really annoying was the birthday party. If I'd have played alone that would have been the part where I'd have stopped playing the game.

Very good, very cheap horror survival game themed around the backrooms. There are entities roaming the backrooms that will attack you, and you will have to learn their personalities and react accordingly to survive, all while solving puzzles to continue your expedition through the maze-like backrooms. You have a limited amount of lives using a respawn system. It uses steam co-op system for a total of THREE players, with proximity chat.

The game consists of (spoiler?) [spoiler] 2 [/spoiler] levels, and it takes about 3+ hours to completely finish the game, depending on whether or not you have to restart.",1660550653,1683766078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played this game from start to finish. This game is truly awful. Everything about it is not fun. Having played escape the backrooms and really enjoying it, I figured another highly rated backrooms horror game would be fun. This game however, is totally awful in just about every facet. The graphics suck, it looks awful. The AI of enemies is terrible and just out right annoying. The enemies are not scary, they are extremely annoying and don't add a challenge to the game, just a block of pixels that continuously stay in one spot and never move and can kill you basically instantly. The puzzles are also awful, they are not fun to solve and the rewards are terrible. I have never seen a game with such poor level transitions either, the level variety doesn't feel different. The levels are just the exact same thing with different textures on the walls to make it look different.

Honestly, new update sucks. Waited for this disappointment for months, only for it to be the worst single update to ever drop in the history of gaming. Endless bugs and the new ending is impossible to beat. Also I was playing on the normal difficulty, so I had only 10 lives before I have to start the whole level again. To be honest, the later puzzles just feel like time fillers, there is no fun involved. Only trial and error, except you have lives (if you don't want to play the easy difficulty, but we all know that real men don't play on the easy difficulty) so you have to start over and over again until you beat the whole level. I played for about 1.5 hours (starting from the 3rd level) and didn't even get to play the new level. Also the new running ending is bullshit. You die once and you fail the whole thing, because when you respawn you get put into a loop where you respawn and die instantly. Also it's the length of at least 5 football fields so it feels impossible and it just feels like the devs pulled the section from their arse just to kill you and stretch the game time.

To sum it up: don't buy this game unless maybe if it's on sale, just feels like a chore to play. Puzzles are uncreative and boring. The only thing that got me through it was playing it with friends. I give it a 4/10.",1666635686,1683054498,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

- The way the mouse seems to lag and then suddenly 'snap' when moving around can be very jarring. I've tried adjusting settings, but it doesn't seem to really addressing the issue with that sudden 'snap.'
- The blur and lighting is really hard on the eyes. Even turning film-grain off and tweaking the settings available, the lighting really leaves a lot to be desired. Being unable to see the people you are playing with who are standing close just makes it frustrating to work with.
- I understand the desire for immersion to have the player just dropped into the game where they have to figure stuff out, but that immersion is ruined when you have to bumble around for 15 - 20 minutes trying to figure out what you need to do. A better tutorial would help this, or some better design. 
- It feels like the large bulk of the time is spent hiding in lockers, even with things like the screw driver to deter certain monsters. Having to deal with multiple entities who skulk about aggressively in the same spots (sometimes multiples at a time in an area) just kills the game's vibe for me.

There were some smaller issues that my group had when we played this game, but these seemed to be the biggest problems we all had. I would love to recommend this game, but I don't think I can until things such as these get some attention. The group I play with has played a variety of similar games (Dead by Daylight, Phasmophobia, Ghost Hunter Corp., Devour, Forewarned, etc) which all have their quirks, but the ones in this one seem a little more heavy-handed.

I wish the developers the best of luck, though! I can see a lot of potential in this game.",1682959915,1682959915,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

We got to the pool with some creatures swimming in office level, which required solving many puzzles and dealing with the skin-stealer, and escaping the b-day party stuff. The whole thing took a few hours to figure everything out and get to that point. However, the game didn't save any progress and next time we wanted to continue, we were back to the square one with everything needing to be redone. 

I don't understand what is the point of this strict saving or checkpoint system. I'm not sure it makes the game more challenging in a meaningful way and there's no point in doing all the puzzles and going through the same struggles. The level design of the game does not make it replayable anyway. Also, we play easy, at least at that level saving or checkpoints could be more generous.

that being said a few things that could be done to make the game more immersive I will list the things in my opinion that could be done.

1. More immersive visuals, some of the game feels like it came out of a GMOD, and I only say that because the NPCs are very generic and so is the overall atmosphere of the levels, such as walls, furniture, bodies, entities, this is something that could be improved and would by far and would make the game so much more enjoyable

2. The mechanics, these for sure need to be improved, the walking, running, crouching, sprinting, and also their should be more options such as jumping and climbing, you could keep the challenge adding these options, simply make these much more physically demanding mechanics use more stamina, also the stamina should be set with he health, if you have low health why would you have normal stamina?
also swimming mechanics will definitely be a must because in backrooms lore, there is multiple backrooms levels with water, and that in itself is an endless possibilities of level;s and so and so forth, Poolrooms anyone?

3. This game is missing so much, I mean there are of course limits to everything, but this game has unlimited potential, some things that should be added is a more open world experience, now i know what your thinking, How the heck is the backrooms an open world experience? well you can No-Clip anywhere if you hit the wrong wall, this could expand into even more levels, and different possibilities, such as trading with other survivors, NPCs, and i mean an open world game, gets more players and is overall more enjoyable.

3. as i mentioned NPCs, this just needs to be improved overall, like i said the copy paste thing, it can take away from immersion really fast and make the game dull for some people, a game should grab the players attention and  make them feel like their actually being challenged and actually making hard decisions, but nothing breaks the immersion more than seeing the same face or same corpse or same NPC over and over and over again, and NPC,s should definitely be more lifelike, for example the entities, it seems like they just go back and forth and back and forth and have no real chasing or hunting mechanic.

but this is just friendly criticisms, and I really hope that this game take a good direction and really grows and thrives, I of course know its still being developed and will take time to create, and build, and grow, but this has endless possibilities, and I really hope to see them come to light.

- The game has multiple game-breaking bugs, one of which has existed since last year.

- The VR mode's controls suck.

- You need to beat certain levels to unlock some skins and cosmetics, which doesn't make a lot of sense given that there are only a couple of levels and they don't have much replay value at the moment.

Everything you pick up during the game has a use. It makes sure to include each nook and cranny of the level design in order for you to obtain every item that you will need for progression.

There are three difficulties with a variety of scaling when it comes to health, stamina, lives, revive time, etc. Easy is definitely the best difficulty to play on if you're after a more casual experience I would say, as there are less drawbacks compared to playing on Normal and Hard. On top of that, as you unlock new levels, you can choose to spawn from those levels going forward, which is very nice, as I wouldn't enjoy having to replay the entirety of the game if I wanted to simply spawn at my desired level.

The very first level is monster-free, you can explore safely but the non-saturated colours and the sound of the level is very off putting. I think they did a very good job in capturing the uneasiness of the Backrooms with the first level, even if it's very short and brief - as with any good horror game, there's a sense of dread and uncertainty. Definitely a strong sense of eerieness as you'd expect from the Backrooms.

The second level is a variation of the first and is darker, known as the Dark Rooms. As you explore, you will find various other levels such as the Parking Lot and the Office as well as secret levels such as Level Fun, Level ! (Run for your life!), and the Sewers, with a new level coming later this month which my friends and I are incredibly excited for.

There are multiple endings to the game which provides you with a lot more play time. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this game. There was initial tilt when we played the Sewers for the first time, but I think it really got us to co-ordinate and get our brains working, and overall, I don't regret any of the play time on this game. We replay the game and we have some very good laughs, and enjoy replaying through some of the levels.

I absolutely recommend playing this game if you enjoy survival horror games, as well as puzzle solving. Especially with a group of friends, I would say this is a 'must-play'.",1664880831,1681408705,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It makes you just quitting the game an option.

Ingredients:

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup white sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup water

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1 pinch salt

5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

For me, for poor, naive me, this 15 hours was spent on this piece of bullshit that shouldn't even exist. But it wasn't just the 15 hours that makes me mad. It was the fact that during the days I could not stop thinking about this game. During the nights I would constantly dream of the dimly lit hallways of the Darkrooms. The hours I spent strategizing and theory-crafting, the rage that I spewed out at the friends I played this with. This game turns you into a toxic monster who's only goal is to escape the backrooms. 

This game is not unlike a parasite. You download it, play it once, and forget about it. But the desktop shortcut left on your PC will slowly become ingrained in every aspect of your life. Your next days will leave you yearning for more, and resistance is futile. You *will* click on that icon again. You *will* succumb to the urges to travel those liminal hallways once again. Perhaps your new obsession will carry over to your friends, who will suffer a similar fate to you. 

You and your friends will finally find the way out of the backrooms after countless attempts through sleepless nights. And then you may ask yourself: ""That's all, right?"" No. That most certainly is not all. Every death and hardship followed by success makes you a slave to the grind. You will return for more. To complete the game from Floor 0. To complete the game deathless. To complete the game in under 35 minutes. And you will continue the arduous work until you finally achieve everything that this game could possibly offer.

Then, and only then, are you done. But like a cancer, this game never truly goes away. Not left in check, the urges will fester and the need for a fix will slowly creep back into your system. And then you will continue your servitude to the backrooms, its entities, and the endless halls that captured your mind when you first clicked ""Play"" all those months ago.",1680313123,1680313123,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,1,True,False,True

The game has genuine potential and does require some significant brain usage when it comes down to the puzzles rather than ""Pull 3 levers to open the door"" type puzzles.
I especially liked the safe code puzzle and computer dycryption puzzle.
The vibe is great, i felt uneasy and fear at the start and it does atmosphere quite well alongside some monsters i didn't see before being introduced ( like the pool monster ).
I like the ideas and challenges presented here and were certainly the fun, interesting parts i had with this game...

[b]HOWEVER[/b], the problem that keeps me from recomending it and ruins its pace, is that a good majority of the time you'll be running away from monsters but the stamina system ( EVEN IN EASY DIFFICULTY ) is [i]HORRIBLE[/i] with the stamina regeneration feeling like it takes [i]20-25 seconds[/i] if not more to replenish fully and get used up in a matter of [i]7 seconds[/i] with higher difficulty increasing stamina consumption and monster damage which i don't even know how you'd be able to tolerate unless you like getting your balls kicked in repeatedly.

The best example of this is in the birthday level of this game, [u]you got a time limit and literally have to run to do your tasks before the timer runs out and get insta killed by the monster[/u] , but with such a [i]GARBAGE[/i] stamina duration and regeneration, unless you get really lucky [i]( which is never a good thing when developing any game )[/i] you'll get hunted down by the active monster or outright insta killed on the spot, you can't sneak this or hide, you have to be quick which this game really does a good job of making it as [b]tedious and painful[/b] as possible.

Yes, there's some levels where you can [i]""sneak""[/i] around the monsters and in the later levels are encouraged to do so such as the ""Party level"" but that level you literally have 3+ monsters that can instantly kill you, your hiding spots aren't exactly ""safe"" ( no lockers either ) and worst of all, they give you a 10 second break period where the monsters are temporarily disabled and then enabled them again for 30 seconds and vise versa, and during all that you have to [u]collect 5 body parts with varying quantities.[/u]

They're basically encouraging you to sneak and hide but if you get spotted you're screwed anyways because you can't run for more than 5 feet before needing to regain your breath like a fat man climbing up the [b]STAIRS[/b].
And even if the monster doesn't instantly kill you before, you're unable to do ANYTHING and will die regardless before you can run again, which can make some puzzles fustrating and chases just a death wish and unpleasant.

Outside of that, it's worth mentioning that the game runs alright with some lag spikes here and there with some visible visual and gameplay bugs at times, and some puzzles having awkward handling ( like the safe code puzzle ) but this is a 5$ game, i went in with that expectation in mind.

There were never any clear signs or instructions for the players to follow when it comes to solving their puzzles. There was also no information given about what the collect items do. It does make the puzzles more interesting since you have to find out the hard way, but in this case the game just felt more tedious because of it. I didn't even know what moth jelly does until defeating my first ending. Furthermore, this plays negatively when combined with their incredibly large maps that are so easy to get lost in. There is no mini map either and honestly the game was a lot more fun after finding a map online just to beat the sewers level. If they had a more instructional HUD given to the players, I think this will elevate the already outstanding performance of this game.It has an incredible ambiance of dread and fear, I was never certain if the smiley entity will just backstab me again because I was in the dark. I was terrified of the very first level and, honestly, that first level was a really great experience. So great that I ended up playing because I saw my friend's gameplay when they tried to defeat level one. It is personally my favorite level because of the variety of entities/monsters, its intriguing puzzles, and a very immersive environment. The game was also pretty challenging making it a more extended gameplay and worthwhile experience once the player beats the game. It is also not too challenging and it feels beatable and possible without online aid. Even if you use online sources as an aid, it ends up performing as a manual DIY HUD system for the player which basically counters the main weakness of the game and turns it into a more socialized experience (although, I still think they should have added a HUD system alongside a mini map). Overall, I highly recommend this game to be played with friends and family. It gives very good scares, a lot of teamwork, and a very interesting, and rewarding experience for its players. Additionally, the game is, unfortunately, significantly harder when performed alone or by pair so I recommend a team of at least 3 or 4 people. I already achieved all endings and I am STILL planning to play the fist level again or to beat the game a second time but this time with the rest of my friends (if I could convince them to play horror haha).",1679764624,1679764624,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

All you do is walk around doing tasks and going to the next level. There's like 4 total rooms you go in to do tasks and the sewer is so boring I didn't even want to finish it at all. You just run around in the sewers going slow asf and you avoid huge rats while you go in a bunch of rooms figuring out which parts go where. There is no horror at all in this game after you walk around trying to figure out the puzzle and memorize the level you're in and see that the AI is garbage and loops a room you're trying to finish a task in. I'm not making this review because i'm frustrated or angry or anything but genuinely this game is just a small backrooms chore game. I'd like it if you could actually run and hide and escape scary enemies but the only way to get past the floor is just figuring out puzzles the entire time. My entire 7 hours was going area to area with different pieces of the puzzle using it for the next piece of the puzzle until eventually I just unlock the next area.

There's too much running back and forth for the puzzles, and three monsters. Lemme repeat that. There are THREE MONSTERS ON THE FIRST LEVEL and they are constantly on your a** while you're trying to figure out these puzzles. WHY are they constantly there you may ask? Because dev thought it would be funny if they were heavily attracted to sound while you do puzzles that require constant communication. 

And then you have to do a MINIGAME to RESPAWN, and if you fail it no respawn for you ever. Have fun watching your friends play, because that's what you wanted to do in a video game right? Not play even though you had lives left? 

To put it into perspective, there's only ONE monster on the second level. We spent 100 minutes on just the first level but only 10 on the next, and then it glitched out when the monster when down the white tiled hallway so we would have to start ALL OVER AGAIN from that f**king first level.

An average run takes between 2-3hrs to complete, and the game has multiple endings. The puzzles are neat and varied and the entities all have different behavior and strategies to avoid. The game's still unfinished but it's worth the current price. I didn't try the VR mode but it runs pretty great on my mid to high end machine.

The few gripes I have with the game right now would be:
1) Some entities can clip through terrain/walls and attack you.
2) Places where multiple entities can attack you will have them corner you in almost guaranteed death situations. [spoiler]Cable/Bacteria entity chasing you in a room while the Smiler blocks the exit.[/spoiler]
3) Certain puzzles are difficult to read if players are nearby as their flashlight or shadow will blind you. Would be nice to have those blocked out while doing those puzzles as the game already puts you into a unique puzzle mode while doing them.
4) A level later on has a mechanic that was either broken when I was on it and made it seem unfair or it's just set to being too hard IMO. [spoiler]The pool area with the arms creatures lurking inside. For me their model wasn't visible and they made no noise or ripples in the water. The only way to detect them was with a motion detector found earlier on, but even with that the pings for location tracking were too sparse. By the time I'd get info on locations they'd have already gotten me. Lost my first run on normal difficulty by losing my seven remaining lives in just this area. Since they move it proves very difficult to just go slow and safe. Only reason I think this area was bugged for me was that another level has the same entities but they can be seen and heard in the water.[/spoiler]
5) Skipping the opening cut-scene seems to kick players if you're the host. Had this happen several times so I just stopped skipping them to help avoid this problem.
6) Later levels give you a lot of recovery items but most of the entities are one shot kills to you, mostly defeating the purpose of the healing ones. This is more of a gripe about the balance between multi-hit kills and one-shot kills as the earlier levels had a lot more multi-hit kill entities which gave you a chance to heal.
7) A certain entity has a long range one-shot kill attack that I never truly figured out. I'd just hide for longer than I needed to to make them go away as I couldn't deal with them otherwise. [spoiler]The Smiler entity has a very odd way of killing you from a distance. Initially I thought you just needed to not stare at them as you'd lose sanity, and to not touch them as they would one-shot kill you. However apparently if they see you for long enough they'll kill you even from long distances. Breaking line-of-sight works but I guess it's a certain amount of time they need to spot you for them to get that long range kill. What's more is that the attack is either on a timer or the cool-down after breaking LOS doesn't reset, so if you get seen and hide but decide to peek several seconds later to see if they're gone, they can kill you almost instantly.[/spoiler]
8) Certain parts of the game has huge frame drops, including when using certain items [spoiler]The flesh in the sewer[/spoiler]. It's disorienting and when it does happen it's normally when I'm trying to avoid an entity. My camera will jitter and I'll need to reset myself quickly to not die.
9) Even though the puzzles have plenty of hints, I've found that most people give up and disconnect on just the first level. There's multiple puzzles going on at once and it seems to overwhelm or confuse them and they either silently give up and follow me around or leave. Only managed to do a fully play-through with my brother as everyone else left before finishing the first level.
10) A in-game notebook would be handy. I've played some Backrooms games with this feature for jotting down notes or creating maps as you play. This would be really handy as there's several puzzles that involve memorization. What I ended up doing is either taking screenshots of clues I find or using an external notepad app but it'd be nice to have it built-in.

Even with these current issues I still think the game is worth getting in its current state and price. If the dev continues to add more content and fix the wonky parts of the game it'd make it even better.",1678605459,1678605459,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I've been playing this game for quite a while, not very often but I always enjoyed my time on it. The recent Halloween update came out and I was more excited than ever to play it with my friends... Shortly after playing the new update, a patch came out that completely destroyed my game. I can't even launch the game anymore. I have a Ryzen 7, RTX 3080, and 32GB RAM, I know it's not a hardware issue, everything is up to date, and I have tried everything I could find online or think of myself. I posted several times in their support, though they refuse to respond to me, while they respond to every other persons question, I've been ignored entirely throughout this time. I'm tired of this, I just want to play with my friends, but the whole dev team refuses to acknowledge my problems, they won't help me, the only response I've gotten was from some random that told me to check the integrity of my files, as though that wasn't literally the first thing I did. This is ridiculous, buy this game at your own risk. If your game doesn't work anymore, don't expect any help, you're on your own for this one.

Biggest bug I ran into: In an online game, one of us died in the sewers to a rat. When he respawned, a rat was on top of his body and began to push him. Due to the way the rats work, he couldn't move. The rat pushed him out of the world boundary and he fell, and with no way to reset himself we had to completely restart the level.

Worst part of the experience: [spoiler]The hallway chase when getting the ending required for the Lost Inside the Backrooms achievement. This chase was clearly only programmed assuming the player both had and consumed a Moth Jelly, but when my group arrived to it none of us did.[/spoiler] Cue a slow, six minute chase where we would die, respawn, walk ten feet or sprint as far as we could, get killed, revive, repeat. Either giving the player a Moth Jelly right outside the chase to ensure they use it or giving the players a better sprint in this chase is a must, because not every player will continuously hoard an item they can only hold two of in a game where running from monsters is a 24/7 game (ESPECIALLY online, where players will aggro monsters just to buy their friends time on puzzles.)

These are just two small-ish parts of a bigger experience though. I really have enjoyed this game! If you have a group of friends, this game is a great and inexpensive experience where you'll definitely get some laughs.",1678593351,1678593351,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It's a very fun co-op experience (I played it with my little brother) until the last level, the sewers. Up until that point it's decently challenging, requires a bit of puzzle solving skills, requires cooperation skills, is a little bit scary and not too repetitive. Then when you reach the final level it gets rather boring. It took me and my brother ca 2,5 hours to finish the last level and after like 1,5 hours we got tired of it. There's no way to save so you can't really take a break to finish it later which only made it even duller and you felt forced to complete it. The puzzles get repetitive and you're really slow which leads to you progressing very slowly.

It's really not a good backrooms game either. There's too much things going on at the same time which kind of takes you out of the eerie liminal space feeling that the backrooms is trying to bring out. The whole reason backrooms is scary is because you don't know what's lurking in the hallways, you don't know whether you're alone or not, you don't know anything about this place and it's too empty. This game is quite the opposite, it's easy to figure out where the entities are which removes that feeling of not knowing what's lurking and there's too much happening which removes the eerie horror feeling of the backrooms and you get to know the areas pretty quickly. It's a pretty fun puzzle game but not a good backrooms game.

Gameplay was fun due to the puzzles not being too complex that would normally make it annoying to play. Though, there are a two things (that I can remember) that bothers me when playing the game, mechanic-wise. And yes, I know that it's still in Early Access (as of writing this) so bugs/issues are to be expected. Plus I understand there are bound to be bugs/issues.
(May Mention Spoiler(s))

First off is the lack of motion blur settings. When I was playing this game with my friend(s), the biggest issue is the constant blur happening on the screen, making it nauseating to play. I understand it's part of a game mechanic but there should be another method of showing that you have ""anxiety"". My friends and I mainly struggled playing the game because of this.

(Mentions Spoilers)
Second is some of the AI. In the sewers, Entity#25 tends to get bunched up together with its friends at a specific wall because of their mechanic requiring hearing. It's due to a certain puzzle causing a lot of noise that even when it is stopped, they most likely stay at that wall. Then there's the Entity#10 in the third section. Would've been nice if it actually copied someone's look to make it more terrifying as it is in it's name. Its description mentions that it can smell blood over long distances basically meaning (from my guess) it will know where you are and hunt you down if you're not full HP. That mechanic does not entirely work because it more rather reacts to the usage of anxiety pills or seeing a player. Last one I want to mention is Entity#3. Just the fact that there's a room leading to the radiation suits that room is entirely dark, meaning it will show up a lot or it has a high chance of showing up making it frustrating to play around that point.

(Mention Spoilers)
In conclusion, mentioning these does not mean the game is unplayable, just more troubling to play. Regardless, I did enjoy playing the game love how my friends and I played our own part when playing this game. The game immediately drops you into the horror with at least some instruction(s) on what you're up against or what you're doing. The scariest monster to me would be Entity#67 while the best section to me is the first part (when the entities are able to hunt you). Entity#67 to me is just horrifying because of how narrow its second ""game"" is. Just the risk of having to make turns in a narrow maze to potentially see that thing is very terrifying. So terrifying, I was too afraid to leave the corner panicking while my friends were searching for the boxes. While that may be scariest monster to me, the section I like the most is the first one (as fore-mentioned when the entities are able to hunt you) because the maze that is given is not too complex for me to memorize but also not too easily memorized as well (apparently to my friends). For a $5 game, I recommend this game. it's really worth giving it a try.",1677957053,1677957053,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Only main gripe is that I think there should have been the option to randomise some of the physical layouts of the maps like with BINDING OF ISSAC or SCP CONTAINMENT BREACH and keep introducing new kinds of puzzles and challenges, a bit like THE CRYSTAL MAZE TV show.

The whole time I could see my player models head, and had to turn my camera away from items to even pick them up, also you can't read notes. Now playing it outside VR, it still wasn't good, better but not good, wall textures were clipping, which is fine but kinda easy to resolve, also you can't even see the player model in normal play so why can you see it in VR, no idea. An entire wall was missing, I can't tell if it was missing or a horrible mirror, as when you see the wall it has an invisible wall blocking you from falling in, the edges of it were black so probably not missing, and if it was a mirror pretty crappy job cause it didn't reflect what was supposed to reflected and instead showed a image of the backrooms, low res so you could count the pixels not game breaking but horrible nevertheless. Also for the record I'm a scaredy cat, I get scared by the babiest of things but this game was not scary, not even in VR, it might have been but it's kinda hard to see when there's a giant face in the way, I literally ran in to Smiler and felt nothing, could have been the jumpscare but whatever, ran into another Entity, the one that's a stickman, and again felt nothing. Oh and you don't die first hit, why??? NO IDEA. that's the least scariest thing, imagine playing a game that's supposed to be scary and, seeing the monster, it gets you, it just sits there... waiting to hit you again. There is also a life system, at least in the multiplayer so take that as you will. Now I normally don't review or refund things even if they're bad, as I don't want to be rude but this game had it comin, and it's fairly certain that the game was made to go with the trend which is fine, if you do it well, the intro cutscene has a Gmod Nextbot, and clearly the VR was a rush job so they can slap it on the games page, and I heard one of the game creators said to not buy the game for the VR, and you shouldn't do that, well then don't have it as a VR Supported Game.

Critiques:
[list]
[*]Puzzles are enjoyable and fun but controls for interacting with the puzzles can be very clunky.

[*]The animations could use some polishing.

[*]There 100% needs to be some form of a hotbar/item wheel to quickly swap between different items in your inventory.

[*]In my opinion, the horror aspect should be kicked up a few notches. The monsters and environment are not scary enough visually/audibly.

[*]Once you learn the monster's patterns and behaviors, a lot of the challenge is removed and the thrill drops significantly. I don't want to feel like I can puppet them around in the palm of my hand. I want to feel nearly hopeless and be holding my breath till the finish line.

You're not actually in the backrooms proper for most of the game, and when you are, the lack of looping paths and corridors not attached to dead-end setpieces make the whole area feel like one small, enclosed, elaborate puzzle rather than a real place. I want to get lost. I want to feel like I've seen the same place over and over because being unable to ground yourself geographically in what should feel like an impossible space is part of the fun. 

Everything past the first area is either a straight line or at best a T-junction. This means that monsters, if around, will pretty much never despawn or leave you alone. They're also nearly impossible to get rid of for the same reasons. Combined with the mediocre spatial audio and the gameplay is much more frustrating than tense or scary.

Oh, and the VR experience is terrible. Interactive items are often unusable, making the game literally unplayble in VR.

I bought this game in VR and it is unplayable. The controls don't work at all. I can't open doors or anything.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I liked the first level the most, because the monsters had patterns and warnings for when they were coming, and was more classic backrooms.  The monsters in the second level were too op, having to hide every few seconds took away from the experience. 
We beat this game in a bit over 3 hours, because we found a secret ending, which was kinda fun. I won't be playing it again until saving is added. It's hard to get the time to sit down and play one game for hours without saving.

Good quality for the price, fun with friends! Scary, anxiety inducing, sweaty palms game.
Multiple levels, puzzles not too hard but still challenging. You can progress before completing all puzzles in some areas, but game will provide missing key items when loading next level [spoiler]accidentally bypassed finding hammer/smashing vases/finding fuses etc on first run and game continued smoothly.[/spoiler]
I believe there could be multiple endings? As my group escaped without touching the sewer. Will definitely play again to experience the sewer!

Some glitches are to be expected, and I have experienced host crashing just once in 9 hours of gameplay. No glitch has required restart so far.

Some of the notes/entity information sheets feature broken English, but are easy enough to understand. The only entity which seems not to follow the rules as listed on its sheet is [spoiler]the dog. Information states that he is intimidated by eye contact/staring but he just keeps attacking us - just need to lose him. Potentially the sheet is written wrong and you need to avoid eye contact?[/spoiler]

For an early access indie game, the dev is surprisingly active with updates, and I'm confident that they will improve this game with time!

We got to the point where we launched in VR and were going to play we selected our characters and hit play, we got into the starting cut scene and it was odd were were very close to the ground and watching from across the street. Once fully loaded into the actual game we first noticed our hands had zero tracking and stayed at our sides, THEN we tried moving. Oh My God, Moving was a whole WTF moment. When you walk it seems fine then you hit the sprint button and your looking at your hair/head and it blocked nearly the entire screen and causes FPS to drop like crazy. It was most definitely unplayable in VR. On the other hand we played on PC and the experience was much better. Actually worked and was very fun, maybe if the VR port was better i would recommend for all but from a 1-10 view I give it a 7, Its great but would be better and way more horrifying if it worked in VR. All in all very good on PC impossible to play VR game.

Turn off lights while playing, yets yes!
Also, it saves your progress and you can return to the game, which I liked a lot.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

You can also unlock 2 outfits, one by getting the Flesh Cake ending and one by getting the Sewer Ending (which is extremely long and boring), however these outfits are purely cosmetic and do not grant any sort of ""special"" power making them unappealing to unlock, maybe one could give you unlimited stamina, while the other unlimited health, just to give the player a reason to fully explore this game.

The only real skill the Rats test is your patience to stand still for so long (when theres more than one rat in the corridor) and some ocasional RNG (you can spawn inside one of the monsters so this will take you 2 lives).
Its INCREDIBLY tedious and excrutiangly -artificially- long, I didnt feel so annoyed by a level design since that white cathedral in the game Code Vein (a few of you might know what I'm talking about)

oh, the coup de grace: THE BOSS WAS BUGGED - after taking so many hours beating this hell in one sitting, the boss at the end of the level, I believe its called MotherRat, was invisible to me :) my friend yelled at discord ""Right in front of you!"" and I was like ""what?""
BANG
Fatality cutscene (jumpscare) 
My last life down the drain to a GLITCH :D
hours of my life spent at absolutely nothing because I didn't even got to progress lmao

So no, a huge no for me, sadly I can't refund.

What I don't like about the game:

- I didn't recommend the game because we didn't find the checkpoints. We spent a lot of time in the first area and I think it had the most content compared to the other areas.

- The one thing I hate about this save/checkpoint feature is that it doesn't save our inventory. We get only the mandatory items like [spoiler] hazmat, geiger counter [/spoiler] but we don't keep the items that aren't mandatory [spoiler] the body parts [/spoiler]

- One of the monsters [spoiler] ENTITY #3 [/spoiler] still sometimes teleports inside us and kills us but with infinite lives it was doable (when we played it wasn't written in the game under the difficulties I had to search in the update logs to see if there is any information about them. Now you can see them in game under the difficulties.)

So why I recommend the game after all:

+ Because the game is beatable and as far as I know this is the best backrooms game which is Co-op.

+ It's really cheap

UPDATE 1/21/2023

The devs fixed a lot of the issues I had with this game! My friends and I have been playing it a lot, and I just completed all of the achievements! I would highly recommend now! :)















I think this game has a lot of potential and could be really fun, but the party room ruins EVERYTHING. Firstly, the timer is too short, and the monster in the maze with the walls 1 hit kills you. With the scaling to find the presents in the maze, it uses most of your lives to get through the maze. If you make it out of the maze with the physical walls, then you get to the TAPE MAZE. The same monster is in that maze, but this time, the monster can run through the walls, immediately to you. If one player solves the maze, gets the keycard objective of the room, and leaves, the monster still hunts down the other players who hadn't made it out of the maze yet. I lost all of my lives in the maze and had to spectate my friends finishing the game. I think this game could be great if they gave you a bit more leniency with the party room level, and give you the option to turn off the maximum 10 lives per player. As of right now, I would not recommend this game.

This game, for an average player that hasn't been into the Backroom' intended vibe, can be a good experience.
It's fun with friends and kinda goofy, it got its own charm to it.

But for me, the main concept of the Backrooms getting a bit ruined because of its fill with puzzles, non-logical levels, it just feels like a fairy tale or a game that tries too hard to be scary.
Especially the level ""Sewers"", me and my friend spent around 3 hours trying to figure out the locations, going fourth and back to get codes, clues, items, getting caught by Rats/Crawlers.

I just feel like the pacing of this game can be greatly improved, as much as its vibe and environment.

Please devs get a better save system because nobody wants to replay a game they constantly get screwed over by. 

Also, the monster spawn camps specific locations. Don't know if this is done intentionally, but my god does it make it frustrating for everyone to cross into safe zones.

Ideas for improvement (for the dev):
-More save points and missions
-Sewers could be more scary imo, it feels like its more puzzle than anything
-I hosted a game and as people left it was still set for 4 people to play so maybe a fix for this?

For one, almost all the entities camp the objectives for example, the hound camps a vase room you need to be in for a while, I tested it a while ago (though this isn't true now) and when you break the first vase (if not there already) the hound comes in through the vent. The hound also camps the lever room which also has smilers (which have their own problem) which makes the lever room a ""hope the hound and or smilers don't show up"" game which isn't fun nor is it scary, although I haven't noticed the camping as much though I've probably gotten better at avoiding the camping. The bacteria camps either the room to the left of the mirror and only moves when you approach it or leave the area, or a tight hallway leading to an important room and never leaves the hallway. Second off, the smilers are the worst thing in the game hands down. The smilers' whole ""gimmick"" is spawning in hallways leading to important areas, or in large open spaces and if you look at them for more than 2 seconds, you die instantly. All this does is slow down the game and makes the player bored. Sometimes smilers even spawn on you killing you instantly, they kill you when you aren't looking at them, or they spawn around a corner you can't see. Smilers are bad additions to the game that should be removed or revamped. Maybe this review will be outdated but at the time I'm writing this, it isn't really. I will give it to them though, past the darkrooms is pretty solid and the darkrooms are fun to learn for the first time, the parking garage can be annoying but you can dodge the skin-stealer pretty easily, the office rooms has a skin-stealer with a repeating walk cycle and doesn't really camp at all, not to mention, the fun games are pretty fun. The pools are easy, and the sewers are pretty fun to learn but I can see how sewers can be annoying.

Got some good levels with some fun monsters to avoid who will probably give you a good couple scares, until you get to the sewers. Why games feel the need to add a sewer level to every game is beyond me. 

The level is simply not scary, not fun, and extremely poorly designed. Sprawling tunnels that are too difficult to map in your mind and would take you hours on the level to remember, (you will want to spend the least amount of time as possible on this garbage section). All items and places you need to get to are on complete opposite ends of the level. The water is annoying, makes you go even slower through the boring level, the concept would be fun in small uses and sections but in this you cannot avoid having to walk through it. The rats are the least threatening enemy in the game, not scary just fucking irritating. Just stop moving and you're good. There is nothing tense, scary or fun about them and it again makes the level sooo slow. The rats also can glitch through the railings slightly, so when they're walking down the sewer and you're on the side of it (where you should be safe), they still get you. I don't know why im wasting time on this review. Good game up to the sewers. Its the worst and I hope they adjust it, it should get destroyed. It smells, it looks the same everywhere you walk, I hate it, my friends hate it, my dentist would not recommend it. Mentally prepare yourself for the sewers. it would be a 7/10 but the sewers makes it a 6/10, I pray the next level they add is fun.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

How long it took to complete the main game: around 2 hours and 30 minutes
how long it took to complete sewer level: 3 hours and 33 minutes  ( we were confused for the first hour )
How long it took to complete Run for your life: around 11  minutes  ( mainly retries )

This game may not be as fun for other people who aren't as good at puzzles, or want to take breaks after a level or 2. This wasn't as fun for one of my friends because you had to complete it in one go.  I recommend a tutorial  if you want to try to get the game done faster, and not spend so much time on one thing. 

levels/ puzzles/ entities : The levels were great, My personally favorite was Level 0.  My least favorite was the sewer because some of the puzzles were confusing and it took a long time.   Th entity for the next 2 levels was annoying, but we managed to get through.  Sometimes it would camp the lockers, which made it harder for us to complete the computer code. Partygoer ( minigame part not the level  )  was tiring because of the maze part where we had to find the presents. There was nothing else to really comment on. 

The only thing I found that I personally didn't like was the fact sometimes when you have to find the door when you're dead it can take quite a while because of how big a map is. This only applies for level 0,  since all the other levels were smaller or didn't randomized where the door was.  There is also a bug for VR where I get stuck outside of the elevator when i go in it. That may be just me, but I wanted to report it anyway just in case.

But the game is also headache inducing and im not talking about hard puzzles.

The sewer area for example is far too slow and is extremely boring and tedious to get through as there is no excitement. There as issues such as spawning back in just to die to a monster sitting on your body and the monsters glitching and killing you when you are no where near them. The sprinting mechanic is also very sloppy as the walking speed is painfully slow and the loud breathing is extremely annoying when you run out of stamina.

The levels never change and for a game built on puzzles it is nearly impossible to win with a screaming Mexican child flipping switches and taking the key items. Communication is detrimental for every single run yet next to no one knows how to use the chat or voice chat. Tutorial also doesn't exist.

Edit: Came back after another 4 hours for a total of 6 hours. The game is early access but still has a huge potential for a great game. Found a group i was able to play with and had an amazing time despite bugs.
Known Bugs:
Rats in the sewers commonly no clip through the fence causing an insta death
Multiple entities can (and will) camp your body ASAP (insta death from respawn)
Many instances of entities making no noise (Also instadeath)
Hitboxes on gnomes (seasonal event) is very janky
Moving your screen too fast results in the screen splitting into 2 for a brief moment
Flashlights cause insane light pollution if used too close to a surface
Oil line un-interactable making the sewers unplayable (Wasted an hour I hate this game)

Please keep in mind this game is in early access from a very small team, what they have made is an awesome concept with mediocre execution. Even with these bugs,  7/10",1672615814,1672816848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Although there are some minor bugs in the animation it doesn't really annoy me. The audio mixing could be improved by like 500% but i assume this is an indie game made by a single developer so i can let it slide. The gameplay could be changed up a little because you always know what your going to get if you want to replay the game. The game does randomise the codes for the elevator and stuff but it's not really that great. despite all of the bugs and annoyances in the game, it has been improved so much and i would recommend getting the game. It does need to be updated a lot and changed but it is playable and gives some entertainment. If you wish the read my review when i played before when the game wasn't updated and was in a terrible condition, read below.

Game is super broken. Should not be sold in this state. The tracking sucks, i spawn outside of the main menu with no way to start the game most times and when i launch the game, i have to watch a long unskippable cutscene. Game is boring, the puzzles aren't even difficult. I think i should be getting paid to play this game. Don't buy this game even for £3.99. Just to add more details, the hands are not properly placed on your controllers and also the models absolutely suck and i'm pretty sure their just free models off of mixamo. Either wait for this game to be fully fixed and polished or just wait for a better game to come out and buy that. I have literally made i think, 3-4 reviews in my time on steam including my old account from 2013 and i just really felt the need to write this so nobody else wastes their money like me.",1657667759,1672591794,True,0,0,0.465343981981277466,5,True,False,True

I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.

Played probably too many hours trying to get through some of the final areas in the game [spoiler] mainly the sewer level, mostly due to glitches and other game breaking bugs the caused me to have to completely restart the area... [/spoiler] 

One of the main issues I have with this game is the lack of a save function which is more than likely never going to be resolved due to this being an online co-op style horror game. Even when the devs have been asked they have stated there is no plan for this feature to be added. The only thing I ask then is that they at the very least work out a majority of the game breaking issues and bugs that cause crashes or make an area impossible to complete. 

Overall, its a fun game can be annoying at times but if you plan on playing with friends it can be a blast!

It was scary at first, and really fun, but by the time we got to a certain point with certain entities it went from fun and scary to annoying. We kept dying, and it got to the point where the entities were too hard to surpass, and we had to keep starting from the start of the level to get to where we were. Some levels should be separated. Having the entire game put into 2 levels was insanely unfair, and was annoying when we kept dying and having to start from the beginning of the level we were on. This was the worst with the 2nd level. We'd die, because the middle and final enemies were too hard, and then have to start all over with the puzzles, which made the game stale. It got much less scary, and the only real fear was fear that we'd die and waste all of our lives and have to start over.

Edit: After the sewer level came out my partner I essentially lost all our progress on the office level, and were expected to redo it in order to play the sewer level. Why can't we just play any level we want? Why does it have to go in order? It's not a story driven game. There is literally no story. There are no established characters, nothing. There is zero point to make people grind for hours to get the level done, especially if they just want to play it with their friends.

ALSO, the Devs in the community replies came off as major jerks. ""Keep in mind a large majority of the players didn't have trouble playing the game, so rethink your strategy"" in reply to someone complaining about how unfair and difficult the entities are. Seriously? It's true. The entities are incredibly OP and strong, and usually spawncamp.

I love how there are challenging puzzles, great entities with some okay pathing, and just in all the environment is fantastic. One of my main problems is that the stamina is really low, this can affect a lot of things, such as in office room the ""skin-walker"" loves to chase and camp you so whenever you run out of stamina there really isn't anything you can do. Another complaint I have is that almond water is really no where to be found. I can find plenty of anxiety pills but there really aren't a lot of ways to heal. The next problem I have has to do with the party goer. The first 2 party games are find which are the popping balloons and the maze where you have to find presents, what I mainly hate about the third game is that it is extremely dark and the party goer doesn't go through the maze but instead goes over it and it really ruins the fun in that level and causes more rage due to it taking the majority of your lives if you don't get lucky. That really is all the problems I have run into so far, but besides that it is a great game and I do recommend it!

PS: I have tried the secret ending also known as the sewer level, and let me tell you running around for 3 hours trying to figure out things is unbelievable, thank god for tutorials. Seriously though what they need to do to the sewers is remove 50% of the entities and make the map smaller alongside this make the puzzles less complicated. There is no need for all that complexion!

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The level with the sewers was the worst. As we write this review, we continue to do it. We are mentally fed up with the game, we didn't quit because the save didn't work, so we would probably have to do everything from the beginning.

I also think the party game section is kind of pointless and rage inducing which kinda turns me off of the horror and the scares. Other than that this is a great game and I would definitely recommend.

As of the new update, the party game section is easier and makes it a lot better of an experience. They also added a new level which was so fun. Still recommend this game.",1660968713,1671397010,True,0,0,0.49751242995262146,0,True,False,True

However, if you want to play through the entire game. I cannot recommend this to anyone. The game starts fast paced you are running away from monsters and trying to survive while doing puzzles. Then it shifts with the second level as you mainly have to just hide in a locker from the monster while half completing puzzles. It doesn't seem like you need to really do the task on the computers in the second level? We never did that puzzle and decided to move on. 

However the party room on the second level was what I thought the worst level in game design. The first few puzzles start out pretty fun, pop the balloons, find the boxes. But MY GOD the candle mini game is absolutist terrible. The mini game has two big issues that could be solved. Either ONE give the play more stamina. Half the monsters you cannot outrun anyways in the game so having a terrible stamina system where you run 5 feet before coming to a crawling pace is just awful. OR give the players better flashlights. Its hard enough to see which direction the little red lines go. But when my flashlight cant show whats below me feet how am I supposed to find my way around in the 10 seconds you give me before the monster aimlocks though the lines. Now I thought the worst was over once we beat the party room mini game but man was I wrong...

The sewer level is one of the worst designed levels in any game I have ever played. It took us about 2 hours of trying to memorize and figure out the layout in general. On top of all the theme of the level is about being quite. Which means you are crouch walking around most of the time and when the cost is clear since the stamina system is so bad you end up getting to run for maybe 5 seconds before having to walk again. The game has this jelly that makes it so you can have unlimited stamina, however they give it to you way to late in the level. Another huge fault of this level is there are WAY to many things to do. After reading all the notes it was hard to keep track of what goes where. Please add a system where you can pick up the notes and read them in your inventory. After about 2 and a half hours on this one level alone we finally got all the parts to get to the exit both with one life left. Just to be met with another bullshit puzzle that we needed more parts (A bucket???) to get through. We just ended up quitting at that point because we couldn't be bothered to crouch around the entire sewer system looking for the bucket. Also please fix the clipping monsters. Dont punish your players for being sneaky just by having the monsters clip through the safezone ground and get you. Very frustrating. Very unpolished level. Wait until it hopefully gets fixed.",1671065385,1671065385,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

It is characterized by the smell of moist carpet, walls with a monochromatic tone of yellow, and buzzing fluorescent lights. Internet users have expanded upon this concept by creating different ""levels"" of the Backrooms and ""entities"" which inhabit them.

The original version came from a two-paragraph 4chan comment on a post asking for ""unsettling images"", where an anonymous user invented a story based on one of the photos. The Backrooms drew comparisons to various other horror trends and media, including the photography of liminal spaces, the SCP Foundation collaborative fiction project, and the six-hour-long album series Everywhere at the End of Time.

Since its original creation, The Backrooms has been expanded into various other forms of media and Internet culture, including video games, collaborative fiction wikis, and YouTube videos.

The Backrooms originated from a thread posted on the /x/ board of 4chan on 12 May 2019, where an anonymous user asked for others to ""post disquieting images that just feel 'off'."" There, the first photo depicting the Backrooms was uploaded, presenting a slightly tilted image of a yellow-colored hallway. Another anonymous user commented on the photo with the first story about the Backrooms, claiming that one enters the Backrooms when they ""noclip out of reality in the wrong areas"", which is a video game-related term originating from Doom for when a player passes through a physical boundary that would otherwise block their way.[1][2]

After the 4chan post gained fame, several Internet users wrote horror stories relating to The Backrooms. Many memes were created and shared across social media, further popularizing the creepypasta.[2] Some have stated they had seen that image somewhere before; in the opinion of Manning Patston from Happy Mag, these comments were ""existential, hollow, and terrified"".[2] Patston commented on the use of the term ""noclip"", interpreting it as ""glitches in which the walls of reality are torn down"", such as the existence of doppelgängers.[2] Comparing the location to the level design of the Resident Evil franchise, Kaitlyn Kubrick of Somag News called the Backrooms ""the terrifying creepypasta of cursed dreams"".[3]

The location of the original Backrooms photo is unknown. Although a number of locations have been proposed, it is possible that the image is a procedurally generated digital composition.[4] The creepypasta has also been associated with the concept of kenopsia, first coined in The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows: ""the eerie, forlorn atmosphere of a place that's usually bustling with people but is now abandoned and quiet"".[4][5]

The Backrooms' original concept has been expanded by Internet users, who have created different ""levels"" of the location. There are thousands of levels found within fan made Wikis of the Backrooms, featuring different photos and ""safety classes"" in a format influenced by the SCP wiki. One canon is that there are three distinct levels.[2] The levels specified in this canon include:

Level 0 - The Lobby: This is the level depicted in the original Backrooms photo, featuring all of the creepypasta's most well-known characteristics – moldy carpet, yellow walls, and buzzing fluorescent lights. One of the entities created by users for this level are ""hounds"", described as disfigured and manic humanoid beings. Another feature of this level is a ""noclip zone"", which can bring wanderers back to Earth's dimension, return them to the starting point of Level 0, or to another level with different hostile organisms.[2]
Level 1 - Habitable Zone: A level reached when one chooses not to enter a noclip zone and instead wanders around Level 0 for days.[2] It is darker than Level 0 and features a more industrial architecture, with mechanical-like sounds being heard through the place. The level appears to be a dark, dingy warehouse with low-lying fog and puddles of water which randomly appear. In contrast to Level 0, the fluorescent lights begin to flicker more frequently, occasionally shutting down completely – ""This is when the beings come out"".[2]
Level 2 - Pipe Dreams: The third level of the Backrooms, according to the three-level interpretation.[2] It is one of the darkest levels, containing more industrial-like architecture. This level appears as long service tunnels with pipes lining the walls. It is described as being reached when one simply wanders around Level 1 for a long enough period of time, and featuring a much higher temperature than other levels. ""Survivors"" of the Backrooms claim that the only way to escape the level is to remain calm, stating that ""Only when the backrooms have become your home can you depart.""[2]

The Backrooms soon became popular from writers and Internet users, most of which commented on its uncannyness. The creepypasta has also been cited as the origin and most-well known example of the liminal spaces Internet trend, which are photos that evoke ""a sense of nostalgia, lostness, and uncertainty"";[7] the '#liminalspaces' tag has amassed nearly 100 million views on the social media platform TikTok.[6] When a woman named Claire Scheulin found an abandoned mall below her Airbnb, Internet commentators compared her photos of the place to the original Backrooms image.[8][9]

The horror aspects of The Backrooms drew comparisons to the conspiracy theories of UFOs in Area 51, to filmmaker Stanley Kubrick's work The Shining, to the Minecraft urban legend of Herobrine, and to the 2019 film Us.[2] Its ambiguous rooms has also been noted as featuring similarities to horror stories of the SCP Foundation, especially SCP-3008 (a branch of IKEA that contains an infinite interior space within a pocket dimension), and to the vague buildings of Control (2019).[10] Dazed called the Backrooms an example of ""internet folklore"".[6]

In January 2022, a short horror film titled The Backrooms (Found Footage) was uploaded to the YouTube channel of then 16-year-old director Kane Parsons (Kane Pixels on YouTube). It is presented as a 1996 recording of a young cameraman who accidentally enters the location, running from entities and entering other levels.[11] The film employs both live-action footage and 3D Blender renderings, as well as other techniques to create effects such as camera shake and a VHS filter.[12] Categorized by some as ""analog horror"",[13] the short received acclaim: WPST contributor Erica Russell called it ""the scariest video on the Internet"",[14] while Dread Central's Mary Beth McAndrews compared it to the 2019 video game Control and ""watched it 10 times"".[15][16]

Some were surprised by what Parsons did with what he had: Jai Alexis of website PopHorror was surprised by the director's age,[17] while The Awesomer noted that Backrooms ""shows how to create tension without a budget"".[18] Boing Boing's Rob Beschizza hypothesized that the creepypasta will eventually ""end up in a slick but dismal 2-hour Hollywood movie"", likening this prediction to the Slender Man creepypasta and its 2018 film adaptation.[19] When describing a meme of the Backrooms, GameRant's Tanner Fox called the short ""a paralyzing watch which packs quite a bit of terror into its short runtime.""[20]

Parsons has since uploaded twelve other videos relating to the Backrooms in non-chronological order as of 31 August 2022: The Third Test, First Contact, Missing Persons, Informational Video, Autopsy Report, Motion Detected, Prototype, Pitfalls, Report, Presentation, Found Footage #2, and I Remember.[10][21] They revolve around the fictional Async Foundation finding and exploring the Backrooms in order to solve ""all current and future storage and residential needs"",[22] with Informational Video referring to the location as Project KV31.[23] There are also five unlisted Backrooms videos uploaded by Kane, one of which references the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.[24]",1662432698,1671003117,True,0,0,0.479041904211044312,2,True,False,True

Graphics are good and there is a good sense of fear that makes it great. Some nice puzzles too. Like others said, the fun room is not very fun. My favourite monster is by far the bacteria (we nicknamed him cable guy) because it is so fun to be chased by him. Least favourite is smiley (nicknamed spongebob) cause hes not very fun. The other monsters are pretty good too, but the best area in the game is the first area right after you get off the first elevator. I have not done the sewers yet, but the other areas (parking garage and office) are fun but just not quite as clever as the first bit with puzzles. And you gotta deal with meat boy (don't know his name) and he just keeps coming. Solid game though, so far provides a good amount of fun if you're looking for some cheap thrills. 8/10 Edit: I completed the multiple endings now. They do add some extra content, and are pretty great. I still believe the dark rooms area is the best, but these at least add some replayability. Hopefully they add more in the future as I would love to have some more areas to explore. If you do decide to try to find all the endings (I believe there are 4 in total) it can be a little tricky to figure out how to find two of them. One of them you come across in the parking garage (leads you to the area, the sewers) so that one is pretty easy, and the other one you come across in the office rooms as well, and that is pretty obvious (escape ending). However, the other two are not quite as clear. One of them involves a little bit of back tracking after the office (if you go that same route) and uses the computer too (this is the lost in the backrooms ending). The other one is called the fun rooms, which requires you to go back into the party room after finishing the party games (flesh cake ending). Although the lost in the backrooms ending (there are technically two but one is sewerage) is a bit tricky to find, it is quite easy to do. Same with the fun rooms. I would say the most difficult ending is the sewerage, but that is just because it takes the longest to do. Still believe it is an 8/10 game, most fun with friends.",1670838255,1671000975,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Don't play this game, if you hyperventilate easily or suffer from chest pain, you might get a heart attack.

Don't get me wrong, it's probably a great horror game to some people, but not for me at all. Never was into creepypastas.

sure you can restart levels in the game with a group, but none of the stuff you did prior was performed in that instance or save of the game, making it impossible to be useful

It's frustrating and fairly buggy in its current state. While it technically works in VR, the implementation feels clunky and sometimes things just straight up don't work. I've died to a monster, found my door, and been unable to recover my items many times in VR mode where desktop is not an issue. There is a particular puzzle that requires you to read some names from the floor. When interacting with these objects, the VR camera jarringly pulls the your body and view down to the floor to read the labels. It's at a strange angle and could easily induce vertigo in sensitive individuals. It also regularly forgets comfort settings (smooth vs. snap turning, etc.) after death. I was unable to choose a character in the VR version and, sadly, was unable to scare my friends by creeping along with some of the spookier player models. I would only recommend VR mode to VR veterans and those with patience. 

Outside of VR mode, the game is fun and the puzzle solutions are randomized with each playthrough. The layout remains the same if that makes a difference to you. The monsters do a good job of breaking the group up and slowing down progression in an entertaining way. They're also visually well designed and you can get some genuine spooks in certain spots. It's a great buy for $5 if you're planning to play mainly with keyboard and mouse. Make sure you have a good group of friends to play with - the kind you'd take to an escape room. For the time being, I'd recommend turning off ambient occlusion. Huge performance impact for not much difference in visual quality.",1670184595,1670184595,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

It is a giant maze that you will get lost in constantly, have to backtrack at times, and you'll get killed by the monsters pretty frequently if you aren't careful. BUT! It is a really fun game to play with a friend or 2. My first playthrough with another friend took a little over 3 hours, which might seem short, but the game is really cheap and still in development. The game has a story (kind of, only make sense once you finish) and 3 alternate endings, which will add more playtime if you so choose to go for them. The game has puzzles, which increase in difficulty as you go through the levels. I suggest doing the story mode on easy as on normal you only have 10 lives. As a side note: Unless you are an achievement hunter don't go the sewers route (the blue door in the parking garage), it's fucking terrible and you will waste at least 4 hours getting a shitty 3 second cut scene that isn't finished.

In the 5 hours that I have played the game, I never had a crash, which is good because there isn't a save function. From the main menu there is a ""start at"" feature, but it does reset all progress you've made.

here are the main points that made me dislike this game and regret paying for it

1: no save points, if you leave the game no matter where u are, than u must start from the beginning
2: chapter 3 is just full of all the monsters u fought and make it way too annoying as i had ran a lot from the dog only to run into another monster and be killed
3: listening for the heartbeat after death can be really confusing and iv nearly lost all progress just to find it, i think the heartbeat should have more signs to find the door
4: the monster that killed my fun the most was the smiley face as it got way too annoying to run into

However I was playing the sewer rooms today with my friend and we were in the oil room when I died to an entity #5.

This meant we had to restart as I had all the medallions for one of the puzzles in the level and 2 of the oil cans to fill up. This really pissed me off as we had gotten really far in the level only for us to end up losing stuff we needed to complete the level. If I could give this game a star rating I would give it 3 stars. Good gameplay, good levels, but unfortunately a bug had to happen to me when we were so close to beating the level and we had been playing for 2 hours.

1987080,127495452,76561198338250936,0,3,188,0,188,1669625107,"The concepts behind the game are good and I like much of it so far, but there are multiple quality of life issues. The most important and why you should wait to buy this game until it exits early-access is just how long it takes to get to the first save point. I was playing with my friends and three hours in I was exhausted, stressed, and just wanted to quit. We hadn't gotten to the save point yet but we were all so mentally tired we just gave it up. It was very discouraging and by the end I felt like crying. The game was fun at first but going 3 hours with no ability to save made it feel like torture. If it weren't for that I would not have refunded the game. 

Other QOL issues are more minor and I'm sure will get better as the game updates. One was no way to move all of the contents of a 'death' box back into your inventory quickly. Another was the lack of a setting to change the amount of respawns before permanent death. While the limited amount of respawns is a nice touch to make the game scarier, not all players find that fun. The limit to respawns is especially frustrating given the fact that there are some areas in the game where it is easy to be spawn-killed (dog followed us into radioactivity room, did not leave the entire 15 minutes we were there and resulted in 7 deaths between the three of us because we could not do anything without being attacked). Similarly I died in a long hallway with ENTITY #10 and it would not walk far enough away for me to revive without being killed again. This was not helped by the fact that upon waking up both directions (towards the monster and towards safety) looked identical. 

Respawn loot looking the same for every player (yellow box) is also frustrating because in the hurry to pick up your things before you get attacked, it is easy to accidentally take some of the contents of a friend's box if they died next to you. It is then very difficult to drop all of their stuff as you have to open the item interaction menu and then click the drop button for every single item to give them to your teammate, which is difficult to do if you are about to be spawn-killed again. 

Occasionally smilies will spawn on top of you and insta-kill you which is very frustrating. This didn't happen to me personally but it happened to my friends on four separate occasions. 

I understand some players like to be kept in the dark about the details of the game, but some of the puzzles seemed non-obvious (or at least it is easy to miss something) and having a hints system would be a nice touch, especially for normal and easy mode. 

When you are in your 'ghost' state you can hear the footsteps of monsters but not see them. Seeing them would give an advantage to teammates, so it makes sense that you cannot see them. But in that case you should not hear them either because the sound of footsteps sounds similar to the heartbeat sound (which could also be made to be more clear and easier to follow.)

Finally there need to be more audio settings for both the in-game comms and otherwise. My mic was extremely quiet for some reason in game and I was entirely inaudible for my teammates, so we had to join a discord call so they could hear me. This was unfortunate because it meant that we had proximity chat for them, but not for me (my teammates could hear me at all times). Although my team was audible, I have hearing issues and couldn't hear 50% of what they said in proximity chat. I wish there was a slider where I could turn my team up, but just turning down the game a lot helped. 

Overall the game has great concepts and I enjoyed it in the beginning, but I can't in good faith recommend that most people buy it until it has undergone more changes (mostly regarding the save system). That said, keep an eye on this game! If the developers do improve QOL, I think it will be a great co-op horror game that is easy for beginners but scary for all levels of gamers.

Item and monster spawns are somewhat random, which allows for some unique experiences, but it can also lead to a slog of back and forth fetch quests to complete puzzles. The many puzzles in the game are necessary to add some sort of challenge, but the types of puzzles don't feel like they fit well with the overall theme of the game. Sometimes an entity will just hang around your corpse after you die and when you revive it will immediately attack you; this is particularly frustrating for the entities that kill instantly. The worst section of the game involves running around a maze 3 times looking for 1, then 2, then 3 items, followed by running around another maze 5 times to interact with other items, each time with only about 15 seconds before an entity starts hunting you.",1669656907,1669656907,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The experience I had after the beginning half of the game has felt like a slap to the face with how much time has been wasted trying to un-fuck the bugginess of the monsters and the slog that is traversing the sewers.

***There are 3 Difficulties: Easy  
                                      Normal
                                      Hard
We played All of the but we didn't finish the hard dificullty since its nearly impossible. for begginers i recommend easy and if you beat it once then try normal

***Backrooms (Level 0) - it is a decent level to start with, the elevator puzzle took me 30 min first time we played it. There are no threats in this level. 7/10


***Backrooms (Level 1) - in my opinion, this is the greatest level in the game and where we had most fun and were scared, puzzle's were fun and actually made us use our brains and felt rewarding. There are 3 threats: Smiley, Larry and The Hound. Smiley is the Simplest to avoid, if you see him, look away and run so he cant see you and you are good. Bacteria aka Larry will chase you if he sees you. you can tell if he is near you by the red lights near you, if you see red lights, run or hide in a locker. The Hound can be avoided by closing the vents with a screwdriver, but he is unavoidable in 2 sections, otherwise you can hide from him in a locker. i'd give this level 10/10 very fun


***Parking - is a very short but simple level. there is only 1 Threat: Skin-Stealer (we called him Deadpool for some reason) is a pretty simple but dangerous enemy, if he sees you, he will outrun you, you need to hide otherwise you are dead. i'd give this level 8/10 pretty spooky


***Office - oh god this level made us go insane, we streamed this game on youtube and i almost lost my mind since most of the puzzles were figured by me and it was too hard for me, i'm not saying it was badly designed, quite the opposite, it is perfectly designed and challenging, deffinitelly will make you use your brain the most... or walktrought but at least try to beat it without one, you will feel like a god. there are 3 Threats i believe, Skin-Stealer, the partygoer and the clump. the partygoer is very challenging the first time you play it, but if you play it many times, you will get used to it. i will not spoil it, its a pretty interesting section, the clump will not chase you but will kill you if you get near it, u need to use a motion tracker to know where it is, pretty interesting too. i'll mention it again, puzzle's are challenging but rewarding. i'd give this level a 9/10


***Right now there are 4 endings i believe and i will not spoil them all, but i'll say this, the newest one took us 10 hours to complete.

***Overall i'd give this game a 9/10 this is a very quality horror game and i'm really interested how it will develop further, it is only 4 euros it is definitely worth it solo or coop it doesn't matter. also this game is in vr too. i dont have a vr but i would like to get one and try this in vr. Definitelly a YES for me

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I love this game, but having asthma fits every 5-10 seconds of running and slowing down for even longer is just extremely tedious, and makes Level ! literally impossible without dying and makes it hard to really enjoy playing the game to its fullest. Additionally in !, if you respawn, you have literally 1-2 seconds before you die again (the smiler spawns incredibly close) Was looking forward to playing the level after the update but after getting into it, was a little disappointed.

If you ask me, I think this can be fixed with three things:

-Lower sprint speed
-Increase in sprint time
-Large increase in sprint regen (it's really bad)

I have to say that this game made me feel almost every emotion humanly possible in only a few hours of gameplay.

Sure, it still has room for improvement, in the stability, graphics, 3D models and stuff, but even the game being on Early Access, it is still a game worth buying, you will not regret it and will have lots of fun.

This game is 110% worth playing IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS, I know it's a little too much to ask of you but hear me out. I am a lil scardey boi therefore I could not play this game solo, but with friends it made the purchase worth it and the experience GRAND. Every moment was pure comedic bliss and terror, my friends leading me towards false hope only for them to turn the corner and come face to face with the worst dog I've ever seen. We screamed, we laughed, we ran away in terror leaving each other behind to get eaten by tentacle man. 

Where my grievances arise:

Initial play through, the Party Room was HORRENDOUS with the amount of lives it ate away. It seemed so simple, a party right? Fun and enjoyable? WRONG! This balloon bastard takes evil to a whole new level, their only purpose being to kick your ass to kingdom come. HOWEVER, it is such a satisfying level when you can finesse it and escape. This level is for sure one to play without the lives turned on because you will be suffering a poor souls end trying to escape the backrooms with him leaving you a single life. Another grievance arises with the newest sewer level which is its own breed of evil, me and my friends were unable to escape the sewer (3 hrs) because of a bug that prevented the final door from opening. The level itself requires the player to use an online map of some kind because getting around there while avoiding the rats and knowing where to go is big hard. 

Overall, the game is a blast. I love me some indie horror that receives continuous updates AND EVENTS!!! That Halloween event was actually pretty cool even if it was just finding treats in the map to unlock skins, I enjoy collecting skins man it's my burden. Get this game if you got homies, and are down to sink in an ungodly amount of hours into completing a full 100% play through. Good luck.

There was a Halloween event that's about to expire now. You had to collect candies in each of the levels, but there's a few spots the candies can spawn that can't be collected. Getting a playthrough without these broken spawns is difficult, random, and time consuming, because you need to restart the entire game from the beginning searching through literal mazes just to find a candy you can't even collected.

As for the update and the sewers...I was 5 seconds away from finishing the game and it crashed, its 100 times harder and more confusing, impossible without a playthrough, impossible without a map...the AI still sucks, sometimes if you die your suitcase spawns in another room, and even if you die somewhere else again it ONLY spawns there, then you have a black screen after dying at the end because the mother rat was missing and you couldn't see her... plus there needs to be small things implemented like adding a ""Collect all"" from your suitcase after you die, there needs to be a way to equip items without having to ""interact"" then select the item from your inv.

The visuals create a very accurate atmosphere to the Backrooms aesthetic and can make for some very scary moments. The monsters are also very interesting with haunting animations and sounds that actually make you feel afraid as they approach you. Despite these qualities, I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that YOU CANNOT SAVE. As someone who doesn't always have an opportunity to play for long periods at a time, the option to save is detrimental. When my friend and I were getting decently far in the game and we decided to get off, the realization that none of our progress saved was devastating and completely depleted my interest in coming back to it.

Firstly, the game takes 1 hour to complete. why would you need to save. my first play through without knowing anything, completed in 2 hours flat. my friends do it in 50 mins. its meant to be a ""run through"" not a little at a time lol.

Anyways after the Tea, i highly recommend this game. god do the monsters scare the crap out of you and the puzzles are amazing. loved every second of it. and for $5? man its a steal! buy now play with friends do NOT  play alone, to hard.",1667755467,1667755467,True,2,0,0.53956836462020874,0,True,False,True
