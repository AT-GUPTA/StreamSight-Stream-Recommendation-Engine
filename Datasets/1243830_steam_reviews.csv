Bought this for the updated graphics and additional bonus levels during a sale.

The main part of the game seems to work for me, but the game has bugs which get never addressed. For example, some levels are made in a way that the timer only starts rolling once you deliver the first meal. So you can prep all the ingredients and then deliver super quickly later. In this version, the timer just runs always when you try to get 4 stars. That way, you can never reach the 4 star score.

I see in the forum that this has been reported several times and the feedback from the moderator was ""it was handed it to the development team"". But it's not fixed for months or years. What else can you do than give this game a negative review. They had no issue taking my money. This stuff worked correctly in Overcooked 2, but not in this version.

If you want to play this game with other players not stay together and use the same computer.You must defray extra cash for accelerator,it is necessary,a software to make sure you and others can keep contact instead of loss the contact,the pay expenses is persistent, if you want this service,you should pay for it,although we already had all the content about the game,but if you want enjoy the function,still need to do something.Then I think it is fantastic as a cook game,the general appearance of a picture is cute,playing method is also interesting,but it is just my thinking,so if you do not like this game,that is all right,I have to say it is horrible we need to solve the problem about the game by ourselves,before the problem be seen,I know nothing about it and think I can use all of the part and enjoy my time after download,I was flurried.So somebody  said the matching mechanism is rubbish,I think so.It is not itself provide it for you,the truth maybe absurd,no kidding.
If you want to see other player's personal information,you need the software called steam++，maybe the requirement can be changed if you are live in different place,if you can't get into steam community,you can have a try.Even if you used the accelerator,you still have the chance loss the contact with others,it seem not have method to solve the problem,as I.If other people and you used different accelerator,your feeling may become bad because at this time control yourself in the game will be more difficult than usual.  However,as long as the game can be played,it is enough for me,the game is wicked.
By the way,when you play with others online,at the very start somebody stay together with you(maybe one，two,or three),as long as they don't secede,you can play with them for long time without somebody midway add,you and others can keep contact and nobody disturb yourselves,until somebody quit,I like this truth,and that's why I stay here,I only like play with one person at the same time.Only with the person I like and wish become together,just stay along with me,at this time,I always be happy.We can enjoy the time belong to ourselves and nobody else,that's really so warm,joyful time,took me so many sweet memories and pleasure.The game took me some fun,I really really like this game.",1687074657,1701940473,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, what makes this game truly shine is the chaotic fun it delivers when you play with friends. It's not just about cooking; it's about laughter, frustration, and the challenge of working together seamlessly.

Communication is your best friend, and can help make sure everyone is on the same page, and so everything can run smoothly.

The controls for pc are a ""must tweak,"" because it was pretty hard with default controls. My fiancee and I use left mouse for pickup/drop, and right mouse clicking for doing tasks.

Aside from that, its SUPER fun, its chaotic in a good way, and once you learn the mechanics it can be a huge blast.

It's easily the best deal if you want the full Overcooked experience, as it includes a remaster of both Overcooked 1 & 2, all extra DLCs plus new ones, fully integrated online with new features such as voice chat, and even has enhanced 4K graphics with 60 FPS in it, which is even better than Overcooked! 2 graphics. This is a real game changer, and is extremely fun to play with friends. Couch co-op  is the best for this game in my opinion, and is EXTREMELY fun. The original Overcooked games weren't too replayable, but this one definitely is as it has SO much content in it. It has ALL overcooked content and costs less than buying both overcooked 1 and 2 and is easily the best option if you're looking to buy all there is to overcooked. It's a great and amazingly fun experience, and I cannot stress enough how much of a great time I had playing this game with my family. 10/10 for me, I haven't played a game this fun in a long time, and in my opinion, it's one of the best options out there if you're looking to buy a party game. Singleplayer isn't as fun to be honest, but multiplayer is on a different level of fun. Amazing game. If you have a chance, I HIGHLY recommend buying this game.",1691792729,1691792729,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I spent so many nights playing it with my friends on the sofa, I really feel like it's a masterpiece, expect for its' two major problems...

Firstly, online connection. Sorry to say it but IT SUCKS SO MUCH. the lag, the infinite amount of time it takes to find someone, only for them to leave a minute after. It makes the online experience unbearable...

Second, the points needed for 4 stars. I feel like ever since the updates they made they literally couldn't care less about this, what shows their willing to help. The timer starts automatically when it shouldn't, ridiculous amounts of points needed... A complete joke. And this would be something that would take them less than 1 day to fix...

Overall I still recommend the game, for a casual couch gameplay it is perfect, not just that good for someone wanting to play online or wanting to 4-star every level

We instantly gave up on playing because the game already ruined first impressions by the fact you cannot simply swap players around. The order/colour of your players is locked into whatever controller order is established in the main menu.

So there is no way to do ""hey lets retry that level but swap places"" or even choose the places initially for preference.

The only way is to quit the game, reboot it, and initialise the other controller first so it becomes P1.

However, I got disconnected from the network (error screen, which ended the level prematurely) while playing a level SOLO a few seconds from the end. What a pain even solo play is affected. Due to this, I solemnly cannot recommend this title.

EDIT: after 15 hours
I really wanted to change this review to positive, since there are additional chefs, levels and a graphical overhaul of Overcooked! 1, but having single player require online connectivity really killed the buzz for me, especially since the disconnection issue ruined another level. I finished achievement hunting in Overcooked! 1 and 2 and still feel Overcooked! 2 holds its own.

I got this game to play with two other friends, and coming from a game called PlateUp, I thought that with a similar premise, we were going to have a lot of fun. It initially did start off as a fun, challenging game. However, over the course of the game, that challenged turned into absurd difficulty and it started getting ridiculous.

Some of the levels the game throws at you are really difficult to wrap around, but imagine trying to get multiple people to understand it and figure out how to optimally work with each other. We had to take several attempts to barely understand the levels, combine it with some minor bugs in this game, and other minor details, the game knows how to infuriate you. And I hate how this is the default difficulty of the game. The fact that the game has ways to make it easier through ""Assist Settings"" is condescending and makes you feel like you are not good enough for the game.

Getting 3 stars on a level honestly isn't possible unless you and your friends completely sweat with the dashes and get good RNG with the recipes. It was through this that we got a few close calls to 3 stars, but only falling a few points short. But the game deliberately times you to where if you don't get it within the second, the customer gets impatient and fails you. 

I know PlateUp has some finnicky controls, but it is much worse in this game. Sometimes whenever I place an ingredient in a pot or trying to pick up a pot/pan before the meat burns, the game oftentimes misunderstood where I was facing and decides to place what I'm holding on the completely wrong tile, or it picks up an item I'm not even looking at. It's almost as if the developers didn't do enough playtesting to iron out these seemingly minor issues that can make or break an attempt.

Also, don't bother playing this on singleplayer. On singleplayer, you have to control two people and it is difficult to manage, especially if you are playing with a controller. If you ever choose to play this game, at least get it with a friend so it becomes more bearable. Get a good friend, so that when the both of you get upset trying to do some of the levels, you can forget it.

The plot is cheesy, but I can overlook it. I like the look of the game, it's nice and refreshing. The soundtrack is pretty nice. But that's all the positives that I can say about this game. Unless you're willing to sweat or you can hold your rage, don't buy this game.",1676949000,1676949000,False,3,2,0.419288218021392822,0,True,False,False

[b][u]PROS[/u]:[/b] Overcooked! All You Can Eat is a complete edition consisting of both Overcooked! games, all DLC, & some additional stages to entice owners of the previous titles.  The games still have that goofy charm to them with their silly plot & irreverent stages.  The controls are tight & fluid, leaving little room for error outside of human control.  The variety of stages & dishes is still just as nice as ever, with different mechanics unique to each stage.  The soundtrack is equally as charming, with the overworld theme being the easiest to stick in one's memory.  Finally, the co-op is just as fun as ever, making the stages both easier to complete & more chaotic to run about, as well as increasing the star required score due to the number of chefs running about.

[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] Overcooked! 1 feels slightly out of place, the lack of a throw food option making the game feel a bit slower.  Where the stages are varied, some can be quite annoying due to the individual level features, such as ice physics in the ice world.  The largest con for fans of the series would be the game's status.  As a complete edition of both titles, this is not a bundle, meaning players who already own both games will already have about 90% of this in their collection already.

[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] This is actually an easier list than the original titles this was based off of.  The removal of the heavier grind achievements have been replaced with ones requiring multiple chefs to be specific chefs.  This needs to be done online, or locally using a controller & keyboard/second controller.  There really isn't too much difficulty here, other than completing the main campaigns if one finds them difficult.  One doesn't even need to finish a majority of the DLC to clear the list either.

[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Overcooked! All You Can Eat is a fun bundle of two fast paced, enjoyable games with some extra DLC added for those who want more.  It's colorful style & frenetic gameplay creates a wonderful experience, be it solo, couch co-op, or online.  Though owners of the titles would be much better off waiting for a sale, newcomers should jump on this first rather than start with the earlier games.

Let me preface this by saying that I work actual food service. I find cooking to be quite enjoyable and a little bit of micromanagement, especially in a real world setting, is absolutely no problem to me at all. When I played this game for the first time, my experience was a bit akward and uncomfortable, much like how you'd feel at your first day in a real job. This feeling didn't go away however. I initially wrote it off as just me being bad, however the more patient I try to be with this game, the more frustrated I get, and I think I should get my views on this game out just to validate the feelings of those in the same predicament as me, since I really didn't see anybody acknowledging this in the reviews. Maybe this is just me and my play style, but this game is FAR too gimmicky for me to play. The base gameplay which consists of prepping food and serving it has virtually no depth to it, making a good 90% of this game pointless, impractical, micromanagement due to all the pointless and nonsensical gimmicks in the game. If there's anything I know from my experiences with games, it's that difficulty is no substitute for gameplay, and this game is practically the reason I believe that. Sometimes you'll be prepping food and the entire kitchen starts moving away from you (WTF??!) or the kitchen will have an infestation of super rats that can locate and acquire food as soon as it's dropped. My personal favorite is that level where people are just casually walking through the kitchen. That kind of stupidity and spatial unawareness makes me absolutely livid. If somebody walked through the kitchen at work we'd literally just kick them the fuck out. So why the hell should I take that shit in a game? Every level there's a dumber, more bizarre obstacle that holds dominion over the kitchen that you just happen to be working in. I understand that this is a video game, but this is a game about cooking. Why the hell am I forced to play in these levels that are were so obviously not designed to be cooked in? The level choices are creative, but frustrating and practically designed against you, which I have to hold against the game since it's just so unrealistic for a food service environment. There's a way to make your game difficult without making it this ridiculously frustrating. Take a game like Touhou 6 or Crash Bandicoot for example. Those levels are clearly designed for you to play them, and the difficulty is based on skill, where as in Overcooked it's more about management. You can't just make a game super overwhelming and substitute that in for difficulty. I'm a bit of a perfectionist so I found it hard to even get started on most levels let alone get a good flow going, and that's basically why I'm writing this review. In my opinion, it feels like the player has very little control over the game, and instead of actually introducing skills that let players thrive in that environment, the game focuses more on just putting the player somewhere and forcing them to just deal with it. If I wanted to deal with annoying customers, I'd go back to work and actually get paid for it. This game is really cute and has a lot of accessibility features, but it feels like you're trying to do a job while a group of mentally disabled children running amok and wreaking havoc on your workspace. To give you a better example, this game is like a Mario game where all the levels are water levels, and instead of making them harder as they went on they just added ridiculous spams of enemies. Cute game, not worth the stress at all imo. This is the only game where I can be bored of the gameplay while still stressing out about the levels.

This game unfortunately is NOT optimized for PC controller play. I have never had this issue with Overcooked 2 so when it felt like my character was moving through sand on screen, I was really disappointed. My character will slide without me moving it, glitches all over the screen, and just in general has zero accuracy when trying to place/chop/throw anything. I am so confused as to how this came after Overcooked 2 which has just been a fantastic experience. I understand it is basically a combination of the two games, but clearly something was done RIGHT with OC2 that was just not implemented in All you can eat. It needs to be fixed, because this is an absolute chore to play with friends.

Edit 10/15/2022:
So this game has gotten better since it's first launch although it has never played as smoothly as OC2 did which still baffles me. This recent update (world food festival) really feels like it was not properly played through before release. I don't play solo so all my experiences come from both hosting as well as joining my friend's game (we tested both to see if the issues were lag-related or game related). We played through all levels once to 3 star and then again to 4 star and the issues were consistent through each playthrough. This update has ridiculous bugs that I have never experiences on any other level.
1. Our characters frequently dropping or throwing food without prompt, and I MEAN frequently
2. In 1-2 specifically the amount of times items were dropped or thrown was ridiculous, thought it might have something to do with the stairs
3. Collision with other characters as well as fire was ridiculously exaggerated, simply bumping into a player would throw them off the map and cause a re-spawn, even if we were nowhere near an area on the map we could fall (1-2 get kicked from the sink area to the water, 1-3 from multiple areas)
4. On 3-1 & 3-2 the score system and stars are screwed, show 0 and what you score doesn't matter, you get 3 or 4 stars without actually getting a high score (tested), does not show you what score you have to get to reach each star at the start of the level either
5. On 3-4 specifically the delivery guy is just stuck, doesn't move, and his box is not reachable. We tried throwing the items into the box to get something to happen but the box looked bugged too so we gave up and played around the delivery guy
6. This is minor compared to everything else but emoting was bugged and players couldn't hear their own character emote 1/2 the time

I look forward to every update because I genuinely enjoy this game and the games that have come before it. These kinds of bugs make playing very hard to enjoy though, and I honestly expect OC2 level gameplay given it clearly worked well.",1628574074,1665897738,False,4,0,0.543983221054077148,0,True,False,False

most level designs of the maps in <Overcooked!> are too single,lack of the performance of cooperation and having strong sense of separation. The difficulties of story(1) is not progressive, most of them are around the same level of difficulties and model sets are quite similar.
""Festival seasoning"" is okay, but still can't compare with any map from ,<Overcooked!2>
  I think <Overcooked!2> is the real masterwork, you can see through it's the brainchild from designers, every level of it is meaningful and needs ability of thinking ,judging, and asks for intensive cooperation.I think that's why <Overcooked!2> is still so popular nowadays.(2)'s overall design ideas are the unique thing that no other similar games can compare.
  I personally prefer Kevin levels, I know most new players and some of old players don't like them,but Kevin levels will actually become easier when you have understanding of it, degree of proficiency is not as useful in Kevin levels. It asks more for tactics and comprehension.
<Overcooked: All You Can Eat> only added 2 new maps, ""Birthday Party"" and ""The Ever Peckish Rises"",they are okay ,but ""obstacles"" in some levels seem to too intentional and a bit useless, i don't know if it's because the production team is lack of inspiration. And ""The Ever Peckish Rises"" seems to borrow from <Overcooked!>'s model, I don't know why did they do this.  They seem to be made from different team from ,<Overcooked!2>. I'd say for players who loves <Overcooked!2>, you guys won't like them.
  If the creation team really wants the overcooked series to last long, you guys should't think of how to let people leave <Overcooked!2> , to let them move out and buy a ""new game"", but think of how to keep the players, to make real meaningful maps, or even make new mainlines and add them into the most popular production.
  All in all, <Overcooked; All you can eat> is not worthwhile for buying or playing, because most maps from<1> are..... I'd say, boring ,for players who played <2> already, the new maps they made are not better. The overall optimization they made for the game is super low, it's better not to optimize at all. There are tons of bugs that <2> doesn't have, I'm not going to list here.
  Anyway, if you are a lover of overcooked game, you'll be disappointed.

This game is great fun with friends, definitely, just like the other Overcooked! games. The assist mode is a very welcome addition, especially because not all of my friends game a lot or are familiar with controller games. It prevents everyone from getting frustrated on a nice afternoon. It also makes playing with younger kids much easier, as the game gets much harder further into the story. I would recommend getting AYCE to anyone who hasn't previously purchased one of the games and want to have some (chaotic) fun with friends. 

I personally don't regret buying AYCE on Steam mostly because OC!2 on my switch can serve as a more portable method of playing as I could bring it to someone else's, and for the price of the original Overcooked! plus a bit more, I get to play the original AND all DLCs (in addition to the OC!2 I already have) on my PC, which I think is better than on a switch. However, if it wasn't on sale, I might be a bit more hesitant when it comes to this purchase. 

I probably will not recommend this game, especially when bought at full price, to someone who already has at least one previous game (OC!1 or OC!2) and on the same platform.

OC 2 on Epic Games - terrible online connection experience for Australia. Painful rubberbanding 80% of games.

AYCE: 
Online experience:
- Connection is *much* better, possibly steam > epic servers, and dedicated Australia server. 
- Light rubberbanding is rare. However, ""powerpoint presentation"" visuals sometimes when due to someone else is hosting. 
- Easier to find skilled (not new player) teammates, as dedicated players buy AYCE and people on epic likely picked up OC2 for free (me).

Pros:
- OC1 levels online multiplayer, and all existent DLC. 
- Being the latest installment, *will get more developer attention than OC2.*
- Remote play any level with non-owners. 

Cons: 
- Scarcer people in online public
Maybe don't bother if you have OC2, as more people have that. Deffo only buy when discount.
- Common ""Powerpoint presentation"" visuals when not hosting. Sometimes light rubberbanding, but never as bad as OC2 was.
- Strange 3d interaction collision when dashing up stairs, items getting placed on ledges, out of reach. Deffo not perfect, may or may not be due to combined lag.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Overcooked! is an amazing game. It forces you to cooperate with your friends through 200+ transforming and challenging kitchens. The game tries not to become overly repetitive, by constantly offering new and unique mechanics, like new recipes and environmental switches, though the game can get a little repetitive at times.
Though, if you do plan on doing multiplayer, be a little cautious, as while it hasn't screwed up yet for me, it has for many other people.

Im not exactly the greatest example of manual dexterity, but this game (or rather, OC1 and OC2) is nearly impossible when playing alone; the craziest levels actually give you more than one chef to control at once, which might be easier on a controler because I guess (?) you dont have to swap which one youre controling at any given time

But then, there are the obstacles

Cooking on a ship which moves some of your tables as it rocks to the waves
Cooking over ice, which means the floor  is slippery
Cooking on a kitchen standing over a tectonic plate
COOKING ON A KITCHEN DIVIDED INTO 2 OR 3 <REDACTED> MOVING TRUCKS

Some of these are truly aggravating (so far, for me, the truck ones are the worst)

But

The game is cute; it has charm. The characters are always with a happy face. They seem to truly enjoy what they are doing. And once you find friends to play with, you can kinda understand them. Sure, your pal just threw your perfectly fine dish of fish and chips into the ocean and half the kitchen's on fire because you yourself slid off the platform, but most of the time you'll (probably) be thrash talking eachother because of those mistakes.

I bought OC1 originally, but kinda gave up on it because of the difficulty I had. Now Im playing with my GF and having a blast with it. And we converted a friend of ours to come get his ass served with us.

As others have said, if you have one or both of the other games, dont buy it full price; there SHOULD be a discount for ppl who have one or both games IMO. But if you're completely new to this series, and/or got to this game during a sale, buy it, convince friends to buy it too, and, as they say, ""Bone Apple Tea"" (yes, this is wrong)",1641749252,1641749252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You get all the levels from Overcooked 1 and 2, achievements also don't require you to perfect those old levels again.

The way I see it, you buy this game for the ""cross-play"" feature if you already have Overcooked 1 and 2. It's a shame they didn't just update Overcooked 2 with the feature, but oh well. Cross-play works for me. Maybe it varies for different PCs or regions? I tried UK PC to UK Switch and it seemed to work fine. It's not straightforward, though. You have to add each other with Team17 IDs and you can only see this when you go into Manage Team on the Menu screen (Y on Xbox controller) > Online Play. I thought it was in the settings or on the general menu, it's a bit obscure.

Arcade Public I usually find one other person, but haven't encountered a full house yet like I have with Overcooked 2. Versus Public on both games from what I've seen is dead. Playing with friends is probably the way to go if anyone is online.

I think the trailer does a good job of showcasing what the game is about so i won't go in depth here, the basics are working together with your group to cook and deliver various meals to customers, This starts out simple but toward the end will really test your co-ordination and teamwork skills if you're looking to get the maximum star rank on each level. The game offers a gigantic variety of recipes and stages to play on with new mechanics or hazards to consider. If you like the gameplayloop you won't be disappointed with the huge amount of content on offer here. I really could sit there all day making ramen in the giant woks

While the game certainly won't click for everyone i feel Overcooked! appeals to a wide range of ages and skill levels, i've played the series with different people trying to achieve very different goals but the common factor is that it has always been a fun time.

I purchased it for myself and 2 friends.  We spent the better part of 50 hours trying to 100% the game.  We love it.  I swallowed the steep price as I value the quality time with my friends.

Unfortunately, the game is unplayable.  We constantly get an E015-7 error, which kicks us out of the online session.  This never happened in Overcooked 2.  Or any other steam game we play together.

This game isn't really meant to be played solo.  It is a multiplayer experience.

Because of the greedy tactics of Team 17, and the unplayable state of the game, I would NOT recoomend this title to anyone.",1632424478,1632424478,False,29,0,0.721126317977905273,0,True,False,False

Call me lonely, but I have been playing solo since OC, and up until now, I don't really mind about cross-multiplayer and online matchmaking (for now, probably gonna change my mind once the devs improve this system)

If you really love and support OC, as well as enjoy solo play like me, then this is the game to go. People say it's expensive, but I'm pretty sure the devs will work hard on the updates and patches. Plus, I remember that there will be 5 free updates this year... I really hope that's the case though lol. The game may not worth it for now, but if the devs kept their promise and work hard for the players, this game will worth the expensive price in the future (given that the price is kept fixed). If the devs raised the price though after free updates, that's messed up lol. But at least you don't have to bear higher price if you buy this game now

One thing though, I noticed that this game causes my laptop to overheat easily. The first time I played this game (2 months ago), my laptop overheated like crazy, it went shut down by itself, with a weird sound of charge. I couldn't turn on my laptop, so I had to let it cool down before charging the battery (which gives the same weird sound), and finally be able to turn on my laptop. I have never met with this issue whenever I play another 3D game (a game between 40-60 players), which I currently and actively play

I have to ask my friend's help to optimize the performance so that I can play this game nicely. As for now, I have not met with such problem ever since the performance is optimized, but the overheating issue from this game is still my concern. I wonder how my laptop will be able to withstand the heat once I reach the final level... [PRO TIP: Turn on the VSync so that the FPS stays fixed. I reckon that variable FPS during gameplay is one of the factors of this issue]

I really hope that the devs do something about this overheating issue. To the devs, make sure that this game really worth the high price 

Pros:
-Better graphics and UI
-You don't have to buy DLCs from OC and OC2 to play them
-The camera doesn't zoom in even if you play solo (a huge problem in original OC)

Cons:
-Crossplay and matchmaking doesn't work (not that you'll mind if you play solo lol)
-You won't get certain achievements if you play solo :(
-Overheating issue

TL;DR: If you support Overcooked, usually plays solo and have decent gaming computer, go for it! May not worth it for now, but it will in the future

Update: I have just bought myself a gaming PC, and I have enjoyed this game a lot. Of course, I play other games as well, but I really enjoyed the latest birthday update. Sure, the last level is quite frustrating to get 4 stars, but it is supposed to be challenging

Tbh, I feel sorry for Overcooked team because of the recent backlash, especially from Twitter. It's kinda sad that I saw the banner changed because of that. Sure, someone has screwed up in the making of this game, or even this update. Sure, the damage has been done, but I still have faith in this game. I really hope that the dev team will make things right and bring this game back to its glory days, just like how my other favourite game ([spoiler]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/spoiler]) were used to fall in popularity last year, before giving great comeback with great updates this year",1621700459,1629734966,True,3,0,0.524822711944580078,0,True,False,False

FYI: A friend and I found that to help with the controller issue (at least with using Xbox) plug it in before you start the game and when it prompts to either Press A or Spacebar, Press A on the controller to ensure you are playing with a controller.

As someone who has played both the first and second games, I still ended up getting this because of cross-platform multiplayer, access to all the content from both games in one package, and online multiplayer for the first game. Sure it still has bugs and some other weird issues, but besides that this is a good value if you have never played either any of the Overcooked games, never played any of the DLCS, or for any other reasons.

Edit: Now that the game has been out for a while, I feel that there are still some issues with performance. I usually run the game on lower graphics quality, however it uses a lot of graphical power where most of my GPU usage always with this game will be almost 100% (maybe its just me).

What it feels like is they switched to using a dedicated server instead of having one host (in Overcooked 2), which was a nightmare of latency for anyone who wasn't hosting. While the new setup does introduce some weirdness from time to time, overall it's a far better experience than Overcooked 2. What's more, crossplay works flawlessly (I've been playing with friends who have the Switch version). 

While there were some issues initially upon launch (unable to crossplay, broken controller support), both have since been resolved, and it's been a great experience so far. It's a shame that some of the old music was replaced, but the gameplay has definitely been refined (Overcooked 2 engine, which means you can pick up cooked hamburger patties with just a bun instead of needing a plate, for example; this was impossible in Overcooked 1)",1621198017,1621198017,True,15,1,0.605453968048095703,0,True,False,False

Placing and picking up items takes a full second to register, and when map mechanics happen, you have no idea if you're shoved off the map or not. I don't understand how OC2 had such a good online play mode, but this completely butchers (lol) the experience. 
OC2 is my favourite game to play with friends, and I was super excited to play AYCE before release, but it's been a full month and a half since release, and over a month since the last patch. I'm massively disappointed in this game and really expected a lot better.

The new rats mechanic that steals your food is a terrible design choice, and you need to dedicate a player solely to stomp them instead of contributing to the team. I also tried to link my twitch account several times to no change in the game, which was a frustrating experience. 

I enjoyed the new chef choice screen, and the new end game screens. I wish the original game assets from OC1 and 2 were upscaled nicer than they are because they would look much nicer and be worth the price tag of this game.

This game is basically a patch for the second game to fix it, without adding anything new or innovative that would warrant a £30 price tag.

All You can Eat is a welcome sight for newcomers of the series and veterans and packs everything together (1 and 2 and all the DLC) in a nice lunch (see what I did there?) with updated graphics and Features. Crossplay is a very welcomed feature and much needed for all multiplayer games on multiple platforms. WE NEED TO NORMALIZE CROSSPLAY!

Despite the controller bugs (360 controller on pc here) and some connectivity issues, the game is great. I hope the developers keep working on solving these issues because I know people will buy this game. Another downside is the price. It should've been $25 and not $40. just my 2 cents (money puns!!!!)

Those who fall under the third ""Not Recommended"" category would think the game is overpriced and the loyalty discount is not enough to make up for it. I do agree to a certain degree. But at the same time, I understand that the highlight of playing AYCE is mostly its ability to support cross-platform and to make OC1 available in online Co-Op mode. I’m not sure if AYCE is marketed with the intention of encouraging old players to (re)buy the whole game, so if we see from a [b]newcomer’s point of view AYCE will definitely worth it[/b]. Other than that, I'm betting that future DLCs would probably be released more on this AYCE version.

We can’t deny Overcooked is super fun and has great gameplay, so at the very least I wouldn’t not recommend it just because the price fails some people.

The BGM and visual are really improving though! I love how catchy OC1 and the main menu music is~

I'm playing with keyboard so I have yet to experience controller issues (edit: heard they fix it with the patch by now?) But, as far as I've experienced, AYCE tends to have server issue when playing with friends. We need to close and relaunch the game so we're able to join a new session. There’s also this problem when we connect while enabling the cross-platform function, it tends to fail to connect (when hosting).

There will be lag and glitches still but it seems to be very likely that it isn't unplayable anymore when your friend is on the other side of the continent since this is server based instead of peer to peer. If your friend is near your city and you got a good connection already you might experience more glitches with All You Can Eat compared to Overcooked 2 though.

The game doesn't feel polished yet especially when a patch fixes issues but introduces new game braking bugs for other players.

Some bonus levels. All the chefs in a handy menu.

If you've never played Overcooked before, this is an incredible deal at $40 for all the content. Over 200 levels, with couch or online co-op for up to 4 players, as well as crossplay with other platforms. It's quite fun for both casual party play, and the more hardcore competitive end has a scene as well. overcooked.greeny.dev tracks high scores, and the Overcooked League Discord hosts no-stakes tournaments to test your skill against other teams in a somewhat live sense.

If you HAVE played every Overcooked game and DLC prior to this, it may be hard to justify the price tag. What you add is online play for OC1 levels, more chefs to play as, 7 brand new levels, somewhat better load times, and having everything in one package. I got a 15% dicount for owning all prior content. While not much, with how much play time I've gotten out of the series thus far, I was happy to support the dev more. So use your best judgement if the moderate convenience improvement is worth it to you.

There ARE currently some bugs that need working out with connectivity, though my personal experience hasn't been a dealbreaker. Hopefully these will be fixed in the future.

Another issue I hear of is bad controller support. I personally run 8bitdo with my PS4 controller emulated as a 360 controller, and have no issues with that. I'd do some research on it depending on your setup.

Controller worked for me immediatelly, without any custom settings or anything. If controller doesn't work for you, first check your steam controller settings, it fixed it for many players. Devs are also aware of the issues with some controllers and working on a fix, so if it's still broken for you, try again in a few days. You can also play on keyboard.

If you're just looking to play OC2 levels with the same group of friends, there's probably not enough content for you to justify the price.

It helped us to survive the quarantine and to strengthen our relationship  So we got excited when we knew that this version would be on Steam. We planed yesterday as ""Overcooked day"" and prepared snacks for the ocasion. 

And, so far, we are enjoying the game a lot.

The critics about the content and the price are true. But as someone said before, it is a great excuse to replay Overcoocked 1. We were expecting a newer version of the  final battle against the Meatball, and we got it. So we are playing to get there. 

One of the problems are the transitions. The ones in the original games are pleasing and caracteristic. By their absence, this ones feels rough.

If you have a partner to play, buy it. Better with controllers.

If you have OC 1 & 2, this is not worth the pricetag for the extra couple of levels, perhaps until more content is added.

Real talk. The game is Overcooked 1 and 2 with all the DLC repackaged. Some visual optimizations have been done but it's not all that different of an experience from the other games. If you already own the other two, it's likely not worth the purchase. The ONLY reason I'm purchasing this game is because of the inclusion of cross-platform multiplayer: I have a niche case where netplay options like Steam Remote Play Together and Parsec aren't viable. In my view, there isn't anything else here at launch that would convince me to buy.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good game. It doesn't give much value beyond the original games, but if you haven't played Overcooked before, this is a fantastic bundle. And who knows: maybe the free content promised later this year might make up for the lack of new content... I'm not crossing my fingers for that, but we shall see.",1616524280,1616529404,True,70,8,0.764706671237945557,1,True,False,False
