It seems they do not care about the game anymore, they just focus in changing two features to sell you the new game but they won't correct what is known to not be working for several years. I have only played the pro mode and here are the main bugs that is making me start hating PCM2023:

- The maintain position button WON'T MANTAIN POSITION. will be either on top of the peloton or botton of the peloton, just based on the effort that you assign to the skill. This will lead either to get all the wind nd get tired constantly, or choose to be regulating the effort constantly so you won't be able to skip certain stages parts with the x8 button.

- The objectives in pro mode are unrealistic. For example: I am a top 2 favorite for the mountain stage, but the team consider I have to work for my sprinter for 30KM. This would be funny as a joke. But how is possible that the IA cannot recognize that the end of the stage is a HC mountain, and I am a 3 star favorite with Vingegaard and Pogacar ? It is really frustrating.

- The contract negotiation. I do not really understand why in year 3 I hadn't the posibility to negotiate the duration of my contract. I get only one year deals, and no matter how good of a season it was, it will be just around three teams of interest. 

- The rider progression does not make any sense. On year 3 I am already in 82 of Climbing but somehow my rider only has 70 on Hills stat. How a climber cannot go properly through hills?. Also stamina is below 70 when Climbing is in 82, which makes not really compatible the fact that you are good at climbing big mountains but still get tired pretty easily...

EDITING TO ADD THE MOST FRUSTRATING BUG: I forgot to mention that it feels more than ever that the AI races against you. And when I say the AI I meant all the teams will ride against you. For example if someone is attacking, the peloton will not do anything, but if I attack, the peloton starts working really hard to avoid me get part into the breakaway. It is ridiculous to the point that someone was attacking and the peloton was really slow, I followed the attack and they started to chase us like crazy, and then I stopped, the other rider was still atacking, but somehow the peloton stopped the effort to catch us immediately, and let the other rider get into the breakaway. Really pathetic.

These are the three main things that I consider that does not make any sense from my experience in the pro mode. It is a bad review but I also have to say that I like the stamina management more than other years. There are some mountains that every rider will run out of energy and they will just basically reach the top of the mountain based on their climbing skill, so makes the selection of riders more realistic than previous years.",1692108052,1692108429,False,15,0,0.640517115592956543,0,True,False,False

Played on Expert. Most races is way to easy. Luckily there are exceptions in the major ones like Paris-Roubaix, Vlaandern, and GC in GT's. They are really though as it should be.

Increasing the difficulty (if it was possible) wouldn't solve the problem - the AI needs to get better and smarter. AI is riding very unintelligent and makes it an incredible frustrating game to play. And I'm really trying, since I love the sport so much.

Some feedback in-game:
- The dot is way to overpowered since AI is riding stupid. Just put it on 85 when AI is attacking and they spend all their energy while you preserve yours. If your rider want to get away you can just do a short attack to establish a gap, followed by using the dot. The AI always attacks until empty (except when following attacks).
- TTT - Totally bugged. Teams rarely finish with 5 riders. I won TTT in Paris - Nice on Expert with the worst team present since no other teams managed to finish as a team of 5 or more.
- TT - Al riders ride excatly the same. Why not change that a bit. Some riders take it easy, for instance in GT's when they have no probability of good result. Some opens hard, and some more easy. Even in hilly TT's it seems to stay the same throughout the intermediate timings. Those on flats should push more on flats etc..
- In long climbs, the riders totally empties themselves long before the finish. Even the best ones. Each individual rider with a stage ambition or GC ambition needs to portion out their energy better. The helpers can empty themselves long before the finish line obviously.
- This also applies in one other specific situation: big cobble classics. The 3-star favourites can attack 50 km before the finish line and empty themselves completely in half the distance. Portion out the energy better, the AI needs to understand that spending all your energy on 20 km with 50 km to the line is the wrong way to do it.
- Sprints are hard and works well. Really a fight to get in a good position with several lead-out trains fighting. Good job on solving that this year.

I have decided that since the game is unplayable, I will only play the races while guiding the cyclists through the ""Strategy"" tab. It works bad as well, but sometimes better than controlling the cyclists my self, and it gives me more pleasure knowing I'm not taking advantage of all the in-game flaws.

The big leaks here are;
- You often need to ""twerk"" the guidance somehow, since riders often doesn't follow what you set. There is also Strategy instructions missing that Cyanide need to improve big time - like sending your riders in early breakaways.
- Your team never goes in the breakaway early. 
- Breakaway always wins in one day races, and often in stage races as well. This is totally unrealistic, and also frustrating if you combine that with the first point. Breakaway forms in 10-12 riders in .1 and .Pro races and always wins, even in races like Fleche Wallone.
- To ""overrule"" this bug, you have to manually send one of your riders in the breakaway. Then it more often gets caught. However, you can't send one of your strongest riders in the breakaway, because then they refuse to follow your ""Strategy Tab"" order afterwards and refuse to cooperate with the breakaway members. And if you send a weak rider in the breakaway, he just gives up way before he is empty (Example he gave up 5 km from the finish line with half his energy bar left while the others 9 riders in the breakaway fought for the win). It has to be one of riders set as ""free riders"" by the game in those races.
- Despite all the times it bugs, its a really great feeling when your rider win using the strategy tab. You know you haven't won because you have taken advantage of bugs or other imperfections (except the morning breakaway thing).

I have one idea and feedback to Cyanide that I really do think would make this game enjoyable and fun to play again. Cyanide should really put some effort into improving the ""Strategy Tab"" section. You don't control your cyclists directly, but you manage them by giving them orders, and then they try to solve it for themselves. Then your riders are riding at the same terms as the AI, and you can't beat them on AI stupidnes or bugs. Since you are playing career mode like a manager, this makes it even more realistic and a good strategy component as well. Suggestions to implement are ""Follow attacks 70-30 (range) km to the finish line"", ""Try to get in the morning breakaway"", ""Take it easy today/Preserve energy (in stage races)"", ""Follow specific riders if they attack"", ""Don't let more than X riders get away in a breakaway without your team being present"" (and if that happens) ""Push hard to close the gap"". These are just a few suggestions, but still the biggest one is to make your riders actually follow the ""Strategy Tab"". Now it is, lets just say, less than ideal.",1690497142,1690497142,False,8,0,0.567307710647583008,1,True,False,False

I've played this sodding game every year since 2011 and I can honestly say I'm sick of it. The ""people"" who make this garbage simply copy and paste the code for each edition and help themselves to 30 quid from your wallet. And yet somehow each edition is worse than the last. 

They peaked in PCM 2012, since then, every edition has had some disastrous take on pre-season planning, that requires you to make actual notes on real paper just to keep track of whats going on, like some boffin in a power plant. In this particular version, my last game took 4 hours to set up and actually click the next day button. They've made the ""get one week into the game"" achievement much harder, seeing as it takes phenomenal willpower to not uninstall it after a mere glance at January 1st.

Secondly, the AI is a catastrophe. It's like the devs thought people were having too much fun and decided to finally get off their fat arses and make some changes. At the end of the race, the entire peloton will commit ritual suicide on the front, making any kind of lead out train completely impossible. Every time the bunch goes around a badly coded corner (which is all of them), the riders are shuffled around like they're inside a washing machine, making positioning pointless. The pathing is simply atrocious. Need someone to get bottles in the last 30km? Good luck, mate. Watch your supposedly good domestique sprinting like a moron and getting boxed in at every opportunity as your leaders die of thirst. It's futile.

I will admit that the pro cyclist mode was a good idea, and a fun addition back when it was implemented. This year's evolution of it, was to make it needlessly harder. At this point, it would be easier to just become an actual professional cyclist. And WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH DO I NEED TO PLAY EVERY SINGLE RACE TO GET XP? Unlike the creatures employed at Cyanide, I work for a living. There are only so many hours in a day, I don't want spend half an hour each time, playing every single cyanide cup just so I can feel the exhilaration of riding on the front for 30 km.

I won't list the endless bugs and glitches which have been in the game for over a decade. Or the fact that they still can't get all the riders names right.

I start the stage with a higher green, by the end of the stage the green has dropped off and they are dropping me! I didn't attack once, I stayed at the back of my team chain, defended the whole way... yet dropped.

DO NOT BUY ANY PCM GAME! Every year of this game release appears to have the exact same AI coding bug that makes the game unplayable past a certain threshold of hours played / training done.

Dramatic, but there is an issue that has apparently been part of this franchise's game code for a decade without the devs ever fixing it. They deliberately just sell a ""new"" yearly version of the game with updated rosters but without fixing a game breaking devastating bug that has been reported hundreds if not thousands of times based on all the hits my searches pulled up.

So what is this bug? Oh, nothing much really... past roughly the first season's May or June (or slightly later if you are slower to progress) races you will suddenly NEVER be allowed to breakaway. All 138 other riders, including your own teammates, will have red relay marks which when hovered over will either say refuses to relay, or is waiting for a teammate... they stay red until the moment the peloton catches back up and suddenly the riders explode into attack. Over and over. The moment you, not the peloton just you, catch up to a breakaway group they will suddenly stop trying to breakaway, plus the moment you leave the peloton every other rider still in it will explode in a frenzy of blood to catch you.

This bug begins roughly once your stats are high enough so say high 60s and low 70s. Once you hit the bug's stat wall like a rock this bug hits you regardless of what your reputation is. My reputation is listed as ""Unknown"" and I am competing against some riders with far higher stats yet the only rider they care about is me.

Teammates deliberately will try to block you from exiting the peloton to attack. Teammates in a breakaway will cancel effort the moment you join them just like the enemy AI all does and also refuses to relay.

So when exactly does this bug take place?

For me, I started noticing AI weirdness in May of season 1 at level 5, but it was the next month in June at level 6 when the game instantly became impossible where even my own team was deliberately spiting me. Also, prior to leveling to 6, my team manager was over 90% happy with my service, but the instant I hit 6 I was suddenly only 60% happy.

My racer had raced 18 days, only won a single time (first ever race), I accomplished every teamwork oriented objective in all 18 races. I still had a reputation of ""Unknown"" yet the game was acting like I was the most hated racer in the game by every team in the race including my own. The game is bugged into punishing me for training hard and that makes all the fun just leave.

I am playing the Pro Cycling Manager Series for years now, skipping only a few of them and this is by far the best one for me personally and the price is fair in my opinion.

For example, the statistics stuff, that you see placement switches after the race, that you can search riders in the results, the ranking systems, that you FINALLY see results of other races in pro cyclist modes, the mountain stats, many small details that really makes me enjoy the game a lot more. Keep that small details going, they are very important in a manager game. A small thing that I am missing is probably a better display in which team a rider is in 3d races, like a tooltip on the mini-jersey or something and the overview of the favourites in the 3d race as an extra tab, so that you can click them a bit faster maybe.

There is one bug with preparation and shape for 3d races in pro cyclist mode which is very annoying and which I hope will be fixed. If you enjoy pro cyclist mode, its even worth to wait for a fix to that bug, cause it makes things unnecessary hard and annoying. I hopefully can edit this out soon, because its sad that this small thing overshadows many good things.

Else I really love this edition, pro cyclist mode really makes fun with all the information sources you have now, with the new training system and so on. Like previous versions I play on extreme and I found it very balanced. Stamina does not go as high as for some top riders, but with good training and focus on other stats, you can manage that pretty well. Its even better for me personally, so I couldnt win everything with 20 years old already :). So despite the preparation bug, a really really nice experience for me so far, I enjoy it a lot.

Like every year there are always some bugs that are seriously damaging the gameplay experience. 
- Right now, in pro cyclist mode, the stamina management doesnt work properly so you're basically not able to compete in multiple mountain stages. 
- In career mode, after 2030 there are no newgens anymore and/or new cyclist all of sudden are 32 years old. 
- Also after the last patch update, the game crashes frequently. 
Probably some of these issues get fixed (or not), but it's always like that with Cyanide. They seem to struggle to deliver a well polished product. And these issues are too much harming your gameplay experience, to take it for granted.

Then there are some serious functionalities that lack realism. 
- In career mode, the sponsors that want to fund you, are completely random. I've build up a fully Dutch team but there are never Dutch sponsors that want to fund me. 
- There is also no option to negotioate the sponsor goals with your sponsor. If you want to compete for the mountains yersey but your sponsor wants you to end in the top 10, you can not discuss this. If your big star get's an injury, your sponsor will not take this in account when you fail to deliver results. 
- Contract negotiations with cyclists is unrealistic and works with a weird file system. As long as you have enough money, you can basically get any cyclist with an expiring contract. There is no threat of the cyclist rejecting your contract because he has a better option at a bigger team.
- The racetracks dont change during the years. So every year you have the exact same racetracks. This get's boring.

I've been buying PCM every year since 2006.

Is the game very similar to last year, yes. Okay, now that everyone's biggest gripe about PCM is out of the way, my first impressions are very positive. The changes to the Pro Cyclist Mode make it feel more in control of a pro cyclist rather than controlling a single rider as in years past. The weekly training choices make things interesting and the requirements to focus heavily on a specific skill in order to evolve the potential is a great addition. The option to focus on XP in the weekly training takes some of the slog out of the Pro Cyclist mode from years past, where you had to fight through many races of working as a domestique just to get good enough to compete for climbing points or a sprint during a breakaway. 

It also seems that stamina/endurance has been reworked a bit, it isn't as easy to break away at km 0 and stay away until the peloton catches you. Now the riders seem to run out of gas a bit more naturally, not just getting steamrolled by the peloton in the last 10km. 

I'm hoping there are no significant bugs to be found (like not being able to race in the European championships in the first year they added that to the game). So far, I haven't experienced any. 

Yes it is very similar to last years game, but that isn't a bad thing. I'm okay with the developers refining the formula a little bit each year as long as they focus on quality. For example, the addition of the medium mountain stat, if it plays out to really have a difference, is a great improvement allowing riders like Alaphilippe to be more competitive on those short mountain stages, adds to the realism. It also allows for more strategy during grand tours, some riders where the shorter punchy climbs will have different outcomes than the long slogs like Tourmalet. 

I'll update my feedback if the experience changes, but as someone that was very critical of the last few versions, I can say I'm very pleasantly surprised this year and would recommend to all, veterans of the series, and especially for anyone who has yet to dive into PCM.
